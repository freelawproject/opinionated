D. Tappan- and others, which set forth in detail the matters relating to the release of August 11, 1873, and prayed that it might be declared valid and of the. legal effect charged in the bill; that the proceedings in the foreclosure suits might be stayed; and that the Sutherland suit, with this bill treated as a supplemental \u25a0 bill or cross-bill, might proceed regularly to a decree, containing the manner in which the property covered by the several trust deeds should be offered for sale, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>That Sutherland, McCarter' and Tappan, trustees, appeared in this last-mentioned suit by the same solicitor and answered.; that Birdseye, trustee, also appeared, and, in his answer, admitted and realleged the allegations contained in the bill relating to the claims of Wells under the release; that defendant Wells appeared, and on or about December 30, 1874, his' solicitor stipulated that the bill filed by the assignees be taken <em>pro eonfesso </em>against him; that issue was joined and a large amount of testimony was taken and filed in the several suits referred to; but that none of the testimony had any bearing on the effect of the release, and its validity was admitted upon the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\">It was then charged that during the latter part of 1876 and the early part of 1877 the solicitor of Davis, Johnston and Ayer, and other parties interested with them, \u201c entered into a fraudulent conspiracy for the purpose of procuring from said Circuit Court the entry of a decree, by means of which the interest of said Jonathan T. Wells in said eight thousand acres of land should be divested, and the value of his said bonds destroyed, and the entire property and assets of said the Lake Superior Ship Canal, Railroad and Iron Company vested in the parties in this article mentioned to the exclusion of said Wells;\u201d that it was agreed, upon the sale of the property, to be made in pursuance of the proposed decree, that it should be purchased by Wilson and Man, as trustees, for the benefit of the parties to the said fraudulent decree; that a company should be organized, under the laws of Michigan, for the purpose of taking and holding the property formerly held by the canal company; and that, upon the completion of said transfer the parties to said agreement would endeavor to sell the property to English capitalists, \u00e1nd, failing in this, the stock should be divided between the parties to the agreement.v</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-6\">That in pursuance of this scheme, the solicitor represented to the Circuit Judge that an arrangement had been made to sell the whole property of the canal company to English capitalists for a sum sufficient to pay the entire debts of that company, and that to carry out this agreement it was necessary to sell the whole property of the company under a decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>of the court, and that such decree would be satisfactory to all parties interested; that by these representations, without any' notice to Wells or his solicitor, an order was obtained from the judge, at his house, February IS}, 1877, that the bill filed by Jerome and Beaman be treated as a cross-bill in the Sutherland, the Birdseye \u25a0 and.'the Union Trust Company foreclosure suits, and that the four causes be heard together upon the pleadings and proofs in all, and at the same time and place a decree was signed by Judge Emmons, entitled in the four suits, which contained the following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-3\">\u201c <em>Twenty-first. </em>It is hereby ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the attempt of the defendant, Jonathan T. Wells, to redeem or obtain release of certain lands from the lien of the mortgage of the first of July, 1868, and the alleged release of said land by Lucien Birdseye, trustee, as set forth in said cross-complaint, having taken place after the institution of the suit for the foreclosure of said mortgage, were and are ineffectual and void.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-4\">That the decree further adjudged that' the receiver\u2019s certificates for the amount of $934,478 \u2014 principal and interest \u2014 were a first lien upon the canal and the first and second land grants, but not a lien upon the third land grant, and required that the lands covered by the Birdseye mortgage should be sold separately, and gave various directions as to the method to be adopted by the master for distributing the proceeds; that the sale was advertised under the decree in but one paper, and that a village newspaper of limited circulation, and the-parties refused to advertise more extensively; that they gave no notice of the terms of sale; that they required at the sale the whole amount of the purchase money to be paid at once, without giving the purchaser, any opportunity to examine the title, and refused to s\u00e9ll the second land grant separately; that at the sale thus conducted, Man and Wilson bought the entire property of the canal company for $550,000, which they pkid in receiver\u2019s certificates; that the master\u2019s report was confirmed before the\u2019expiration of the usual time, upon a representation to the solicitors of the other parties that this was necessary to the consummation of a sale to the English <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>capitalists; that they then, in combination with the other members of the - party, formed a new company, which is one of the demurring defendants; and that they conveyed all the property of the old company to the new corporation, which had notice of the fraud, paid no new consideration and took title subject to the rights of Wells.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-4\">It was also alleged that Wells died in Brooklyn, New York, on October 16, 1881, at the age of about eighty-two years, and that \u201c for three years and upwards immediately preceding his death he was feeble in body and mind, and by reason thereof was unable to travel to Michigan, where the litigation herein-before referred to was carried on, or to give his personal attention to his interests therein;\u201d that in March, 1879, Wells \u2022transferred his property to James H. Gilbert for the benefit of himself and his legal representatives, and \u201c knowledge of the making and entry of said decree was first acquired by said Jonathan Tremaine Wells and by said James H. Gilbert, trustee as aforesaid, during the month of May, 1879;. that it has been exceedingly difficult and has required much time to ascertain the facts in relation to the proceedings herein related on account not only of the many and protracted litigations,\u201d but especially of the efforts \u201cmade by the parties to the fraud aforesaid to suppress everything tending to throw light upon their transactions and .to hamper and impede investigation by withholding or concealing whatever might give information to Wells or his representatives.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-5\">The bill also set forth that on March 10, 1882, a petition was filed in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Michigan, on behalf of Gilbert, trustee, as aforesaid, and an application for relief against said last-mentioned decree was made thereon; and that this application was heard by the Honorable Stanley Matthews, one of the \u2022 judges of the Circuit Court, and an order made denying it, \u201c but without prejudice to the merits of the application or proceedings to be taken thereafter in the interest of the estate of said Jonathan Tremaine Wells.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-6\">The forty-first paragraph of the bill alleged that after the execution of the Birdseye release McCarter became seized of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the eight thousand acres described in the release, in fee simple, in trust for Wells, and in further trust to sell said lands and pay Wells the eighty thousand dollars and interest; that it was his duty, as trustee, to cause the said lands to be suitably advertised, and to use diligence to prevent the creation of any lien prior to that of Wells; that'Davis, Johnston and Ayer took upon themselves the performance of the duties of said trust; that said land at the time of the sale was worth at least $150,000, and that amount could have been realized with reasonable diligence; that th\u00e9y became trustees for Wells and had no right to buy said lands; that they did buy them and caused them to be conveyed to the company, and have sold a portion of said lands to <em>Iona fide </em>purchasers for value and received the purchase money; and \u201c that they and said company have thus become and are liable to pay to this plaintiff the full amount due upon the bonds aforesaid, to .wit, the sum of eighty thousand dollars, with interest as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-4\">The forty-second paragraph stated that the plaintiff was without remedy unless he could set aside the alleged fradulent decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-5\">The bill prayed that the decree of February 12, 1877, might be adjudged void so far as the release to Wells was concerned, and so far as the receiver\u2019s certificates were made a paramount lien or given any right of prior payment, or any validity as payment, as against Wells\u2019s bonds and release; that the eight thousand acres released be adjudged to be held in trust for Wells; that plaintiff be declared to succeed to all of Wells\u2019s rights, and be decreed a paramount lien on the eight thousand acres for eighty thousand dollars and interest; for an account' of profits in dealing with the property held in trust for Wells; for an injunction; and for a money decree against the defendants for said sum of eighty thousand dollars and interest; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-6\">Copies of the various trust deeds, of the release, of .the orders and decree of the Circuit Court of the United States for' the Eastern District of Michigan, and of agreements in relation to the purchase of the lands, etc., were attached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A04\">The cause was heard bn demurrer to the bill before Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Justi\u00f3e Blatchford, holding the Circuit Court, who sustained the demurrers and. dismissed the bill, whereupon the cause was brought to this court on appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-5\"><em>Mr. Everett P. \"Wheeler </em>(with whom was <em>Mr. John Ownmins </em>on the brief) for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-6\">The facts alleged in the complaint charged a fraudulent conspiracy, carried to a conclusion by certain legal forms, the parties contriving and benefiting by the conspiracy being bondholders who, by. a series of fraudulent manoeuvres in the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, succeeded in depriving the plaintiff of the general and specific liens given him under- the Birdseye and McCarter mortgages. They \u00ae'btained the mortgaged property themselves by the familiar device of issuing receiver\u2019s certificates at a ruinous discount, selling the mortgaged property on foreclosure, and buying it and paying for it in such receiver\u2019s certificates. As part of this conspiracy the plaintiff charges that these bondholders were acting in the name of Birdseye, who was trustee under the first mortgage on the second land\u2019 grant, that they therefore owed a duty to Wells to protect his interest, that they violated this duty by admitting the validity and priority of the receiver\u2019s certificates as a lien on the second land grant, and by obtaining a decree against Wells from the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. This decree was in contradiction of the admissions in the cross-bill, was not based upon or in any way supported by any testimony taken in any of the actions, was in fraud of the plaintiff\u2019s rights, and obtained secretly, collusively, by misrepresentation to the court, and without notice to the plaintiff, though he was a party to the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-7\">The complainant\u2019s remedy grows out of the fraud. His right arises out of the errors committed to his prejudice. His complaint asks that so much of this decree so obtained as adjudged that the release by Birdseye was invalid, and that the receiver\u2019s certificates were a prior lien, be adjudged fraudulent and void, and that the title acquired under it. by defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>ants be adjudged to be in trust for plaintiff and that they account, etc. The demurrers admit that the allegations of the complaint are true. If they be true, there can be. no question but that at some time and in some proceeding, they constituted a cause of action, and entitled the plaintiff to relief from the said decree. The only question is. now whether at this time and in this proceeding, the facts set forth entitle the plaintiff to the relief he seeks; or to any relief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-4\">An original bill to impeach the j\u00fadgment was the proper form of proceeding. The decree was fraudul\u00e9nt and erroneous. The plaintiff\u2019s only remedy was by original bill to impeach it. The term at which the decree was entered expired before the fraud and error were discovered. Under these circumstances the remedy was by original bill. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Mil</em>ler, 1 Sandf. Ch. (N. Y.) 103; <em>Evans </em>v. Bacon, 99 Mass. 213 ; <em>Johnson </em>v. Johnson, 30 Illinois, 215; <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Head, </em>5 California, 297; <em>Bradish </em>v. Gee, 1 Ambler, 229; <em>Pemberton's Case, </em>40 N. J. Eq. (13 Stewart) 520. This bill need not be filed in the same court which rendered the decree complained of. A court of equity has jurisdiction of a suit' to impeach for fraud a decree rendered by another court. <em>Arrowsmith </em>v. <em>Gleason, 12</em>9. U. S. 86; <em>Gaines </em>v. Fuentes, 92 U. S. 10, 20; <em>DeForest </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>40 Fed. Rep. 375; <em>Wilmore </em>v. <em>Flack, </em>96 N. Y. 512; <em>Dobson </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>12 N. Y. 156; <em>S. C. </em>62 Am.

Its acts <em>in personam, </em>and wherever it can find +h\u2018 parties guilty of fraud, takes from- them benefits which they have procured thereby. The jurisdiction to do this rests on the solid foundation that fraud vitiates all proceedings, whether apparently judicial or otherwise, and that a fraudulent judgment is really no judgment at all. <em>Earl of Bandon </em>v. <em>Becher, </em>3 Cl. &amp; Fin. 479.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">So in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>111 U. S. 640, 667, Mr. Justice Bradley says: \u201c The most solemn transactions and judgments may at the instance of the parties be set aside for fraud. . . . In such cases the court does not act as a court of review, nor does it inquire into any irregularities or errors of proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>in another court; but it will scrutinize the acts of the parties, and if it finds that they hp.ve been guilty of fraud in obtaining a judgment or decree it will deprive them of the benefit of it and of any inequitable advantage which they have derived under it.\u201d See also <em>Gaines </em>v. Fuentes, 92 U. S. 10, 22; <em>Barrow </em>v. Hunton, 99 U. S. 80, 83; <em>Metropolitan El. R'y Co. </em>v. <em>Manhattan R'y Co., </em>14 Abb. N.

Parsons </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-6\">Mr. Chief Justice Fuller,</author>\n<p id=\"A3h\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">By this bill plaintiff, as succeeding to the rights of Wells, seeks relief in respect of so much of the decree of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Michigan of February 12, 1877, as adjudged that the release by Birdseye was invalid, and the receiver\u2019s certificates a prior lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">It appears that the canal company defaulted in the payment of interest due upon its several issues of bonds; that bills were filed to foreclose the trust deeds securing them ; that receiver\u2019s certificates were issued by order of court; that a decree was entered in all the causes heard as one cause; and that the property was advertised and sold under the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">The right to a decree and sale cannot be controverted, and at the sale any or all the bondholders' had the right to buy. If there was error in the decree, or in the sale, the remedy of plaintiff was in the court which rendered the decree and confirmed the sale. <em>Blossom </em>v. <em>Milwaukee Railroad Co., </em>1 Wall. 655; <em>Christmas </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>5 Wall. 290, 305; <em>Michaels </em>v. <em>Post, </em>21 Wall. 398, 427; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Iron Railway Co., </em>135 U. S. 522, 531. Application was made to that court and was denied, but no further step was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Suit to foreclose was commenced by Sutherland, May 25, 1872, the trustees in the other trust deed, Birdseye, Frost and the Trust Company being parties defendant. The receiver was appointed in this suit June 13, 1872, and on June 17 the order was entered for the issue of the certificates for the purpose of completing the construction of the canal. This order declared \u201c that the indebtedness created by said receiver\u2019s certificates shall constitute a first and paramount lien over another liens and incumbrances upon the ship canal, real and personal property, and franchises of said defendant corporation, and on all the future earnings and income thereof, and shall be entitled to priority and payment over all other claims out of said real and personal property, earnings and income, etc.,; and in case said canal, real and personal estate, and franchises or any part thereof shall be sold under and in pursuance of any judicial decree said certificates of indebtedness remaining unpaid shall first be paid out of the proceeds of sale,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\">\u201c Under the .provisions of the acts of Congress granting the lands covered by the mortgages,\u201d said Mr. Justice Strong, speaking for the court in <em>Jerome </em>v. <em>McCarter, </em>94 U. S. 734, 738, \u201cthe lands reverted to the United States, unless the ship canal should be finished within a fixed period, and that period was p\u00e1ssing away when the order was granted to the receiver to raise money for completing the canal by the issue of certificates secured by his mortgage. The canal was unfinished, and there were in the receiver\u2019s hands no funds to finish it. \u25a0 Hence there - was a necessity for making the order which the court made \u2014 a necessity attending the administration of the trust the court had undertaken. The. order was necessary alike for the lien creditors and for the mortgagors. Whether the action of the court could make the receiver\u2019s mortgage supeferior in right to the mortgages which existed when it was' made, it is needle'ss to inquire. - None of the creditors secured by those other mortgages objected to the order when it was made, though they were ail then in court. None of .them object to its lien or its priority now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Johnston &amp; Co. and Ayer <em>&amp; </em>Co. purchased the certificates thus issued for the construction of the canal.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>On July 5, 1872, Birdseye, trustee, filed a bill to foreclose his trust deed. August 11, 1873, Birdseye executed the release to Wells. Neither Johnston <em>&amp; </em>Co. nor Ayer &amp; Co. nor the receiver were in any way parties or assented to this release. It was given a year after the order for the issue of the certificates was entered, as we have said, in a suit to which Birdseye, trustee, and Frost, trustee, (succeeded by McCarter,) were parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">In <em>Richter </em>v. <em>Jerome, </em>123 U. S. 233, 246, a bill was filed by Bichter as the holder of two hundred and thirty of the bonds 'issued under the fourth trust deed, and it was charged that other bondholders had conspired to obtain the mortgaged premises, and that the solicitor who foreclosed was their attorney. This court said, Mr. Chief Justice Waite delivering the opinion: \u201cAll the rights the bondholders have or ever had in the mortgage, legal or equitable, they got through the Trust Company, to which the conveyance was made for their security. As bondholders claiming under the mortgage, they can have no interest in the security except that which the trustee holds and represents. If the trustee acts in good faith, whatever binds it in any legal proceedings it begins and carries on to enforce the trust, to which they are not actual parties binds them. <em>Kerrison </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>93 U. S. 155, 160; <em>Corcoran </em>v. <em>Chesapeake &amp;c. Canal Co., </em>94 U. S. 741, 745; <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>100 U. S. 605, 611. Whatever forecloses the trustee, in the absence of fraud or bad faith, forecloses them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The paramount lien of the certificates was recognized by Birdseye in the bill exhibited by him, and his action, so far as appears, was within the discretion reposed in him by his deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">August 27, 1872, the company was adjudicated a bankrupt, and in September, 1873, its assignees filed their bill, setting up the facts relating to the Birdseye release and praying to have it declared valid, to which Wells appeared and stipulated that the bill might be taken <em>pro eonfesso </em>against him; but Birdseye, trustee, McCarter, trustee, the Union Trust Company, trustee, Tappan, trustee for the certificate holders, and others, were parties, and Wells could not cut off their rights or create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>rights in his own favor, by admission. The decree complained of covered this suit as well as the others, and the question of the operation and effect of the release was raised upon the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\">Upon what ground can another court rescind the decree, or set aside the sale, because either is erroneous ?</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u25a0Wells clearly could not insist upon matters which he had or. could have insisted upon, prior to the decree, or upon the' motion to confirm the sale. If the confirmation were without notice, he should have applied to the court which entered the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Neither Birdseye nor McCarter, the trustees under whose deeds the bonds were issued which Wells held, are charged with fraud or any conduct in bad faith, and neither is a party to this bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The matters alleged to be fraudulent are the steps taken to have the property foreclosed and the purchase thereon ensuing, and what is charged is that the holders of large amounts of the bonds and of all the receiver\u2019s certificates combined to bring about the foreclosure and to make the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Epithets do not make out fraud, and the averments are substantially of legal conclusions not admitted by the demurrers, <em>Fogg </em>v. Blair, 139 U. S. 118, 127, and in themselves insufficient as stating a case of fraud practised directly upon Wells and preventing him from seeking redress in the premises. The case attempted to be made was not a new one arising upon new facts, but one involving matters which the court was, or might have been, called upon to determine. And if, as asserted by his counsel, appellant\u2019s \u201c remedy grows out of the fraud, his right arises out of the errors committed to his prejudice,\u201d then the remedy ought to have been sought in the court which rendered the decree and confirmed the sale. This, if there were error in respect of the certificates and the release, (which forms the basis of plaintiff\u2019s claim;) but if none were committed, then relief through the enforcement of a lien upon eight thousand acres, and adjudging the same or' the profits therefrom to be held in trust for Wells, or through a money decree in lieu thereof, could not be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Nor do we think that plaintiff has any better standing by reason of the allegation that the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Michigan had no jurisdiction of the Sutherland suit, because Sutherland was not a citizen of New Jersey, but was a citizen of the same State as Birdseye. This defence was interposed by Birdseye, in his answer, and was determined against him. That determination cannot be questioned here.' Moreover, to the consolidated suit, Wells was himself a party as were the trustees named in the various trust deeds, and all were bound by the decree and the subsequent proceedings thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Suggestion is made in argument that plaintiff was entitled, under the prayer for general relief, to invoke the aid of the court to let him in to share in the benefits of defendants\u2019 purchase, but it is sufficient to say that such relief would not be conformable to the case made by the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The demurrers were properly sustained, and the decree is</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
