After conviction, the defendant, by motion in arrest of .judgment, and.by exception to the jurisdiction of the court, objected that the proceedings were in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States for the same reason, and also because the selectmen of the municipality who-prepared the jury list, and took the principal part in drawing the jurors, were at the same time actively promoting this prosecution. The highest court of the State held the objections taken.before verdict to be unfounded, and those after verdict to be taken too late. <em>Held, </em>that this, court had no jurisdiction to review the judgment on writ of error.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-10\">An indictment was found by the grand jury in the superior court for the county of Nantucket and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, on c. 204, \u00a7\u00a7 1,\"2, of the Public .Statutes of Massachusetts, containing twenty-four counts, each of which was for forging, or for uttering, a discharge for money payable by the county of Nantucket, or by the town of Nantucket, with intent to defraud the county,\u2019or the town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-11\">The town and county of Nantucket are geographically identical ; the selectmen of the town have the powers of county commissioners; the town may raise money to pay the expenses of the county ; and the treasurer of the town is county treasurer.

The court overruled the motion and the exception. The defendant appealed from the order overruling the motion in arrest of judgment, and alleged exceptions to the overruling of his exception to \u25a0 the jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-7\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed the order, and overruled the exceptions, for reasons stated in its. rescript to the superior court as follows: \u201c A motion in arrest of judgment can be sustained only for errors apparent on the-record. The record discloses no error. The exception to the jurisdiction is nothing but a motion in arrest of judgment under another name.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-8\">In the opinion then delivered, and duly transmitted to this court with the record, the Supreme Judicial Court, after deciding the case upon the grounds stated in this rescript, added: \u201c It is difficult to see how any question deserving serious consideration arises under the Constitution, either of this State or of the United States. In view of the authorities cited in the former opinion in this case, it can hardly be argued that a legislature' has no constitutional authority to. provide that mere inhabitancy in a town or county shall not disqualify one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>from sitting as a juror to try-a prisoner for unlawfully obtaining money from the treasury of the town or county. It has not been contended before us, that our statute forbidding the allowance of a motion in arrest of judgment for a cause existing before verdict, unless it affects the jurisdiction of the court, is unconstitutional, nor that the rule which confines proceedings upon motions in arrest to.matters apparent upon the record is in conflict either with the. Federal or State Constitution. \"We are of- opinion that there was.no error in the proceedings in the superior court.\u201d 15Q Mass. 334, 343.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-5\">The superior court thereupon sentenced the defendant to imprisonment in the house of correction for two years and six months, and he sued out this writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-6\">By the practice in Massachusetts, where a bill of exceptions or an appeal in matter of law is taken to the Supreme Judicial Court, the question of law only goes to that court, and the \u25a0record, unless ordered up by that court, remains in the court below; and therefore this writ of error was addressed to the superior court. Mass. Pub. Stat. c. 150, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 12; c. 153, \u00a7 15; <em>McGuire </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Wall. 382; <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>12 Allen, 201, 205 ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>123 Mass. 418.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-7\"><em>Mr. R. JD. Weston-Smiih </em>(with whom- was <em>Mr. H. W. Chayplim, </em>on the brief) for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-8\">The composition of the grand jury and the traverse jury exclusively from the inhabitants of the county and town of Nantucket made them necessarily a partial tribunal. Impartiality is of. course never absolute, but always relative.- Never-' theless it is a requirement, and it is for the courts \u2014 and under the Fourteenth Amendment for this court \u2014 to draw the line in any given case. The plaintiff in error was presented by a grand jury and tried by a trial' jury, composed exclusively of the town and county corporations against which his alleged crime was directed. This was in violation of the first principles of justice. \u25a0 These grand and petit jurors were all disqualified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-9\">The position of the selectmen as acting prosecutors under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>vote of the town made them incompetent, under the Fourteenth Amendment, to prepare the preliminary list of jurors. It made them incompetent to compose, in their individual, capacity, substantially the whole town meeting held to revise that list and make it final. Seven men who were prosecuting the plaintiff in error for the offences finally embodied in the\u00bbindictment against him made up a list, from which, exclusively, was drawn the grand jury which indicted him, and from which was made up the trial jury. The -fruits of this action are seen in the fact that eighteen out of the twenty-three grand jurors were persons who had voted for the prosecution which these'prosecutors were promoting before them. 4 grand jury so made-up was as to this defendant a mere travesty of a grand juty, and was a nullity. The objection to it was jurisdictional; <em>McGregor </em>v. Crane, 98 Mass. 530; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Welcome, </em>6 Cush. 331; and as such may be taken at any stage. When'an objection-of this character goes to the \u2022roots of the administration of justice, it is never too late to take it. This objection was one of such gravity that it could not be waived. <em>Hopt </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>110 U. S. 574; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>People, </em>16 Michigan, 351; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>12 Ohio St. 622; <em>Cancemi </em>v. <em>People, </em>18 N. Y. 128; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>People, </em>128 Illinois, 585; <em>McGregor </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>cited above; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Welcome, </em>cited above.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-4\">If any state statute stands in the way of the plaintiff in error upon this point, it is, when it operates upon objections so important as are now made, in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, as unduly clogging remedies. <em>Callan </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>127 U. S. 540.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-5\">Even if this new question of fact does not, within the strictest meaning of the word \u201cgo to jurisdiction,\u201d it involves so gross an impropriety, and an abuse of the forms of justice so- extreme as, in a proper exercise of judicial discretion, to vitiate the whole proceeding. <em>Hopt </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>cited above; <em>Edson </em>v. <em>Edson, </em>108 Mass. 590; <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Aspinwall, </em>3 N. Y. 547.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-6\">' The fact that eighteen out of twenty-three grand jurors had joined in the vote for the prosecution which was being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>carried on before them by the agents of their town, whom they had helped to constitute such, made them, substantially, prosecutors, and disqualified them. Their action violated the first principle of justice: that no man shall be prosecutor and judge at the same time. This objection is,, like the objection last referred to, of so vital a character that it cannot be .waived. It is jurisdictional, or quasi-jurisdictional, and may be raised at any stage of the cause.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b603-4\"><em>Mr. Albert E. Pillsbury, </em>Attorney General of the State of Massachusetts, for defendant in- error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b603-5\">Mr. Justice Gray,</author>\n<p id=\"AiJ\">after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In order to give this court jurisdiction, under section 709 of the Revised Statutes, to review on writ of error a decision of the highest court of a State against a title, right, privilege or immunity claimed under the Constitution of the United States, it must, as observed by Chief Jjistice Waite in <em>Spies </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>\u201c appear on the record that such title, right, privilege or .immunity was \u2018specially set up or claimed\u2019 at the proper time in the proper way.\u201d 123 U. S. 131, 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In the case at bar, the only ground, on which it has been argued that the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts should be reversed, is that the plaintiff in error has been deprived -of his liberty without du\u00e9 process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution-of the United States, because the grand jury by .which he was indicted, and the traverse jury by which he was tried and convicted, were wholly composed of inhabitants of the town and county of Nantucket, which the indictment charged him with intending to defraud.; and because the selectmen of the town, who prepared the'jury list,, and took the principal part in drawing the jurors, were at the same time actively promoting this prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">No objection that the proceedings were in violation of the Constitution of the United States was taken in any form, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>either expressly, or by any possible inference or implication, before verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"AOOZ\">Nor was any such objection duly presented afterwards. In Massachusetts, as elsewhere, the errors suggested could not be availed of by motion in arrest of judgment, unless appearing on the face of the record. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Edwards, 12 Cush. 187; <em>Carter </em>v. Bennett, 15 How. 354. And by the statutes of the State, the defendant was not entitled, after verdict, to object to the qualifications of the jurors, .or to any irregularity in drawing' them; nor could he move in arrest of judgment for any cause existing before verdict, and not affecting the jurisdiction of the court. Mass. Pub. Stat. c. 170, \u00a7\u00a7 39, 40; c. 214, \u00a7 27. The objections taken did not affect the jurisdiction of the court in which the. plaintiff in error was indicted and convicted, but only the regularity of the proceedings in obtaining the grand and traverse jurors. <em>Ex parte, </em>Harding, 120 U. S. 782. The anomalous \u201cexception to the jurisdiction,\u201d filed after verdict, was held, and rightly held, by the state court to be nothing but a motion in arrest of judgment under another name.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The judgment of the highest' court of the State was put upon the ground that these objections were not open after verdict, independently of the opinion of that court that the objections had.no merits. As that ground was sufficient to support the judgment, no federal question is involved, and this court has no jurisdiction. The case cannot be distinguished in principle from <em>Baldwin </em>v. Kansas, 129 U. S. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\n<em>Writ of error dismissed for wa/nt of jurisdiction.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
