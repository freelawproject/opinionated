It also alleged that none of the certificates were in force at the latter date by reason of the fact that the dues payable by the assured on the first day of January, 1886, were not paid at any time prior to his death; consequently the certificates of insurance ceased to be of any force or effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0k\">, To the answer setting up this- defence the plaintiff replied': \u201cShe admits that her husband, Elias J. Unsell, died January 31, 1886, and not December 31, 1885, as through clerical error was averred in the petition. Further replying, she denies that the said Elias J. Unsell failed to pay the monthly dues for the month of January, 1886, as averred in the answer, but avers the same were paid. -And for further reply this plaintiff says that for several months before his death the said Elias J. Unsell was in such agony and pain of body as to seriously affect his mind and render him unfit for attention to any business; that in consequence thereof, said Unsell lost his memory and the knowledge of all his business affairs, but was fully conscious that he was about to die. That in December, 1885, and while he was so under disability and possessed of a consciousness of his approaching death, he informed plaintiff and his friends that he had paid up all that was due by him to the defendant; that plaintiff supposed and yet believes such to be the fact;.that during the whole of the month of December, 1885, said, Elias J.&gt;Unsell was at home confined to his bed; that he never received any notice, or had any knowledge that anything was due on any of said certificates, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>had this plaintiff, or any of his friends,, such knowledge until on or about January 26, 1886, when a notice was received through the mail from defendant that dues from January 1,. 1886, were in arrears. That she at once, for said Elias J. TJnsell, forwarded to defendant the sum of $5, to pay dues for the months of January and February, 1886, which sum was duly received by defendant and was kept by it and not. returned until after defendant had learned of the death of said\u2019 Elias J.

Krum, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-8\">I. Under a policy of life insurance, which requires payment of a premium on a day certain and specified, it is immaterial what was the mental or physical condition of .the assured on such day. That he was sick will not excuse non-payment. <em>N. Y. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Statham, </em>93 U. S. 24; <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>104 U. S. 88; <em>Thompson </em>v. Insurance <em>Co., </em>104 U. S. 252, 257. Hence the trial court erred in admitting evidence, against the objection of the defendant, in regard to the mental and physical condition of the assured during the last month of his life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-9\">II. Having erroneously permitted .inquiry as to the mental and physical condition of the assured, at the time when his premium fell due and he failed- to pay, it was the manifest duty of the trial court to leave it to the jury to determine; <em>(a), </em>Whether the failure to pay the premium resulted from the mental or physical incapacity of the assured at the time which would be no excuse for non-payment, or, <em>(b), </em>Whether such failure to pay the premium resulted from a reliance in a supposed waiver by the company of the -condition requiring payiment upon the day when due or within four days thereafter \u2014 which reliance, on the theory of the court, might be, an excuse for such non-payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Hence the propriety of. the instruction asked by the defendant in regard to this phase of the case. For, if the assured did not pay, merely because he was sick,' the jury ought to have been told to return a verdict for the defendant. ' If he did not pay because he supposed the condition had been waived, and the course of conduct of .the defendant, had been such as to legally justify such conclusion, then the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict. But the defendant was entitled to have the question of fact so left with the juryas to afford an opportunity for them to say, upon what circumstances depended the failure to pay the premium within the time stipulated fot its payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-3\">III. The defendant was entitled to the instruction refused by the court below, which declared that it was not required, by the terms of the certificate sued upon, to give the assured notice of the time when his dues or premiums were payable. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Insurance </em>Co., 104 U. S. 252, 258; <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Mowry, </em>96 U. S. 544.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-4\">IY. There was no evidence which justified submission to the jury of the question of waiver. The defendant in error was permitted to try her case, upon the theory that by its course of conduct, with reference to payment of dues, the plaintiff in error had waived the requirement of prompt payment. It is true, that a party always has the option to waive a condition or stipulation made in his favor. - Equally true, that forfeitures are not .favored in the law. But to create a waiver of conditions on which forfeiture may be claimed, there must have been some agreement, some declaration, some course of action evidencing an abandonment or withdrawal\\of such conditions. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>104 U. S. 252, 259.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtS\">The condition of insurance in the present certificate is : \u201c The holder of this certificate further agrees and accepts the same, upon the, express condition that if either the monthly dues, assessments or the payment toward the safety fund, as herein-before required, are not paid to said company on the day when due, then this certificate shall be null and void.\u201d T.o , grant indulgence as to such payment upon one occasion, or' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>upon, a series of occasions, does not prohibit the company from insisting upon the condition on subsequent occasions. <em>Mut. Ben. Life Assn. </em>v. <em>Ruse, </em>8 Georgia, 534; <em>Winnesheik Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Holzgrafe, </em>53 Illinois, 516; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Poughkeepsie Ins. Co., </em>32 N.

S. 252.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-4\">In fact the whole theory upon which the plaintiff was per-' mitted to y her case was repudiated by this court in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., ubi sup.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-5\">Y. The v\u00e9rdict was wholly against the evidence, and the trial court ought to have set it aside on that ground. <em>Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Munson, </em>14 Wall. 442; <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Fant, </em>22 Wall. 116; <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>97 U.

These cases hold that when a verdict would be set aside as being against the evidence, the court ought to direct a verdict. <em>A fortiori </em>is it the duty of a trial court to set aside a verdict, where it is wholly against the evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b470-6\"><em>Mr. George D. Reynolds </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b470-7\">Mr. Justice Harlan,</author>\n<p id=\"ARV\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">1. The court, against the objections of the defendant, permitted the plaintiff, testifying-as a witness in her own behalf, to answer the following questions: \u201c How long before his death had your husband been confined to his house ? \u201d \u201c What was his condition; what was the state of his health, so far as enabling him to continue in business; what effect had it on his attention to business the month preceding his death ? \u201d <em>\u201c </em>In'what condition, mentally and physically, was Mr. Hnsell at the receipt of that notice ? \u201d The notice referred to in the last question was the one from the company, mailed at Hart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>ford, January 2\u00cd, 1886, and which stated that payments were in arrears for dues from January to May, $5. The admission as evidence of the answers to these questions is the foundation of some of the assignments of error in this court. It is sufficient to say that whatever error may have been committed by admitting this evidence was cured by the charge of the court to the jury; for they were instructed that there was but one question in the case, namely, as to the alleged waiver by the company of the terms of the contract in respect to the payment of premiums or dues at the times stipulated, and that it was immaterial whether the contract was a stringent one or not, or whether the assured, was sick the last of December or in the first part of January. \\</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">2. There was no error in admitting as evidence the plaintiff\u2019s letter of January 28, 1886, transmitting five dollars for dues from January 1, 1886, on her husband\u2019s policies. That letter was written in reply to defendant\u2019s notice by postal card mailed January 21, 1886. It was competent as showing that the payment of the amount due January 1, 1886, was, in fact, made or tendered, though not at the precise time specified in the contract. If the plaintiff had sued on the policies or certificates without having paid or tendered the amount due to the company\u2014the non-payment of which, at the time stipulated, was relied on to prove that the policies had become forfeited \u2014 that fact would have been fatal to a right to recover, in any view qf the case. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>104 U. S. 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">3. The refusal of the court to give the instructions asked by the defendant is also assigned as error. But such refusal constitutes no ground for reversal, for the reason that the charge of the court contained everything that need have been said to the jury upon the single question submitted to them, namely, whether, under all the circumstanqes, the defendant waived a strict compliance with the stipulation in the contract as to the payment, at the times specified, of the premiums or dues on the certificates of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The court, among other things, said to the jury: \u201c Nobody is bound to enter into any contract. It is perfectly voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>on the part of either side; but when they once enter in, the terms of the contract, as' expressed in the writing, control. The1 plaintiff comes in, however, and says : \u2018 Conceding that this contract reads in this way, the company by its conduct waived the' necessity of a strict compliance.\u2019 She does not say the \u25a0company so said to her, or to her husband, \u2018 We do not insist upon this; we waive this; \u2019 but she says that the company so acted, so conducted itself in its dealings with her husband that he, as a prudent, reasonable man, did believe, and had the right to believe, that payment on the very day specified would not be insisted upon. Of course we speak by our actions, just as much as we do by our words; and although there may be no spoken word, no written word, declaring a- waiver, yet it may be that a man by his conduct, his course ,of dealing, justly and fairly leads the other party to believe that he does n\u00f3t care about a strict compliance. That is wrhat this plaintiff says was the case here; that while the contract reads \u00a3 payment must be made on specified days,\u2019 yet the company did not insist on such payment. It did, when her husband was alive and well, take the dues from him after the time specified and permit the policy to continue in force, and that it did so until he had a right, as a reasonable man, to believe, and did in fact believe, that that was to be the rule in the future. I do not think that any particular number of instances, one or' more, can be said as a matter of law to make or not make a waiver. It is' a question for you, as reasonable men, to consider what did the cpmpany intend ; what would its conduct make a reasonable man believe in reference to it. . . . So ' far as the matter of notices is concerned, and the receipt of notice, it is a matter that need not concern you. The company. did not contract to give notice; the policy specifies when ' the payments a,re due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">But the part, and the only part, of the charge to the jury to which the defendant excepted was -in these words : \u201c But the plaintiff says, that beyond these receipts of money after. the day specified, there were instances in which money was received without any such notice. Now the question come.s up in respect to that, was there such a continuance of business, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>was the whole course of business, from the commencement to the close, such that from this and that, and from all the receipts and all the transactions, he had a right to believe and did believe that the question of health even would not be considered, and that it would be willing to take his money shortly after it had become due without inquiry as to his' health <em>% </em>If so, that makes a waiver. If the company, by its conduct, led him, as a reasonable and prudent business man, to believe that he could make payments a few days after, sick or well, it cannot turn around now and say, \u2018 You did not pay at the time.\u2019 I cannot say to you, as a matter of law, that one receipt, after the time specified, would make a waiver, or that fifty would. It is not in the numbers. The question is for you to consider and determine from all of them and from the whole course of business, whether, as a prudent business man, he had a right \u2022 to believe that it was immaterial whether he paid on the day or a few days later. If the course of. conduct was such that he had a right to believe that he could pay only in good health, then there was no waiver applicable to the case at bar. It must have been such a course of conduct as would lead a reasonably prudent man to believe that the company was willing to take payment, sick, or well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The law applicable to the case was stated to the jury with substantial accuracy. It is a mistake to suppose that the charge was inconsistent with the principles announced in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Insurance Company, </em>or in any other case decided by this court. In the case of <em>Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Eggleston; </em>96 U. S. 572, 577, Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court, said: \u201cWe have recently, in the case of <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>96 U. S. 234, shown that forfeitures are not favored in the law; and that courts are always prompt to seize hold of any circumstances that indicate an election to waive a forfeiture, or any agreement to do so on which the party has relied and acted. Any agreement, declaration or course of action, on the \u2022 part of an insurance- company; which leads a party insured honestly to believe that by conforming thereto a forfeiture of his policy will not be incurred, followed by due conformity on his part, will .and ought to estop the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>from insisting upon the forfeiture, though it might be claimed under the express letter of the contract. The company is thereby estopped from enforcing the forfeiture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">These principles were not modified in <em>Thompson </em>v. Insur<em>ance Company. </em>Alluding to the claim, in that case, that the company had, by its conduct, waived the requirement as to the punctual payment of premiums, Mr. Justice Bradley, again speaking for the court, said: \u201c The assured had no right, without some agreement to that effect, to rest on' such voluntary indulgence shown on one occasion, or on a number of occasions, as a ground for claiming it on all occasions.\u201d After observing that \u2022 a fatal objection to the entire case was, that payment of the premium note there in question had never been made or tendered at any time; that there might possibly be more plausibility in the plea of former indulgence and days of grace allowed, if payment had been tendered within the limited period of such indulgence; and that <em>\u201c </em>a valid excuse for not paying promptly on the particular day is a different thing from an excuse for not paying at'all,\u2019\u2019the court proceeded : <em>\u201c </em>Courts do not \u25a0 favor forfeitures, but they cannot avoid enforcing them when the party by whose default they are incurred cannot show some good and stable ground in the conduct of the other party, on which to base a reasonable excuse for the default. ... We do not accept the position that the payment of the annual premium is a <em>condition precedent </em>to the continuance of the policy. That is untrue. It is a condition subsequent only, the non-performance of which may incur a forfeiture of the policy, or may not, according to the circumstances. It is always open for the insured to show a waiver of the condition, \u00f3r a course of conduct on the part of the' insurer which gave him just and reasonable ground to infer that a forfeiture would not be exacted. But it must be a just and reasonable ground, one on which the insured has a right to rely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The principles of the above cases were reaffirmed in <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. </em>v. Doster, 106, U. S. 30, 34, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\"><em>' </em>The charge was in- entire consonance with- the settled doc-, trines of this court as established in the case's to which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>have adverted. The only ground for serious doubt in respect to the case is, whether the evidence was sufficient in any view of it to sustain the theory that the defendant had by its course of business with the assured led him to believe, and that he, in good faith, believed, that the company waived, as to him, a strict performance of the conditions as to the payment of dues or. premiums, and whether if the court had given a peremptory; instruction to find for the defendant, the verdict and judgment would have been disturbed. But we need not consider the case in those aspects;-for the defendant assumed that it would be submitted to the jury, and asked instructions touching the several points on which it relied. It did not ask a peremptory instruction for a verdict in its behalf. It cannot, therefore, be a ground of reversal that the issues of fact were submitted to the jury. As no error of law was committed to the prejudice of the defendant, the judgment must be</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
