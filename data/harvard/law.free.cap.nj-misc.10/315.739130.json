On December 31st,. 1930, at the sarnie time the ordinances enlarging the police force were passed, an ordinance was adopted increasing the-number of lieutenants from three to five, and prosecutor was-appointed to one of the new positions, having theretofore-been a sergeant. When the board of commissioners in June, 1931, reduced the force to its previous strength, it also-abolished the two offices of lieutenant created on December 31st, 1930. On June 16th, 1931, the director of public-safety appointed the prosecutor to the office of sergeant.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Prosecutor is an exempt fireman and claims he could not-be reduced in rank except upon a hearing after charges. It has repeatedly been held that the governing body of a municipality, acting in good faith, and in the public interest,, has the power to abolish an office or position. <em>Paddock </em>v. <em>Hudson Tax </em>Board, 82 <em>N. J. L. </em>360; <em>Harker </em>v. <em>Bayonne, </em>85 <em>Id. </em>176; <em>Colgarry </em>v. <em>Water </em>Commissioners, <em>Ibid. </em>583; <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Guttenberg, </em>87 <em>Id. </em>434.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">The purpose of the change here was clearly shown to be economy. When the force was substantially reduced, the-need of five lieutenants naturalty ceased. Prosecutor fails-to show that the action taken with respect to his position was not in good faith. In fact the contrary clearly appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">The action of the board of commissioners is affirmed, andi the writ dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
