THE MAYOR AND ALDERMEN OF JERSEY CITY ET AL., RESPONDENTS.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b645-6\">Submitted October 17, 1931</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ANV\">Decided May 3, 1932.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b645-9\">Before Justices Teenchard and Donges.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>For the relator, <em>Gross &amp; Gross (Isaac Gross, </em>of counsel).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b646-4\">For the respondents, <em>Thomas J.

J. L. </em>6; 147 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>570, as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">\u201cThe action of municipal authorities upon application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>such a license is discretionary and not ministerial, and when such application is denied, <em>mandamus </em>will not lie to compel the authorities to grant it in the absence of fraud or abuse of such discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">There is no suggestion in this case of fraud, and the presumption is that the city acted in good faith. The question remains, was there abuse of discretion? We think that no abuse appears. The depositions indicate that this license for music and dancing was desired by a corporation, some of whose officers were Chinamen and non-residents of New Jersey, and that the restaurant in which the music and dancing was desired was on the second floor of a building at Journal Square and which is being conducted as a Chinese restaurant with the help entirely Chinese and the active management Chinese; and the indications are that its most active hours are in the evening, perhaps late at night, and that the equipment inside of the restaurant consists in part of secluded booths.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Now bearing in mind that the reason for the refusal to grant the license was, amongst other things, that it was detrimental to the young people of the neighborhood, it certainly cannot be said that there was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The rule to show cause will be discharged and the writ denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
