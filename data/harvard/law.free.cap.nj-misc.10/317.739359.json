J. L. </em>218, affirmed February 1st, 1932, it was held that the statute relating to establishing the state highway system does not empower the highway commission to take all the right, title and interest of the owner, but only so much of the right, title and interest of the owner as may be necessary to the public use authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>In the instant case, the orders under review provide for the taking of the fee of the lands in question. It follows, therefore, that ,so much of the orders in said condemnation proceedings, dated February 16th, 1931, and February 28th, 1931, as empowers the commission to take all the right, title and interest of the prosecutor in the lands therein referred to is set aside, but without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
