Prom these facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>undoubtedly the presumption o\u00ed control in the defendant arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">To meet this presumption the defendant testified that his car was kept in the garage of one JIcKnight and was to be delivered by the garage to the defendant at his home each morning; that Bell was not his employe; that he did not pay him and that he was not in his service. To like effect was the evidence of Bell, the driver, who testified that he was employed by the garage, that he was not employed by the defendant and that he delivered the ear as directed by the garage owner. This evidence, uncontradicted, we think, so clearly rebuts the presumption arising from the fact of ownership as to resolve the question into one of law for the court as such and not one for the court sitting as a jury. <em>Tischler </em>v. <em>Steinholtz, </em>99 <em>N.
