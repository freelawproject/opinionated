JOHN W. MORRISON, DEFENDANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b330-4\">Submitted October 16, 1931</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AkL\">Decided March 2, 1932.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b330-8\">Before Justices Tbenciiaed, Daly and Donges.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-9\">For the prosecutor, <em>Willigm A.

J. L. </em>156.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Looking to the return made by the judge, it appears that the return was amended by the judge to strike out all reference to the defendant\u2019s having waived hearing, and it, therefore, appears that the defendant did not waive a hearing, but that the defendant appeared specially for the purpose of raising the question of jurisdiction, and this appears throughout the return as the fact. If this be so, and the \u25a0defendant did not waive defects in the warrant and its service, we are of opinion that the warrant was not properly served and that the defendant could not be held thereunder, because it was served by someone to whom it was not directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The judgment is affirmed, but without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
