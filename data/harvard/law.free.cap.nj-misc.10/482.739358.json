These defenses were regarded by the District Court as good on their face, since they were struck as sham. <em>National Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Mulligan, </em>105 <em>N. J. L. </em>336. This was a proper view of the law. <em>Chaddock </em>v. Vanness, 35 <em>Id. </em>517; <em>McCormack </em>v. Williams, 88 <em>Id. </em>170; <em>Cockrell </em>v.

Gaddis, <em>No. </em>411 <em>January term, </em>1932.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">Our examination of the affidavits on the motion to strike, which are here challenged for insufficiency, leads us to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>conclusion that they were not sufficient to support the action of the trial court, and that there were disputed questions of fact which could only be settled after a trial. <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., </em>107 <em>N.
