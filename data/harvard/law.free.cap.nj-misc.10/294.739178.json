Where a party asks for an instruction which is partly good and partly bad, it is proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>to refuse it altogether. <em>Dederick </em>v. <em>Central Railroad Co., </em>74 <em>N. J. L. </em>424. The request next considered contains this sentence: \u201cThe duty to exercise reasonable care by the person using the highway is mutual, and every person may assume that others traveling on the highway will comply with his obligation.\u201d Given the ordinary and correct grammatical construction, this means that a person may assume that the obligation resting upon him will be complied with by others\u2014\u2022 which clearly is not what counsel intended and is not a correct statement of the law. The request must stand or fall by the language in which it is presented to the court unless modified by counsel. <em>Manchester Building and Loan </em>Assoc<em>iation </em>v. <em>Allee, </em>81 <em>N. J. L. </em>605. In much the same manner the third and fourth requests fail to present clear and correct concepts. In the last request this sentence occurs: \u201cWhen stopping or slowing up the driver of the vehicle so doing shall keep the arm and hand in a steady position with palm to the rear.\u201d The sentence is complete within itself. Counsel evidently intended these words to be part of a reference to the provisions of the Traffic act, for consideration by the jury in determining the question of negligence; but he did not make this clear. He left the request in such shape that the quoted sentence could be understood by the jury, not as an incidental fact, but as a controlling statement of the pertinent law. Therein the request was faulty. We find no error in the court\u2019s refusal to charge any of these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The final point is that the verdict of the jury is irregular, improper and uncertain and insufficient to sustain a judgment based thereon. The argument presented under this point is that on the request of the defendant the jury, having rendered its verdict through the foreman, was polled and one of the jurymen said, \u201cfor the defendant * * * I mean for the complainant,\u201d and that this incident vitiated the verdict. On behalf of the respondent it is argued that the polling of a jury is irregular in a civil cause. We find it unnecessary to consider the merits of the controversy. This point was presented before the trial court on a rule to show cause why the verdict should not be set aside. The appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>thereby lost his right to have the matter reviewed by an appellant tribunal. <em>Faragasso </em>v. <em>Introcaso, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>583; <em>Balint </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>9 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>591.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The judgment below should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
