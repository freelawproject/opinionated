The Newark Glass Company was engaged to install the glass in the plaintiff\u2019s window at No. 89 Halsey street, Newark, and in doing so the glass was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>broken. This was substantially the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony. The defendant gave testimony tending to show that the glass broke because of a weakness due to cutting and grinding the glass too deeply. In this situation the trial judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff, and in this there was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Assuming that the rule of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>applied, this did not raise a conclusive presumption of negligence. It still remained for the jury to decide whether negligence should be inferred. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Atlantic City and S. Railway Co., </em>85 <em>N. J. L. </em>212; 89 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>769. It was there said, in dealing with the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>that \u201cthe inference [negligence] is still one for the jury and not for the court. They may believe the witnesses; the circumstances may be such that the jury would attribute the injury to some cause with which the defendant has nothing to do; they may find the inference of negligence too weak to persuade their minds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In the present case there was additionally the defendant\u2019s proofs from which the jury could attribute the breakage to an undue weakness in the glass itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
