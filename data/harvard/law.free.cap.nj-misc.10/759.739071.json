There was a trial before the First District Court of the city of Newark, and the trial judge dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The state board thereupon sued out this writ of <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">The uncontradicted evidence showed that the defendant upon several occasions took impressions of the gums of the witness, made impressions in wax or rubber compound, and also in plaster paris; made dentures and fitted the teeth in the mouth of the witness. He held himself out as a mechanical dentist. The witness paid him all told $60. It was proved and uncontradieted that he had no license.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">There was no denial of these essential matters. On the contrary, the defendant himself testified that the work which he did was of a character which should have been done by a dentist.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">We think that the dismissal of the complaint was erroneous, and that the statutory essentials were proved by uncontradicted evidence. The finding of the trial judge that the work was \u201cprocured by the pleading of the witness\u201d did not justify the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">On the record presented the dismissal of the complaint was unjustified, and it will be set aside and the case remanded for retrial, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
