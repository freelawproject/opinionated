Holland, judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the county of Morris, and E. Bertram Mott, clerk of the county of Morris, respondents, show cause why a peremptory or alternative writ of <em>mandamus </em>shall not issue commanding them and enjoining him, Albert H. Holland, judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the county of Morris, \u201cto approve <em>one of the bonds\u201d </em>which relator, Michael A. Sagarese, filed with him for approval, and to permit the said relator to qualify as justice of the peace, as of May 1st, 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Our examination of the depositions results in the conclusion that sufficient appears to justify the award of an alternative writ, but not a peremptory writ. The legal right is not clear, and the facts which may well be pertinent are not definitely settled. In such case the court will ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>award an alternative writ to the end that an issue may be made, and the facts definitely ascertained, and thereby an opportunity given for review in error. <em>Hugg </em>v. <em>Camden, </em>39 <em>N. J. L. </em>620; <em>Schnitzler </em>v. <em>New York Transportation Co., </em>76 <em>Id. </em>171.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Accordingly an alternative writ will be awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
