Gerli &amp; Company for the purchase of silk by the prosecutors.</p>\n<p id=\"Abj3\">The contract provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">- \u201cAll the terms and provisions of the Baw Silk Buies of the Silk Association of America, approved or adopted by its board of managers are expressly understood and agreed to be a part of this contract the same as if they were herein set forth in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">\u201cEvery dispute, of whatever character, arising out of this contract must be settled by arbitration to be conducted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>the manner provided by the by-laws, rules and regulations of said association, governing arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">A dispute arose, prosecutors refused to submit, and pursuant to the Arbitration act <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1923, <em>ch. </em>134), Gerli <em>&amp; </em>Company petitioned the Circuit Court, and it made the order requiring submission to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The prosecutors say that the order is void because there was no evidence to support it. We think there was sufficient basis for the order. The petition was verified, and the affidavit filed by the prosecutors did not deny the <em>making </em>of the contract, the existence of the controversy, nor the failure to comply with the arbitration provision when that was demanded, but, as we read it, stated the <em>conclusion </em>of the affiant that the terms of the contract were rescinded or modified by parol, whether contemporaneously with or subsequent to the execution of the contract does not appear. We conclude that the making of the contract was not put in issue, there being no allegation of fraud or mistake. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Jameson, </em>32 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>222. The court below so found and we think properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Prosecutors say that the parties were not heard in open court. The record is to the contrary. It shows that the court \u201cheard counsel for the petitioners and for the respondents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Prosecutors say that it did not appear that the member of their partnership who signed the contract was authorized to bind his co-partners. The answer to this is that the making of the contract was in effect admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Prosecutors say that the Arbitration act of 1923 is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">It is first said that it is so because it encroaches upon the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery over specific performance of contracts of arbitration. That contention is plainly unsound. <em>Davilla </em>v. <em>United Fruit Co., </em>88 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>602; 103 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>519.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">It is lastly said that the act is unconstitutional because it embraces more than one object which is not expressed in its title. That is not so. The title is, \u201cAn act concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>arbitrations and awards/\u2019 and is certainly broad enough to cover the outlining of the procedure by which arbitration .agreements are to be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The order under review will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
