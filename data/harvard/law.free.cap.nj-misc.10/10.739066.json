The account was opened by the wife of the defendant below in 1928 and was continued until May 6th, 1930, when the defendant notified the plaintiff not to extend any further credit on his account. The goods were delivered from time to time to defendant\u2019s home and payments were made, on account, until on May 6th, 1930, there remained an unpaid balance of $177.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">The judge of the District Court, sitting without a jury, found in favor of the plaintiff below and from the resulting judgment the defendant below appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-14\">Three grounds for reversal are urged.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-15\">1.

The judgment is contrary to the weight of the evidence. This is not a proper ground of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">The judgment will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
