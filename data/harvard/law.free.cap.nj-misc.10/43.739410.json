He seeks to review the action of the new Hudson county park commission in abolishing the position which he occupied, claiming that he had a right to the office because he held an exempt fireman\u2019s certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">The stipulation of facts and the record returned with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>writ are too attenuated for us to determine the prosecutor\u2019s right to the possession of the office claimed, if such it be. <em>Loper </em>v. <em>Millville, </em>53 <em>N. J. L. </em>362.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">In so far as the writ seeks to attack the existence of the defendant commission, it is unnecessary for us to say more than that the principal questions suggested have been passed upon in <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>107 <em>N. J. L. </em>223.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The writ will therefore be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
