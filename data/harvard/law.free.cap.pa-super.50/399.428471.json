H. Hardy Auto Company, for the use of Harry Thomas^ against the defendant, C. W. Posey, to recover one \u201cWayne\u201d automobile, Model II design, of the value of $300. This is an action of replevin, and is brought to obtain possession of the property in question. The defendant refused to deliver possession of the machine to the officer executing the writ, and gave a counter bond as provided by law, and retained the machine. [In replevin the only question that the jury determines is the question of title, and possession follows the title. So if the title is in the plaintiff in this case, then he has the right to recover.] [3] The evidence shows that the automobile in question was leased to C. W. Posey for a certain specified time, named in the lease, and the court has construed that this lease is what the law calls a bailment, and that on the lessee not fulfilling the conditions of the bailment, that then the bailor has the right to recover the possession. [While this lease was made to C. W. Posey by the C. H. Hardy Auto Company, subsequently the lease was assigned to the use plaintiff in this case, Harry Thomas. So that this action now stands for the use of Harry Thomas as plaintiff in the case.] [4] [The defendant, having retained possession of the machine, and given a bond, and it appearing that the title is in the plaintiff, and also the right of possession, he is entitled to a verdict for the value of the machine, or the property in question, and the value in this case is claimed and admitted to be $300.] [5] In addition to that you are authorized to give damages by reason of the detention of the machine, that is, not delivering it over at the time the writ was issued, and those damages are not to exceed six per cent for the detention, unless there was a case of wanton oppression or maliciousness, or something of that kind, which might permit damages, such as the law terms exemplary, but there is no evidence of that in this case, so your verdict would be the value of this machine, with such damages for de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>tention, not exceeding six per cent from the time this suit was instituted, which was January 6, 1908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-2\">Counsel on both sides have submitted points.

H. Hardy Auto Company leased and hired to C. W. Posey for the term of two months from that date a Wayne auto, reserving for its hire and use for the term, the sum of 1550, payable in cash $250 and the balance on September 3, following. Indorsed on the agreement is an assignment by C. H. Hardy, \u201cof all his right, title and interest to Harry Thomas \u201d who is the use plaintiff in this action. The statement of claim avers that the Auto company, the original lessor, for value assigned all its interest in and under the lease to the said Harry Thomas. This averment was not denied in the affidavit of defense so that the confusion of names in regard to the actual lessor is not material, whether it be a corporation, a trading name or an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Where pleadings are irregular and imperfect but not necessarily defective the court must, if possible, give such effect to them and to the operation to the statute of amendments as will secure a trial upon the merits, provided it leads to results that will not prejudice the defendant and may subsequently be pleaded as an ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>judicated determination of the litigated matters, if any other suit were instituted: Stainer v. Insurance Co., 13 Pa. Superior Ct. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">The suit being brought in the name of the legal plaintiff, his right alone is in question and it may be recovered upon or defended against, as the defendant is not permitted to dispute the form of the action as presented by his record. A person for whose use a suit is brought need not show a right in himself; all that is necessary is to show the legal plaintiff\u2019s right to recover. This suit being brought in the name of the legal plaintiff with whom the defendant contracted, the judgment is an adjudication of the controversy: Adams v. Edwards, 115 Pa. 211; Guaranty Trust <em>&amp; </em>Safe Deposit Co. v. Powell, 150 Pa. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"AHZ7\">The alleged conversations in regard to the condition of the machine prior to the execution of the lease were properly excluded, as the manifest purpose of the offers was to lay ground for a'set-off \u2014 for the amount of the repairs which the defendant had expended so as to put the machine in good condition. Though part of the offer was admissible, it was properly rejected as the court was not bound to separate the good from the bad, and was justified in rejecting it as it was presented: Mundis v. Emig, 171 Pa. 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The law is well settled in Pennsylvania that set-off cannot be pleaded or allowed in an action of replevin to recover personal property: Nat. Cash Register Co. v. Cochran, 22 Pa. Superior Ct. 582; Eureka Knitting Co. v. Snyder, 36 Pa. Superior Ct. 337; Hall\u2019s Safe Co. v. Walenk, 42 Pa. Superior Ct. 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
