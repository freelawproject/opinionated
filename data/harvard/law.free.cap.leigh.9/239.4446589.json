The record of the proceedings next had in the cause, *which were on the 31st of October, states that \u201cthe said William H. Page, who stands indicted of forgery, was set to the bar in custody, and being arraigned of the said forgery, moved the court to quash the first, second, fourth, fifth and sixth counts of the indictment;\u201d which motion being overruled, he tendered a bill of exceptions, which was received and made a part of the record. In this bill it is stated, that the motion to quash the several counts aforesaid was made for the reason and upon the ground that the prisoner had not been, according to law, examined by a court of examination for the facts and offences set out in the said counts, and remanded to the said circuit court for trial for the same ; and for other errors apparent on the face of the said counts ; in support of which motion the prisoner offered to the court a copy of the record of his examination, under which he had been remanded to the said circuit court for trial: but the circuit court overruled the said motion and refused to quash all or any one of the said counts, being of opinion that it sufficiently appeared, from the record aforesaid, that the prisoner had been, according to law, examined by a court of examination, and remanded to the said circuit court for trial, for the facts and offences of which he stood indicted in the said several counts, and that there were no errors in the said counts for which they or any of them ought to be quashed. The record of the examining court (consisting of the warrant for' summoning the justices, the proceedings and judgment of the court, and the depositions of the witnesses for the commonwealth) was set out in hsc verba in the bill of exceptions. The warrant was under the hand and seal of P. Wicker, recorder of the city of Richmond; reciting that William H.

Page then and there well knowing the said note and writing to be false, forged and counterfeited ;\u201d \u2014 and, therefore, requiring the serjeant to summon at least eight of the justices of said city to meet at the courthouse thereof, on &amp;c. to hold a court for the examination of the fact with which the said William H. Page stood charged. In the proceedings of the examining court, the offence was described, verbatim, as in the warrant for summoning the court; and then it was stated that \u201cthe court, having heard the evidence, are of opinion that the said William H.

And in the entry made on the following day, it is stated that \u201c the said William H. Page, who stands indicted of forgery, was again set to the bar in custody, and thereupon came a jury &amp;c. who being elected &amp;c. and having heard the evidence, upon their oath do say that the said William H.

Page be acquitted of the charges contained in the said second, third, fifth and sixth counts of the indictment, and go thereof without day ; that the said first and fourth counts be .quashed ; and that the said William H. Page be discharged out of custody.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
