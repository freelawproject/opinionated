Whereupon the counsel for the tenants moved the court to instruct the jury, that unless they were satisfied, from the evidence, that all the heirs of William Bartly deceased were made demand-ants, they should find a verdict for the tenants. But the court, being of opinion that the tenants had, by joining the mise, admitted that the demandants were the heirs of William Bartly deceased, and could not prove the existence of other heirs than those named, in order to defeat the demandants, except on a plea in abatement, refused to give the instruction asked. To which opinion the tenants excepted.
