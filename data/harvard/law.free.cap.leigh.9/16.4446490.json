And he after-wards tendered a plea of nil debet; to which the counsel for the plaintiffs objected, but on the defendant\u2019s counsel saying that he hoped to shew by authorities that this was a proper *plea in such a case, the court overruled the objection, and the plea was put in, and the plaintiffs took issue upon it. But at the next term after these proceedings, there was a judgment entered for the plaintiffs as upon a general demurrer by them to the defendant\u2019s plea of nil debet; and the court gave judgment for them also on the plea of no such record, and then judgment for them according to the demand in the declaration; namely, for the debt and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-13\">The defendant applied by petition to this court for a supersedeas to the judgment; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b17-14\">Johnson, for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG\">contended, 1. That while the issue joined on the plea of nil debet stood on the record, no demurrer to that plea was admissible; the plaintiffs could nor reply and demur too. And if the demurrer was not properly admissible, much more irregular and erroneous was the proceeding of the court overruling the plea as upon demurrer, when in truth no demurrer had been put in. The consequence of this irregularity might have been to deprive the defendant of a good plea, such as payment of the debt after the judgment rendered. 2. That the plea nil debet to this declaration was not a demurrable plea. He said the case of Clarke\u2019s adm\u2019r v. Day, 2 Leigh 172, required a reexamination ; and notwithstanding that case, he insisted, that the laws of Maryland must, in our courts, be regarded as matters of fact to be proved by evidence ; that the declaration here should have set forth the effect of the law of Maryland ; or the plaintiffs might have replied, that the plea was not a good bar according to the law of that state; and the question whether it was so or not, was, in its nature, a matter of fact, and so a proper subject of pleading and evidence: that the court could not upon a general demurrer to the plea take judicial notice, that by the law of Maryland the plea was not a good plea to the action there. *3. That this being an action on a judgment, the declaration should have</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-16\">demanded what the judgment gave, namely, the debt and the damages, not the debt and the interest, for which no judgment was given, though the payment of interest was, by the memorandum, to be a defeasance of the judgment for the damages ; in like manner as in debt on a judgment for the penalty of a bond to be discharged by the payment of principal and interest, the declaration shoulddemand the penalty adjudged.

That it was plain the question whether the plea of nil debet should be received or not, was not decided, but was held sub judice till the defendant\u2019s counsel should shew the authorities to sustain.it. It was doubtless owing to a clerical misprison that the similiter was added'to the plea. But if the plea was not a good plea to the action, the defendant could have had no benefit from a trial of the issue upon it. Suppose the plea an improper one, which the court below should have rejected, and from which the party could have derived no benefit;. this court would not reverse the judgment for any irregularity in the manner in which the plea was overruled. If the plea had been received, it should have been struck out; Wyche v. Maclin, 2 Rand. 426, Read v. Hanna\u2019s ex\u2019or, 3 Rand. 56. Then, 2, he said, the plea was unquestionably demurrable: he relied on Clarke\u2019s adm\u2019r v. Day, and cited also Barney v. Patterson, 6 Har. &amp; Johns. 182, andWernwag v. Pawling, 6 Gill &amp; Johns. 500. And as to the last point, he insisted, that the declaration properly demanded the interest which was really due, instead of the damages which were not due, by the judgment. But if that was a defect in the declaration, it was cured by the statute of jeofails, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128, \u00a7 103, p. 512.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b16-19\">Pleading and Practice \u2014 Striking Out Plea after Issue Joined. \u2014 To the point that the court may strike out a plea that is wholly unnecessary even though issue has been joined upon it, the principal case is cited in Fant v.

The cases of Ragsdale v. Batte, and Anderson v. Price, are not direct authorities upon the point, and without disturbing them, we may sustain the declaration in this case. I consider the demand of the plaintiff to be substantially for the debt and interest, they having, at the time the judgment was entered, released the damages and agreed to receive interest in lieu of them. After that agreement, they never could enforce payment of 400 dollars damages, which were equivalent to thirty-three years interest, when only three years interest was due at the date of the judgment. Now, this is not the case of a demand reduced by payments or matter ex post facto. The reduction is in the judgment itself, and the plaintiffs .never had title to demand more. They therefore properly demanded what was due, and no more. Indeed, it is obvious, that this practice in Maryland has been adopted to enable the plaintiff to recover continuing interest; and though the contrivance seems awkward, we cannot fail to see, that the true meaning of the judgment is that the plaintiffs shall recover their debt with interest till paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">The plea of nil debet was, in this case, an improper plea, according .to the decision in Clarke\u2019s adm\u2019r v. Day, which we are not disposed to disturb, though I do not acquiesce in some of the reasoning of judge Coalter in that case. The court, therefore, erred in receiving the plea, and might very properly at a subsequent time correct that error by setting aside the issue and the plea. It has done this, substantially, by entering a judgment as if there had been a demurrer. Perhaps, indeed, we ought to infer that there was one ; but even if there were none, the court having done what was right, we cannot reverse its act because it has not done it in the right <em>way; </em>since the mode of doing it has no influence upon the justice of the case. It was said, indeed, that if the plea had been rejected, the defendant *might have pleaded payment, and that he has been taken by surprise. I do not think so. He ought to have pleaded payment at first or if he did not, still, on the plea of nil debet being overruled, he would have had a right to plead payment. But he offered no such plea. Had he done so, I should have considered it error to refuse it, as the court, by accepting his first plea, had led him reasonably to suppose he might defend himself under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-8\">I am of opinion, that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b18-9\">BROOK\u00ae, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adq\">I entirely concurin the opinion of the president. I did not concur in all the reasoning of judge Coalter in Clarke\u2019s adm\u2019r v. Day, though I did in the conclusion to which he came, and I said no more. I then entertained the opinion I do now, \u2014 that the judgments of our sister states, under the constitution of the U. States and the acts of congress in pursuance thereof, are to be treated as domestic judgments ; and that the effect of such judgments in the state from which they came, is a question of law, not a question of fact as in the case of foreign judgments. And I was surprised to hear it argued to the contrary in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-10\">BROCKENBROUGH and PARKER, J., concurred. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
