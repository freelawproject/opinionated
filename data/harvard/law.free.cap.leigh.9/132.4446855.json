The declaration complained of Kayser executor of Circle, and contained five counts. The first count alleged, that the defendant executor as aforesaid, by his promissory note in writing, was indebted to the plaintiff one of the legatees of Circle, in the sum of 459 dollars, the balance due the plaintiff as such legatee from the defendant as executor as aforesaid ; and being so indebted, the defendant as executor as aforesaid, in consideration thereof, undertook and promised, by his said promissory note, to pay the sum of money to the plaintiff, when the defendant should be thereto requested.- \u2014 The second count was like the first, except that it alleged, that defendant executor as aforesaid (not as executor) promised to pay the money, when the defendant executor as aforesaid should be thereto requested. \u2014 The third count alleged, that the defendant executor as aforesaid was indebted to the plaintiff as one of the legatees of Circle, in the sum of 459 dollars, for so much money by the defendant executor as aforesaid had and received to the use of the plaintiff as such legatee ; and *being so indebted, the defendant executor as aforesaid promised the plaintiff to pay him the same. \u2014 The fourth count alleged, that the defendant executor as aforesaid, by his promissory note in writing, acknowledged, that on a final settlement of all accounts between the plaintiff one of the legatees of Circle, and the defendant executor of Circle, there was a balance due the plaintiff of 459 dollars ; and in consideration thereof the defendant executor as aforesaid, by his said promissory note, promised to pay the same to the plaintiff. The fifth count alleged, that the defendant and the plaintiff accounted together of and concerning divers sums of money due from the defendant executor as aforesaid, to the plaintiff as one of the legatees of Circle ; and upon that account, the defendant executor as aforesaid was found indebted to the plaintiff the sum of 459 dollars ; and being so found indebted, the defendant executor as aforesaid, in consideration thereof, promised to pay the same to the <em>plaintiff.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>The defendant demurred generally to the declaration, and pleaded non assumpsit.

No admission of assets or mere acknowledgment will be sufficient; for without such promise the executor has a right to require a refunding bond which a court of law cannot compel the creditor to give or the executor to receive. Whitehead v. Coleman, 31 Gratt. 789, citing the principal case as its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">And in Nelson v. Cornwell, 11 Gratt. 737, it is said: \u201cNo suit will lie at common law to recover a legacy, unless the executor has assented thereto. If no such assent has been given, the remedy is exclusively in the courts of equity. 1 Story\u2019s Equ. Jur. \u00a7 591. Since the decision of Deeks v. Strutt, 5 T. R. 690, it has been considered as the settled doctrine in England, that no action at law will lie to recover a general legacy; even though there be assets, and the executor expressly promised to pay it. 2 Roper on Legacies 1798; 1 Story\u2019s Equ. Jur. \u00a7\u00a7 591, 592. This doctrine, however, has not been recognized in any case decided by this court; and Tucker, P., in <em>Kayser, ex\u2019or, v. Disher, </em>9 <em>Leigh </em>357, seemed to be unwilling to admit It in its whole extent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Age\">In Hairston v. Hall, 3 Call 218, It was held that a legatee cannot recover a slave devised to him without proving the assent of the executor to the legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"AIlZ\">The principal case was also cited in Staples v. Staples, 85 Va. 81, 7 S. E.

Itis a subject of regret, that a good cause should be lost for want of : form in the pleadings ; *but we do not perceive how we , can sustain this judgment, without an utter disregard of the essential forms of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">The questions argued at the bar arise out of the declaration, to which there is a general demurrer. Upon this demurrer, the objection to the misjoinder of action may be made, together with any other objection, which is matter of substance, and goes to the whole of the counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">As to misjoinder. The writ is against \u201cJ. D. Jtayser executor of Circle.\u201d The declaration complains of \u201cJ. D. Kayser executor of Circle.\u201d The first count alleges, \u201cthat the said defendant executor as aforesaid\u201d by his promissory note &amp;c. was indebted &amp;c. to the plaintiff \u201cas legatee and being so indebted, in consideration thereof, \u201che the said defendant as executor as aforesaid promised &amp;c.\u201d This is distinctly the form of the declaration against an executor in his representative character. 1 Chitt. Plead. 205-6, 1 Wms. Saund. 111, 112 ; Brigden v. Parkes, 2 Bos. &amp; Pull. 424; Hawkins &amp; ux. v. Saunders, 1 Cowp. 289, 292 ; Epes\u2019s adm\u2019r v. Dudley adm\u2019r, 5 Rand. 437 ; Bishop v. Harrison\u2019s adm'r, 2 Leigh 532. No other form, indeed, could well be devised for distinguishing the action against the executor, from the action against the individual. It is necessary that some form should be adopted, which shall enable the court, where there is judgment by default, or on demurrer, to decide in what character the judgment should be rendered against the defendant. On this first count, the judgment can only be against the executor as such, for the promise is distinctly laid to have been made by him as executor. It must, therefore, be against the goods and chattels of the testator, and not against the executor personally. . : '</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">The court does not find it necessary to enquire, whether the other counts are against the executor as such, or not: quacunque via , data, the declaration is bad. Take *it, that they are against him individually : then, as the first is not, there is . a misjoinder. Take it, that they are all against the executor as such : then, they are all of them demands against the estate. But the demand of a legatee for his legacy, is ; \u25a0 not a demand against the estate ; it is a demand against the' executor personally, for part of the estate. And if, as was contended, an action at law will lie for a legacy, either upon an express or implied promise, it is perfectly clear, that it must be brought against the executor in his individual, and not in his representative, character ; and the judgment must be de bonis propriis, not de bonis testatoris. This is clearly shewn by the cases decided in the time of lord Mansfield ; Atkins &amp; ux v. Hill, 1 Cowp. 284; Hawkes &amp; ux. v. Saunders, Id. 289. See also Rose &amp; ux. v. Bowler\u2019s ex\u2019ors, 1 H. Black. 108. Taking all the counts, then, to be of the same character, they are all against the defendant in his representative character, and are, therefore, all of them bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-19\">In this view of the case, the question mainly argued at the bar, need not be decided : the court gives no opinion upon it. Yet I am myself well satisfied, 1. That an action at law against an executor for a legacy, does not lie without an express promise of the executor to pay. 2. That it does lie upon such promise, where there is a good consideration ; for example, where there are assets to pay the legacy. 3. That if the promise of the executor be unqualified, it amounts to a waiver of the refunding bond which he might have required of the legatee, and removes a great difficulty in the proceeding at law. 4. That if the promise be on condition of a refunding bond being given by the legatee, then, on ordinary principles, there can be no recovery without proof of the performance of that condition. 5. That no admission of assets, or mere acknowledgment of indebtedness, without an express promise, will sustain the action ; for, in those cases, the objection exists, if no other, **that the executor has a right to require a refunding bond from the legatee, : which a court of law cannot compel him to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-22\">Judgment reversed ; and judgment for the defendant upon the demurrer to the declara- ' tion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
