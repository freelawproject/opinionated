The State of Montana appeals. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the District Court erred in granting Devlin\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of his responses to the officer\u2019s requests, made after Devlin was arrested for DUI but before he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, that he recite the alphabet starting with the letter \u201cK\u201d and count aloud from 46 to 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">\u00b63 At about 11:00 p.m. on April 25, 1997, Ravalli County Deputy Sheriff Greg Stewart saw Devlin driving north on Highway 93 at erratic speeds and weaving across both the center line and the fog line at the edge of the road. When Stewart pulled Devlin over, he smelled alcohol on Devlin\u2019s breath and Devlin\u2019s speech was slurred and slow. Devlin failed several field sobriety tests and was placed under arrest and taken to the Ravalli County Sheriff\u2019s Office. There, Stewart again asked Devlin to perform field sobriety tests, videotaping the results. The tests included recitation of the alphabet starting with the letter \u201cK\u201d and counting out loud from 46 to 72. When these tests were administered, Devlin had not yet been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">\u00b64 Devlin was initially prosecuted in Ravalli County Justice Court, where he moved to suppress evidence of \u201call statements made by him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>not preceded by a <em>Miranda </em>warning\u201d and \u201call [of his] testimonial answers in field sobriety tests.\u201d The State opposed that motion. After briefing, the court denied the motion to suppress. Devlin was convicted of DUI and sentenced to two days in jail. His sentence was stayed pending his appeal to District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b65 In the District Court, Devlin renewed his motion to suppress. After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs, the court entered an order and opinion suppressing the results of the alphabet and the number recitation tests. The State appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in granting Devlin\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of his responses to the arresting officer\u2019s requests made after Devlin was arrested for DUI but before he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, that he recite the alphabet starting with the letter \u201cK\u201d and count aloud from 46 to 72?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u00b67  Our standard of review of a ruling on a motion to suppress where the facts are not in dispute is to determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct as a matter of law. This Court\u2019s review is plenary as to whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied the law. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 459, 462, 904 P.2d 1019, 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">\u00b68 The issue here presented implicates the right guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution not to be compelled to be a witness against oneself in a criminal case. The Fifth Amendment privilege was designed to protect against the \u201ccruel trilemma\u201d of having to choose among answering truthfully, answering falsely, or remaining silent. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Muniz </em>(1990), 496 U.S. 582, 110 S.Ct. 2638, 110 L.Ed.2d 528. Like the United States Constitution, Montana\u2019s Constitution guarantees, at Article II, Section 25, that \u201c[n]o person shall be compelled to testify against himself in a criminal proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">\u00b69 At the outset, we note the representation made at oral argument that before asking Devlin to perform those field sobriety tests, the arresting officer obtained Devlin\u2019s assent that he was familiar with the alphabet and with counting. We make no determination as to the constitutionality of using as evidence the response of a person unfamiliar with the alphabet when asked to recite its letters or a person unable to count when asked to recite numbers in sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">\u00b610 In <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 384, 773 P.2d 722, this Court upheld the use as evidence of a videotape of a DUI defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>response to field sobriety tests including a request that he recite the alphabet. We agreed with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s spoken words on the videotape did not include any testimonial information. <em>Thompson, </em>237 Mont. at 387, 773 P.2d at 724. Devlin and the District Court take the position that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Muniz </em>effectively overrules <em>Thompson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b611 Muniz was arrested for DUI on a Pennsylvania highway and taken to a booking center where he was told that his actions and voice would be videotaped. Muniz then answered questions about his name, address, height, weight, eye color, date of birth, and age. He was also asked, but was unable to give, the date of his sixth birthday. He refused to take a breathalyzer test and was then advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b612 Over Muniz\u2019s objection, the videotape from the booking center was introduced into evidence at his trial, and he was convicted of DUI. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Superior Court reversed on grounds that the videotape was inadmissible as evidence because it violated Muniz\u2019s right against self-incrimination. <em>Commonwealth v. Muniz </em>(1988), 547 A.2d 419. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania appealed that decision, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied the application for review. At the next level of appeal, however, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b613 The United States Supreme Court ruled that Muniz\u2019s answers to questions about his name, address, height, weight, eye color, date of birth, and age were admissible into evidence under an exception to the <em>Miranda </em>requirements for routine booking questions. <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 601, 110 S.Ct 2638. The Court determined, however, that the sixth birthday question was not a routine booking question, that it \u201crequired a testimonial response,\u201d and that, as a result, Muniz\u2019s response should have been suppressed as a violation of the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 598-600, 110 S.Ct 2638. It is important to note that the <em>Muniz </em>Court specifically reserved decision on whether counting as part of the field sobriety tests would be testimonial within the meaning of the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 604, n. 17, 110 S.Ct 2638.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b614 The Court has defined a testimonial response as one in which the accused explicitly or implicitly relates a factual assertion or discloses information. Doe <em>v. United States </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 201, 210, 108 S.Ct. 2341, 2347, 101 L.Ed.2d 184, 197. The need for use of the human voice does not automatically make an answer testimonial. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number><em>States v. Wade </em>(1967), 388 U.S. 218, 222-23, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1930, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149, 1155. The physical inability to articulate words because of lack of muscle coordination of the tongue and mouth is not in itself testimonial. <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 590-91, 110 S.Ct 2638.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b615 Requiring a criminal suspect\u2019s presence and speech at a lineup does not require the person to disclose any knowledge he might have and does not violate the Fifth Amendment. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. at 222-23, 87 S.Ct. 1926. Such a requirement is not testimonial even though it requires a verbal response and is not a routine booking question. Similarly, a grand jury witness may be compelled to read a transcript in order to provide an example of his or her voice if the voice example is to be used only to measure the physical properties of the witness\u2019s voice and not for the testimonial or communicative content of what is said. <em>United States v. Dionisio </em>(1973), 410 U.S. 1, 7, 93 S.Ct. 764, 768, 35 L.Ed.2d 67, 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b616 Devlin argues that asking him to recite the alphabet and to count is a request to disclose information beyond possible slurred speech; that incorrect recitation of the alphabet or numbers would constitute incriminating evidence from his own mouth. The same could have been said in <em>Wade </em>regarding required speech at a lineup and <em>Dionisio </em>regarding the required reading of a transcript to provide a voice example.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u00b617 Devlin cites cases from Florida and Oregon, whose courts have held that under their respective states\u2019 constitutions recitation of the alphabet or counting is testimonial in nature and is therefore protected under the Fifth Amendment. In <em>Allred v. State </em>(Fla. 1993), 622 So.2d 984, the Supreme Court of Florida reasoned that the content of a response to a request to recite part of the alphabet \u201cis incriminating evidence out of the suspect\u2019s own mouth. The incriminating inference is drawn from the testimonial act \u2014 answering the question incorrectly, not from physical evidence \u2014 slurred speech.\u201d <em>Allred, </em>622 So. 2d at 987. \u00b618 In the second state case cited by Devlin, <em>State v. Fish </em>(Or. 1995), 893 P.2d 1023, the Supreme Court of Oregon ruled that under Oregon\u2019s state constitution, all field sobriety tests must be preceded by a <em>Miranda </em>warning. This ruling extended not only to requests for verbal recitation of the alphabet or numbers, but also to the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, the walk-and-turn test, the one-leg stand, and balance test and finger-to-nose test. The court reasoned that if any aspect of the field sobriety tests involves testimonial evidence, then the request that a person perform such tests is a request for testimonial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>evidence. The court lumped counting and alphabet recitation together with answers to questions relating to the individual\u2019s residence and date of birth, stating \u201c[tjhere can be no doubt that those aspects of the field sobriety tests require the individual to communicate information to the police about the individual\u2019s beliefs, knowledge or state of mind.\u201d <em>Fish, </em>893 P.2d at 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b619 On the other hand, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, Suffolk, has reasoned that, unlike providing the date of one\u2019s sixth birthday, recitation of the alphabet \u201clacks inherent communicative value because it does not convey knowledge of any fact specific to the person being questioned.\u201d <em>Vanhouton v. Commonwealth </em>(Mass. 1997), 676 N.E.2d 460, 466. That court reversed an order suppressing evidence of an alphabet recitation test of a person charged with DUI. The court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">The same conclusion has been reached by the vast majority of other jurisdictions that have addressed the issue. The decisions hold that a straightforward alphabet recitation test (or comparable counting exercises), performed during a roadside investigation of suspected drunk driving, are outside the protective sphere of the privilege against self-incrimination because there is no disclosure of subjective knowledge or thought processes in a constitutionally prohibited sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\"><em>Vanhouton, </em>676 N.E.2d at 466. The court cited cases from ten jurisdictions, including the <em>Thompson </em>decision from Montana, in which the courts reached similar conclusions as to counting and/or reciting the alphabet.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u00b620  Neither counting nor reciting the alphabet involves an express or implied assertion of fact or belief. Therefore, a defendant who is asked to count or recite is not confronted with the \u201ccruel trilemma\u201d of truth, falsity, or silence discussed in <em>Muniz. </em>Where like Devlin, the accused is familiar with the alphabet and with counting, the questions here at issue cannot be said to convey information to the police about the individual\u2019s beliefs, knowledge, or state of mind. Neither the recitation of a portion of the alphabet nor counting conveys any facts specific to the person being questioned. Devlin has offered no persuasive authority or rationale for expanding the <em>Muniz </em>holding to cover relatively content-free oral declarations like reciting the alphabet and counting in sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\u00b621  This Court\u2019s holding in <em>Thompson </em>is in line with the majority of jurisdictions that have considered this issue, both before and af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ter <em>Muniz. </em>We agree with the reasoning of the Massachusetts court and the cases it cited in <em>Vanhouton. </em>We reaffirm our decision in <em>Thompson </em>and hold that neither counting aloud nor reciting a portion of the \u25a0 alphabet is testimonial in nature and that therefore Fifth Amendment protections do not attach when a driver suspected of DUI is asked to recite either or both as part of field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"ANi\">\u00b622 In his brief, Devlin raised a cross-appeal issue concerning whether the District Court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of his response to the officer\u2019s question, \u201cDo you understand these instructions?\u201d At oral argument, however, Devlin\u2019s counsel conceded that this issue is premature because there is no final judgment of conviction against him. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-20-104, MCA. Consequently, we do not address the cross-appeal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b623 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-5\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b245-6\">JUSTICE NELSON dissents.</judges>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\u00b624 I have a great deal of difficulty with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Pennsylvania v. Muniz </em>(1990), 496 U.S. 582, 110 S.Ct. 2638, 110 L.Ed.2d 528. The Supreme Court\u2019s pigeonholing of Muniz\u2019s various statements and responses into arbitrary categories, some admissible and some not, draws impractical and result-oriented distinctions grounded more in form than in substance. Stumbling over one\u2019s address and age at booking (as Muniz did, <em>see Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 586, 110 S.Ct. at 2642) is no less \u201ctestimonial\u201d than being unable to calculate the date of one\u2019s 6th birthday. Indeed, \u201croutine booking questions\u201d (i.e., name, address, height, weight, eye color, date of birth) fit precisely within the testimonial component criteria adopted by the Supreme Court. Such questions require the detainee or arrestee \u201cto communicate an express or implied assertion of fact or belief.\u201d <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 597, 110 S.Ct. at 2648. That inaccurate (and, thus, incriminating) answers to such questions are obtained during the booking process instead of during a custodial interrogation, renders them no less testimonial under the test articulated by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AqI\">\u00b625 Furthermore, if, as the Supreme Court states, creation of the \u201croutine booking questions\u201d exception to <em>Miranda </em>is justified by the police\u2019s need \u201cto secure \u2018the biographical data necessary to complete booking or pretrial services\u2019 \u201d and for administrative and \u201crecord-keeping purposes <em>only\u201d (see Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 601, 110 S.Ct. at 2650 (emphasis added)), then it logically follows that, absent a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>Miranda </em>warning and waiver, the state should not also be able to incriminate the accused with his misstatements and inaccurate answers to such questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b626 In other words, a more intellectually honest approach demands that the police be allowed to gather routine booking information for biographical, administrative and record- keeping purposes, but that the prosecution be prohibited from using the arrestee\u2019s inaccurate responses against him unless he had first knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to remain silent. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 476-77, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1629, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (\u201cThe privilege against self-incrimination protects the individual from being compelled to incriminate himself in any manner; it does not distinguish degrees of incrimination. Similarly, for precisely the same reason, no distinction may be drawn between inculpatory statements and statements alleged to be merely \u2018exculpatory.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Rhode Island v. Innis </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 291, 301 n.5, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1690 n.5, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (\u201cBy \u2018incriminating response\u2019 we refer to any response \u2014 whether inculpatory or exculpatory \u2014 that the <em>prosecution </em>may seek to introduce at trial.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b627 With regard to an arrestee\u2019s failure to recite the alphabet or to count accurately, those responses, too, are \u201ctestimonial\u201d under the criteria adopted by the <em>Muniz </em>Court. As the Supreme Court notes, giving a voice exemplar or speaking a scripted phrase during a line-up is not testimonial because the suspect is not asked to communicate any personal beliefs or knowledge of facts; the accused\u2019s voice patterns and manner of speech are content-neutral and, therefore, not testimonial. <em>See Muniz, </em>496 at 598-99 and n.12, 110 S.Ct. at 2648-49 and n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"AD7\">\u00b628 By contrast, in reciting the alphabet and in counting, the defendant is required to state, as a matter of fact or belief, that 2 follows 1 and precedes 3 and that \u201cC\u201d precedes \u201cD\u201d and follows \u201cB\u201d. As the <em>Muniz </em>Court stated, the slurred nature of the accused\u2019s speech in answering these questions (or in answering the 6th birthday question) is not protected under the Fifth Amendment because the manner of the defendant\u2019s speaking and delivery is \u201creal,\u201d physical, or non-testimonial evidence. <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 592, 110 S.Ct. at 2645.</p>\n<p id=\"AY9\">\u00b629 However, apart from the manner of his speaking, the inability of the accused to correctly sequence the alphabet and to count chronologically \u2014 -i.e., the <em>content </em>of his responses \u2014 is as much indicative of mental confusion (the testimonial component of speech held suppressible by the Supreme Court, <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 592-93, 110 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>at 2645-46) as is the arrestee\u2019s inability to compute the date of his 6th birthday. Both sorts of questions require the accused to \u201cexplicitly or implicitly, relate a factual assertion or disclose information.\u201d <em>Doe v. United States </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 201, 210, 108 S.Ct. 2341, 2347, 101 L.Ed.2d 184. Both sorts of questions allow the fact-finder to infer from an inability to answer or from an inaccurate answer that the accused\u2019s mental state was confused. And, from both sorts of questions, \u201cthe incriminating inference of mental confusion is drawn from a testimonial act\u201d (inaccurately reciting the alphabet or counting) rather than from the physical evidence (the manner of the defendant\u2019s speaking and delivery). <em>See Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 592-93, 110 S.Ct. at 2645-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b630 Again, a more intellectually honest approach would allow simply the non-testimonial/physical/real evidence component of the defendant\u2019s answers \u2014 the manner of his delivery; his slurred, slow speech \u2014 to be used against him, but, absent a prior <em>Miranda </em>warning and waiver, disallow introduction into evidence of the testimonial component \u2014 his inability to correctly recite the alphabet and to count.</p>\n<p id=\"AcH\">\u00b631 Finally, these points of disagreement with <em>Muniz </em>aside, this Court in the case <em>subjudice, </em>misapplies <em>Muniz </em>even as written. The majority points out that \u201cthe <em>Muniz </em>Court specifically reserved decision on whether counting as part of the field sobriety tests would be testimonial within the meaning of the privilege against self incrimination,\u201d citing <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 603 n.17, 110 S.Ct. at 2651 n.17. \u00b632 True, the Supreme Court did not specifically state that counting is testimonial and, therefore, subject to <em>Miranda. But see Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 614-16, 110 S.Ct. at 2657-58 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Notwithstanding, the Court did state without equivocation that \u201ccounting at the officer\u2019s request qualifies as a response to custodial interrogation,\u201d <em>Muniz, </em>496 at 603 n.17, 110 S.Ct. at 2651 n.17, and that \u201cthe inherently coercive environment created by... custodial interrogation precluded] the option of remaining silent\u201d \u2014 thus confronting the defendant with the cruel trilemma. <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 597-99, 110 S.Ct. at 2648-49. Importantly, however, in Muniz\u2019s case, the Supreme Court also determined that the defendant\u2019s counting was <em>not incriminating </em>because he counted <em>accurately,Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 603 n. 17, 110 S.Ct. at 2651 n.17, a fact refuted by the dissent, <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 615, 110 S.Ct. at 2657-58 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b63 3 Thus, under <em>Muniz </em>as written, since the DUI suspect\u2019s counting at the station house is the result of an inherently coercive custodial interrogation, the accused is <em>prima facie </em>confronted with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>trilemma of telling the truth, lying or remaining silent, and, as the Supreme Court notes, the latter is not an option. In Muniz\u2019s case, <em>Miranda </em>was not implicated only because the defendant\u2019s counting \u2014 his testimony \u2014 did not incriminate him; his counting was accurate, according to the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b634 Similarly, in the case at bar, Devlin was arrested and, then, as part of the DUI investigation at the station house, he was required to recite the alphabet starting with the letter \u201cK\u201d and was required to count aloud from 46 to 72. Under Muniz, then, it is clear that Devlin\u2019s post-arrest responses to the officer\u2019s demand that he recite the alphabet and count were as a result of a custodial interrogation, and, thus, <em>prima facie </em>subject to the requirements of <em>Miranda. </em>However, unlike Muniz, Devlin\u2019s speaking was incriminating.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b635 In his March 3, 1998 Opinion and Order granting the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, District Judge Langton noted that the post-arrest videotape of Devlin\u2019s recitation of the alphabet and counting shows that he did so inaccurately. The trial court\u2019s finding is supported by the record. The videotape reveals Devlin\u2019s stumbling recitation of the alphabet, and his losing the sequence near the end of his recitation. The videotape demonstrates that Devlin violated the officer\u2019s instruction to count only to 72; he continues to count past that number. More importantly, the videotape shows that, while he recited the alphabet and counted inaccurately, Devlin\u2019s manner of speaking did not reveal that he was intoxicated\u2014 his speech was neither slurred nor slow. In short, in Devlin\u2019s case, under <em>Muniz, </em>the real or physical evidence component of his speech was <em>not </em>incriminating, but the testimonial component \u2014 his inaccurate recitation of the alphabet and <em>counting </em>\u2014 was incriminating.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b636 Consequently, under <em>Muniz, </em>even as written, Devlin\u2019s responses to the arresting officer\u2019s requests were properly suppressed, being <em>both </em>the product of a custodial interrogation <em>and </em>inaccurate (and, thus, incriminating). <em>See Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 603 n.17, 110 S.Ct. at 2651 n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"AGZ\">\u00b637 In the case at bar, a proper application of <em>Muniz </em>requires that Devlin\u2019s inaccurate recitation of the alphabet and his incorrect counting be suppressed, but that testimony as to the nature of his speech in delivering those responses be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u00b638 I would so hold, and I dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b248-8\">JUSTICES GRAY and HUNT concur in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
