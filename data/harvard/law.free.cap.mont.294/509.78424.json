Brown (Brown) of two counts of sexual intercourse without consent and one count of attempted sexual intercourse without consent. The District Court sentenced Brown to forty years in prison on each of the counts of sexual intercourse without consent and to forty years in prison with twenty years suspended for the count of attempted sexual intercourse without consent. Brown appeals his convictions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b62 Brown raises one issue on appeal, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it denied Brown\u2019s motion to dismiss which was based on the State\u2019s alleged suppression of evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">\u00b64 On September 15,1995, the State charged Brown by Amended Information with two counts of sexual intercourse without consent and one count of attempted sexual intercourse without consent. The Amended Information alleged that Brown raped A.H. (who was his twelve-year-old stepdaughter) twice and attempted to rape her a third time in 1993 and 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">\u00b65 On September 7,1995, Brown filed a list of potential witnesses which included A.H.\u2019s mother, Lori Wessel (Wessel) and Wessel\u2019s address. On September 14,1995, Brown appeared for trial but requested that the trial be postponed because Wessel refused to appear. As a result, the District Court rescheduled the trial and advised Brown \u201cto advise the Court if he needs the Court to compel the witness to attend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">\u00b66 On May 24,1996, Brown filed an amended list of witnesses which again included Wessel and her address. On May 30,1996, prior to the commencement of the jury trial scheduled for that day, the State and Larry Nistler (Nistler), who was Brown\u2019s attorney at the time, met in chambers to settle preliminary matters. Nistler told the District Court that Brown had contacted Wessel and that Brown believed that Wessel would be at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">\u00b67 Brown, however, did not appear for trial. Consequently, the Court revoked Brown\u2019s release on his own recognizance and issued an arrest warrant for Brown. On October 13, 1996, Brown was arrested. Trial was eventually rescheduled for May 8,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">\u00b68 On March 3,1997, Ben Anciaux (Anciaux), who was Brown\u2019s attorney at the time, and Lake County Attorney Robert Long (Long) interviewed A.H. by telephone. A.H. indicated during this interview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>that she knew how to contact Wessel. Anciaux asked A.H. for Wessel\u2019s telephone number. A.H., however, refused to give Wessel\u2019s telephone number to Anciaux. Notwithstanding, Anciaux continued to ask A.H. for Wessel\u2019s number. Consequently, Long told Anciaux to stop asking A.H. about how to contact Wessel. Long also told Anciaux that he would give Anciaux Wessel\u2019s telephone number after the interview. Long explained at the hearing on this matter that A.H. did not want to give Anciaux information concerning Wessel\u2019s whereabouts and that he told Anciaux to stop asking A.H. for that information because he thought that A.H. might hang up the telephone and, thus, end the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\u00b69 Despite his pledge to give Anciaux Wessel\u2019s telephone number after the interview with A.H., Long did not give Anciaux Wessel\u2019s phone number and, on April 14,1997, Long told Anciaux that he would not give Anciaux Wessel\u2019s telephone number. Consequently, on April 15, 1997, Brown filed a motion to compel the State to give him Wessel\u2019s address and telephone number. On April 22,1997, the State filed a response to Brown\u2019s motion to compel wherein it stated that it would not call Wessel as a witness in its case-in-chief, stated that neither it nor A.H. had an address for Wessel, and gave Wessel\u2019s last known telephone number. However, on that same day, Long told Anciaux that Wessel was no longer at the telephone number which the State provided in its response to Brown\u2019s motion to compel. Long stated at the hearing on this matter that he did not include Wessel\u2019s number in the State\u2019s response to Brown\u2019s motion to compel because of Brown\u2019s motion to compel; instead, Long stated that he included Wessel\u2019s number because of Anciaux\u2019s first request for the number and that it was a coincidence that he gave Anciaux Wessel\u2019s number after Brown filed his motion to compel. On April 30,1997, the Court granted Brown\u2019s Motion to Compel and told Brown that he may file a motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"Adb\">\u00b610 On April 30,1997, Brown filed a Motion for Sanctions against the State because of its failure to comply with the court\u2019s discovery orders. Brown asserted that the State violated \u00a7\u00a7 46-15-322(l)(a) and (e), and 46-15-327, MCA, by not providing Wessel\u2019s current address or telephone number. Brown asserted that the State had \u201cled [him] on\u201d and that the State knew that Wessel was a material witness for the defense. Brown argued that the State violated his right to due process of law by withholding Wessel\u2019s telephone number. Brown asserted that he could not prepare or present a defense and, therefore, that the court should dismiss the charges against him or, alternatively, pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>elude the State from calling A.H. as a witness and the State from introducing her statements through other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u00b611 On May 12,1997, the District Court held a hearing on Brown\u2019s motion to impose sanctions on the State. Brown\u2019s half-sister, Yvonne St. Dennis (St. Dennis), testified that she had been friends with Wessel for seven or eight years and that she knew A.H. St. Dennis also testified that Wessel told her that A.H. had accused three or four of Wessel\u2019s other boyfriends of molesting her and that A.H. had also alleged that she had been inappropriately touched by her stepbrother. In addition, St. Dennis testified that Wessel stated that she did not believe A.H.\u2019s accusations and that A.H. had withdrawn her accusation against Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b612 On May 21,1997, the District Court issued an Order which, in effect, denied Brown\u2019s motion for sanctions but stated that the court would favorably consider a six-month continuance so that Brown could locate Wessel. Brown subsequently moved the court for a continuance. On June 12,1997, the District Court granted Brown\u2019s motion for a continuance and ordered that the trial be rescheduled no earlier than January 1, 1998. Thereafter, the District Court scheduled the trial for January 8,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u00b613 On August 11,1997, the District Court issued a Material Witness Warrant for Wessel. On January 7,1998, Brown renewed his motion for sanctions and argued that, since the Material Witness Warrant had not been served upon Wessel, he could not defend himself and that the State violated his right to due process of law by not giving him information regarding Wessel\u2019s whereabouts. The District Court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\u00b614 Trial commenced on January 8, 1998. The jury found Brown guilty on each count charged. On January 21,1998, the District Court sentenced Brown to forty years in prison on each of the counts of sexual intercourse without consent and to forty years in prison with twenty years suspended for the count of attempted sexual intercourse without consent. Brown appeals his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">\u00b6 15 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law. <em>State v. Sweet, </em>1998 MT 30, \u00b6 18, 287 Mont. 336, \u00b6 18, 954 P.2d 1133, \u00b6 18 (citing <em>State v. Hansen (1995), </em>273 Mont. 321, 323, 903 P.2d 194, 195). Our review is plenary; we review the decision to determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusion of law is correct. <em>Sweet, </em>\u00b6 18 <em>(citing Hansen, </em>273 Mont. at 323, 903 P.2d at 195).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">\u00b616 <em>Did the District Court err when it denied Brown\u2019s motion to dismiss which was based on the State\u2019s alleged suppression of evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aph\">\u00b617 Brown maintains that the State violated his state and federal constitutional rights to due process of law by impeding his investigation and efforts in preparing a defense. Brown first asserts that the State violated his right to due process of law by hindering and interfering with his access to and interview with A.H. The State, however, contends that this issue is not properly before this Court because Brown raised it for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b6 18 In response, Brown concedes that his main argument in District Court was that the prosecution interfered with his attempts to contact Wessel. Nevertheless, Brown asserts that the record shows that the prosecutor also controlled the access to and the interview with A.H. Since he generally asserted in District Court that the prosecution hindered his ability to prepare a defense and since this Court\u2019s standard of review is plenary, Brown maintains on appeal that this Court should review all of the evidence which he presented to the District Court regarding whether the State violated his right to due process of law by hindering or interfering with his efforts to prepare a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u00b619 This Court will not address issues or theories raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Schaff </em>1998 MT 104, \u00b6 26, 288 Mont. 421, \u00b6 26, 958 P.2d 682, \u00b6 26 (citing \u00a7\u00a7 46-20-104(2) and -701(2), MCA; and <em>State v. Woods </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 359, 372, 942 P.2d 88, 96-97). See also <em>State v. Robbins, </em>1998 MT 297, \u00b6 56, 292 Mont. 23, \u00b6 56, 971 P.2d 359, \u00b6 56 (citing <em>State v. Huerta </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 245, 260, 947 P.2d 483, 492) (stating that \u201c[c]laims that constitutional rights have been violated cannot, in the absence of plain error, be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\u00b620 In the instant case, the record shows that Brown did not argue in District Court that the State violated his rights to due process of law by either hindering or interfering with his access to or interview with A.H. Instead, the record shows that he only raised the theory that the State violated his rights to due process of law by hindering or interfering his access to Wessel. Thus, although Brown generally raised the issue in District Court of whether the State violated his right to due process of law by interfering with his attempt to prepare a defense, he did not raise the theory in District Court that the State violated his right to due process of law by either hindering or interfering with his access to or interview with A.H. Thus, we will not address the merits of this argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>\u00b621 Moreover, we rej ect Brown\u2019s argument concerning our standard of review because our standard of review only applies to those issues which we review on the merits. See generally Kelly Kunsch, <em>Standard of Review (State and Federal): A Primer, </em>18 Seattle U. L. Rev. 11,13-14 (1994). Hence, even though our standard of review is plenary, it is only plenary over those issues and theories which we review on the merits \u2014 i.e., those issues and theories that were raised in district court. Thus, since Brown did not raise the theory that the State violated his rights to due process of law by hindering or interfering with his access to and interview with A.H. in District Court, we will not address the merits of this theory on appeal even though our standard of review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">\u00b622 In sum, Brown did not raise the theory that the prosecution violated his right to due process of law by either hindering or interfering with his access to or interview with A.H. until this appeal. Consequently, we will not address the merits of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u00b623 Brown next contends that the State violated his rights to due process of law by preventing his defense counsel from obtaining information regarding how to contact Wessel, whom Brown claims was a potential exculpatory witness. The State maintains that it did not withhold exculpatory evidence from Brown and that, even if it was responsible for failing to procure Wessel\u2019s testimony for trial, Wessel\u2019s testimony would not have changed the outcome of the trial. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u00b624 In <em>State v. Patton </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 278, 930 P.2d 635, Patton, who was convicted of deliberate homicide, argued that the State denied him his rights to due process of law and a fair trial by suppressing exculpatory evidence by failing to \u201cpreserve\u201d as a witness a person whom Patton claimed was a suspect. <em>Patton, </em>280 Mont. at 283, 930 P.2d at 638. We noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">[I]t is well settled that while a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to obtain exculpatory evidence and that the denial of such right is a denial of due process, this right is only a personal right to obtain exculpatory evidence. It does not require that police officers take initiative or even assist in procuring evidence on behalf of a defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-8\"><em>Patton, </em>280 Mont. at 284, 930 P.2d at 638-39 (quoting <em>State v. Sadowski </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 63, 79, 805 P.2d 537, 547). We also stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">[Ojnly a deliberate or intentional suppression of exculpatory evidence is a per se violation of due process. To amount to a violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>due process, negligently suppressed evidence must be material and of substantial use, vital to the defense, and exculpatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0v\"><em>Patton, </em>280 Mont. at 285, 930 P.2d at 639 (quoting <em>Sadowski, </em>247 Mont. at 79, 805 P.2d at 547).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">\u00b625 Patton was unable to secure the presence of the person whom he claimed was a suspect at either a deposition or the trial. However, since Patton did not assert that the State took affirmative steps to insure that the person whom Patton claimed was a suspect would be unavailable for trial nor that the State impeded his efforts to investigate and serve this person with a subpoena, we concluded that the State did not suppress exculpatory evidence and, thus, that it did not violate Patton\u2019s rights to due process and a fair trial. <em>Patton, </em>280 Mont. at 285, 930 P.2d at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\u00b626 Likewise, in <em>State v. Sweet, </em>1998 MT 30, 287 Mont. 336, 954 P.2d 1133, Sweet argued that the charges against him should have been dismissed because the State failed to keep track of a confidential informant who may have been able to provide testimony relevant to the defense of entrapment. Sweet argued that the State\u2019s failure to keep track of the confidential informant constituted a negligent suppression of important evidence and violated the district court\u2019s order to produce the confidential informant. <em>Sweet, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u00b627 The State, however, contended that Sweet did not establish that the confidential informant\u2019s testimony would, have raised a reasonable doubt as to Sweet\u2019s guilt. Moreover, the State contended that it did not negligently suppress evidence because it was not in direct control of the confidential informant and because both parties had the power to subpoena him. Finally, the State maintained that the district court\u2019s determination that the confidential informant may have been able to give testimony relevant to the defense of entrapment was not determinative for purposes of a motion to dismiss. <em>Sweet, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"Asr\">\u00b628 In <em>Sweet, </em>we reaffirmed our holding in <em>State v. West </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 83, 826 P.2d 940, that in order to reverse a conviction a defendant must show that the lost or destroyed evidence had exculpatory value which would have changed the outcome of the trial. <em>Sweet, </em>\u00b6 20. We quoted from <em>West </em>wherein we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">[W]hen the State, due to negligence, loss, replacement, or destruction, is unable to produce certain physical evidence in the prosecution of the case, reversal of a conviction is not necessary where the actual objects were not vital to the defense, were not exculpatory in nature, and the result would not have been affected by their introduction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>Sweet, </em>\u00b6 20 (quoting <em>West, </em>252 Mont. at 87, 826 P.2d at 943). We also quoted the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>California v. Trombetta </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 479, 488-89, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 2534, 81 L.Ed.2d 413, 422, for the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\">[W]hatever the duty the Constitution imposes on the States to preserve evidence, that duty must be limited to evidence that might be expected to play a significant role in the suspect\u2019s defense. To meet this standard of constitutional materiality, evidence must both possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><em>Sweet, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>West, </em>252 Mont. at 87, 826 P.2d at 943).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">\u00b629 We then held that Sweet did not establish that the confidential informant\u2019s testimony would have changed the result of the trial or raised a reasonable doubt about his guilt. <em>Sweet, </em>\u00b6 21. We also noted that the confidential informant was neither an employee of the local law enforcement agency nor of the particular county attorney\u2019s office and \u201cthus was not under the direct \u00e1uthority of the State.\u201d <em>Sweet, </em>\u00b6 24. Moreover, we stated that \u201cthe State cannot be held responsible for the unavailability of someone over whom it has no control.\u201d <em>Sweet, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"A8-\">\u00b630  In the instant case, Brown has not shown that Wessel\u2019s testimony would have been exculpatory. In fact, Brown concedes in his reply brief that Wessel\u2019s testimony was only \u201cpotentially\u201d exculpatory. In addition, the State did not take any affirmative steps to insure locating Wessel, it did not impede his efforts to find Wessel. See <em>Patton, </em>280 Mont. at 285, 930 P.2d at 639. Moreover, we agree with the State that Brown did not establish that Wessel\u2019s testimony would have changed the outcome of the trial. Wessel was not a direct witness to any of the alleged criminal activity and it is unclear what her testimony would have been. Finally, the State cannot be held responsible for the unavailability of Wessel, who, like the confidential informant in <em>Sweet, </em>is someone over whom the State had no control. See <em>Sweet, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\u00b631  Accordingly, under the facts of the instant case, we conclude that the State did not violate Brown\u2019s rights to due process of law and, thus, that the State did not engage in conduct that warranted dismissal of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b540-10\">JUSTICES HUNT, REGNIER, GRAY and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
