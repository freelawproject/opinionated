In an Order dated January 27, 1998, we denied two of Boucher\u2019s claims and reserved decision on the remaining claim of ineffective assistance of counsel pending an evidentiary hearing before the District Court. Having reviewed the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions and the supplemental briefs filed by the parties, we now deny Boucher\u2019s remaining claim for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">\u00b62 1. Did the District Court err in limiting the evidentiary hearing to the issue of whether defense counsel failed to formulate a defense by not investigating the victim\u2019s history of false accusations of sexual assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">\u00b63 2. Did the District Court err in denying Boucher\u2019s motion to amend the pleadings?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\u00b64 3. Were the findings and conclusions of the District Court regarding Boucher\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in error?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b65 Upon his plea of guilty to a charge of sexual assault against his thirteen-year-old stepdaughter, the District Court sentenced Boucher to twenty years in the Montana State Prison and designated him as dangerous for purposes of parole. Boucher subsequently filed a post-conviction petition before this Court, asserting three grounds for relief. We denied two of Boucher\u2019s claims and ordered an evidentiary hearing before the District Court on Boucher\u2019s remaining claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel due to counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and formulate a defense based upon the victim\u2019s history of making false accusations of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b66 During the evidentiary hearing before the District Court, Boucher attempted to introduce evidence that his guilty plea was entered as a result of counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance, not only in failing to investigate the victim\u2019s history of false accusations, but also in failing to prepare for the trial generally and in failing to challenge Boucher\u2019s confession in light of the witness\u2019s recantation and Boucher\u2019s assertion that his confession had been coerced. Relying on the instructions set forth in the order of this Court, the District Court disallowed introduction of any evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel not related to counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the victim\u2019s prior history. Boucher moved the District Court to amend his petition to include allegations that counsel was ineffective for the additional reasons set forth above, and this motion was denied. Boucher appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to amend his petition and its findings and conclusions regarding his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">\u00b67 1. Did the District Court err in limiting the evidentiary hearing to the issue of whether defense counsel failed to formulate a defense by not investigating the victim\u2019s history of false accusations of sexual assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">\u00b68 Boucher argues that the District Court erred in refusing his offer of evidence that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in not being properly prepared to go to trial and in failing to challenge Boucher\u2019s confession before the District Court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u00b69 In ordering an evidentiary hearing on Boucher\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">Petitioner also alleges that his attorney did not investigate the victim\u2019s history and did not formulate a defense. He states that an investigation would have revealed that in the past the stepdaughter had falsely accused others of similar conduct. Petitioner\u2019s allegations of error involve the failure of counsel to act. Because they involve omissions rather than commissions, we cannot say that \u201cthe files and records of the case conclusively show that the petitioner is not entitled to relief... .\u201d Section 36-21-201(l)(a), MCA. We thus hold that his allegations are sufficient to require an evidentiary hearing on this issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b610  By its terms, our order limited the scope of the evidentiary hearing to the question presented to us in Boucher\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief. A trial court is not free to ignore the mandate and opinion of the reviewing court, but must proceed in conformity with the views expressed by the appellate court. <em>Haines Pipeline Const., Inc. v. Montana Power Co. </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 282, 290, 876 P.2d 632, 637 (citations omitted). We therefore hold that the District Court did not err in refusing Boucher\u2019s offer of evidence on issues not related to the issue set forth in our order of remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b611 2. Did the District Court err in denying Boucher\u2019s motion to amend the pleadings?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\u00b6 12 Boucher argues that the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motion to amend his petition to include additional claims of ineffective assistance of counsel not asserted in his original pleading because the amendment would not have generated prejudice to the State. The District Court determined that because the matter was before it on remand from this Court, the scope of the court\u2019s inquiry was limited to the issue specified in the order of remand regardless of whether an amendment would generate prejudice to the State. We agree with the reasoning of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">\u00b613  The case <em>sub judice </em>is distinguishable from those cases in which we have held that the district court has the discretion to grant or deny a motion to amend a post-conviction petition, because of the different procedural posture of those cases. Where a post-conviction petition is filed directly before the district court, that court has original jurisdiction over the pleadings and may, in its discretion, grant or deny a motion to amend the petition. <em>See Bone v. State </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 293, 302, 944 P.2d 734, 739; <em>Kills on Top v. State </em>(1996), 279 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Mont. 384, 387, 928 P.2d 182, 186. However, Boucher\u2019s petition was not filed before the district court, it was filed before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b614 InHans <em>v. State </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 379, 410, 942 P.2d 674, 693, a petition for post- conviction relief was filed before this Court and subsequently remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing. Following a review of the district court\u2019s findings and conclusions of law, this Court granted the petitioner leave to amend his petition for the purpose of fully addressing issues raised but not sufficiently briefed in the original petition. However, unlike the petitioner in <em>Hans, </em>Boucher did not request leave of this Court to amend his pleading to include allegations not included in his original petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b615  We hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that it did not have authority to grant Boucher\u2019s motion to amend pleadings on a petition over which this Court has original jurisdiction. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Boucher\u2019s motion to amend his pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b616 3. Were the findings and conclusions of the District Court regarding Boucher\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in error?</p>\n<p id=\"AL_\">\u00b617 Because this Court has original jurisdiction over the post-conviction petition filed by Boucher, we do not review the District Court\u2019s denial of Boucher\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief; instead, we review the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding Boucher\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Hans, </em>283 Mont. at 391, 942 P.2d at 681. Our review of a district court\u2019s findings of fact is whether they are clearly erroneous, and our review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Hans, </em>283 Mont. at 391, 942 P.2d at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u00b618 In considering ineffective assistance of counsel claims in post-conviction proceedings, Montana courts apply the two-pronged test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. <em>See State v. Hagen </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 432, 440, 903 P.2d 1381, 1386. Under that test, the petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Hagen, </em>273 Mont. at 440, 903 P.2d at 1386. In the context of a guilty plea, prejudice is shown where the petitioner can demonstrate that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, he would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. <em>Bishop v. State </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 100, 106, 835 P.2d 732, 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>\u00b619 In its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, the District Court determined that Boucher failed to demonstrate either that trial counsel\u2019s performance had been deficient or that, but for the alleged deficiencies, Boucher would not have pled guilty to sexual assault. The District Court based its conclusions in part upon its determination that Boucher\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing conflicted with his testimony under oath at the change of plea hearing and that therefore his testimony was not credible. A determination of the credibility to be afforded to evidence is exclusively within the province of the finder of fact and will not be disturbed by this Court on appeal. <em>State v. Flack </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 181, 188, 860 P.2d 89, 94.</p>\n<p id=\"AuT\">\u00b620 Our review of the record reveals that there is substantial credible evidence to support the findings of the District Court and that those findings are not otherwise erroneous. Moreover, we hold that the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law are not in error. For these reasons, we affirm the findings and conclusions of the District Court and hold that Boucher\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is without merit. Petition is dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-4\">JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT, TRIEWEILER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
