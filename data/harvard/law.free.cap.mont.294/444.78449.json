The case was tried to a jury in the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County, and a verdict was rendered in favor of the Hunts. At the close of trial, K-Mart filed a motion for new trial on grounds that the District Court improperly allowed expert evidence of hedonic damages. The District Court denied the motion. K-Mart appeals the denial of its motion for new trial and the resulting judgment against it. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b62 The sole issue presented on appeal is whether the District Court erred in admitting expert testimony of Norma\u2019s hedonic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\u00b63 On April 1,1996, the Hunts filed a complaint against K-Mart on a theory of strict products liability resulting from Norma\u2019s fall from an office chair purchased from K-Mart by Norma\u2019s employer. K-mart admitted the chair was defective, but disputed the amount of damages alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">\u00b64 At trial, the Hunts introduced evidence concerning Norma\u2019s damages for loss of enjoyment of life, otherwise known as \u201chedonic damages,\u201d through the tandem testimony of two expert witnesses, one in psychology and another in economics. These experts calculated Norma\u2019s hedonic damages by assessing a percentage of loss suffered by her in each area of her life on a \u201closs of pleasure of life scale\u201d and then inserting those percentages into a formula which translated the losses into actual dollar amounts. According to the expert testimony, the monetary value of Norma\u2019s loss of enjoyment of life was $228,526.</p>\n<p id=\"AYgd\">\u00b65 The jury awarded damages to Norma in the amount of $525,000 and to Harvey in the amount of $34,000. Although the jury\u2019s verdict was presented in a special verdict form, the verdict did not specifically set forth that portion of the total damages representing hedonic damages. After trial, K-Mart filed a motion for new trial on grounds that the expert testimony regarding Norma\u2019s hedonic damages was improperly admitted and resulted in an unfair trial and excessive damages. The District Court denied the motion. K-Mart appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in admitting expert testimony of Norma\u2019s hedonic damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u00b67 The district court has broad discretion to determine whether or not evidence is relevant and admissible pursuant to the Montana Rules of Evidence. We therefore review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Vincelette v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>1998 MT 259, \u00b6 12, 291 Mont. 261, \u00b6 12, 968 P.2d 275, \u00b6 12. Moreover, in order for the erroneous admission of evidence to constitute grounds for a new trial under \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, the error must be so significant as to materially affect the substantial rights of the complaining party. <em>Zeke\u2019s Distr. Co. v. Brown-Forman Corp. </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 272, 278, 779 P.2d 908, 912. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Kneeland v. Luzenac America, Inc., </em>1998 MT 136, \u00b6 54, 289 Mont. 201, \u00b6 54, 961 P.2d 725, \u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b68 In its order denying K-Mart\u2019s motion for new trial, the District Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">Plaintiffs disclosed that Dr. Velin would testify as to psychological aspects of hedonic damages and Dr. Vinso would testify as to economic aspects of hedonic damages. In this Court\u2019s Scheduling Order of August 26,1997, the Court ordered that all pre-trial motions, including motions in limine were to be filed on or before January 2, 1998. Prior to trial, Plaintiffs filed a Statement of Claim which enumerated total specific damages of almost $800,000.00, only $228,000.00 of which were specified as hedonic damages. On April 8, 1998, the Court issued a Jury Trial Preparation Order which stated that the final pre-trial Order was to be submitted to the Court for approval prior to June 1,1998. The pre-trial order identified Drs. Velin and Vinso as two Plaintiff witnesses to be called, and identified exhibits related to the doctors. The Court also stated in its checklist for pre-trial conference and trial that all motions must be set for hearing at least five business days prior to trial. At no time did the Defendant file any motions or objections with respect to the proposed testimony and/or evidence to be presented by Drs. Vinso and Velin. Defendant did not take exception to the testimony and evidence presented by Drs. Vinso and Velin until Dr. Velin was placed on the witness stand the second day of trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b69 The record reflects that when K-Mart objected at trial to the offered testimony, the District Court recessed and heard arguments on the objection in chambers. The basis of K-Mart\u2019s objection was that the experts were not qualified to testify and that hedonic damages in general are not an appropriate subject for expert testimony in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Montana. When the District Court inquired whether K-Mart could supply any legal authority regarding the propriety of such testimony, K-Mart failed to cite any. The District Court overruled K-Mart\u2019s objection and the testimony was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b610 Under Rule 103(a)(1), M.R.Evid., in order to preserve an objection to the admission of evidence for purposes of appeal, the objecting party must make a timely objection and state specific grounds for the objection. To be timely, the objection must be made as soon as the grounds for the objection become apparent. <em>Kizer v. Semitool, Inc. </em>(1991), 251 Mont. 199, 207, 824 P.2d 229, 234 (citing McCormick on Evidence (3d ed. 1984), \u00a7 52 at p. 126). An objection to the introduction of evidence is sufficiently specific if it is accompanied by a reasonably definite statement of the grounds for the objection. <em>Kizer, </em>251 Mont. at 207, 824 P.2d at 234. Failure to make a timely and specific objection constitutes a waiver of the right to claim error on appeal and results in the evidence being treated the same as any other admissible evidence. <em>Kizer, </em>251 Mont. at 207, 824 P.2d at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b611 The United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 592-93, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 2796, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 482, contemplates a hearing to determine admissibility of expert testimony which deals with questionable science in order that the court may make \u201ca preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.\u201d The usual and customary procedure for obtaining such a hearing is the filing of a motion in limine. <em>See Brothers v. Town of Virginia City </em>(1976), 171 Mont. 352, 356-57, 558 P.2d 464, 466-67. A motion in limine is a request for guidance by the court regarding an evidentiary question, which the court may provide at its discretion to aid the parties in formulating trial strategy. <em>Jones v. Stotts </em>(10th Cir. 1995), 59 F.3d 143, 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b612 The grounds upon which K-Mart lodged its objection first became apparent as early as September 9, 1997, when the Hunts disclosed their intention to present expert testimony regarding Norma\u2019s hedonic damages at trial. However, K-Mart failed to file a motion in limine at that time seeking to have this evidence excluded. K-Mart had another opportunity to object to the introduction of this evidence when the District Court issued its pre-trial order listing the witnesses and exhibits to be used at trial, but again, K-Mart did nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>\u00b613 K-Mart finally lodged its objection to the admission of the expert testimony on the second day of trial, and a hearing on the objection was held at that time. At the hearing, the District Court inquired whether either party was aware of any appellate decisions regarding the use of expert testimony on hedonic damages. Counsel for the Hunts responded that \u201cthere have been decisions in other states ... that have gone both ways on the subject.\u201d Counsel for the Hunts argued that the article relied on by the experts in this case had been published by the National Association of Clinical Economists and that both experts were qualified to testify with regard to that portion of the evidence related to their respective fields of expertise. Counsel for the Hunts also argued that because K-Mart had known for at least a year prior to trial of the Hunts\u2019 intention to introduce this testimony, K-Mart\u2019s objection was not timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b614 K-Mart did not dispute that it was aware of the Hunts\u2019 intention to use expert testimony to demonstrate the amount of Norma\u2019s hedonic damages, or that the District Court\u2019s scheduling order had required all motions in limine to have been filed by January 1998. K-Mart did not cite any legal authority to the District Court in support of its position that this kind of testimony is not allowable in the courts of Montana or elsewhere and, when asked whether it was aware of any professional articles attacking the approach used by Drs. Velin and Vinso, K-Mart responded, \u201cNothing that directly attacks it; no, Judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b615  We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing expert testimony regarding Norma\u2019s hedonic damages due to the lack of a timely and specific objection to the introduction of this evidence at trial. Moreover, because the District Court did not err in allowing this evidence in the first instance, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying K-Mart\u2019s motion for new trial on the grounds that the admission of the evidence resulted in an unfair trial and excessive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b472-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
