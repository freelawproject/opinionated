The District Court awarded summary judgment in favor of the defendants. We reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it concluded that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was Buerkley\u2019s exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">\u00b63 Trevor Buerkley was hired by Parkview Convalescent Care as a maintenance worker on August 9,1993. Prior to the start of his employment, Buerkley was not asked to submit an employment application, nor was he required to comply with any of Parkview\u2019s other existing hiring procedures. Until the time of his injury, two months after he started work at Parkview, Buerkley worked a normal forty-hour week but did not use a time clock as other employees did, his paycheck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>was not drawn from Parkview\u2019s payroll account, and no payroll deductions were taken from his paycheck. In other words, Parkview employed Buerkley \u201cunder the table.\u201d Buerkley was not held out by Parkview to others as its employee. Furthermore, Buerkley was not reported as an employee on the payroll reports provided to the Montana Health Network\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance Trust by which Parkview\u2019s employees were provided with coverage for work-related injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b64 Aspen Meadows is a limited partnership which operates a retirement community. It is a separate business entity; however, it has common principals with Parkview. The two homes occasionally shared personnel and other resources. On October 8, 1993, Aspen\u2019s maintenance director contacted the maintenance director for Parkview and asked him to send Buerkley to Aspen with one of Parkview\u2019s snowblowers to clear the remains of an early snow from Aspen\u2019s parking lot. While Buerkley was operating the snowblower at Aspen, the teeth of the machine became blocked with heavy, wet snow. Buerkley inserted his left hand into the snowblower to clear the blockage and seriously injured his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b65 Sometime after the accident, Buerkley completed an employment application and portions of other employee paperwork for both Parkview and Aspen. Both applications were back-dated to reflect an employment date for Buerkley of September 27, 1993, prior to the date of his injury. Beginning October 14,1993, Buerkley\u2019s paychecks began to reflect deductions for workers\u2019 compensation, Medicare, and FICA; however, they were still drawn on an account which was not Parkview\u2019s regular payroll account. Beginning October 25, 1993, Buerkley began using Parkview\u2019s time clock to record his hours worked. After the accident, Buerkley was also issued at least one paycheck by Aspen, despite the fact that the morning he was injured was the only time he performed any labor at Aspen. The paycheck from Aspen was also drawn on an account different from its regular payroll account.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b66 On December 8,1993, Aspen filed an \u201cEmployer\u2019s First Report of Notice\u201d with Montana Health Network. Compensation Adjusters, Inc. was authorized by contract to adjust MHN claims and to pay all benefits. It determined that Buerkley was entitled to benefits and paid all medical claims and compensation benefits. Compensation Adjusters also made Buerkley a settlement offer for a release of any future permanent partial disability claim. Buerkley rejected the set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>tlement offer and brought suit for damages in District Court. Compensation Adjusters discovered that Buerkley\u2019s employment records had been falsified after it received notice of the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err when it concluded that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was Buerkley\u2019s exclusive remedy?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b68 Our standard of review on appeal from summary judgment orders is de novo. See <em>Motaire v. Northern Montana Joint Refuse Disposal Dist. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156; <em>Mead v. M.S.B., Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 465, 470, 872 P.2d 782, 785. We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment to determine whether it was correctly decided pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., which provides that summary judgment is appropriate when where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Moreover, evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, see <em>Bowen v. McDonald </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 193, 199, 915 P.2d 201, 205, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the party opposing the motion. <em>See Porter v. Galarneau </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 174, 179, 911 P.2d 1143, 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b69 On appeal, Buerkley contends that an employer who has not properly complied with the requirements of \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA (1993), is an \u201cuninsured employer\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-501, MCA (1993), and, therefore, subject to the civil remedies provided pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-508 and -515, MCA (1993), and should not, as a matter of law and public policy, be allowed to rely on the exclusive remedy provision found at \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u00b610 The defendants argued, and the District Court agreed, that whether or not Buerkley\u2019s employment was reported to the trust by which they were self-insured, they elected coverage under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and, therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was Buerkley\u2019s exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">\u00b611 Section 39-71-411, MCA (1993), provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">For all employments covered under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act or for which an election has been made for coverage under this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are exclusive. Except as provided in part 5 of this chapter for uninsured employers and except as otherwise provided in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, an employer is not subject to any liability whatever for the death of or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>personal injury to an employee covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The defendants contend that because they were covered under the Act the provisions of the Act are exclusive. However, \u00a7 -411 specifically provides an exception to the rule of exclusivity where provided in part 5 for uninsured employers. Uninsured employers are defined at \u00a7 39-71-501, MCA(1993), as follows: \u201cFor the purposes of39-71-501 through 39-71-511 and 39-71-515 through 39-71-520, \u2018uninsured employer\u2019 means an employer who has not <em>properly </em>complied with the provisions of 39-71-401.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b612 Section 39-71-401, MCA, requires any employer of any employee to enroll in and be bound by the provisions of Compensation Plan No. 1, 2, or 3. Defendants contend that they did enroll in and were bound by Compensation Plan No. 1 and, therefore, they complied with \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA. However, \u00a7 -501 defines an uninsured employer as one who has <em>\u201cnotproperly </em>complied\u201d with the enrollment obligations. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b613  In this case, Bill McLain, who was a general partner in Parkview Convalescent Care at the time of Buerkley\u2019s employment, testified that Parkview was insured against workers\u2019 compensation by the Montana Health Network, which calculated premiums based on the previous year\u2019s payroll. He testified that it would have been a breach of the agreement with Montana Health Network to omit an employee from that payroll report. From this testimony, we conclude that a condition of Parkview\u2019s enrollment in Plan No. 1 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was the accurate and honest identification of its employees on a quarterly basis, and that by deleting Buerkley\u2019s name from that payroll report, defendants had not properly complied with the enrollment requirement of \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA, and, therefore, were an \u201cuninsured employer\u201d for purposes of part 5 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u00b614 Section 39-71-508, MCA (1993), provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1U-\">An employee who suffers an injury arising out of and in the course of employment while working for an uninsured employer as defined in 39-71-501... may pursue all remedies concurrently, including but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">(1) a claim for benefits from the uninsured employers\u2019 fund;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">(2) a damage action against the employer in accordance with 39-71-509;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>(3) an independent action against an employer as provided in 39-71-515; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">(4) any other civil remedy provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b615 Section 39-71-515, MCA(1993), provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtqZ\">(1) An injured employee or the employee\u2019s beneficiaries have an independent cause of action against an uninsured employer for failure to be enrolled in a compensation plan as required by this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">(4) The amount of recoverable damages in such an action is the amount of compensation that the employee would have received had the employer been properly enrolled under compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">(5) A plaintiff who prevails in an action brought under this section is entitled to recover reasonable costs and attorney fees incurred in the action, in addition to his damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b616 The purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is to effectuate a compromise between industry and labor. \u201c[W]orkers received guaranteed no-fault recovery, and industry was relieved of the possibility of large ... recoveries in the tort system.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 67, 74, 915 P.2d 175, 179. Workers\u2019 compensation statutes are often described as a <em>quid pro quo </em>exchange of rights and remedies. <em>See </em>2A Arthur Larson, The Law of Workman\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 65.40 (perm. ed. rev. vol. 1998). We have held that where injuries are outside the scope of those covered by the Act, there is no <em>quid pro quo </em>and, therefore, the exclusive remedy is unavailable as a defense to tort claims. <em>See Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 76, 915 P.2d at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\u00b6 17  Similarly, the requisite <em>quid pro quo </em>is absent when an employer has deliberately avoided the cost of insuring <em>an </em>employee by failing to acknowledge his existence in its payroll records. In such cases, an employer should not be able to take refuge behind the exclusive remedy provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">\u00b618  Therefore, we conclude, based on the plain language of the Act and its historical purpose, that for the purpose of those remedies provided in part 5 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Buerkley\u2019s employer at the time of his injury was uninsured as defined in \u00a7 39-71-501, MCA (1993), and the District Court erred by holding otherwise. Our holding is limited to the facts in this case and does not ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>dress an insurer\u2019s obligation to an employee of an employer who has not fully complied with the Act or its insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b619 The judgment of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b293-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT, LEAPHART, REGNIER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
