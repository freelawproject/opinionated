We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b62 Winchester raises one issue on appeal, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in deciding that Winchester\u2019s unfair labor practice claims were subject to the final and binding arbitration clause in the collective bargaining agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\u00b64 Winchester was employed by Mountain Line, an urban transportation district in Missoula, as a bus driver. Winchester was a member of Teamsters Union Local No. 2 (Teamsters) and served as the Teamsters\u2019 shop steward at Mountain Line. The employment relationship between Winchester and Mountain Line was governed by a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the Teamsters and Mountain Line which was effective from June 2,1993, to June 30,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\u00b65 On July 16,1993, Mountain Line suspended Winchester for allegedly violating Mountain Line\u2019s bus drivers\u2019 handbook by stopping a bus in the middle of an intersection and instructing a passenger to get off the bus and retrieve a hatchet which was laying on the street. On August 6,1993, Mountain Line held a pre-termination hearing regarding the incident that gave rise to Winchester\u2019s suspension. Later that August, Mountain Line discharged Winchester, retroactive to July 16, 1993, for his alleged violation of the bus drivers\u2019 handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"AYt\">\u00b66 On September 15,1993, a grievance hearing was held regarding Winchester\u2019s discharge. Mountain Line upheld Winchester\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\u00b67 On September 29,1993, the Teamsters asked Mountain Line to arbitrate the dispute over the reasons underlying Winchester\u2019s discharge pursuant to the arbitration clause in the CBA. On the following day, September 30,1993, Winchester filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry, Board of Personnel Appeals (Board). Winchester\u2019s charge alleged that Mountain Line first suspended him and then discharged him for soliciting other employees to attend a meeting at his house to discuss the decertification process required to change union representation and because he was the shop steward. Therefore, Winchester as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>serted that Mountain Line committed unfair labor practices in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 39-3-201 and 39-31-401(1), (2), and (4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b68 On October 10,1993, Mountain Line responded to Winchester\u2019s charge. Mountain Line asserted that it discharged Winchester for just cause pursuant to the CBA. Mountain Line also pointed out that the Teamsters had requested that the dispute be resolved through the arbitration procedure set out in the CBA. Hence, Mountain Line urged the Board to defer to the arbitration procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b69 On October 25,1993, the Board\u2019s investigator issued a Recommended Order wherein she recommended that Winchester\u2019s charge be dismissed without prejudice to any party and without deciding the merits of the charge. The investigator recommended that the Board defer to the already scheduled arbitration pursuant to the \u201cpre-arbitral deferral\u201d policy which the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) set out in <em>Collyer Insulated Wire </em>(1971), 192 N.L.R.B. 837, 77 L.R.R.M. 1931, and which the Board adopted in <em>William Converse v. Anaconda Deer Lodge County, </em>ULP 43-81 (April 1982) and <em>James Forseman v. Anaconda Deer Lodge County, </em>ULP 44-81 (April 1982). Notwithstanding, the investigator recommended that the Board retain jurisdiction over the matter so that the Board could hear the case if the dispute was not resolved within a reasonable time pursuant to the arbitration procedure set out in the CBA, if the arbitral procedure was not fair, or if the arbitrators reached a result which was repugnant to the public policy considerations contained in the Collective Bargaining for Public Employees Act, \u00a7\u00a7 39-31-101 et seq., MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u00b610 Winchester filed objections to the investigator\u2019s Recommended Order on November 4,1993. Winchester asserted that deferring to arbitration under <em>Collyer </em>was improper because the CBA stated that any alleged violation of federal or state law was not subject to the arbitration procedure. Since Winchester objected to the investigator\u2019s Recommended Order, the Board transferred the case to the Department of Labor\u2019s Hearings Bureau on December 22,1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u00b6 11 Despite Winchester\u2019s obj ection to the investigator\u2019s recommendation to defer the arbitration procedure, an arbitration hearing was held on December 1,1993. Winchester did not attend the arbitration hearing. The arbitrators upheld Mountain Line\u2019s decision to discharge Winchester.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u00b612 Thereafter, on November 25,1994, Mountain Line filed a motion to dismiss Winchester\u2019s unfair labor practice charge on the grounds that the dispute was resolved at the arbitration hearing. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>December 13, 1994, Winchester responded to Mountain Line\u2019s motion to dismiss by reiterating that the CBA specifically excluded claims made under state statutes from the arbitration. Hence, Winchester argued that deferral to the arbitration procedure under <em>Collyer </em>was improper, that the arbitration hearing violated the CBA and, therefore, that the arbiters\u2019 decision was not binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b613 On July 27,1995, a hearings officer issued an Order on behalf of the Board which denied Mountain Line\u2019s motion to dismiss. The hearings officer ruled that Winchester\u2019s charge alleged that Mountain Line violated the Collective Bargaining for Public Employees Act, and not the CBA. Consequently, the hearings officer ruled that deferral to arbitration under <em>Collyer </em>was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b6 14 On August 16,1995, Mountain Line filed objections to the hearings officer\u2019s Order. Mountain Line maintained that deferring to the arbitration procedure was proper and, in effect, that the hearings officer erred in denying its motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b615 On September 27,1995, the Board held a hearing on Mountain\u2019s Line\u2019s objections to the hearings officer\u2019s Order which denied its motion to dismiss. On October 2,1995, the Board issued its Final Order wherein it determined that the hearings officer erred in denying Mountain Line\u2019s motion to dismiss. The Board stated that the basis for Winchester\u2019s unfair labor practice charge was discrimination because of union activities. Since the CBA prohibited discrimination because of union membership, the Board ruled that Winchester\u2019s unfair labor practice charge was covered by the CBA and, therefore, that it was subject to the grievance procedure set out in the CBA which culminated in final and binding arbitration. Thus, the Board ruled that deferral to the arbitration under <em>Collyer </em>was proper. Accordingly, the Board reversed the hearings examiner\u2019s decision and dismissed Winchester\u2019s unfair labor practice charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\u00b616 Winchester filed a Petition for Judicial Review on October 18, 1995. After both parties briefed the issues, the District Court issued an Opinion and Order wherein the court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision to dismiss Winchester\u2019s unfair labor practice charge. Winchester appeals from this Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">\u00b617 The issue in the instant case concerns an interpretation of a contract, the CBA. The construction and interpretation of a contract is a question of law for the court to decide. <em>Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34 (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Klawitter v. Dettmann </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 275, 281, 886 P.2d 416, 420.) We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Reichle v. Anderson </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 384, 387-88, 943 P.2d 1324, 1326 (citing <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b618 <em>Did the District Court err in deciding that Winchester\u2019s unfair labor practice claims were subject to the binding arbitration clause in the collective bargaining agreement?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u00b619 Winchester asserts that, since the CBA specifically exempted from arbitration alleged violations of federal and state law, <em>Collyer </em>is inapplicable and, hence, that the Board improperly deferred to the grievance procedure in the CBA which culminated in final and binding arbitration. Mountain Line maintains that <em>Collyer </em>is applicable and that the Board properly deferred to arbitration under <em>Collyer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AcD\">\u00b620 In <em>Collyer, </em>the NLRB ruled that it would defer to an arbitration procedure established by a collective bargaining agreement before it would consider an unfair labor practice charge if certain conditions were met.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The NLRB ruled that deferment was appropriate in <em>Collyer </em>because: (1) there was a long-standing bargaining relationship between the parties; (2) there was no enmity by the employer toward the employee\u2019s exercise of protected rights; (3) the employer manifested a willingness to arbitrate; (4) the arbitration clause in the collective bargaining agreement was sufficiently broad to cover the dispute at issue; and (5) the collective bargaining agreement and its meaning lay at the center of the dispute and was thus \u201ceminently well suited to resolution by arbitration.\u201d <em>Collyer, </em>192 N.L.R.B. at 842, 77 L.R.R.M. at 1936. See also <em>Young v. City of Great Falls </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 349, 353, 646 P.2d 512, 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\u00b621 After a series of shifts in policy, the NLRB announced an extension to the policy set out in <em>Collyer </em>in <em>United Technologies Corp. </em>(1984), 268 N.L.R.B. 557, 115 L.R.R.M. 1049. In <em>United Technologies, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the NLRB held that it was proper to defer to an arbitration procedure established by a collective bargaining agreement even though the dispute arose under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and did not necessarily require construction of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. In so holding, the NLRB explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\">It is fundamental to the concept of collective bargaining that the parties to a collective-bargaining agreement are bound by the terms of their contract. Where an employer and a union have voluntarily elected to create dispute resolution machinery culminating in final and binding arbitration, it is contrary to the basic principles of the [National Labor Relations] Act for the [National Labor Relations B]oard to jump into the fray prior to an honest attempt by the parties to resolve their disputes through that machinery. For dispute resolution under the grievance-arbitration process is as much a part of collective bargaining as the act of negotiating the contract. In our view, the statutory purpose of encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining is ill-served by permitting the parties to ignore their agreement and to petition this Board in the first instance for remedial relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\"><em>United Technologies, </em>268 N.L.R.B. at 559, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1051 (footnote omitted). Thus, since the alleged violation of the NLRA was \u201cclearly cognizable under the broad grievance-arbitration provision of the... collective-bargaining agreement,\u201d the NLRB decided to defer the case to arbitration. <em>United Technologies, </em>268 N.L.R.B. at 560, 115 L.R.R.M. at 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u00b622 Likewise, in <em>Hammontree v. National Labor Relations Board </em>(D.C. Cir. 1991), 925 F.2d 1486, (en banc), the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals considered a challenge to a NLRB order that required the complainant to exhaust grievance remedies established by a collective bargaining agreement before the NLRB considered his unfair labor practice complaint. The complainant <em>in Hammontree </em>argued that the NLRB\u2019s deferment authority was limited by \u00a7 203(d) of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), which provides that \u201c[f]inal adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties is declared to be the desirable method for settlement of grievance disputes <em>arising over the application or interpretation </em>of an existing collective-bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Hammontree, </em>925 F.2d at 1493 (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 173(d)) (emphasis added by the court). The complainant maintained that \u00a7 203(d) of the LMRA authorized deferment only in cases \u201carising over\u201d interpretation of a collective bargaining agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ment and argued that his discrimination claim under \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the NLRA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not \u201carise over\u201d contract interpretation even though the collective bargaining agreement contained an anti-discrimination provision which paralleled \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the NLRA. <em>Hammontree, </em>925 F.2d at 1493. Thus, since his discrim-ination claim was actionable not only under \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the NLRA but also under the collective bargaining agreement which prohibited \u201cdiscrimination against any employee because of Union membership or activities\u201d and \u201cdiscriminatory acts prohibited by law,\u201d the complainant contended that his \u201cclaim [wa]s simply one that [arose] under a statutory provision that happens to be parallel to a claim that could be advanced under the contract,\u201d and, therefore, that his \u201cclaim does not rest upon a construction of the [collective bargaining agreement].\u201d <em>Hammontree, </em>925 F.2d at 1493-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u00b623 Notwithstanding, the court rejected the complainant\u2019s argument and pointed out that his claim did not arise either under the NLRA or under the collective bargaining agreement; rather, his claim arose under both. <em>Hammontree, </em>925 F.2d at 1494 (citing <em>Alexander v. Gardner Denver Co. </em>(1974), 415 U.S. 36, 52, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 1021, 39 L.Ed.2d 147). Thus, the court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">Hammontree cannot nullify his contractual claim simply by choosing to pursue his statutory claim. Such an interpretation of the law would severely undermine Congress\u2019 \u2018decided preference for private settlement of labor disputes without the intervention of government\u2019 as reflected in \u00a7 203(d). If a party could unilaterally release itself from a contractual pledge to submit complaints to arbitration simply because it had a parallel claim under the statute, then the pro-private dispute resolution policies of \u00a7 203(d) would be substantially abrogated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\"><em>Hammontree, </em>925 F.2d at 1494 (quoting <em>United Paperworkers International Union v. Misco, Inc. </em>(1987), 484 U.S. 29, 37, 108 S.Ct. 364, 370, 98 L.Ed.2d 286)(footnote omitted). Therefore, the court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>that the complainant\u2019s claim arose under the collective bargaining agreement and held that \u00a7 203(d) did not preclude the NLRB from deferring to the grievance procedure set out in the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. <em>Hammontree, </em>925 F.2d at 1494.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b624 In <em>Small v. McRae </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 497, 651 F.2d 982, the public employee made an argument similar to the argument made by the complainant in <em>Hammontree. </em>In <em>Small, </em>the employee argued that the grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement were only applicable to resolve contractual disputes. <em>Small, </em>200 Mont. at 505, 651 P.2d at 987. The employee argued that his claim \u201cdid not center on a contractual dispute but, rather, on a violation of a constitutionally protected right.\u201d <em>Small, </em>200 Mont. at 505, 651 P.2d at 987. In considering the employee\u2019s argument, this Court stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">Only in those cases where it is <em>certain </em>that the arbitration clause contained in a collective bargaining agreement is not susceptible to an interpretation that covers the dispute is an employee entitled to sidestep the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX8\"><em>Small, </em>200 Mont. at 504, 651 P.2d at 986 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Torrington Company v. Metal Products Workers Union Local 1645 </em>(2nd Cir. 1966), 362 F.2d 677).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b625 In the instant case, Article VII of the CBA provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\n<em>Discrimination</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\"><em>Section 7.1: </em>There shall be no coercion, intimidation, or discrimination on the part of either the District or the Union, or their respective agents, officers, or members against any employee covered by this Agreement for reasons of age, race, sex, color, religious or political beliefs, national origin, marital status, physical handicap, <em>Union membership </em>or non-membership, or any other group or classes protected by State or Federal law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\"><em>Section 7.2\\ </em>Any <em>alleged </em>violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or other applicable Federal or State statutes <em>shall be processed through the appropriate Federal and State agency(s) and will not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures as set forth in Articles 12 and 13.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">\u00b626 Winchester\u2019s unfair labor practice charge alleged that Mountain Line discharged him for soliciting other employees to attend a meeting to discuss decertifying the union and because he was the shop steward. Hence, Winchester claimed that Mountain Line violated \u00a7 39-31-201, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Public employees shall have and shall be protected in the exercise of the right of self-organization, to form, join, or assist any labor organization, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing on questions of wages, hours, fringe benefits, and other conditions of employment, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection free from interference, restraint, or coercion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1-\">Winchester also claimed that Mountain Line committed unfair labor practices under \u00a7 39-31-401, MCA, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">It is an unfair labor practice for a public employer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">(1) interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in 39-31-201;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">(2) dominate, interfere, or assist in the formation or administration of any labor organization; however, subject to rules adopted by the board under 39-31-104, an employer is not prohibited from permitting employees to confer with him during working hours without loss of time or pay;... [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">(4) discharge or otherwise discriminate against an employee because he has signed or filed an affidavit, petition, or complaint or given any information or testimony under this chapter ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Thus, since his unfair labor practice charge alleged that Mountain Line violated \u00a7\u00a7 39-31-201 and 39-31-401, MCA, Winchester argues that, pursuant to the plain language in Section 7.2 of the CBA, his charge is not subject to the CBA\u2019s grievance and arbitration procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">\u00b627 Mountain Line, however, contends that Winchester\u2019s allegations are \u201ccovered by\u201d Section 7.1 of the CBA even though he generally alleged that Mountain Line violated \u00a7\u00a7 39-31-201 and 39-31-401, MCA. In effect, Mountain Line asserts that, as in <em>United Technologies </em>and <em>Hammontree, </em>Section 7.1 of the CBA encompassed the allegations in Winchester\u2019s unfair labor practice charge and paralleled the claims that he advanced in his unfair labor practice charge. Therefore, Mountain Line maintains that the Board properly deferred to the arbitration procedure set out in the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">\u00b628 Despite Mountain Line\u2019s argument, the plain, ordinary language in Section 7.2 of the CBA shows that the Board should not have deferred to the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in the CBA. <em>See Hughes v. Blankenship </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 150, 154, 879 P.2d 685, 687 (citing <em>National Labor Relations Board v. Superior Forwarding, Inc. </em>(8th Cir. 1985), 762 F.2d 695, 697) (statingthat \u201c[c]ourts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>interpret contractual provisions according to the plain, ordinary language used by the parties.\u201d). The plain language of Section 7.2 of the CBA excludes \u201cany <em>alleged </em>violation of... state statutes ...\u201d from the CBA\u2019s grievance and arbitration procedures. (Emphasis added.) Here, Winchester <em>alleged </em>that Mountain Line violated \u00a7\u00a7 39-31-201 and 39-31-401, MCA. Thus, it is \u201ccertain,\u201d under Section 7.2 of the CBA, that Winchester\u2019s unfair labor practices charge, which alleged that Mountain Line violated \u00a7\u00a7 39-31-201 and 39-31-401, MCA, was not subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions in the CBA. See <em>Small, </em>200 Mont. at 504, 651 P.2d at 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u00b629  In sum, even if Winchester\u2019s charge was covered by Section 7.1 of the CBA, the plain language in Section 7.2 of the CBA excludes his unfair labor practice charge from the grievance and arbitration procedure set out in the CBA. Accordingly, the District Court erred in ruling that the Board properly deferred to the arbitration procedure in the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u00b630 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b550-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT, LEAPHART, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\">.
