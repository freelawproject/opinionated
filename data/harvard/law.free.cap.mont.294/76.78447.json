Barnes (Barnes) filed suit against the City of Thompson Falls (Thompson Falls) in the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Sanders County, alleging negligence and nuisance in relation to a 1996 flood that damaged her home. The District Court denied, over objection, Barnes\u2019 request to instruct the jury on nuisance. Barnes appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in refusing Barnes\u2019 proposed jury instructions on nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b63 In 1978, Barnes purchased a duplex in Thompson Falls. The duplex was built in a low spot in Thompson Falls, and the basement door was virtually level with the alley behind the house. As a result, runoff from higher ground tended to drain towards Barnes\u2019 property and pool in the alley outside her basement door. Within six months of moving in, Barnes began to experience flooding problems in the basement of her duplex whenever significant rainfall occurred. At that time, Thompson Falls did not have a municipal storm sewer system.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b64 To mitigate future flooding, Barnes constructed a small retaining wall in front of the basement door around 1980. Thompson Falls established a municipal sewer system in the early 1980s and, at that time, installed a storm drain in the alley behind Barnes\u2019 home. For a period of time, these measures prevented the flooding of Barnes\u2019 basement. However, regraveling of the alley over the years by Thompson Falls resulted in the height of the alley\u2019s surface rising, thereby lessening the margin of flood protection afforded by Barnes\u2019 retaining wall. Moreover, Barnes\u2019 flooding problem was noticeably exacerbated when the State of Montana decided to expand Highway 200 through Thompson Falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b65 Due to the increased runoff, Barnes experienced flooding from a 1993 rainstorm more severe than anything' she had previously endured. Barnes thus filed a complaint with Thompson Falls. In response, Thompson Falls replaced the existing storm drain line in the alley with a larger diameter line. Thompson Falls also chip-sealed the alley to help prevent sand and gravel from clogging the storm drain line.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b66 Despite these precautionary measures, on July 30,1996, a brief but \u201cvery heavy rainstorm\u201d in Thompson Falls caused the storm drain line to back-up. As a result, runoff pooled in the alley, flowed over Barnes\u2019 retaining wall, and flooded the basement of her duplex with three inches of caustic sludge. Barnes therefore filed suit against Thompson Falls, alleging that the city\u2019s sewer and storm drain system was negligently designed and maintained, and that the system also constituted a private nuisance. Thompson Falls argued in response that the flooding that occurred at Barnes\u2019 home in July of 1996 was not caused by the city\u2019s negligence, and that the city could not be held accountable under Barnes\u2019 theory of nuisance because its sewer and storm drain system was statutorily authorized. The District Court agreed with Thompson Falls and, accordingly, denied Barnes\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>request to instruct the jury on nuisance. Thus, the jury decided the case solely on the question of whether Thompson Falls was negligent, and found the city not liable. Other facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b67 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in refusing Barnes\u2019 proposed jury instructions on nuisance?</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b68 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s refusal to give proffered jury instructions is whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Harwood v. Glacier Elec. Co-op., Inc. </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 481, 487, 949 P.2d 651, 655. A trial court is imbued with broad discretion to determine whether or not it will give a proposed instruction to the jury, and this Court will not overturn a district court on the basis of alleged instructional errors absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>Savik v. Entech, Inc. </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 152, 158, 923 P.2d 1091, 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u00b69 Barnes contends that the District Court abused its discretion when it ruled that she could not prevail on a claim of nuisance absent proof of negligence. Under the facts presented by this case, the District Court determined that Barnes\u2019 proposed jury instructions on nuisance were not an accurate statement of Montana law pursuant to \u00a7 27-30-101, MCA, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">(1) Anything which is injurious to health, indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, ... is a nuisance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\"><em>(2) Nothing which is done or maintained under the express authority of a statute can be deemed a nuisance. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Section 27-30-101(1), (2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">\u00b610 As Thompson Falls points out, the nuisance alleged by Barnes is the city\u2019s sewer and storm drain system, which is specifically authorized by statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-13-4301, MCA (statutory authorization for a city or town to establish sewage and water systems). Accordingly, Thompson Falls argues that since the city\u2019s storm drain system is expressly authorized by statute, Barnes can only prevail on her theory of nuisance against Thompson Falls by proving negligence. We agree. \u00b611 Barnes relies upon <em>Wilhelm v. City of Great Falls </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 251, 732 P.2d 1315, wherein this Court held, in part, that \u201c[u]nder the statutory definition of nuisance at \u00a7 27-30-101, MCA, a nuisance can exist without negligence.\u201d <em>Wilhelm, </em>225 Mont. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>261-62, 732 P.2d at 1322. Pursuant to this holding, Barnes requested that the District Court instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">[Barnes] is not required to prove under this theory [of nuisance] that [Thompson Falls] acted negligently. Negligence of [Thompson Falls] in this case is immaterial in determining liability and is a separate claim from nuisance. A nuisance can exist without negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b612 <em>Wilhelm </em>involved a nuisance action arising out a city\u2019s alleged negligent operation of a statutorily authorized landfill. Instruction 21 in <em>Wilhelm </em>instructed the jury that it could find a nuisance, notwithstanding the fact that the landfill was statutorily authorized, if it found that the landfill was either \u201c \u2018wholly unauthorized\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018negligently done.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Wilhelm, </em>225 Mont. at 261, 732 P.2d at 1321. Following trial, the jury returned a verdict that the city\u2019s landfill constituted a nuisance, but that the nuisance was not caused by the city\u2019s negligence. According to this verdict, the District Court entered judgment for the city. <em>See Wilhelm, </em>225 Mont. at 255, 732 P.2d at 1317. The plaintiffs in <em>Wilhelm </em>appealed and this Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b613 In rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments on appeal, this Court held that Instruction 21 in <em>Wilhelm </em>was an accurate statement of Montana law because it allowed the jury \u201cto find a nuisance if the act done was wholly unauthorized <em>or </em>negligently done.\u201d <em>Wilhelm, </em>225 Mont. at 261, 732 P.2d at 1322. Thus, since the landfill in question was statutorily authorized, the plaintiffs in <em>Wilhelm, </em>in order to prevail, were required to prove that the acts complained of were <em>either </em>wholly outside of the statutory authorization <em>or </em>so negligently performed as to constitute a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b614 Regrettably, as this case illustrates, the <em>Wilhelm </em>decision is not as clear as it should have been. The lack of clarity in <em>Wilhelm </em>is due in large part to this Court\u2019s failure to expressly discuss how the first two subsections of \u00a7 27-30-101, MCA, interface with each other under general principles of nuisance law. We determine that although this Court reached the right result in <em>Wilhelm, </em>our analysis of the jury instructions in that case without an express discussion of \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA, is likely to breed more confusion than clarity. Accordingly, we take this opportunity to clarify the law of nuisance in Montana as it relates to statutorily authorized activities or facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"ArR\">\u00b615 This Court in <em>Wilhelm, </em>without expressly referring to \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA, implicitly recognized the distinction between an absolute nuisance, in which negligence is immaterial, and a qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>nuisance, which is predicated upon negligence. <em>See Wilhelm, </em>225 Mont. at 256, 732 P.2d at 1318, <em>quoting </em>58 Am. Jur. <em>2d Nuisances </em>\u00a7 221 (1971) (holding that, \u201c \u2018where a nuisance has its origin in negligence, as distinguished from an absolute nuisance,\u2019 \u201d contributory negligence can constitute a defense). This distinction is crucial to understanding both the proper application of \u00a7 27-30-101, MCA, as well as the result reached in <em>Wilhelm</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b616  A nuisance action maybe based upon conduct of a defendant that is either intentional, negligent, reckless, or ultrahazardous. Thus, \u201cnegligence is merely one type of conduct upon which liability for nuisance may be based.\u201d 58 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Nuisances </em>\u00a7 9 (1989) (footnote omitted). This was the case in <em>Wilhelm, </em>where the plaintiffs claimed \u201cthat the nuisance ha[d] its origins in [the city\u2019s] negligence.\u201d <em>Wilhelm, </em>225 Mont. at 256, 732 P.2d at 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b6 17  In general, nuisances may be classified as either a nuisance <em>per se </em>or at law, or as a nuisance <em>per accidens </em>or in fact. A nuisance <em>per se </em>or at law is an inherently injurious act, occupation, or structure that is a nuisance at all times and under any circumstances, without regard to location or surroundings, while a nuisance <em>per accidens </em>or in fact is one which becomes a nuisance by virtue of circumstances and surroundings. <em>See </em>66 C.J.S. <em>Nuisances </em>\u00a7 5 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b618  In turn, nuisances may be classified as either absolute or qualified. An absolute nuisance is often referred to as the same thing as a nuisance <em>per se, </em>and is defined as a nuisance, \u201cthe substance ... of which is not negligence, which obviously exposes another to probable injury.\u201d 66 C. J.S. <em>Nuisances </em>\u00a7 3 (1998) (footnote omitted). A qualified nuisance, on the other hand, is a \u201cnuisance dependent on negligence [that] consists of anything lawfully but so negligently or carelessly done or permitted as to create a potential and unreasonable risk of harm, which, in due course, results in injury to another.\u201d 66 C.J.S. <em>Nuisances </em>\u00a7 3 (1998) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u00b619 How, then, can a plaintiff bring a nuisance action against a defendant engaged in a statutorily authorized endeavor when \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA, indicates that such activities or facilities shall not \u201cbe deemed a nuisance\u201d? The starting point for our analysis is the historical source of this nuisance immunity defense. Section 27-30-101(2), MCA, was borrowed verbatim from \u00a7 3482 of the California Civil Code, which provides: \u201cNothing which is done or maintained under the express authority of a statute can be deemed a nuisance.\u201d Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3482 (West 1997). When interpreting a statute borrowed from a sister state, this Court generally follows the construction placed on the statute by the highest court of the state from which it was adopted. <em>Dew v. Dower </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 114, 125-26, 852 P.2d 549, 556 (citing <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 307, 311, 570 P.2d 1103, 1105).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b620 The California Supreme Court, in interpreting the reach of the nuisance immunity defense afforded by \u00a7 3482, has consistently applied a narrow construction to the principle embodied therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">\u201cA statutory sanction cannot be pleaded in justification of acts which by the general rules of law constitute a nuisance, unless the acts complained of are authorized by the express terms of the statute under which the justification is made, or by the plainest and most necessary implication from the powers expressly conferred, so that it can be fairly stated that the legislature contemplated the doing of the very act which occasions the injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-6\"><em>Hassell v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(Cal. 1938), 78 P.2d 1021, 1022-23, <em>quoting </em>46 C. J. at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u00b621 The <em>Hassell </em>test of statutory authorization thus \u201crequires a particularized assessment of each authorizing statute in relation to the act which constitutes the nuisance.\u201d <em>Varjabedian v. City of Madera </em>(Cal. 1977), 572 P.2d 43, 47 n.6. By requiring that the authorizing statute contain an express or necessarily implied authorization to do the very act which occasions injury, it is ensured that \u201can unequivocal legislative intent to sanction a nuisance will be effectuated, while avoiding the uncertainty that would result were every generally worded statute a source of undetermined immunity from nuisance liability.\u201d <em>Varjabedian, </em>572 P.2d at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\u00b622 More importantly for the purposes of this case, the courts of California have concluded pursuant to the <em>Hassell </em>test that \u201c \u2018although an activity authorized by statute cannot be a nuisance, the <em>manner </em>in which the activity is performed may constitute a nuisance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Greater </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Westchester v. City of Los Angeles </em>(Cal. 1979), 603 P.2d 1329, 1336, <em>quoting Venuto v. Owens-Coming Fiberglass Corp. </em>(Cal. App. 1971), 99 Cal. Rptr. 350, 359. With respect to statutorily authorized activities or facilities, the authorities are in agreement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\">A lawful action may become a nuisance by reason of its negligent performance. Thus, there are certain situations in which what was lawful may be turned into a nuisance by negligence in maintenance, and in which the danger, being a continuing one, is often characterized as a nuisance, although dependent upon negligence, as in the case of a highway out of repair. Also, negligent use may make a structure a nuisance which would not be a nuisance otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">58 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Nuisances </em>\u00a7 72 (1989) (footnotes omitted); <em>see also </em>66 C.J.S. <em>Nuisances </em>\u00a7 15 (1998); 8 Thompson on Real Property, Thomas Edition \u00a7 67.05(b)(4), at 116 (David A. Thomas ed., 1994); <em>see, e.g., Greer v. City of Lennox </em>(S.D. 1961), 107 N.W.2d 337 (holding that a public dump cannot be a nuisance <em>per se </em>in view of the statutory authority to operate such facilities, but may become a private nuisance by virtue of a municipality failing to perform its statutory functions in a reasonable manner); <em>Brown v. County Commissioners of Scioto County </em>(Ohio App. 1993), 622 N.E.2d 1153 (holding that operation of a duly authorized sewage treatment plant could not be an absolute nuisance, but could be found to constitute a qualified nuisance predicated upon negligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b623 In other words, a statutorily authorized activity or facility cannot constitute an absolute nuisance as a matter of law, but, nonetheless, may become a qualified nuisance in fact \u201cby reason of the improper or negligent manner in which it is conducted.\u201d 66 C.J.S. <em>Nuisances </em>\u00a7 15 (1998) (footnote omitted). We find this approach persuasive. When performing acts pursuant to statutory authority, an individual or entity must still act with due care, skill, and in conformity with legislative sanction. <em>See </em>57 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Municipal, County, School, and State Tort Liability </em>\u00a7 164 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b624 Thus, for the purpose of clarifying <em>Wilhelm, </em>\u201c[a]bsent a predicate finding of negligence, there can be no finding of a qualified nuisance.\u201d 66 C.J.S. <em>Nuisances </em>\u00a7 3 (1998) (footnote omitted); <em>see also </em>58 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Nuisances </em>\u00a7 25 (1989) (\u201cnegligence must be averred and proven to warrant a recovery\u201d) (footnote omitted). In refusing Barnes\u2019 proposed jury instructions on nuisance, the District Court correctly concluded that this \u201cCourt, in upholding the verdict in [Wilhelm], re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>quired there still to be a finding by the jury of negligence.\u201d That is, since the jury in <em>Wilhelm </em>did not make a predicate finding of negligence, liability for nuisance did not attach to the defendant city\u2019s statutorily authorized acts. <em>See Wilhelm, </em>225 Mont. at 255, 732 P.2d at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b625  Under \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA, therefore, an activity or facility that is expressly authorized by the Montana Legislature cannot \u201cbe deemed a nuisance\u201d as a matter of law pursuant to the statutory definition of nuisance found at \u00a7 27-30-101(1), MCA, unless the plaintiff can show, pursuant to a particularized assessment of the authorizing statute, that the defendant was acting wholly outside of its statutory authority. Furthermore, even assuming that a defendant\u2019s activity or facility falls within the exculpatory effect of \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA, a plaintiff may still claim a qualified nuisance against a defendant, like Thompson Falls, that is operating under express statutory authority, by averring negligent design, construction, operation, or maintenance. However, in bringing a qualified nuisance action, a plaintiff must do more than simply plead the existence of the statutorily authorized activity or facility claimed to constitute a nuisance; such plaintiff must, in addition, plead and prove the defendant\u2019s negligence and the resulting \u201cinjurious\u201d consequences of that activity or facility to plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccomfortable enjoyment of life or property.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-30-101(1), MCA; <em>see also Varjabedian, </em>572 P.2d at 47-48; 66 C.J.S. <em>Nuisances </em>\u00a7 5 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b626  To recap, a statutorily authorized activity or facility cannot be a nuisance unless the plaintiff can show: (1) that the defendant completely exceeded its statutory authority, resulting in a nuisance; or (2) that the defendant was negligent in carrying out its statutory authority, resulting in a qualified nuisance. Thus, the plaintiffs in <em>Wilhelm </em>could have prevailed on their nuisance claim if the jury found <em>either </em>that the city was liable for a nuisance because it had acted entirely outside the scope of its legislatively authorized power in operating the landfill, <em>or </em>that the city was liable for a qualified nuisance because it had been negligent in its operation or maintenance of the landfill. Barnes could have likewise prevailed on her nuisance claim against Thompson Falls only by proving that the city was liable for a qualified nuisance, notwithstanding \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA, because it had been negligent in designing, constructing, operating, or maintaining the storm drain line, or by proving that the city had acted wholly outside of its statutory authority with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>storm drain line and was thus liable, in the absence of negligence, for a nuisance pursuant to the definition of \u00a7 27-30-101(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b627 While it is generally true, as Barnes argues, that \u201ca nuisance can exist without negligence,\u201d this rule is inapplicable to a situation like the one <em>sub judice. </em>Barnes does not dispute that Thompson Falls\u2019 sewer and storm drain system is statutorily authorized. Nor does Barnes specifically allege that Thompson Falls exceeded its statutory authority. Barnes attempts to evade the strictures of \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA, by arguing for the first time on appeal that the flooding, and not the storm drain, constitutes the nuisance and, accordingly, that Thompson Falls has no statutory authority to flood her property. This argument begs the question; it asks this Court to focus not on the activity or facility in question, but on its consequences. However, as a threshold matter under \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA, a court must first inquire pursuant to the particularized <em>Hassell </em>inquiry whether the activity or facility is authorized either by the express terms of the authorizing statute or by necessary implication therefrom. Once it is determined that the activity or facility falls within the immunizing effect of \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA, a plaintiff\u2019s only recourse is to then proceed on a qualified nuisance theory and prove negligence to warrant recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b628 Here, Barnes has not shown that the actions of Thompson Falls with respect to the storm drain line behind her house were wholly outside of its statutory authority. Since Thompson Falls\u2019 storm drain system was constructed and is maintained under the express authority of \u00a7 7-13-4301(l)(a), MCA, Barnes could only prevail on her nuisance claim by proving that Thompson Falls was negligent in its design, construction, operation, or maintenance of the storm drain line. \u00b629 Despite Thompson Falls\u2019 express statutory authority to operate its sewer and drain system, Barnes argues on appeal \u2014 as she argued at trial \u2014 that she is not required under Montana law to prove negligence in order to recover for nuisance. Barnes fixates on the holding in <em>Wilhelm </em>that \u201ca nuisance can exist without negligence,\u201d a conclusion impliedly made in reference to the definition of nuisance found at \u00a7 27-30-101(1), MCA, while ignoring the plain language of the nuisance immunity defense afforded by \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA. However, as we have stated herein, \u00a7 27-30-101, MCA, must be read in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b630 Under Barnes\u2019 theory, a plaintiff could circumvent \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA, by glossing over the fact that an activity or f\u00e1cil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ity is statutorily authorized (e.g., the sewer and storm drain system) and focusing on the result (e.g., the flooding), arguing that any activity that results in injury to the plaintiff, whether statutorily authorized or not, is a nuisance. Barnes\u2019 position on appeal would have this Court, in effect, permit a nuisance action to be <em>prima facie </em>actionable against a defendant operating under express statutory authority regardless of any proof that the defendant was negligent in acting upon that statutory authority and, in so doing, to disregard the meaning of the nuisance immunity defense afforded by \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA. If we were to hold, as Barnes requests, that a statutorily authorized activity or facility can constitute a nuisance solely because it results in damage to the plaintiff, regardless of any negligence on the part of the defendant, this Court would effectively eviscerate the rule of \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b631  According to the facts of this case, Barnes could have only brought a qualified nuisance action against Thompson Falls. Under a qualified nuisance theory, \u201c[w]here the acts or omissions constituting negligence are the identical acts which allegedly gave rise to a cause of action for nuisance, the rules applicable to negligence will be applied.\u201d 58 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Nuisances </em>\u00a7 72 (1989) (footnote omitted). Thus, given the jury\u2019s verdict of no negligence, we must conclude that Thompson Falls was not negligent in its operation or maintenance of the storm drain line behind Barnes\u2019 duplex and, thus, would not have been liable for a qualified nuisance due to the incidental flooding of Barnes property in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b632 We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing Barnes\u2019 proposed jury instructions on nuisance, as they constituted a misstatement of Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b633 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b110-8\">JUSTICES HUNT, REGNIER, NELSON and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\">. Some of the confusion of <em>Wilhelm </em>may be attributed to the fact that the law of nuisance is, itself, a muddle. The venerable Prosser long ago characterized the subject of nuisance as \u201ca sort of legal garbage can,\u201d due in large part to a traditional definition of nuisance \u201cbroad enough to cover all conceivable torts.\u201d William L. <em>Prosser\u00a1Nuisance Without Fault, </em>20 Tex. L. Rev. 399, 410 (1942). Later in his life, Prosser thus opined that \u201c[tjhere is perhaps no more impenetrable jungle in the entire law than that which surrounds the word \u2018nuisance.\u2019 \u201d William L. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts 571 (4th ed. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
