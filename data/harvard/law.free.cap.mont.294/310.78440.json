The District Court denied cross-motions for summary judgment filed by Skinner and the County; it subsequently dismissed the petition on the grounds that amendments adopted by the board in April 1998 superseded the 1995 regulations and rendered the case moot. Skinner appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">\u00b62 The parties present the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it dismissed the case for mootness?</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it denied Skinner\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b65 Skinner owns and is attempting to develop a subdivision in the north-central Helena Valley called \u201cGreen Acres.\u201d This development has been the subject of an earlier decision of this Court. <em>See Skinner Enterprises, Inc. v. Lewis and Clark County Board of Health </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 256, 950 P.2d 733. Skinner believed that there was a conflict between the 1993 local on-site wastewater treatment regulations promulgated by the Lewis and Clark City-County Board of Health (the Board), and the regulations promulgated at the State level by the Department of Environmental Quality. Skinner petitioned the Board for a review of its regulations pursuant to \u00a7 50-2-130, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b66 In October 1995, the Board conducted a review of its regulations at which time it addressed Skinner\u2019s petition. As part of the review, public hearings were conducted. Following the hearings, the Board adopted several amendments to the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b67 Skinner filed a petition with the District Court which alleged that the Board violated constitutional and statutory notice requirements related to the hearing. Skinner sought a declaratory judgment which vacated the amendments. The District Court found that the Board provided adequate notice of the hearing and \u201creasonable opportunity for citizen participation.\u201d However, the District Court denied the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment and concluded that it would be inappropriate to award summary judgment on issues it considered related to a pending appeal to this Court from earlier litigation between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u00b68 The dispute remained undecided in the District Court for several months. In early 1998 the Board again amended the on-site wastewater treatment regulations. Those amendments superseded the 1995 amendments to which Skinner objected in his petition before the District Court. As a result of the Board\u2019s adoption of the 1998 amendments, the District Court found that Skinner\u2019s objections to the process for the adoption of the 1995 amendments were moot and it dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err when it dismissed the case for mootness?</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">\u00b610 In his initial brief to this Court, Skinner raised the issue of whether the District Court\u2019s denial of summary judgment was correct. The County responded that any dispute over the adoption .of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>1995 amendments is moot. We address the mootness issue first because it is potentially dispositive of the appeal. Skinner contends that the process of adopting the amendments falls within an exception to the mootness rule because it is an action which is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evades review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b6 11 When a district court considers a motion to dismiss it must view the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accepting as true all well-pleaded facts. <em>See </em>Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.R The standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>See Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686; <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b612  This Court has held that \u201ca moot question is one which existed once but because of an event or happening, it has ceased to exist and no longer presents an actual controversy.\u201d <em>Miller v. Murray </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 499, 503, 600 P.2d 1174, 1176. This Court does not normally address moot questions. <em>See Van Troba v. Montana State Univ., </em>1998 MT 292, \u00b6 35, 291 Mont. 522, 970 P.2d 1029, \u00b6 35. However, this Court will consider the merits of moot issues when faced with constitutional questions which are capable of repetition yet could avoid review. <em>See Common Cause v. Statutory Comm. </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 324, 328, 868 P.2d 604, 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\u00b613  A question becomes moot on appeal \u201cwhere by a change of circumstances prior to the appellate decision the case has lost any practical purpose for the parties, for instance where the grievance that gave rise to the case has been eliminated.\u201d <em>Van Troba, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">\u00b614 In <em>Van Troba, </em>the NCAA appealed from a preliminary injunction which barred it from preventing the respondent from receiving a scholarship to play intercollegiate women\u2019s basketball as a freshman for Montana State University. Because of the injunction, the respondent participated in the basketball program as a freshman while the NCAA appeal came before this Court. The respondent\u2019s eligibility to play basketball as a sophomore, junior, or senior was not at issue in the case. By the time this Court heard the NCAA\u2019s appeal, the respondent had completed her freshman year at MSU. As a result, we concluded that the issue of whether the District Court erred when it issued the injunction was moot, because it was no longer of practical consequence to the parties. <em>See Van Troba, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u00b615 While the dispute in <em>Van Troba </em>became moot during the appeal, the principles underlying the mootness rule remain the same whether an issue is rendered moot during the appellate process or while a case is pending at the trial level. Therefore, <em>Van Troba </em>is applicable to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b616 The adoption of the 1995 amendments which formed the basis for Skinner\u2019s claim were superseded by the 1998 amendments, prior to trial. As a result, the legality of the 1995 amendments was no longer of any practical consequence to the parties and any potential error in the District Court\u2019s failure to award summary judgment is similarly no longer of any practical consequence. Accordingly, we hold that the issue is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b6 17 However, Skinner contends that this case falls within the exception to mootness and that our decision in <em>Common Cause </em>is applicable. <em>Common Cause </em>involved the process used to create a list of nominees from which the Governor would appoint, and the senate confirm, a Commissioner of Political Practices. The petitioners argued that the process violated the \u201cright to know\u201d provision of the Montana Constitution because a nominating committee failed to provide any public notice of its deliberations. This Court concluded that the alleged violation of the open meeting statutes and the \u201cright to know\u201d provision was capable of recurring in the context of future selections of nominees, as well as actions taken by other advisory entities. <em>See Common Cause, </em>263 Mont. at 328, 868 P.2d at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b618 Since our decision in <em>Common Cause, </em>we have had occasion to further discuss the mootness exception. In <em>Heisler v. Hines Motor Co. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 270, 937 P.2d 45, we.set forth a two-part burden which the party invoking the exception must meet: First, the challenged action must be too short in duration to be fully litigated prior to cessation; and second, there must be a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subject to the same action again. <em>See Heisler, </em>282 Mont. at 275-76, 937 P.2d at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b6 19 In <em>Heisler, </em>the appellant was injured in a work-related accident and the insurer, the State Fund, declined to pay bills submitted by a second physician on the basis that the appellant had changed treating physicians without prior approval from the State Fund. The parties disputed whether a provision of the Administrative Rules of Montana gave the State Fund the absolute right to pre-approve a claimant\u2019s change of physician. The State Fund subsequently paid all the medical bills at issue and it argued on appeal that the dispute was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>moot. We disagreed, concluding that because the State Fund had not changed its position vis-a-vis the administrative rule, if the appellant was to again change his physician without prior approval, the action complained of could recur. <em>See Heisler, </em>282 Mont at 276, 937 P.2d at 48. \u00b620 <em>In In re Matter of Klos </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 197, 943 P.2d 1277, we found that temporary guardianship appointments for six month periods will lapse before appellate review of an appointment is conducted and, therefore, are capable of repetition, yet evading review.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">\u00b621 The 1995 amendments to the local on-site wastewater treatment regulations were amended in 1998, but Skinner does not contend, nor does the record suggest, that the Board failed to follow the proper statutory rule-making process in 1998. In fact, the record suggests that Skinner may have been instrumental in providing the information to the Board which contributed to the 1998 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"A6I\">\u00b622 The distinguishing feature between the instant case and <em>Heisler </em>is that here the Board may have avoided judicial review, but it also resolved the underlying dispute by reconciling the local regulations with the State-level regulations. In <em>Heisler, </em>the underlying dispute had not been resolved. There was, therefore, the potential for a recurrence of the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b623  We conclude that in this case Skinner has failed to meet his burden to establish that there is a reasonable expectation that he would be subject to the same action again if we were to affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal for mootness. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court. Because we conclude that the claim is mooted, we decline to address the question of whether the District Court erred when it denied Skinner\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES REGNIER, GRAY and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
