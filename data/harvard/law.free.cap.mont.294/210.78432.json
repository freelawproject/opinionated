The District Court ruled that damages to the home and personal property of Mike and Vera Sokoloski for which they sought homeowners\u2019 insurance coverage were not covered under their insurance policy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the court erred in granting summary judgment for the insurer, American West Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b63 During four or five weeks in the holiday season of fall 1994, the Sokoloskis burned scented candles in their home. This caused a discharge of smoke and soot which accumulated on the walls, ceilings, and floors of the home and on their personal property. The Sokoloskis admit noticing soot accumulations on the glass candle containers while they were burning the candles, but they deny burning candles after they realized the smoke was damaging their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\u00b64 The Sokoloskis\u2019 home and its contents were insured under an \u201call-risk\u201d homeowner\u2019s policy issued by American West Insurance Company. The Sokoloskis contacted American West concerning the smoke and soot damage, but American West denied coverage, stating that the damages were excluded under a pollution exception in the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">\u00b65 The Sokoloskis subsequently filed this action for payment of their claim and all expenses related to pursuit of the claim. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the court ruled in favor of American West. The Sokoloskis appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">\u00b66 Did the court err in granting summary judgment for American West?</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">\u00b67 This Court\u2019s standard of review of a summary judgment is de novo. <em>Treichel v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 280 Mont. 443, 446, 930 P.2d 661, 663. Once it has been demonstrated (or, as here, conceded) that no issues of material fact exist, the Court must determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\u00b68 In this case, the District Court determined that the pollution ex- . elusion clause in the insurance policy barred coverage of the claimed loss and that the damages to personal property were not sudden and accidental. The Sokoloskis argue that both of those determinations were wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">f 9 The American West insurance policy held by the Sokoloskis covered physical loss to the dwelling under Coverage A, but it excluded coverage of damages caused by the discharge of pollutants \u201cunless the pollution is itself caused by a Peril Insured Against under Coverage C.\u201d \u201cPollutants\u201d is defined under the policy as \u201cany solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, <em>including smoke, </em>vapor, <em>soot, </em>fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u00b610 The Sokoloskis argue that \u201cpollutant\u201d is an environmental term of art which applies only to discharges of pollution into the environment from sources outside the home. They cite a Ninth Circuit case, <em>Enron Oil Trading &amp; Transp. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1997), 132 F.3d 526, in which the court defined the word \u201ccontamination\u201d as an environmental term of art. In <em>Enron, </em>the word \u201ccontamination\u201d was not defined in the insurance policy at issue. Here, however, \u201cpollutants\u201d was defined within the insurance policy, and smoke and soot damages were expressly included within the policy definition of \u201cpollutants.\u201d We therefore need not look outside the insurance policy for a definition of \u201cpollutants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b611 We next proceed, as Coverage A of the insurance policy requires, to determine whether damage from the pollutants smoke and soot is insured against under Coverage C. Coverage C, Personal Property, specifically covers damage from \u201cSmoke, meaning sudden and accidental damages from smoke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b612 The question remaining is whether the smoke damage from the candles was \u201csudden and accidental damage.\u201d The District Court ruled that damage over a four to five week period was not sudden. \u00b613 The Sokoloskis cite <em>New Castle County v. Hartford Acc. and Indem. Co. </em>(3rd Cir. 1991), 933 F.2d 1162, in which the court stated that there was a split in authority regarding the meaning of the word \u201csudden\u201d in pollution exclusion clauses. This issue \u201chas precipitated \u2018a legal war ... in state and federal courts from Maine to California.\u2019 \u201d <em>Northern Ins. Co. of New York v. Aardvark Assoc., Inc. </em>(3rd Cir. 1991), 942 F.2d 189, 191. The <em>New Castle </em>court deduced that this split in authority demonstrated that the word \u201csudden\u201d was subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, was therefore ambiguous, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>must be construed in favor of the insured. <em>New Castle, </em>933 F.2d at 1198-99. The Sokoloskis likewise argue that, because it is ambiguous, the insurance policy clause should be interpreted according to their reasonable expectations of coverage. They assert that any damages which were unexpected are \u201csudden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b614 The issue of the meaning of the word \u201csudden\u201d in a pollution exclusion clause has not previously been considered by this Court. We note, however, that the District Court\u2019s ruling was consistent with other courts\u2019 recent decisions on the meaning of the word \u201csudden\u201d in similar insurance policy provisions. The <em>Northern Insurance </em>court abrogated the decision <em>isxNew </em>Castle, concluding that under Pennsylvania law an exception for \u201csudden and accidental\u201d events applies only to events which are abrupt and last a short time. <em>Northern </em>Ins., 942 F.2d at 193-94. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected an argument that \u201csudden and accidental\u201d means \u201cunexpected\u201d and \u201cunintentional\u201d and ruled that under Missouri law the term \u201csudden\u201d must include a temporal element such that it is abrupt, immediate, and unexpected. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. FAG Bearings Corp. </em>(8th Cir. 1998), 153 F.3d 919, 923. Similarly, the Supreme Court of Iowa rejected an argument that \u201csudden\u201d is ambiguous or that when used in the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d it means unforeseen or unintended. <em>Iowa Comprehensive Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Fund Bd. v. Farmland Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Iowa 1997), 568 N.W.2d 815, 818-19. Michigan defines \u201csudden\u201d in such usage as immediate and unexpected. <em>South Macomb Disposal Auth. v. American Ins. Co. </em>(Mich. Ct. App. 1997), 572 N.W.2d 686, 702. When used in a \u201csudden and accidental\u201d insurance policy phrase, the word sudden \u201cmust include a temporal component; otherwise, the word is rendered mere surplusage.\u201d <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(Cal. Ct. App. 1998), 75 Cal.Rptr.2d 54, 63. \u201cThe term \u2018sudden\u2019 carries the temporal connotation of \u2018abruptness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Westling Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Western Nat\u2019l Mut. Ins. Co., Inc. </em>(Minn. 1998), 581 N.W.2d 39, 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b615  We find persuasive American West\u2019s argument that the very use of the two words \u201csudden\u201d and \u201caccidental\u201d reveals a clear intent to define them to state two separate requirements, so that \u201csudden\u201d means more than \u201cunexpected.\u201d This is consistent with Montana statutory law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 28-3-202, MCA: \u201cThe whole of a contract is to be taken together so as to give effect to every part if reasonably practicable, each clause helping to interpret the other.\u201d We hold that in the context of the phrase \u201csudden and accidental,\u201d the word \u201csudden,\u201d even if it includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the concept of unexpectedness, also encompasses a temporal element, because unexpectedness is already expressed by the word \u201caccidental.\u201d \u00b616 The Sokoloskis admitted that they burned the candles over a period of four to five weeks and that they were aware the candles were releasing smoke and soot as they burned. They noticed the black film around the top of the glass containers and understood it was from the candles. They later noticed the soot on the walls and their personal belongings. The District Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">While time is relative and a geologist might speak of sudden events occurring over hundreds or even thousands of years and an astrophysicist may speak in terms of millions of years, most people and institutions measure time in much more finite terms. So must the courts. In the context of the coverage of smoke damage by a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy, the Court determines that \u201csudden\u201d connotes a sense of immediacy, which is measured in seconds, minutes and might be stretched to hours, but not weeks. Therefore, the Court rules the gradual accumulation of soot and smoke over a 4-5 week period is not \u201csudden and accidental\u201d for purposes of policy coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We agree with the District Court. Because we determine that the smoke and soot damage was not sudden, we need not address whether this damage met the additional requirement of also being accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b617  Where the clear language of an insurance contract expressly excludes coverage, summary judgment on the issue of policy applicability is proper. We hold that American West is entitled to summary judgment that the smoke and soot damage to the Sokoloskis\u2019 home and personal property is not covered under their American West homeowners\u2019 insurance. We therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, GRAY, LEAPHART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
