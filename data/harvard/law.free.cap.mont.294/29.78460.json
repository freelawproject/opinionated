(Roger) appeals from the decision of the District Court for the Thirteenth Judicial District, Yellowstone County, terminating his parental rights to K.A.B. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-24\">\u00b62 Roger raises two issues on appeal, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in finding that Roger did not comply with the provisions of his treatment plan?</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in finding that Roger abandoned K.A.B.?</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b65 Because our decision as to Issue 1 is dispositive, we decline to address Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\u00b66 The Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) has been involved with Roger and Kim B. (Kim), the natural parents of K.A.B., since April 1990. At that time, Kim\u2019s other daughters, S.B. and A.B., alleged that Roger, who was Kim\u2019s live-in boyfriend, sexually abused them. Roger denied S.B.\u2019s and A.B.\u2019s allegations and Kim did not believe her daughters\u2019 allegations. In May 1992, however, Roger admitted that he sexually abused S.B., A.B., and Kim\u2019s cousin\u2019s daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">\u00b67 Roger was subsequently charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent. He pleaded guilty in December 1992. The court sentenced Roger to time in the Montana State Prison, suspended all jail time, and placed him on probation until 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">\u00b68 On January 10,1996, the DPHHS became involved with Roger and Kim when it learned that they had resumed their relationship in late 1995. Although their renewed relationship lasted for only two months, Kim became pregnant with K.A.B. Kim gave birth to K.A.B. on September 13,1996. Upon admission to the hospital, Kim denied knowledge of her pregnancy and indicated that she had not received pre-natal care. Roger testified at the hearing on this matter that he did not know that Kim was pregnant until Toni Napier (Napier), a DPHHS social worker, called him approximately one week after K. A.B.\u2019s birth and told him that Kim gave birth and named him as the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">\u00b69 Six days after K.A.B.\u2019s birth, on September 19,1996, the DPHHS filed a Petition for Temporary Investigative Authority and Protective Services of K.A.B. Later that day, the District Court issued an order which granted the DPHHS temporary investigative authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">\u00b610 On January 2,1997, the District Court approved a treatment plan which Roger signed on December 23,1996. The treatment plan required Roger to: (1) continue working with a counseling center to address his sexual offending behaviors; (2) not have any contact with K.A.B., S.B. and A.B. unless approved by the DPHHS; (3) keep his home free of alcohol and drugs; (4) not be involved in criminal activity; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>(5) attend parenting classes; (6) maintain an income; and (7) comply with his probation officer\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b611 On December 18,1996, the DPHHS apparently filed a petition to terminate Roger\u2019s and Kim\u2019s parental rights to K.A.B. The DPHHS\u2019s petition, which is not part of the record but was included in the appendix to Roger\u2019s brief, alleged that neither Roger nor Kim had complied with their treatment plans and that the conduct and conditions that render them unfit as parents were unlikely to change within a reasonable time. The petition also alleged that Roger abandoned K.A.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b612 The District Court held a hearing on the DPHHS\u2019s petition on April 4,1997. Gayle Walsh (Walsh), Roger\u2019s therapist in a sex offender treatment program, testified that Roger\u2019s progress has been slow but steady. Even so, Walsh stated that Roger would never be able to be the sole parent of K.A.B. Walsh, however, did not state whether she thought that Roger\u2019s parental rights should be terminated even after Roger\u2019s attorney asked her for her opinion. Nevertheless, Walsh stated that she saw \u201cno problem with Roger being a part of [K.A.B.\u2019s] life.\u201d Napier testified that Roger had not attended any parenting classes even though his treatment plan required that he do so. Napier opined that terminating Roger\u2019s parental rights would be in K.A.B.\u2019s best interests. Roger testified on his own behalf at the hearing and admitted that he could not be an adequate parent to K.A.B. However, Roger stated that he would like to be a part of K.A.B.\u2019s life by taking part in supervised visits with her. Roger also admitted that he had not attended the parenting classes that his treatment plan required. \u00b613 On April 21,1997, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order which terminated Roger\u2019s and Kim\u2019s parental rights to K.A.B. and awarded the DPHHS permanent custody of K.A.B. with authority to assent to adoption. Roger appeals from the court\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b614 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court interpreted the law correctly. <em>In re A. </em>W-M., 1998 MT 157, \u00b6 8-9, 289 Mont. 333, \u00b6 8-9, 960 P.2d 779, \u00b6 8-9. We review the court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. A. W-M., \u00b6 8-9 (citing <em>Interstate Production Credit Association v. DeSaye </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 320, 323, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence; if the district court misapprehended the ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>feet of the evidence; or if, after reviewing the record, this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>In re E.W., </em>1998 MT 135, \u00b6 10,289 Mont. 190, \u00b610, 959 P.2d 951, \u00b6 10 (citing <em>DeSaye, </em>250 Mont at 323, 820 P.2d at 1287).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b6 15 This Court has stated that \u201ca natural parent\u2019s right to care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest, which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures.\u201d <em>In re E. </em>W., \u00b6 12 (quoting <em>In re R.B., Jr. </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 99, 103, 703 P.2d 846, 848). Thus, a district court must adequately address each applicable statutory requirement before terminating an individual\u2019s parental rights. <em>In re E. </em>W., \u00b6 12 (citing <em>In re R.B., Jr., 211 </em>Mont. at 103, 703 P.2d at 848). The party seeking to terminate an individual\u2019s parental rights has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory criteria for termination has been met. <em>In re E.W.,% 12 </em>(citingIn <em>re J.L., D.L., andA.G. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 284, 288, 922 P.2d 459, 461). In cases involving the termination of parental rights, this Court has stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">clear and convincing proof is simply a requirement that a preponderance of the evidence be definite, clear, and convincing, or that a particular issue must be clearly established by a preponderance of the evidence or by a clear preponderance of proof. This requirement does not call for unanswerable or conclusive evidence. The quality of proof, to be clear and convincing, is somewhere between the rule in ordinary civil cases and the requirement of criminal procedure \u2014 that is, it must be more than a mere preponderance but not beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\"><em>In re J.L., D.L., and </em>A.G., 211 Mont. at 289, 922 P.2d at 462 (quoting In <em>re Interest of S.M.Q. </em>(1990), 247 Kan. 231, 796 P.2d 543, 545).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u00b616  When considering the criteria for termination, courts must give primary consideration to the best interests of the child as demonstrated by the child\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs. Section 41-3-609(3), MCA. See also <em>Matter of B.C. </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 423, 430, 942 P.2d 106, 110 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">\u00b617 <em>Did the District Court err in finding that Roger did not comply with the provisions of his treatment plan?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">\u00b618 The District Court adjudicated K.A.B. a youth in need of care pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-102, MCA, and terminated Roger\u2019s parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA. That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>(1) The court may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding that any of the following circumstances exist:...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\">(e) the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">(i) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u00b6 19 Roger first claims that he substantially complied with his treatment plan. Therefore, he asserts that the District Court\u2019s finding that he did not comply with his treatment plan is clearly erroneous. Partial compliance with a treatment plan, however, is insufficient to preclude termination of parental rights. <em>Matter </em>of B.C., 283 Mont. at 430, 942 P.2d at 111 <em>(citing Matter of J.J.C.H. </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 158, 164, 827 P.2d 812, 816). In the instant case, Roger admitted that he did not attend the parenting classes which his treatment plan required. Napier also testified that Roger failed to attend parenting classes. Thus, there is substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s finding that Roger did not comply with his treatment plan. Therefore, this finding is not clearly erroneous. Thus, we conclude that the District Court did not err in finding that Roger failed to comply with his treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u00b620 Roger next argues that the parenting component of his treatment plan was a \u201cmoot point\u201d because he did not plan to parent K.A.B. and only wanted supervised visits with her. Notwithstanding, Roger voluntarily entered into the treatment plan which required him to attend parenting classes. Moreover, the issue facing the District Court was whether Roger\u2019s and Kim\u2019s parental rights to K.A.B. should be terminated. Thus, it cannot be said that the parenting component of Roger\u2019s treatment plan was a \u201cmoot point\u201d even though Roger did not plan to parent K.A.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">\u00b621 Finally, Roger cites \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, and argues that the court erred in terminating his parental rights because K.A.B. was not in an out-of-home placement for a cumulative total period of one year or longer. Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, however, is an alternative basis for terminating parental rights and is inapplicable in the instant case because Roger\u2019s parental rights were terminated pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(e), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u00b622  Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s finding that Roger failed to comply with the terms of his treatment plan is not clearly erroneous and that the court did not err in terminating Roger\u2019s parental rights to K.A.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b58-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, LEAPHART, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
