The petition was brought due to concerns regarding T.L.E.\u2019s chronic use of illicit drugs and alcohol, including the use of such substances while she was pregnant with her children. T.L.E. did not object to the Department obtaining temporary investigative authority. The petition was granted and the children were placed in foster care. In October of 1996, T.L.E. entered into the first of several voluntary treatment plans with the Department. At the time, T.L.E. was told by the Department that continued drug and alcohol use could result in the termination of her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\u00b64 However, T.L.E. relapsed into alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine use, and became depressed and suicidal. In an attempt to alleviate T.L.E.\u2019s bouts of depression, the Department placed her in foster care with the children; however, she lasted less than twenty-four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>hours in this arrangement before leaving. In late October of 1996, T.L.E. was discharged from chemical dependency treatment due to a lack of attendance and substance abuse relapses. Upon relapsing, T.L.E. was filled with thoughts of suicide and was admitted for psychiatric treatment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b65 In December of 1996, the Department petitioned for temporary custody of the children. Again, T.L.E. did not object. In January of 1997, T.L.E. was arrested for shoplifting and criminal sale of dangerous drugs; she received probation. That same month, she entered into another voluntary treatment plan, but failed to comply with its terms. T.L.E. subsequently entered into other treatment plans with the Department, but was repeatedly unsuccessful in controlling her addictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b66 During her treatment, T.L.E. missed scheduled visits with her children, and later admitted that some of these absences were due to alcohol abuse. T.L.E. also arrived at a scheduled visitation in March of 1997 reeking of alcohol and claimed that it had been spilled upon her, but refused to submit to a breathalyzer test. In April of 1997, T.L.E. was evicted from her apartment and stated that she could not adequately care for both of her children. Indeed, a number of times T.L.E. offered to relinquish custody of the children because she could not adequately provide for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b67 T.L.E. adamantly maintains that she has remained drug and alcohol free since June of 1997, when she was arrested for probation violations and sentenced to three years with the Department of Corrections (DOC). Pursuant to her probationary violations, the DOC initially placed T.L.E. in the Butte Prerelease Center. In July of 1997, the Department petitioned the court to extend temporary custody, citing T.L.E.\u2019s failure to successfully comply with or complete any of her court-approved treatment plans. The extension of temporary custody was granted without objection from T.L.E. While in Butte, T.L.E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>entered the Montana Chemical Dependency Center; she was discharged from the program in September of 1997 for lack of progress. In October of 1997, T.L.E. was transferred to the Montana Women\u2019s Prison in Billings for failure to comply with regulations at the Butte Prerelease Center. While incarcerated at the Women\u2019s Prison, T.L.E. has continued to experience disciplinary problems and has been written up an average of once per month for various infractions of prison rules. T.L.E. has admitted missing several prison classes and meetings necessary to her treatment plans as a result of her inability to compose her emotions when she is not drinking or using illegal drugs on a regular basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b68 At the same time, since being imprisoned, T.L.E. has demonstrated some progress towards meeting the goals of her treatment plans: she has addressed her chemical dependency issues by attending classes, including the successful completion of a drug and alcohol education program consisting of instruction in the roots of addiction, personal values, alternatives to drug-induced highs, methods of enhancing self-respect, relationship skills, and coping with life after incarceration; she has also been attending alcoholics anonymous; she successfully completed a class in coping with anxiety and depression and has continued to work on her depression issues; she has attended positive parenting classes; she has participated in additional programs involving relationships with men, criminal thinking, skills building, grief group, and moral recognition therapy; and she is close to completing her GED.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b69 In October of 1997, K.H. was placed in his father\u2019s custody. In December of 1997, the Department petitioned for permanent custody and termination of T.L.E.\u2019s parental rights, citing general noncompliance with her treatment plans.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a hearing on the Department\u2019s termination petition, the District Court terminated T.L.E.\u2019s parental rights to K.H. T.L.E. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b6 10 Did the District Court err under ICWA by ordering termination of T.L.E.\u2019s parental rights to K.H. without the required testimony of a qualified expert witness?</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u00b6 11 Determining the qualifications of an expert witness is a matter within a trial court\u2019s discretion, and this Court will not overturn such determinations in the absence of an abuse of that discretion. <em>In the Matter ofthe Adoption of H.M.O., </em>1998 MT 175, \u00b6 20, 289 Mont. 509, \u00b6 20, 962 P.2d 1191, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b612 T.L.E. argues that the Department failed to qualify an appropriate expert witness with credentials beyond that of a normal social worker and, therefore, that the District Court erred in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that her parental rights should be terminated pursuant to ICWA. The Department contends, in response, that T.L.E. has \u201cwaived\u201d this claim on appeal by failing to object at the termination hearing to the Department\u2019s introduction of its witness, social worker Lori Hicks (Hicks), as an appropriately qualified ICWA expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b613 ICWA provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">No termination of parental rights may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of a <em>determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, </em>that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912\u00ae. Thus, we must determine, as a threshold matter, whether this Court should reach the merits of T.L.E.\u2019s challenge to the Department\u2019s reliance on Hicks as a qualified expert witness for purposes of terminating Indian parental rights pursuant to ICWA. \u00b614 T.L.E. relies upon this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Matter of H.M.O., </em>where, after noting that qualified expert testimony is a \u201cprerequisite\u201d to the termination of parental rights under ICWA, this Court held that \u201ca social worker must possess <em>expertise beyond that of the normal social worker </em>to satisfy the qualified expert witness requirement of25 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>1912(f).\u201d Matter of H.M.O., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26,33 (emphasis added). We generally decline to address an issue raised for the first time on appeal where the litigant had an opportunity to object at trial; however, there is a limited exception which permits this Court to reach the merits of an issue, in the absence of a timely objection, when the party did not have an adequate opportunity to object at the trial level. <em>See Cenex v. Board of Comm\u2019rs for Yellowstone County </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 330, 337-38, 941 P.2d 964, 968. In <em>Matter of H.M.O., </em>this Court invoked that limited exception and took cognizance of the appellant\u2019s challenge to the State\u2019s witnesses as qualified ICWA ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>perts, despite a failure to object to those witnesses at the trial level. <em>See Matter ofH.M.O., </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b6 15 The Department contends that <em>Matter ofH.M. O. </em>is distinguishable, however. The appellant in that case never had an adequate opportunity to object to the State\u2019s expert witnesses because the \u201ctestimony\u2019 at issue was contained in written reports received into evidence; no foundation was therefore established for the admission of the expert testimony. In contrast, T.L.E. was represented by counsel at her termination hearing, but never objected to the adequacy of the foundation established by the Department for the presentation of Hicks\u2019 expert testimony \u2014 including Hicks\u2019 opinion, pursuant to \u00a7 1912(f) of ICWA, that K.H. was seriously endangered by a continuation of the parental relationship with T.L.E. Nor did T.L.E. choose to <em>voir dire </em>Hicks regarding her qualifications as an appropriate ICWA expert. According to the Department, this Court should therefore decline to invoke the limited exception recognized in <em>Matter ofH.M.O. </em>and refuse to reach the merits of T.L.E.\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b6 16 Contrary to the Department\u2019s position, we do not find <em>Matter of H.M.O. </em>distinguishable from the facts of this case. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that T.L.E. did not have an adequate opportunity to object to the District Court\u2019s implied reliance on Hicks as an ICWA expert witness in terminating T.L.E.\u2019s parental rights. Therefore, despite T.L.E.\u2019s failure to object to Hicks as an appropriately qualified ICWA expert, the question of whether Hicks was so qualified is properly before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b617 In <em>Matter ofH.M.O., </em>the \u201cfirst notice\u201d that certain witnesses \u201cwere to be treated as experts for ICWA purposes was when the District Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order.\u201d <em>Matter of H.M.O., </em>\u00b6 24. This peculiar situation arose because the State\u2019s experts did not testify in person at the termination hearing; rather, the State introduced written reports and deposition testimony, but failed to ever disclose to the natural Indian mother that the witnesses were being offered and qualified as ICWA \u201cexperts.\u201d <em>See Matter ofH.M.O., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Thus, this Court chose to entertain the mother\u2019s claim because she \u201cdid not have an adequate opportunity to object to the District Court\u2019s reliance on\u201d the witnesses as qualified experts pursuant to \u00a7 1912(f) of ICWA. <em>Matter ofH.M.O., </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u00b618 We reach the same result here. Nowhere in the transcript of the termination hearing is there any indication that the Department ever expressly offered \u2014 let alone qualified \u2014 Hicks\u2019 testimony as that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>of an ICWA \u201cexpert.\u201d Nor did the District Court ever expressly rule on Hicks\u2019 qualifications as an ICWA expert during that proceeding. Thus, as in <em>Matter ofH.M.O., </em>T.L.E. was not put on \u201cnotice\u201d that the Department was intending that Hicks\u2019 testimony satisfy its burden of proof under \u00a7 1912(f) of ICWA until the District Court returned its order, relying by inference upon Hicks\u2019 testimony as that of a qualified ICWA expert in terminating T.L.E.\u2019s parental rights to K.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b619 We refuse to endorse the unreasonable notion, implicit in the Department\u2019s position on appeal, that T.L.E. was under an obligation to object to each and every witness offered by the Department if she wished to preclude a witness from being deemed, after the fact, an ICWA expert. The burden under ICWA is not upon T.L.E. to preclude such expert testimony, but on the Department to produce it: an essential \u201cprerequisite\u201d to the termination of Indian parental rights under \u00a7 1912(f) of ICWA is the testimony of a qualified expert that a continuation of the parental relationship would likely result in serious emotional or physical damage to the Indian child in question. <em>Matter of H.M.O., </em>\u00b6 26. However, as we suggested in <em>Matter ofH.M.O., </em>\u201cinformation set forth in a vacuum \u2014 that is, without any disclosure that the witness is being offered and qualified as an expert\u201d \u2014 is neither sufficient to put the Indian natural parent on notice that the witness is being put forward as an ICWA expert, nor to establish an adequate foundation for the admission of such expert testimony. <em>See Matter of H.M.O., </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u00b620 Our interpretation of <em>Matter ofH.M. O. </em>so as to reach the merits of T.L.E.\u2019s claim in this case is, in our view, both \u201ccongruent with the remedial character of [ICWA]\u201d and consistent with \u201cour responsibility to promote and protect the unique Indian cultures of our state for future generations of Montanans.\u201d In <em>the Matter of M.E.M. </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 329, 333-35, 635 P.2d 1313, 1316-17. The District Court, by terminating T.L.E.\u2019s parental rights to K.H., severed a fundamental bond not only between mother and child, but also between culture and individual. The very use of the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard of proof in ICWA termination actions, the highest standard of proof known to American jurisprudence, was intended by Congress to stop the all-too-common removal of Indian children from their Indian families, and thus tribal culture, \u201c \u2018by non-tribal government authorities who have no basis for intelligently evaluating the cultural and social premises underlying Indian home life and childrearing.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 30, 34-35, 109 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>S.Ct. 1597, 1601, 104 L.Ed.2d 29, 38, <em>quoting </em>Hearings onS. 1214 Before the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs and Public Lands of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 95th Cong. 191-92 (1978) (statement of Calvin Isaac, Tribal Chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b621 We remain vigilant because, in large part, \u201cthe members of a tribe are its culture.\u201d <em>Matter of M.E.M., </em>195 Mont. at 333, 635 P.2d at 1316. As KH.\u2019s father is non-Indian, the child\u2019s connection to his Crow Indian culture will be maintained intact primarily through a continuing relationship with his Indian mother, T.L.E. While we express no opinion as to whether T.L.E. deserves a continuation of her parental rights to K.H., we conclude, in light of the curative function of ICWA, that her challenge to the Department\u2019s expert witness, Hicks, is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u00b622 Under Montana law, a witness may be \u201cqualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\u201d and when so qualified, \u201cmay testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d Rule 702, M.R.Evid. Before such expert evidence can be admitted, however, \u201c \u2018some foundation must be laid to show that the expert has special training or education and adequate knowledge on which to base an opinion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matter of HM.O., </em>\u00b6 26, <em>quoting Cottrell v. Burlington Northern R. Co. </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 296, 301, 863 P.2d 381, 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u00b623 Furthermore, in determining whether a proper foundation has been laid for the admission of a qualified expert opinion in an ICWA termination proceeding, the Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings (the Guidelines), promulgated by the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) additionally provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">\u201cD.4. Qualified Expert Witnesses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">(a) Removal of an Indian child from his or her family must be based on competent testimony from one or more experts qualified to speak specifically to the issue of whether continued custody by the parents or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious physical or emotional damage to the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">(b) Persons with the following characteristics are most likely to meet the requirements for a qualified expert witness for purposes of Indian child custody proceedings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>(i) A member of the Indian child\u2019s tribe who is recognized by the tribal community as knowledgeable in tribal customs as they pertain to family organization and childbearing practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">(ii) A lay expert witness having substantial experience in the delivery of child and family services to Indians, and extensive knowledge of prevailing social and cultural standards and childbearing practices within the Indian child\u2019s tribe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">(iii) A professional person having substantial education and experience in the area of his or her specialty.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\"><em>Matter ofH.M.O., </em>\u00b6 30, <em>quoting </em>44 Fed. Reg. 67, 584, 67, 593 (1979) (not codified). While the Guidelines are not binding on state courts and admittedly \u201cadd a dimension to expert testimony not normally required\u201d under Montana law, we have deemed them applicable in the courts of this state because the Guidelines \u201ccomport with the spirit of [ICWA].\u201d <em>Matter of M.E.M., </em>195 Mont. at 337, 635 P.2d at 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u00b624 T.L.E. effectively argues that since the Department could not have qualified social worker Hicks under subparts (i) or (ii) of the Guidelines, Hicks could be qualified as an expert for purposes of ICWA \u2014 if at all \u2014 only under subpart (iii). <em>See Matter ofH.M.O., </em>\u00b6 31. In turn, T.L.E. asserts that Hicks could not qualify as an expert under the third subpart of the Guidelines because, as in <em>Matter ofH.M.O., </em>she does not possess any qualifications beyond that of a normal social worker. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u00b625 The first two subparts of the Guidelines instruct state courts that a qualified ICWA expert should be \u201cknowledgeable in tribal customs as they pertain to family organization and childbearing practices\u201d (first subpart); or should have \u201cextensive knowledge of prevailing social and cultural standards and childbearing practices within the Indian child\u2019s tribe\u201d (second subpart). In our opinion, these references to tribal customs, cultural standards, and tribal childbearing practices found in the first two subparts of the Guidelines help to define who can be considered a qualified ICWA expert under the third subpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u00b626 In keeping with this notion, enlightened state courts have gone beyond the plain language of subpart three of the Guidelines \u2014 appropriately, in our view \u2014 and have concluded that experts should possess more than simply substantial education and experience in the area of their specialty. Rather, they should have <em>expertise in, and substantial knowledge of, Native American families and their childrearing practices. See, e.g., In the Matter of the Welfare of M.S.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>(Minn. App. 1991), 465 N.W.2d 412, 417 (\u201cThe experts should also be conversant with Indian culture and child-rearing practices, lest \u2018the problems Congress has tried to remedy may remain despite the adoption of [ICWA].\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); State <em>ex rel. Juv. Dep\u2019t v. Charles </em>(Or. App. 1984), 688 P.2d 1354, 1359-60 n.3 (\u201c[A]n expert witness within the meaning of [ICWA] must possess special knowledge of social and cultural aspects of Indian life.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b627 Such an approach is consistent with the remedial purpose of ICWA. As the Commentary to the BIA Guidelines regulations explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">[K]nowledge of tribal culture and childrearing practices will frequently be very valuable to the court. Determining the likelihood of future harm frequently involves predicting future behavior \u2014 which is influenced to a large degree by culture. Specific behavior patterns will often need to be placed in the context of the total culture to determine whether they are likely to cause serious emotional harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">44 Fed. Reg. at 67, 593. Indeed, the very adoption of ICWA by Congress was predicated upon an express recognition of the cultural differences between Anglo and Indian notions of the family (e.g., the nuclear family versus the extended family),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the ways in which this cultural disjunction had often resulted in \u201can alarmingly high percentage of Indian families [being] broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies ...\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u00b628  Although we do not hold that an expert ICWA witness qualified under subpart three of the Guidelines must be fluent in the cultural standards of a particular Indian tribe, we conclude that it is highly preferable that any expert witness qualified for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ICWA \u2014 particularly a non-Indian expert witness \u2014 possess significant knowledge of and experience with Indian culture, family structure, and childrearing practices in general. Whether a proffered expert ICWA witness has been sufficiently qualified as an \u201cexpert\u201d remains a matter within the discretion of a district court. Nonetheless, we urge trial courts to ensure that a proper foundation has been established showing such Indian cultural qualifications prior to admitting the testimony of a witness as a qualified ICWA expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b629 As in <em>Matter ofH.M.O., </em>the Department laid an inadequate foundation in this case for the admittance of Hicks\u2019 testimony as a qualified ICWA expert. At the termination hearing, the Department established only the following foundation for the admission of Hicks\u2019 so-called \u201cexpert\u201d opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">Q: Can you briefly describe your education and experience[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">A: I have a Bachelor of Science in education health and human development from Montana State University. I have almost completed halfway \u2014 completed a degree in community counseling, a master\u2019s degree here in Billings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">Q: Do you have contact with Native American people on a regular basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">Q: You have contact with numerous children on a regular basis; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">A: Yes, daily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">Q: Are you familiar with the needs of children and minimally acceptable parenting skills needed to meet those needs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">Where, as here, an ICWA termination proceeding takes place in state court, rather than a tribal forum, it behooves us to take great pains to ensure that the prerequisites of ICWA have been satisfied. We are not confident that ICWA\u2019s requirements have been satisfied here. Hicks testified that she has contact on a \u201cregular basis\u201d with Native American people, but there is no indication that she possesses any special knowledge with respect to Indian culture or childrearing practices. Just because a social worker interacts with Indians, even on a regular basis, it does not necessarily follow that he or she qualifies as an Indian child welfare expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">\u00b630 This Court has previously acknowledged that \u201c \u2018[tjhe separation of Indian children from their families frequently occurs in situations where ... the agency officials involved are unfamiliar with, and often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>disdainful of Indian culture and society ....\u2019 \u201d <em>Matter of M.E.M., </em>195 Mont. at 334, 635 P.2d at 1316-17, <em>quoting </em>S.

While we do not suggest that Hicks\u2019 testimony reveals any disdain for an Indian way of life, it is possible that ignorance of Indian culture and society played an undetermined role in her expressed opinions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Given the fundamental liberty interest at stake in a termination proceeding and the unique role of state courts in carrying out the federal purposes of ICWA, there is all the more reason for proceeding with caution in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b631  We hold that the Department failed to sustain its heavy burden of producing \u201cevidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses,\u201d showing that T.L.E.\u2019s parental rights should be terminated under ICWA. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f). The District Court therefore abused its discretion in implicitly concluding that an adequate foundation had been established for the admission of Hicks\u2019 testimony as that of an appropriately qualified ICWA expert. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s termination of T.L.E.\u2019s parental rights to K.H. pursuant to ICWA, and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Since we have concluded that the Department failed to sustain its weightier burden of proof under ICWA, we need not reach the question of whether the Department sustained its burden for terminating parental rights under the Montana Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b632 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b501-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-11\">. The State of Montana petitioned for the termination of T.L.E.\u2019s parental rights to both of her children, K.L.E. and KH. Because ICWA governs Indian child custody proceedings, the children\u2019s tribe, the Crow Tribe, received notice of the proposed termination actions and petitioned to intervene and remove both actions to tribal court jurisdiction. <em>See </em>25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(b) (authorizing transfer of jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings to tribal court). KL.E. has a different father than K.H., and K.L.E.\u2019s petition was removed to tribal court jurisdiction without objection from her natural father. However, KH.\u2019s natural father is non-Indian and obj ected to the transfer of jurisdiction over his cause to the Crow Tribal Court. Thus, this appeal pertains only to KH.\u2019s state court termination proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\">. T.L.E. has a number of demons from her past with which she continues to grapple. For example, at age seven, she watched her mother murder her father. It appears that she has received little, if any, emotional support from her mother over the years, and continues to have a rocky relationship with her mother. Furthermore, she claims to have been raped at age 12, and again at age 15. T.L.E., who is currently 25 years old, dropped out of school after the eighth grade and has been chemically dependent since age 16. She has never held down stable employment in her life, and has, at times, prostituted herself for drug money and to be able to provide financial support for her children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\">. In all, T.L.E. entered into four separate treatment plans with the Department, spanning from October 8,1996, through March 11,1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\">. According to the authors of an oft-quoted law review article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">An Indian\u2019s extended family includes not only grandparents, and aunts and uncles, but often distant relatives who, by custom, tradition, or necessity have definite responsibilities and duties in child rearing. Although the nuclear family is the generally accepted standard of a basic family unit, the nuclear family concept is frequently inapplicable to Indians. Yet it is the nuclear family standard by which many state courts determine that Indian children are neglected. This built-in bias against Indian child rearing practices is further compounded by state laws ... that frequently make it easy to remove Indian children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az7\">Jesse C. Trentadue &amp; Myra A. DeMontigny, <em>The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978: A Petitioner\u2019s Perspective, </em>62 N.D. L. Rev. 487, 498 (1986) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\">. To illustrate, portions of both Hicks\u2019 testimony as well as the District Court\u2019s order appear to express the view that T.L.E.\u2019s attempts to arrange for the adoption of K.H. by her sister is indicative of a desire by T.L.E. \u201cto relinquish\u201d her parental rights. This prognosis, while entirely consistent with Anglo notions of the nuclear family, could be an unfortunate misinterpretation of a not uncommon behavioral response by an Indian parent in a traditional culture which embraces child rearing within an extended family structure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
