After the Dills settled all of their claims against the Jardines, State Farm filed a motion in limine seeking to (1) amend the caption of the case to remove State Farm as a named defendant; (2) restrict the Dills from stating or otherwise informing the jury that the Jardines were protected by indemnity insurance; and (3) restrict the mention of the fact that the Dills carry underinsured motorist coverage with State Farm. On December 11, 1997, the District Court granted State Farm\u2019s motion in limine. The Dills sought a writ of supervisory control in this matter over the order of the District Court, which this Court granted. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">\u00b62 The issue presented by the writ of supervisory control is whether the District Court erred when it granted State Farm\u2019s motion in limine to restrict the Dills from in any way disclosing to the jury that they are making a claim for underinsured motorist benefits from State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">\u00b63 Jason Dill was a fourteen-year-old pedestrian who was hit and severely injured by a vehicle operated by fifteen-year-old Casey Jar-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>dine. Jardine\u2019s parents owned an auto insurance liability policy with State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company with policy limits of $100,000. In addition, Jason\u2019s parents owned three separate policies of auto insurance issued by State Farm, all of which provided underinsured motorist coverage in the amount of $100,000. Jason\u2019s parents also owned a personal liability umbrella policy endorsement to their homeowner\u2019s policy issued by State Farm that included underinsured motorist coverage with limits of $2.3 million. Jason is a named insured on all of his parents\u2019 applicable insurance policies with State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b64 After suing the Jardines, the Dills made a demand for underinsured motorist benefits from their insurer, State Farm. State Farm refused to pay underinsured motorist benefits. The Dills, therefore, amended their complaint and added State Farm as a party defendant as required by the State Farm policy. The Dills\u2019 four-count amended complaint sought: (1) damages for Jason caused by the negligence of Casey Jardine; (2) damages for Jason for the negligent entrustment of the automobile to Casey Jardine by Jardine\u2019s parents; (3) damages for Jason, his parents, and family for negligent infliction of emotional distress; and (4) a breach of contract action by Jason and his parents against State Farm for failing to pay amounts due pursuant to the underinsured motorist provisions of the auto policies and umbrella policy owned by Jason\u2019s parents. State Farm did not object to being named as a party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b65 After filing the amended complaint, the Dills settled all of their claims against the Jardines for their State Farm liability policy limits of $100,000. The general release executed on the Dills\u2019 behalf in favor of the Jardines specifically reserves the Dills\u2019 right to sue State Farm for payment of underinsured motorist damages pursuant to the Dills\u2019 various policies providing underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b66 State Farm waived subrogation rights against their own insureds, the Jardines. State Farm further consented to the Dills settling for the policy limits of the Jardines\u2019 liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\u00b67 Shortly thereafter, State Farm filed a motion in limine in the District Court seeking to: (1) amend the caption of this case to remove State Farm as a named defendant; (2) restrict the Dills from stating or otherwise informing the jury that Jardine was protected by indemnity insurance; and (3) restrict the mention of the fact that the Dills carry underinsured motorist coverage with State Farm. The District Court granted State Farm\u2019s motion and held that the Dills\u2019 claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>against State Farm would not be ripe for adjudication until after Casey Jardine\u2019s fault was established and damages assessed in a negligence action. The Dills appeal the District Court\u2019s order and request that it be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b68 The standard of review of discretionary trial court rulings is abuse of discretion. <em>See May v. First Nat\u2019l Pawn </em>Brokers, <em>Ltd. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 132, 134, 890 P.2d 386, 388. In <em>Montana Rail Link v. Byard </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 331, 337, 860 P.2d 121, 125, we held that \u201c[t]he standard of abuse of discretion is applied to discretionary rulings, such as trial administration issues, post-trial motions and similar rulings\u201d (citing <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474, 803 P.2d 601, 603).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u00b69 The issue presented by the Dills in their petition for writ of supervisory control in this case is whether the District Court erred when it granted State Farm\u2019s motion in limine to restrict the Dills from in any way disclosing to the jury that they are making a claim for underinsured motorist benefits from State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\u00b610 The Dills\u2019 argument on appeal addresses the issue presented in several parts. We will address each accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">\n<em>Contract versus tort action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">\u00b611 In response to the Dills\u2019 contention that State Farm breached its contract with them, the District Court\u2019s order in limine characterized this case as a tort action rather than as a contract action. The District Court phrased the issue as a tort question of \u201c[w]ho, if anybody, was negligent?\u201d However, Montana law is to the contrary. In <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Estate of Braun </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 125, 793 P.2d 253, State Farm brought suit against its insured, claiming that it had no obligation to pay either uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits. State Farm argued that because the accident occurred in Canada, Canada\u2019s wrongful death damage limitation would apply, meaning that Braun\u2019s estate was not \u201clegally entitled to collect\u201d damages pursuant to the State Farm policy. Our analysis of <em>Braun </em>began with a clear statement that the issues presented were contract, and not tort issues. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\">This case presents a controversy between an insurer and an insured over the interpretation of an insurance contract. As such the dispute sounds in contract and should be resolved by contract law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Respondent also erroneously argues that the Canadian damage limitation shields respondent because it is available to the tort-feasor. In essence, respondent asserts that it is the tort-feasor\u2019s alter-ego. However, tort law is relevant only in as far as the fault requirement is concerned. <em>Once an insured demonstrates a legal entitlement to damages, principles of contract law define the coverage afforded by an underinsurance motorist provision.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><em>Braun, </em>243 Mont. at 127-28, 793 P.2d at 254-55 (emphasis added). \u00b612 Our holding in <em>Braun </em>is consistent with an earlier opinion issued by this Court in an action filed by an insured against State Farm for uninsured motorist benefits. In <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Solem </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 156, 622 P.2d 682, which was decided soon after uninsured coverage became widely available, we stated: \u201cSolem\u2019s action against State Farm isn\u2019t a tort action; rather it is a contract action.\u201d <em>Solem, </em>191 Mont. at 159, 622 P.2d at 684. Because the Dills\u2019 action against State Farm is not a tort action but rather a breach of contract action, this dispute must be resolved by contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b6 13 Moreover, we agree with the Dills that they were required to file a contract action against State Farm in order to comply with the terms of their insurance contract with State Farm. The insurance contract entered into by the Dills provides that in exchange for a premium, State Farm would issue underinsured motorist coverage to the Dills. The contract provides that if there is an accident between the insured and the driver of an underinsured motor vehicle, then two questions must be decided by agreement between the insured and State Farm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">1. Is the <em>insured </em>legally entitled to collect damages from the owner or driver of the <em>uninsured motor vehicle </em>or <em>underinsured motor vehicle', </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">2. If so, in what amount?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The policy further provides that if the parties cannot agree, then they must either arbitrate or litigate these two questions. The policy specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">If either party does not consent to arbitrate these questions, the <em>insured </em>shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>a. file a lawsuit in the proper court against the owner or driver of the <em>uninsured motor vehicle </em>or <em>underinsured motor vehicle </em>and us</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-3\">and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\">c. secure a judgment in that action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">(Underlining added.) The following language appears at page 14 of the policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">THERE IS NO COVERAGE UNTIL THE LIMITS OF LIABILITY OF ALL BODILY INJURY LIABILITY BONDS AND POLICIES THAT APPLY HAVE BEEN USED UP BY PAYMENT OF JUDGMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">In <em>Augustine v. Simonson </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 259, 267, 940 P.2d 116, 121, however, we concluded that in order to prevent unnecessary litigation \u201cthe insured may proceed to bring his or her claim against their UIM carrier whether or not they have fully exhausted the tort-feasor\u2019s insurance policy limits.\u201d Although a claim must first be made with the tort-feasor\u2019s insurance company, the claim does not have to be finally disposed of before proceeding against the underinsurer. <em>See Augustine, </em>283 Mont. at 267, 940 P.2d at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">\u00b6 14 Due to the fact that State Farm is both the liability insurer for the Jardines, and the underinsured motorist carrier for the Dills, State Farm has likely been aware from the inception of these proceedings of the Dills\u2019 actions to both collect the liability coverage carried by the Jardines, and the underinsured motorist benefits from their own policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">\u00b6 15 We have held that when the terms of an insurance contract are clear and unambiguous, the contract language will be enforced. <em>See Augustine, </em>283 Mont. at 263, 940 P.2d at 119. We must give effect to the meaning and intention of the parties as expressed by the language in their contract. <em>See Marko &amp; Co., LLC v. Deaconess/Billings Clinic Health System, </em>1998 MT 26, \u00b6 17, 287 Mont. 293, \u00b6 17, 954 P.2d 1116, \u00b6 17. The Dills have met all of the conditions precedent contained in their State Farm policy. They sued both the driver and State Farm in one action, as the contract required; they settled their claim against the underinsured driver for policy limits, as the contract required; they obtained State Farm\u2019s consent to the settlement; and they reserved their claim against State Farm for underinsured coverage. The State Farm policy requires the insured to file suit against it if the parties are unable to agree that the insured is legally entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>collect damages in a particular amount. Because the Dills and State Farm could not agree on this question, this litigation follows as the next contractual requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b616 State Farm maintains that the issues of both fault and damages remain to be determined and that these issues must be resolved in a direct tort action against Casey Jardine, the settled tort-feasor. The District Court agreed. However, according to the clear terms of the policy there are no issues of fault for a fact-finder to resolve. As noted above, the only two questions that must be resolved either by agreement between the insured and State Farm, or by arbitration or litigation, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">(a) Whether the insured is legally entitled to collect damages from the driver of the underinsured motor vehicle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">(b) If so, in what amount?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Regardless of whether anyone was at fault for the damages caused to the Dills, it is clear by the fact that the Dills received $100,000 from State Farm that they are \u201centitled to collect damages.\u201d The only question remaining, therefore, is what amount the Dills are entitled to collect beyond $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\u00b617 In spite of this, State Farm maintains that it is still entitled to litigate fault as well as damages in its capacity as the underinsured motorist carrier and, thus, that this is a tort action. The policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">If the <em>insured </em>files suit against the owner or driver of the <em>uninsured motor vehicle </em>or <em>underinsured motor vehicle, </em>we have the right to defend on the issues of the legal liability of and the damages owed by such owner or driver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">In this case, the insureds, the Dills, did file suit against the driver, but that litigation has been settled and a full general release has been given so the underinsured driver, Casey Jardine, is no longer a proper party defendant. Thus, there is no underinsured driver for State Farm to defend. State Farm had the opportunity to litigate fault in this case when it represented Jardine outright. Instead, it settled the issue when it offered the Dills the liability policy limits on Jardine\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">\u00b618  The question of whether anyone was at fault and the question of whether the insured is legally entitled to collect damages from the underinsured driver are not the same. One can be legally entitled to collect damages without first proving fault in a court of law \u2014 the Dills have done just that. Conversely, an insured could prove fault on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the part of the defendant, and yet not be legally entitled to collect damages. The critical point to be noted is that the State Farm policy only requires that the insured show that he or she is legally \u201centitled to collect damages\u201d \u2014 not prove fault. The Dills squarely answered that question in the affirmative when they collected $100,000 from State Farm in its capacity as the Jardines\u2019 liability insurance carrier. The common sense reading of the language of the policy leads to the logical conclusion that if one collects damages, one is legally entitled to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\">\u00b6 19 Once an insured demonstrates a legal entitlement to damages, principles of contract law define the coverage afforded by an underinsured motorist provision. Tort law is relevant only as far as fault is concerned. State Farm had the opportunity to litigate this case in the tort arena when it represented Casey Jardine as his liability insurer and, in fact, reserved that right in the policy when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">If the <em>insured </em>files suit against the owner or driver of the <em>uninsured motor vehicle </em>or <em>underinsured motor vehicle, </em>we have the right to defend on the issues of the legal liability of the damages owed by such owner or driver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">(Underlining added.) Underinsured motorist coverage, on the other hand, is first-party coverage which is a carrier\u2019s direct promise to its insured to pay the insured for a loss. <em>See Kratz v. Kratz </em>(Okla. 1995), 905 P.2d 753, 755. The recovery of the insured is based on the terms of the policy, and so the action is one based on contract law. When State Farm accepted a premium from the Dills for underinsured motorist coverage, it contractually established its own liability for the tort of another. Because the tort-feasor has paid his policy limits and has been released from this action, we conclude that State Farm\u2019s contract now dictates the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b620 There are two insurance policies involved in this case; the Jardines\u2019 liability insurance policy with State Farm, and the Dills\u2019 underinsured motorist coverage with State Farm. State Farm maintains that the introduction of any evidence of insurance into this action would be reversible error. We conclude, however, that evidence of both policies is admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\n<em>Admissibility of the underinsured motorist policy between the Dills and State Farm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\u00b621 Rule 411, M.R.Evid., is entitled, \u201cLiability insurance.\u201d It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue of whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of <em>insurance against liability when offered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership, or control, or bias or prejudice of a witness.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">(Emphasis added). Rule 411, M.R.Evid., by its terms, applies only to liability insurance and therefore does not preclude the admissibility of the underinsured motorist policy between the Dills and State Farm. The Dills\u2019 complaint against State Farm is a coverage dispute pursuant to the terms of the State Farm policy, not a negligence action. Therefore, the result here does not contravene the purpose of Rule 411, M.R.Evid., on the admissibility of insurance. The rule only prohibits the introduction of insurance when it is offered for the purpose of showing negligence or liability. Here, the issues to be tried are separate and the rule is not violated. <em>See Klaudt v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 247, 253, 658 P.2d 1065, 1068. Accordingly, Rule 411, M.R.Evid., does not preclude the admission into evidence of the underinsured motorist policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\n<em>Admissibility of the liability policy between the Jardines and State Farm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b622 Rule 411, M.R.Evid., precludes evidence of liability insurance \u201cupon the issue of whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully.\u201d As explained above, the Dills demonstrated that they are legally entitled to collect damages from the underinsured driver by collecting the limits of his liability coverage from State Farm. Because the policy does not impose upon the insured the obligation to demonstrate the legal liability of the tort-feasor, the State Farm liability policy would not be utilized to demonstrate that the tort-feasor \u201cacted negligently or otherwise wrongfully.\u201d As Rule 411, M.R.Evid., allows, the policy would be offered \u201cfor another purpose\u201d; to establish that the Dills have complied with the policy terms by settling with the tort-feasor\u2019s liability insurer before turning to their own underinsurance carrier for relief. The liability policy is relevant and admissible only to establish the Dills\u2019 compliance, and not to establish fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\n<em>Admissibility of State Farm\u2019s settlement for policy limits on the Jar-dine liability claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b623  The Dills maintain that State Farm\u2019s settlement of the underlying liability claim against Jardine is admissible evidence pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ant to Rules 401 and 402, M.R.Evid. They further maintain that it is admissible as impeachment evidence pursuant to Rules 607 and 801(d)(2), M.R.Evid. Because State Farm has stipulated to the fact that State Farm paid the Dills $100,000, the policy limit, on behalf of Casey Jardine, and that it will pay any jury verdict that exceeds that amount up to the policy limit of $2.3 million, we conclude that evidence of State Farm\u2019s settlement of the policy limits on Casey Jar-dine\u2019s liability claim need not be brought before the jury. State Farm is bound to its stipulation that it will pay any damages above $100,000 awarded to the Dills by the jury. Likewise, State Farm has admitted that the Dills have settled with the tort-feasor\u2019s liability insurance carrier, which is all the information the Dills need to explain their attempt to obtain underinsured motorist benefits. It is not essential that the jury be apprised of the amount actually paid to the Dills on behalf of Casey Jardine. Simple knowledge that the policy limits were paid will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">\u00b624 Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand this case for a trial between the Dills and State Farm to determine the amount of damages, if any, the Dills are entitled to recover pursuant to their underinsured motorist policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b625 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b167-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT, GRAY, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
