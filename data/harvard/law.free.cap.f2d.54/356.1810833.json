It was not character evidence; nor did the ease call for character evidence. It was an attempt to prove aets of an individual by purely hearsay evidence. The testimony admitted was not admissible, either in a criminal or civil proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-29\">There is no evidence in the case that the defendant ever carried around on his person, or in a vehicle, or left in any place for a customer, or traveled to solicit, or solicited, or accepted orders for, within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>section 23, intoxicating liquors. The only evidence is that he twice sold liquor at certain premises described in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The decree of the District Court is reversed, and the bill of complaint ordered dismissed, for want of proof.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
