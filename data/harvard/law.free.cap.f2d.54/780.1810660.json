From an order of the Board of Tax Appeals holding it was not, this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-19\">This foundation, unincorporated, was organized October 16, 1920, by officers and employees of Gimbel Brothers, Inc., of PMladelphia. It has no stock or shares, and collects no dues or assessments. It is sustained by voluntary gifts such as are here involved. Nonvoting membership is open to all employees of that company after twelve months\u2019 service, and voting and office holding to employees after twenty years\u2019 service. The objects of the foundation are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-20\">\u201cFirst. To grant Pensions to those who, after twenty-flve years of service to Gimbel Brothers, Incorporated, of Philadelphia, and having automatically become members of the Quarter Century Club, shall be chosen for retirement, because of age or infirmity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-21\">\u201cSecond. To effect Life Insurance in a standard company for every employe of Gimbel Brothers, Incorporated, of PhiladelpMa, after one full year of service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-22\">\u201cThird. To invest the Savings of employes of Gimbel Brothers, Incorporated, of PMladelphia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-23\">\u201cFourth. To extend Relief to employes of Gimbel Brothers, Incorporated, of Philadelphia, through the co-operation of Gimbel Brothers, Incorporated, with the mutual organization of employes known as the Gimhel Brothers Employes\u2019 Mutual Aid Society.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-24\">\u201cFifth. To award Scholarships to employes of Gimbel Brothers, Incorporated, of PMladelphia, \u00bfnnually on a system of merit, in institutions giving business and technical education.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-25\">In its practical working, the main or dominant purpose of the foundation is the grant of pensions, in addition to wMeh oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>er objects, such as carrying life insurance of employees, the extension of relief, and educational scholarships\u2019 at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, and Drexel Institute, are incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">This general subject was considered by this court in Estate of Edward W. Bok v. McCaughn (C. C. A.) 42 F.(2d) 616, 619, and Mutual Aid &amp; Benefit Association of Forstmann &amp; Huffmann Employees v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C. C. A.) 42 F.(2d) 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">In view of these cases, to which may be added John R. Sibley, Ex\u2019r, 16 B. T. A. 915; Eagan v. Commissioner (C. C. A.) 43 F.(2d) 881, 71 A. L. R. 863; Y. M. C. A. Retirement Fund, 18 B. T. A. 139, we are of opinion the Board of Tax Appeals was in error, and that the voluntary payments here made to the Gimbel Foundation should be exempted. In reaching the conclusion to exempt these contributions to charity, we feel, as said in the Bok Case, we do not \u201cdefeat the obvious purpose of Congress to encourage gifts of the class under consideration,\u201d and we are in accord with Horace Binney\u2019s definition of charity there quoted, viz.: \u201cWhatever is given for * * * the love of your neighbor * * * given from these motives and to these ends, free from the stain or taint of every consideration that is personal, private, or selfish.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
