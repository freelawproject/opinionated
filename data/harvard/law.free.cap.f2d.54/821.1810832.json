The electric circuit for so controlling the valve, it is stated, generally leads to some room or rooms remote from the fumaee and the valve.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">Atherton was granted a patent, No. 1,617,094, issued February 8, 1927, upon an application filed June 27, 1924, during the pendency of an application by Payne, serial No. 513,204, filed November 5, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">Following the issuance of the patent to Atherton, Payne, on January 16, 1928, copied claim 1 of the patent for the purpose of bringing about an interference. Such interference was duly declared by the Examiner on February 15,1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">The count reads as follows: \u201cA remote control valve comprising in combination a valve adapted for continuous rotation in one direction, an operating stem connected to the valve to rotate therewith, contact pins on the stem, brushes supported adjacent the stem to form an electric circuit by contact with the pins, electrical means to rotate the valve step by step and cause the pins to make and break an electric circuit at various positions of the valve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">Atherton moved to dissolve the interference upon the ground that Payne \u201chas no right to make the count. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">This motion was denied by the Law Examiner to whom it was referred, whereupon the Examiner of Interferences, no proofs having been taken, rendered his decision awarding priority to Payne who, by reason of his prior filing date, is the senior party.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-16\">So we have before us as the primary issue to be determined, the ancillary question of Payne\u2019s right to make the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-17\">The elements of the count are (a) \u201ca valve adapted for continuous rotation in one direction\u201d; (b) \u201can operating stem connected to the valve to rotate therewith\u201d; (c) \u201ccontact pins on the stem\u201d; (d) \u201cbrushes supported adjacent the stem to form an electric circuit by contact with the pins\u201d; and (e) \u201celectrical means to rotate the valve step by step. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-18\">These elements are all present in Atherton, being disclosed in the drawings, as indicated by numerals, and the function of each member so indicated is specifically described in the specification. Thus the element (a) is a cylindrical member numbered 13 in the' drawings; element (b) is numbered 15 and is referred to in the specification as \u201can operating stem\u201d; of element (e) the specification says \u201ca contact pin 36 is fixed in the stem 15 and extends radially [and] a similar contact pin 37 is fixed in the stem 15 and extends radially and diametrically opposite the pin 36 and is spaced longitudinally from the plane of the pin 36\u201d; element (d) consists of \u201cinsulated spring \u2022brushes-38 and 39\u201d; and element (e) comprises \u201ca solenoid or plunger electromagnet\u201d and means to connect it with the valve through a pawl.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-19\">Elements (a), (d), and (e) are conceded to be present in Payne, but, in behalf of Atherton, it is insisted that Payne does not disclose either element (b), \u201can operating stem,\u201d etc., or element (e), \u201ccontact pins on the stem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-20\">The Board of Appeals held, in effect, that a certain shaft (numbered 24) in Payne\u2019s drawing is driven from a wheel (numbered 32) through screws (numbered 33), and that one of the figures demonstrates that the drive is also through a key (numbered 25), and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-21\">\u201c * * * In the construction of each party all three parts, that is, the valve, the operating disk or wheel and the projecting stem which carries the contact members are rigidly united to form a unitary member. We see no patentable difference in the constructions and deem the claim in this respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>readable on the Payne construction whether the shaft 24 alone or said shaft and the surrounding boss on the valve be regarded as the stem. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Upon the \u201ccontact pins\u201d element, the Board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-6\">\u201cAn additional reason assigned by Ather-' ton for denying the claim to Payne is that Payne does not have contact pins on the stem. No reason is seen for not regarding the rivets 71 as such contact pins. It is true they are not radial pins extending directly from the shaft as in the Atherton construction but the language of the claim is clearly broad enough to include pins indirectly supported on the stem as in the Payne construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Appellant\u2019s brief says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-8\">\u201c * * * It is true that there is a \u2018shaft 24\u2019 extending through the ratchet wheel and valve and that these parts are connected to rotate together, as by means of a key 25; but, so far as concerns the operation of the valve, the shaft and key might be omitted. The said shaft is not an \u2018operating stem\u2019 under any fair interpretation of the issue. It is merely a means for holding the parts together. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-10\">\u201cIt is an abuse of language to call the Payne \u2018shaft 24\u2019 an operating stem for the valve. It is not a valve stem; and if it could properly be so called, <em>it is not an operating stem. </em>* * * The issue therefore calls for a stem which <em>operates the valve.\u201d </em>(Italics quoted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">Appellant further argues that, even if the shaft itself, or the member built up by treating the shaft and the surrounding boss on the valve as a unitary member, be held to be an operating valve stem, \u201cthen there clearly are no pins on the stem,\u201d because the rivets 71 held by the Board of Appeals to be contact points are not located <em>\u201con the </em>stem\u201d by Payne, and \u201cthe only reasonable interpretation of the issue locates the contacts <em>on the </em>stem.\u201d (Italics quoted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">These contentions of appellant as to the mechanical differences appear to be correct. So apparently the conclusions of the tribunals of the Patent Office were reached by applying the rule that the counts of an interference are to be given the broadest interpretation which their terminology will permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">Appellant argues that this rule of broad interpretation may not properly be applied in a case such as that at bar; that the interference is between a <em>patent </em>and an <em>application, </em>not between two applications, and therefore, the count being taken from the patent, its terms must be given the limited meaning which they had in the patent, and the limitations as expressed in the claim which became the count are material, and may not be ignored in an interference proceeding, whatever may be the rule in infringement and ex parte cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-15\">Under the facts of this ease we think it unnecessary to its determination for us to discuss the arguments made and authorities cited relating to the rules of law applicable in interference contests between a patent and an application on the one hand, and between two applications on the other, nor do we regard it necessary here to discuss ambiguity or equivalency.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-16\">The count has specific limitations as recited, supra, two of which, (b) \u201can operating stem connected with the valve to rotate therewith,\u201d and (e) \u201ccontact pins on the stem,\u201d are in issue. Expressly defined limitations we may not disregard. In re Bijur, 40 F.(2d) 999, 17 C. C. P. A. 1134; Thompson v. Pettis, 44 F.(2d) 420, 18 C. C. P. A. 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-17\">Assuming without deciding that the Board of Appeals was correct in holding that the Payne structure discloses a part which meets the requirement of the court as to an \u201coperating stem,\u201d we are unable to agree that Payne\u2019s rivets meet the limitation called for by Atherton\u2019s \u201ccontact pins on the stem.\u201d Payne\u2019s rivets are not on the part held by the Board to be an operating stem.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-18\">In Thompson v. Pettis, supra, we held, as stated in the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-19\">\u201cA wire extending through an opening previously made in a sand plug filling an opening in a mold part and loosely passing therethrough, is not a means \u2018embedded in the plug.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-20\">In Field v. Stow, 49 F.(2d) 1072, 18 C. C. P. A. 1502, where a count relating to a mine car called for \u201ca floor supported on * * * sill flanges\u201d and it was insisted that \u201csupported on\u201d was synonymous with \u201csupported by,\u201d a view apparently taken by the tribunals of the Patent Office, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-22\">\u201cWe are unable to agree with the conclusion reached by the Patent Office tribunals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-23\">\u201cAppellant had the right to expressly limit his patent claim, as he did, to a floor supported <em>on </em>sill flanges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>\u201cThe language 'a floor supported on sill flanges/ in our opinion, means a floor in contact with the upper surfaces of the sill flanges. Had the count defined a floor supported <em>by </em>sill flanges, it would have been sufficiently comprehensive to cover a floor in contact with either the upper or the lower surfaces of the flanges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Since Atherton expressly limited his claim to contact points <em>on </em>the stem and Payne\u2019s disclosure does not read upon the limitation, it follows that, in our opinion, Payne may not make the claim which constitutes the count in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">BLAND and LENROOT, Associate Judges, dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
