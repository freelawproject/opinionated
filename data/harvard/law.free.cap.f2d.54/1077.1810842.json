In point of fact no question has ever been raised in this court until this date that the \u201ccourt had no jurisdiction by reason of the failure of the parties themselves to file a written waiver of jury trial. We make the order now because all parties agree that it be made.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
