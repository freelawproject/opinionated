There is nothing in the record clearly to indicate that it was relied upon by the appellee in the District Court nor considered by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">To the end that the effect, if any, of this statute may be considered by the District Court, the judgment below is reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial. The petition for rehearing is denied without prejudice to the raising of the question of the effect of the statute referred to on the new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
