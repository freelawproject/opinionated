United States, 282 U. S. 194, 51 S. Ct. 119, 75 L. Ed. 291. The appellees raised no objection to the granting of the motion except in so far as it sought to have costs taxed against them. A rule of this court (rule XXXI, subd. 1) provides: \u201cIn all eases where any suit shall be dismissed in this court, except where the dismissal shall be for want of jurisdiction, costs shall be allowed to the appellee, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\u201d The motion does not show that the case is within an exception stated in the rule. The rule is broad enough in its terms to cover the dismissal of a cause which became moot after the appeal was taken. The rule having been adopted, exaction of compliance with it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>reasonably is to be expected by litigants. Green v. Elbert, 137 U. S. 615, 11 S. Ct. 188, 34 L. Ed. 792. The appeal and tbe case are dismissed; the costs to be taxed against the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
