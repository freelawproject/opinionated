Said., support is constructed of strap iron in the shape of a \u201cT.\u201d It is intended as a substitute for the wooden, block formerly used for the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">AppeEant\u2019s appHcation was filed on July 24, 1926; the application of appeEee was filed on September 21, 1926. AppeEee, therefore, is the junior party, and the burden was upon him to estabHsh priority of invention by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">' The Board of Appeals found that appeEee conceived and reduced the invention to practice in 1925, while the earliest date \u2022claimed and proven by appeEant for conception and reduction to practice was in 1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The Examiner of Interferences, whose decision' was reversed by the Board, held that \u25a0appeHee\u2019s testimony as to conception by him in 1925 was very unsatisfactory, but that, assuming without deciding that appellee had established conception in 1925, he was not entitled to a date for reduction to practice prior to his filing date, September 21, 1926, and was lacking in diligence from just prior to July 2, 1926, the date accorded to appeEant for conception, to said filing date. The Examiner, for the reasons stated, awarded priority of invention to appeEant.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">AppeEant contends that the Board erred in finding that appellee conceived and reduced the invention to practice prior to the date awarded to appeEant for conception of the invention; that the evidence does not warrant a finding that appeEee conceived the invention in 1925, as found by the Board, and further contends that, if he did conceive and diselose it, the device claimed by appeEee to have been made and demonstrated was not, in fact or in law, a reduction to practice because the device was not tested to determine its utihty. AppeEant also contends that, if appeEee did conceive the invention prior to .appellant\u2019s conception, appeEee was lacking in d\u00fcigenee in reducing the invention to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">The questions here involved are almost wholly questions of fact. For us to hold that appellee did not in fact conceive and disclose the invention to others in 1926, and did not make a device embodying the invention in 1925 and demonstrate it in the presence of others, would necessitate our finding that, as to conception, appeEee and three of his witnesses were guilty of gross and unblushing perjury in their testimony herein, and that, as to the demonstration of the deviee by appellee, he and two of his witnesses were similarly gmlty of perjury in their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">WhEe the testimony indicates that appellee\u2019s witnesses were biased in his favor, we do not think that sueh discrepancies occur in their testimony as warrant the conclusion that they testified falsely as to the disclosure by appeEee to them in 1925 of the invention here involved, or that the two witnesses who also corroborated appellee as to the demonstration, in 1925, of the deviee embodying the invention, testified falsely with respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">Therefore we find no error in the finding of the Board of Appeals that appellee conceived the invention and made and demonstrated a device embodying the invention in the spring of 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">The next question is whether such making and demonstration of the deviee constituted a reduction to practice of <em>the </em>invention. The Examiner of Interferences held that it did not; the Board of Appeals held to the contrary. \u2022 Appellee\u2019s corroborating witnesses, two in number, testified that appeEee fastened said device on a steel buck, attached an outlet box to the deviee, and showed them how the device held the outlet box in place. This was done upon a job upon which appeEee was foreman of electrical wiring, and the witnesses were, under his direction, engaged in the particular work of placing outlet boxes in the partitions of the buEding.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Appellant contends that, to constitute reduction to practice, a test should have been made to ascertain whether it would stand the strains applied thereto by pulls on the conduit, whether the conduit wotdd be pulled from the support, or the support pulled from the mounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">With respect to this the Board of Appeals said: \u201c * * * In our opinion the device under consideration is of that type where actual use test is not necessary. We consider that the making of the device and placing it in position on the buck with the outlet box attached was sufficient proof to those skilled in the art that it would be successful. The fact that heavier stock would be more desirable than the lighter material-employed we do not find constitutes a material deficiency in the proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">We agree with the foregoing statement of the Board. In the ease of Sachs v. Wads-worth, 48 F.(2d) 928, 18 C. C. P. A. 1284, we held that an electric service switch box, embodying the invention involved in said case was of such a simple nature that its construction constituted a reduction to practice without test other than opening and closing the switch box lid.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In the case of Downs v. Andrews, 58 App. D. C. 91, 25 F.(2d) 218, 224, in an opinion written by the late Judge Smith, a former judge of this court, it was said: \u201c * * * If the operative means accomplishes the desired end, reduction to practice is established, although it appears on inspection that the elements of the deviee should have been made stronger, or given a better shape, arrangement, or adjustment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Finally, appellant contends that, even if appellee was the first to conceive and reduce the invention to practice, nevertheless the Board of Appeals erred in awarding appellee priority, because, appellant contends, appellee was not diligent in giving to the public the benefit of his invention, and invokes the doctrine declared in the ease of Mason v. Hepburn, 13 App. D. C. 86, and the decision of this court in the case of Miller v. Hayman, 46 F.(2d) 188, 197, 18 C. C. P. A. 848. These cases hold that, where an inventor conceals or suppresses his invention until another inventor has entered the field, and, by his independent efforts, genius, skill, and expenditure of money, has discovered the invention and given to the public knowledge of it by placing it upon the market, said first inventor should not, under such circumstances, be awarded priority over the subsequent inventor.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">In the case of Townsend v. Smith, 36 F.(2d) 292, 296, 17 C. C. P. A. 647, this court said: \u201c * * * Where an inventor has established priority of conception, disclosure and reduction to practice, in the absence of any elearly proved abandonment, his right to a patent has not become forfeited either to the public or to his rival. It has been held that a lapse of two years between a reduction to practice and the filing of an application, does not, in itself, constitute an abandonment. Rolfe v. Hoffman, 26 App. D. C. 336.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">In the ease of Miller v. Hayman, supra, we had occasion tq consider under what circumstances an inventor might forfeit to his later rival the right to receive a patent for his invention. We there held that the forfeiture of such right depends upon a doctrine akin to that of equitable estoppel, and said: \u201cWe think it proper to state that, as estoppels preclude a party from showing the truth, they are not favored and should not be applied to any case where the facts do not elearly justify their application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">In the case of Sachs v. Wadsworth, supra, we reaffirmed the foregoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">In the case at bar, the evidence shows inactivity of appellee with respect to the invention for about one year. His testimony is that the reason for suehi inactivity was his inability to secure a sample of door buck upon which to demonstrate his deviee to one Knight who, in 1926, instituted the manufacture of appellees deviee. However this may be, we do not think the facts in evidence warrant a finding of concealment or suppress sion by appellee to justify the application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel, or a doctrine akin thereto, against him, particularly in view of the fact that we cannot find from the evidence in the record that appellee was spurred into activity by the entrance of appellant into the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">We find no error in the decision of the Board of Appeals, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
