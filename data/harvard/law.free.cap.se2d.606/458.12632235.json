The facts of this case, stated in greater detail in the earlieropinion, show that Peverall worked as an Emergency Medical Technician for Alamance County until two vehicular accidents forced him to retire based on disability. Following his retirement on disability, Alamance County adopted a new retroactive policy that required county employees to have completed twenty years of continuous employment (instead of five years required under the old policy) to receive benefits. Although Peverall qualified under the old policy with more than five years of employment, he did not have the requisite twenty years of service to qualify for benefits under the new policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Peverall brought suit against the county alleging tort, contract, and constitutional claims. The tort claims were previously dismissed based on sovereign immunity. Peverall appealed this decision, but this Court affirmed the decision of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=577%20S.E.2d%20632\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the first appeal, both parties requested a trial date in August 2003. Before trial, the trial court granted Alamance County motions for protective orders regarding the taking of Alamance County Commissioners' depositions, and to limit the number of depositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, on 2 September 2003, Alamance County moved for summary judgment and Peverall moved for class certification. The next day, Peverall moved to amend the amended complaint, and on 15 September 2003, he moved to amend his motion for class certification. On 21 October 2003, the trial court denied class certification, denied the motion to amend, and granted partialsummary judgment to Alamance County on Peverall's 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By this appeal, Peverall first contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to amend the complaint, and granting Alamance County's motions for protective orders and partial summary judgment. Alamance County responds that Peverall's appeal of these issues are impermissibly interlocutory. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   An order is interlocutory if it is made during the pendency of an action and does not dispose of the case but requires further action by the trial court in order to finally determine the rights of all parties involved in the controversy.\n   <em>\n    See Veazey v.

But there are two instances where a party may appeal interlocutory orders: (1) when there has been a final determination as to one or more of the claims and the trial court certifies that there is no just reason to delay the appeal, and (2) if delaying the appeal would prejudice a substantial right.\n   <em>\n    See Liggett Group Inc. v.

Thus, Peverall is limited to the second route of appeal, namely where \"the trial court's decision deprives the appellant of a substantial right which would be lost absent immediate review.\"\n   <em>\n    N.C.

Accordingly, we dismiss this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Protective orders and a denial of a motion to compel are discovery orders.

But the transcript of the hearing on class certification and interrogatory answers by the county indicate that there are potentially 376 potential class members, the employees employed with the County of Alamance who had five but less than twenty years of service as of 31 July 1999. The findings fail to address the 376 potential class members, or whether Peverall could fairly and adequately represent them as named plaintiff. Moreover, the trial court made no findings regarding the expected variance in damages; instead, the findings indicate only that variance could be expected. The record also shows that the trial date had been frequently moved, however the findings fail to indicate why adequate notice could not be given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We conclude that the findings of fact are insufficient to allow us an effective appellate review of the trial court's denial of class certification.
