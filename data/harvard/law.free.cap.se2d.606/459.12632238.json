The State's evidence tended to show that at approximately 1:20 a.m. on 22 June 2003, Tyler Singleton (Singleton) stopped at a McDonald's restaurant on the way home from her boyfriend's house. Singleton ordered her food at a drive-through window. Defendant, Travis Atkins, Trina Leavy and Leavy's son were waiting to place their order in the vehicle behind Singleton. Defendant, who according to Atkins was drunk, exited the vehicle and walked up to Singleton's open driver's side window. Defendant hit Singleton in the facewith a silver handgun. Singleton tried to roll up the window, but could not. Defendant again hit Singleton in the face and said, \"Give it up, b____.\" Singleton gave defendant her wallet and defendant ran off. Singleton identified defendant as her assailant in a police photo line-up and in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A jury found defendant guilty as charged. The trial court sentenced defendant to consecutive terms of 77 months to 102 months and 29 months to 44 months imprisonment. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant assigns error to several remarks made by the trial judge in the presence of the jury. He argues that the trial judge's comments were sarcastic, demeaning, critical of defense counsel's performance and violated his constitutional rights to an impartial trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The judge's duty of impartiality extends to defense counsel.

During cross-examination of Singleton, defense counsel questioned her about the composite drawing of her assailant. The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Q. Okay. To you would it be a fair statement that - now this is just your own subjective opinion. Would it be a fair statement -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE COURT: Are you going to ask her what her opinion is or are you going to tell her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I'm going to ask her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: Well ask her is it your opinion so-and-so. That's the way you do a question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After re-direct examination of Singleton, the following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: No further questions, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE COURT: Anything further Mr. Wells?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: In response to that question -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE COURT: Well, I said is there anything further?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In recross-examination, defense counsel asked Singleton whether it would be a fair statement that defendant's hairstyle at trial was \"like dreadlocks or dreads.\" Singleton responded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A. I guess. I don't know. I don't put dreadlocks in my hair and I don't really know exactly what those are.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: But in any event you do know what cornrows are. They've got - it's like a -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: Well, now wait a minute. Are you going to ask her what they are or are you going to tell her what they are?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: I'm allowed to ask leading questions on cross-examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: Yeah, but ask her what they are. Don't you describe them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: I'm allowed that, Your Honor, with all due respect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE COURT: I said you have to ask her the question. Don't you testify to what they are. Ask her does she know what they are.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Is it not correct -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE COURT: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: - that cornrows consist of rows of hair just like maybe a cornfield would have rows of corn and that they are very distinct lines in between. Is that not a correct statement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant next cites to cross-examination of Officer Scott Lascallette of the Greenville Police Department. Defense counsel asked Officer Lascallette about the police \"be on the lookout\" report issued in the early morning hours of 22 June 2003. Reading from the report, Officer Lascallette answered,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A. (As read) \"Same occurred around 0128 hours this date at McDonalds, 2116 Southeast Greenville Boulevard. Subject is a black male, six foot, 220 pounds, white shirt, jeans. Subject was driving a smoke blue Chevrolet Cavalier with chrome wheels. There were also two other black males in the vehicle as well. No description, no direction of travel. If located, stop and hold GPD,\" which stands for Greenville Police Department.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q. Okay, and so you mentioned the correction - that you transmitted 200 pounds, so it should have been reported as 200?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Q. And then you transmitted there was a blue Chevrolet Cavalier, but we've since then - I mean since then the Greenville Police Department -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE COURT: Well do we know what the Greenville Police did, Mr. Wells. Can you ask a question rather than testifying. Ask him did -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: May I approach the bench, Your Honor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE COURT: No, just go ahead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Since then, the Greenville Police Department determined - there's no dispute that the vehicle that was used was a Pontiac Sunbird. Is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   During the cross-examination of Travis Atkins, defendant points to the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q. And Monte House is a little taller than you are. That's your testimony?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A. Uh-huh. (indicates affirmatively).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q. How certain are you of that, that he's taller than you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A. Pretty certain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q. And on June the 22nd of this year, he was a little bit taller than you - than you werethen?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   THE COURT: Has he shrunk? That's been four or five months ago, isn't it? He hasn't changed in size, has he? He hasn't changed has he, Mr. Atkins?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A. No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Later, defense counsel questioned Travis Atkins about his suspended sentence for discharging a weapon into occupied property conviction.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q. And in testifying, are you hoping that you will get some help from the State?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A. No sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Q. You're not hoping to get some help from the State? You don't have any guarantee of help -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q. - but you're hoping to get some, aren't you? You'd like to have some help?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A. Yeah, I'd like to have some help, yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Q. All right, so it's fair to say you are hoping -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   THE COURT: Well, now, Mr. Wells, you're putting words in his mouth. He said he'd like to have some.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defense counsel then questioned Atkins about pending charges as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q. And do you have an expired registration -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q. And in addition to driving while license revoked, do you have a no operator's license?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A. Yes, sir\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   THE COURT: That would probably follow. His license were revoked. Go ahead, Mr. Wells. Anything else?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q. Well are those two separate incidences of no operator's license -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   THE COURT: Mr. Wells, how much more of this are you going into? These are pending charges anyway, aren't they?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor, they are pending.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Q. Do you have a resisting public officer pending?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you. I have no further questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, defendant challenges the trial judge's comments during the State's examination of witness Greg Leavy. After the prosecutor established that people were drinking before the assault, the following exchange ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Q. Was Jarian Dupree drinking?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Q. Was he drunk?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Q. Were you drunk?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I would ask the questions be put in the proper form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   THE COURT: All right, Mr. Perry, Mr. Wellswants you to put the questions in proper form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendant also challenges the trial court's remarks outside the presence of the jury as belittling and unfairly biased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   An examination of these instances reveals that the trial court's actions did not indicate any opinion towards the defendant's case or any negative attitude toward defense counsel, but rather revealed the trial judge's attempt to an efficient and controlled trial. Rather than expressing an opinion as to the truthfulness of the witness, the court merely reminded the attorney of the witness' testimony in some of the exchanges. Some comments were for the purpose of obtaining a proper understanding and clarification of somewhat ambiguous questions, while others can be reasonably viewed as an attempt to maintain progress and proper decorum in the trial.\n   <em>\n    See State v. White,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"790203\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/340/264/#p299\">\n    340 N.C. 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 299,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=457%20S.E.2d%20841\">\n    457 S.E.2d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 861,\n   <em>\n    cert. denied,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"324192,326433,325570,326147,328450,325243,328216,323051,328556,324366,324911,327448,327675,328317\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/994/\">\n    516 U.S. 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20436\">\n    133 L. Ed. 2d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) (trial court has \"duty to control the examination of witnesses, for the purposes of conserving the trial court's time and protecting the witness from prolonged, needless, or abusive examination\"). Defendant has pointed to no statement by the trial court which, taken together with other allegedly improper statements or separately, can be said to constitute a prejudicial expression of opinion on an issue of fact or to intimate a position detrimental to defendant's case. Furthermore, the trial court's remarks when the jury was not present were clearly not prejudicial to defendant, since it was not observed by the jury. Thisassignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Defendant also contends the trial court committed plain error by failing to instruct the jury on voluntary intoxication. Defendant acknowledges, however, that his trial counsel specifically requested that the trial court not instruct the jury on the defense of voluntary intoxication. The record discloses that when the trial court inquired about a voluntary intoxication instruction during the charge conference, defense counsel expressly objected to the instruction as part of his trial strategy because the defense's theory was that defendant was not the perpetrator. Out of an abundance of caution, the trial judge discussed with defense counsel the evidence of defendant's intoxication and asked defense counsel if he wanted the instruction. Defense counsel again objected to the jury being instructed on voluntary intoxication and the trial court yielded to counsel's request. The record makes clear defendant sought to prevent the trial court from instructing the jury on voluntary intoxication. We will not entertain defendant's complaint that the granting of his request prejudiced him.\n   <em>\n    See State v.
