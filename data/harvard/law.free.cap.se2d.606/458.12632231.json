The parties adopted one child in 1993 and another child was born to the parties in 1996. Plaintiff filed a complaint on 7 August 2000 seeking child custody and support, postseparation support, alimony, a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, and attorneys' fees. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, an answer, and a counterclaim on 6 September 2000. In his counterclaim, defendant sought child custody and support, an immediate custody order, a psychological evaluation, and equitable distribution of the marital property. Plaintiff and defendant were divorced on 4March 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court entered an equitable distribution judgment and order in which all the marital debt, totaling $637,641.80, was distributed to defendant. Plaintiff was awarded a distributive award in the amount of $358,719.08. Plaintiff was ordered to execute a quitclaim deed to the former marital home to defendant. Defendant was ordered to then immediately place the home on the market and to pay plaintiff the net proceeds from the sale. The balance of the distributive award was to be paid in monthly installments beginning on 1 May 2006 and in an amount of no less than $2,000, excluding interest. Interest on the distributive award was set at eight percent, and interest payments were due monthly, beginning 1 June 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Instead of selling the former marital home to a third party, defendant purchased the marital home for himself and his new wife. The marital home was appraised at $990,000. Defendant took out a first mortgage of $643,500, and a second mortgage of $215,000, which was to pay down the distributive award at a lower interest rate. Prior to purchasing the former marital home, defendant was living in a home he owned, and for which his employer paid the mortgage and utility expenses. In addition, defendant and his new wife owned two other houses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A hearing on alimony, child support and attorneys' fees was held on 11 July, 15 July and 21 August 2003. In an order entered 4 November 2003, defendant was ordered to pay $1,483 per month in child support; $3,578 per month in alimony, for thirty-six months;$3,881.46 to purge himself of civil contempt for failure to comply with a previous interim support order; $4,000 in reimbursement to plaintiff for the attorney's fees of C.R. \"Skip\" Long, Jr. (Mr. Long); $7,500 in reimbursement to plaintiff for the attorney's fees of A. Doyle Early, Jr. (Mr. Early); and $7,520 in child support arrearage. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We first review defendant's argument regarding the amount of alimony awarded by the trial court. If a trial court finds that \"the supporting spouse participated in an act of illicit sexual behavior . . . during the marriage and prior to or on the date of separation, then the [trial] court shall order that alimony be paid to a dependent spouse.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2050-16\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 50-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .3A(a) (2003). In this case, defendant does not challenge that he is the supporting spouse, and he stipulated at trial to having engaged in illicit sexual behavior prior to or on the date of separation. Consequently, the trial court was required to award alimony to plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See Williamson v.

Defendant first argues that the trial court erred despite finding that his monthly expenses were reasonable. In the alimony order, the trial court found in finding of fact number ten that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Based upon the defendant's financial affidavit, he has $10,000 in monthly income, $3,700 in taxes, $3,785 in shared family expenses and $1,876 in individual expenses, which he contends leaves him with a surplus of $639 per month, not including listed additional in-kind income of $1,625 per month. The Court finds, however, that the defendant's expenses\n   <em>\n    are not reasonable\n   </em>\n   in that after the Equitable Distribution Judgment/Order was entered and the distributive award determined, the defendant and his new wife decided to purchase the marital home for $799,000 and borrowed a total of $858,500 to purchase thehome and pay down the distributive award at a lower interest rate. The defendant has attempted to maintain his standard of living while the plaintiff's standard of living has been substantially reduced and the defendant has increased his debt from $637,641.80 to $858,500 and included this debt service in his expenses. The defendant had a choice to sell the marital home and pay off all the marital debt allocated to him of $637,641.80 and then to obtain reasonable housing in accordance with the defendant's economic circumstances at that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In contrast, when later considering the statutory factors in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2050-16\">\n    N.C. Gen.

Plaintiff responds that the trial court made a clerical error and \"clearly meant to state that the defendant 'contends that he' has reasonable need[s] of $5,661\" per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When a trial court's findings of fact are so contradictory that this Court cannot \"'safely and accurately decide the question,'\" we cannot affirm the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    Spencerv.

In this case, we find that the trial court's earlier, more specific, finding of fact, is controlling. In finding of fact number ten, the trial court described at great length why it found defendant's expenses to be unreasonable. We see no need to give the trial court's cursory statement in finding of fact number eighteen enough weight to merit a reversal. We also find instructive the narrative of trial testimony, on which the trial court's order plainly relied. The narrative of trial testimony states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The relative needs of the spouses - The plaintiff and defendant testified as to what they\n   <em>\n    contended\n   </em>\n   were their reasonable needs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Considering the trial court's more specific earlier finding and the trial testimony on which the trial court's order was based, we reconcile the trial court's inconsistent findings and hold that the trial court found as fact that defendant's expenses were unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant next argues that even if the trial court found that defendant's expenses were unreasonable, the alimony order must be vacated because the trial court did not state exactly which expenses it considered unreasonable. Plaintiff responds that since the trial court specifically referred to the housing expensesdefendant assumed after purchasing the former marital home, \"no ambiguity exists when the order is considered in its entirety.\" We agree with plaintiff. The trial court was very clear when it delineated that it found defendant's assumption of debt by purchasing the marital home to be unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant next contends the trial court erred by ordering him to pay alimony in an amount that leaves him with a shortfall each month. Defendant argues that his monthly income is $10,000, his monthly taxes are $3,700, and his monthly expenses are $5,661. Defendant argues that as a result he has a monthly surplus of only $639. Defendant further argues that the total amount of his monthly child support obligation of $1,483 and monthly alimony obligation of $3,578 exceeds this $639 surplus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We first note that defendant makes several misstatements in his calculation. Defendant admitted in his financial affidavit that he has a monthly income of $11,625 per month: $10,000 in draw and $1,625 in benefits. Defendant's financial affidavit also only\n   <em>\n    estimated\n   </em>\n   his taxes to equal $3,700 per month; the estimation did not take into account various deductions, including those for defendant's alimony payments, and defendant had not yet filed his 2002 or 2003 tax returns. Furthermore, the operating agreement of defendant's employer, AEA, provides that AEA will pay defendant's taxes. Finally, as discussed above, the trial court did not find defendant's monthly expenses to be reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In addition to defendant's miscalculation, we do not find that the alimony order leaving defendant with a shortfall requiresreversal of the trial court's alimony award. Our Court previously upheld alimony awards that left supporting spouses with a shortfall or very limited funds when the evidence showed that the supporting spouse received other substantial financial benefits from the supporting spouse's employer.\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

Defendant chose to purchase the former marital home despite his admitted ability to live in one of three other houses he and his new wife owned, one for which the mortgage and utilities were paid by his employer. Defendant also testified that he is entitled to principal and interest payments on a $197,000 debt AEA owes him. Defendant admitted that payments were suspended in November 2001, but he has not taken any steps to collect the interest or principal payments on this debt. Prior to suspension of the payments, defendant had been receiving principal repayment of $4,750 per month and interest payments in the amount of $4,750 per month, for a total of $9,500 per month. When asked by the trial court why AEA stopped paying interest on the note, defendant replied, \"I don't know.\" Finally, AEA's operating agreement provides that AEA will pay defendant's taxes. Much of this was noted by the trial court in finding of fact number eighteen:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court has previously considered the defendant's intent to try to maintain hisstandard of living, his acquiring of substantial additional debt to try to buy the marital home and to pay down the distributive award at a lower interest rate, the fact that the defendant owns another home and his new wife owns two (2) other homes where the parties may have lived, and the failure of the defendant to take any action to collect principal or interest payments on the substantial debt owed by AEA to defendant[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, we find that the trial court properly evaluated defendant's income and financial benefits and did not abuse its discretion in the amount of alimony awarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, defendant presents in his brief what he describes as a \"fictitious 'best case scenario'\" where he argues that even had he not purchased the former marital home, he would be unable to afford the ordered monthly alimony payments. However, by defendant's own admission, this scenario is fictitious, and it is not supported by any cited authority. Moreover, by virtue of this argument defendant asks this Court to assume facts not in evidence and to make new findings of fact. Also, this argument does not take into account the financial benefits defendant is entitled to receive from his employer.

Defendant points to the testimony of Phenie Bowen (Ms. Bowen), AEA's controller. Ms. Bowen testified that health insurance benefits for plaintiff, defendant, and their children totaled $847 per month. She testified that health insurance benefits for defendant and the children only totaled $515 per month. Defendant argues that he no longer carries plaintiff on his insurance plan so that this finding of fact overstates his income by $847 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Although we agree that the trial court's finding of fact overstates defendant's income, the evidence in the record shows that defendant did in fact carry plaintiff on his health plan for the first six months of 2003; thereafter, he only carried himselfand his children. Therefore, the trial court's finding of fact only overstates defendant's income \"during the first part of 2003\" by $515 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the trial court's error was harmless since the $515 per month is more than offset by the $800 per month that defendant admitted to receiving in unearned income. The trial court acknowledged this income when considering the statutory factors in finding of fact number eighteen:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The amount and sources of earned and unearned income of both spouses including, but not limited to, earnings, dividends, and benefits such as medical, retirement, insurance, social security, or other - The defendant receives unearned income in the sum of $800 per month[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Despite its acknowledgment of this $800 in income, the trial court omitted it in its calculation in finding of fact number seven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We find that the trial court's error was harmless. The $515 in benefits overstated by the trial court is more than offset by defendant's own testimony and the trial court's finding of fact that defendant received unearned income in the sum of $800 per month. The trial court's error was harmless and did not affect the alimony award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant next assigns error to the trial court's finding of fact that defendant increased his indebtedness from $637,641.80 to $858,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant argues first that the trial court understated his original indebtedness. In the equitable distribution order, all ofthe marital debt, in the amount of $637,641.80, was distributed to defendant. Defendant was also ordered to pay a distributive award of $358,719.08. Defendant argues that the trial court failed to take the distributive award into account when stating his original indebtedness and argues that his original indebtedness was actually $996,360.88 (the total of the marital debt plus the distributive award). Defendant states that when he bought the former marital home for $799,000, he took out two mortgages in a total amount of $858,500 in order to pay off the distributive award at a lower interest rate. Defendant claims that by assuming these mortgages he actually reduced his total indebtedness by purchasing the former marital home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Although we recognize that the trial court did not take the distributive award into account when calculating defendant's indebtedness, we disagree that defendant actually reduced his total indebtedness. Defendant's above calculation leads to the erroneous conclusion that all of the debt from the distributive award was absorbed by the two mortgages on the marital home. In actuality, the evidence, including defendant's own testimony, shows that he assumed only the second mortgage in the amount of $215,000 for the purpose of paying down the distributive award. Defendant thus still owed plaintiff $143,719.08 (the total distributive award of $358,719.08 minus $215,000). When taking the distributive award into account in assessing defendant's total debt, defendant's new total debt is actually $1,002,219.08 (the total of $858,500 in mortgages on the former marital home and the remaining $143,719.08owed to plaintiff for the distributive award). As a result, and contrary to his contention, defendant did increase his overall indebtedness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We also disagree that any error the trial court made in calculating defendant's entire indebtedness requires reversal of the alimony award. Defendant argues that the trial court's misstatement of his entire indebtedness necessarily affects the alimony award because the trial court \"condemns\" defendant for increasing his amount of debt. Although the trial court did consider defendant's increase in debt unreasonable, we do not find that any error in the calculation of defendant's total debt affected the alimony award. The trial court clearly found that defendant's increase of debt in the amount of $3,052 per month in mortgage payments was unreasonable when defendant had his choice of three other homes in which to live, including one for which his employer paid the mortgage and utilities. It was not the actual dollar amount of defendant's indebtedness that the trial court relied on in making its alimony award, but rather defendant's attempt to maintain his standard of living while plaintiff's standard of living was substantially reduced. We find that any error in the calculation of defendant's total indebtedness did not affect the alimony award requiring reversal of the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant next assigns error to the trial court's finding that plaintiff's expenses for the upkeep of plaintiff's new home werereasonable.

At the time of trial, plaintiff and the children had been living with plaintiff's parents since defendant had purchased the former marital home. Plaintiff had an initial closing date for the purchase of a new, 2,500 square foot home on 31 July 2003. Plaintiff's anticipated reasonable and necessary expenses amounted to $5,649; $864.00 of this amount was to be used for the upkeep of the new home. The evidence at trial showed that the monthly upkeep of the 7,500 square foot former marital home amounted to $794.26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendant argues that the costs for upkeep of plaintiff's home were speculative, since plaintiff had not yet lived in the home. Defendant also argues that plaintiff's anticipated reasonable and necessary expenses were contrary to common sense because they exceeded the amount needed for upkeep of the larger former marital home. Defendant contends that due to these errors, the alimony award was necessarily affected, meriting reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"The determination of what constitutes the reasonable needs and expenses of a party in an alimony action is within the discretion of the trial [court], and [the trial court] is not required to accept at face value the assertion of living expenses offered by the litigants themselves.\"\n   <em>\n    Whedon v.

Plaintiff's total claimed monthly expenses were $5,649, but the trial court found that her reasonable needs were only $4,167 per month. Plaintiff is thus receiving $1,482 less than she anticipated she would need, which more than makes up for the only amount defendant challenges on appeal, $846.

The undersigned Judge did not preside over any hearings in which Mr. Long represented the plaintiff. Mr. Long has submitted an affidavit itemizing the services rendered, including client interviews, research, preparation of pleadings, discussion with opposing counsel, trial preparation, time in court for child custody, child support, postseparation support and mediation.

Defendant claims that \"[i]t was impossible for the trial court to then know (1) if Mr. Long's representation warranted attorney fees, and (2) if the fees awarded were reasonable.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff introduced into evidence thirty-three pages of invoices detailing the work Mr. Long performed on her behalf. Plaintiff also introduced into evidence Mr. Long's affidavit detailing the amount of time spent on plaintiff's case, his hourly rate, and the work performed. The affidavit clearly states that Mr. Long \"spent time in court for . . . child support.\" The record also reveals that Mr. Long performed work on plaintiff's behalf at the interim support proceeding, preliminary child support proceeding, and contempt action for violation of the interim support order. The record clearly shows that Mr. Long performed work on behalf of plaintiff for child support. We find that the trial court had sufficient evidence upon which to base an award of reimbursement for Mr. Long's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendant next argues that the trial court's finding of fact that Mr. Long spent a portion of time in mediation on equitable distribution matters precludes an award of reimbursement for Mr. Long's fees since \"it is impossible to determine what amount oftime was actually committed to equitable distribution, and, whether the trial court properly refused to award attorney fees for that time.\" We disagree. The total amount Mr. Long billed to plaintiff was $11,160, but the trial court only awarded $4,000 for reimbursement of Mr. Long's fees. Furthermore, the record shows that Mr. Long's fee for the mediation was only $570.60. Since the trial court only ordered defendant to reimburse plaintiff for a fraction of Mr. Long's total fees, and did not necessarily order payment for time Mr. Long spent in mediation, we do not find an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendant finally argues that \"Mr. Long should properly raise his issues of attorney fees, on his own behalf, before a trial court in which he is representing [plaintiff]. For another attorney to represent the interests of Mr. Long in a hearing that Mr. Long did not participate is error.\" We find no merit in this argument. The trial court ordered defendant to reimburse plaintiff for Mr. Long's fees. The trial court did not order Mr. Long's fees to be payable directly to Mr. Long. Plaintiff's attorney was not representing the interests of Mr. Long, but the interests of plaintiff. There was no abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendant has failed to present an argument regarding his remaining assignments of error. Therefore, pursuant to N.C.R. App. P. 28(b)(6), these assignments of error are deemed abandoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff, in a separate motion to this Court, requests that we award her attorney's fees for this appeal. We have previously held that in an appeal from an alimony award, an award of attorney's fees for services performed on appeal should ordinarily be granted, provided the general statutory requirements for such an award are duly met, especially where the appeal is taken by the supporting spouse. This appears to be the majority rule, and there is nothing in our statutory or case law that would suggest that a dependent spouse in North Carolina is entitled to meet the supporting spouse on equal footing, in terms of adequate and suitable legal representation, at the trial level only. In sum, an award of counsel fees is appropriate whenever it is shown that the spouse is, in fact, dependent, is entitled to the relief demanded, and is without sufficient means whereon to subsist during the prosecution and defray the necessary expenses thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Fungaroli v.
