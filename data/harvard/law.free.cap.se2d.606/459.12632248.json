As explained below, we affirm the judgment and orders of the superior court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2000, defendants sought a loan from Centura Bank (\"the bank\"), which the bank declined based on defendants' inability to comply with loan documentation package requirements. The bank then referred defendants to plaintiff, who had expertise in evaluatingchurch financing requests, and with whom the bank had a joint venturing and partnership agreement as part of its duties under the Community Reinvestment Act. After defendants obtained the financing they sought, a dispute arose between the parties over whether plaintiff had provided services to defendants, and whether defendants owed him money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 21 December 2000, plaintiff Robert A. Zander sued defendants Greater Emmanuel Pentacostal Temple of Durham and its affiliates (collectively \"Greater Emmanuel\") for breach of contract. Following a series of motions filed by both parties, they entered a settlement agreement in which plaintiff agreed to accept $7,500 in exchange for releasing all claims against defendants. On 14 September 2001, defendants tendered $6,500 toward the settlement, which plaintiff accepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, defendants tendered the balance to plaintiff, who refused to accept the tender. Plaintiff then notified defendants that he would hold onto the initial payment while he pursued his lawsuit. Defendants moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that the matter had been settled and the plaintiff had unreasonably refused to accept the balance tendered. The court granted the motion 5 December 2001, and plaintiff appealed to this Court. We held that all conditions of the settlement agreement had not been met and remanded the matter for a further hearing.\n   <em>\n    Zander v. Greater Emmanuel Pentacostal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20N.C.%20App.%20206\">\n    154 N.C.

On remand, defendants moved to have the settlement funds returned since this Court had held thatthere was, in essence, no settlement. On or about 12 June 2003, Judge Stanback entered an order granting the motion for reimbursement and ordering that payment of $6,500 be made by 17 June 2003. Thereafter, plaintiff moved for reconsideration, and defendants then moved for summary judgment on their counterclaims, which the court granted in an order and judgment filed 13 August 2003. In that judgment, the court entered judgment 1) against plaintiff on defendants' counterclaims in the amount of $3,500, trebled to total $10,500, and 2) against plaintiff for the separate sum of $6,500 as previously ordered with interest and costs. Plaintiff appeals. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff first argues that the court erred in ordering him to return funds that defendants had paid plaintiff pursuant to the settlement agreement. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Unjust enrichment has been described as: the result or effect of a failure to make restitution of, or for, property or benefits received under such circumstances as to give rise to a legal or equitable obligation to account therefor.\"\n   <em>\n    Watson Elec.

In\n   <em>\n    Zander I,\n   </em>\n   this Courtheld that because the terms of the settlement agreement between the parties were not fulfilled, there was no settlement and, therefore, plaintiff could pursue his lawsuit against defendants. Because defendants had tendered $6,500 to plaintiff only under terms of the settlement agreement, plaintiff would be unjustly enriched if he were allowed to retain both the settlement funds and his right to pursue his lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The cases cited by plaintiff in his brief are inapposite.\n   <em>\n    Baillie Lumber Co. v. Kincaid Carolina Corp.\n   </em>\n   addresses the doctrine of accord and satisfaction, which is not the issue here, where defendants paid funds to plaintiff under terms of a settlement agreement, not in order to satisfy a disputed debt.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8553447\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/4/342/\">\n    4 N.C.

Plaintiff also cites\n   <em>\n    Guerry v. American Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"the voluntary payment of money by a person who has full knowledge of all the facts cannot be recovered.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8625393\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/234/644/#p647\">\n    234 N.C. 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 647,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20S.E.2d%20272\">\n    68 S.E.2d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274 (1951). Here, defendants paid plaintiff $6,500 under a settlement agreement, the terms of which were not fulfilled. There are no \"facts\" appearing in this record which would justify plaintiff retaining that money after the settlement agreement fell apart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that the court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants and awarding defendants treble damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2066-106\">\n    N.C.
