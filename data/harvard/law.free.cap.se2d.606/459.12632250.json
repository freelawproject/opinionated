On 8 June 2001 a social worker employed by the Johnston County Department of Social Services (DSS) observed Megan to have a black eye, facial bruising, and other unexplained bruises. The same day, Megan was removed from her parents' home and placed in DSS custody. Medical examinations revealed that the ten week old baby also had fractures of both her right and leftfemurs, a fractured wrist bone, and healed rib fractures. DSS later filed a petition alleging that she was abused, neglected, and dependent. At the adjudication hearing, expert medical witnesses testified that Megan's injuries were not caused by accidental means, and were consistent with child abuse. A social worker from the Lenoir County DSS testified that DSS was involved with two of the mother's other three children, and that the mother had left Lenoir County without completing the family services case plan or resolving the issues that led to the removal of the two children from her custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 19 December 2001 Megan was adjudicated neglected, abused, and dependent. In this adjudication order, the trial court found that the parents denied any responsibility for Megan's injuries, had not sought medical treatment for the child, and that, although they blamed Megan's babysitter for the abuse, the parents had continued to send her to this babysitter. The trial court's order stated in relevant part that Megan was abused \"in that the child received serious physical injury by other than accidental means for which the parents could not explain and further that the parents created or allowed to be created a substantial risk of serious physical injury to the juvenile by other than accidental means by allowing the child to return to the babysitter's home to whom they claim injured the child.\" On disposition of the 19 December 2001 adjudication, the trial court ordered that Megan's custody remain with DSS, that DSS be relieved of further efforts at reunification, and that visitation be stopped. At a November 2002 permanencyplanning hearing, the permanent plan for Megan was changed from placement with a relative to adoption. On 6 January 2003 DSS filed a petition for termination of the parental rights of both mother and father in Megan. In an order entered 1 December 2003 the trial court terminated the parents' parental rights in Megan. The court's order found the existence of grounds for termination of parental rights:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [1] in that the juvenile has been abused and neglected by [both parents] pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-1111(1) and that there is a probability of abuse and/or neglect if the child was returned to either parent's care; [2] that the mother and father have willfully left the juvenile in foster care . . . more than twelve months without . . . [making] reasonable progress [on]. . . the issues which led to the juvenile's removal . . .; and that [3] [father] has not provide[d] a substantial portion of the cost of care for the juvenile . . . although physically and financially able to do so[.] . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court further concluded that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   it is in the child's best interest that the parental rights of the parents be terminated as the juvenile is in need of stability in a safe, protective and nurturing environment, with proper care and supervision. The juvenile has been in foster care for all but three months of her life and has not had any contact with either parent since December of 2001. The child is developmentally on target. The parents have failed to adequately address the issues, which led to the juvenile's injuries and removal. It . . . is further found by this court, that it is not safe to return this child to the parents' home as there are continuing protection and safety issues for the child. The court finds that no evidence was presented that it was contrary to the child's best interests that the [parents'] parental rights be terminated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to these and other findings and conclusions, the court issued an order terminating the parental rights of mother and father in Megan.

[c]reates or allows to be created a substantial risk of serious physical injury to the juvenile by other than accidental means[.]\" Respondents herein challenge the court's finding of abuse as a ground for termination of parental rights. However, respondents \"assign error to the trial court's ultimate findings of fact on the grounds supporting termination of parental rights, [but do] not assign error to the extensive evidentiary findings.

The minor child was placed in the custody of the Johnston County [DSS] on or about June 8, 2001[.] . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   7. The parents denied at the time of removal and continue to deny any knowledge as to what caused the child's injuries and further continue to allege that the injuries occurred while the child was in her babysitter's home; that although the mother and father had observed the bruising on the child's face, neither parent sought any medical treatment for the child in order to avoid involvement by the Johnston County [DSS]. . . . . Despite the parents' belief that the injuries occurred while in the care of the child's babysitter, they continued to allow her to provide care for their child. . . . The court finds that at the time of the child's injuries and the time of this hearing, the parents were protecting themselves and their self-interests over that of the child's.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   8. . . .

The mother, who lives in the same home as the father, is in need of additional long term services and medication, without which, there would be a recurrence of the same issues which led to the removal of the juvenile.
