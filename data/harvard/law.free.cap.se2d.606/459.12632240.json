He primarily argues on appeal (1) that his trial attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel in not moving to sever the charges and (2) that testimony of the State's rebuttal witnesses that defendant had inappropriately touched them should have been excluded. After reviewing the record, we can find that the trial court was not required to sever the charges and, therefore, hold that trial counsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to move to sever. With respect to the rebuttal witnesses, their testimony was properly admitted under Rule 404(a) of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence in order to rebut thetestimony of defense witnesses. Finding no error on these primary issues and no merit in defendant's remaining assignments of error, we hold that defendant received a trial free from prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This appeal arises from a second trial of the charges against defendant. Both the State and defendant offered evidence. The State's evidence tended to show the following. Defendant is married to the biological grandmother of A.A. and D.A. A.A. was born on 8 February 1987 and was 16 at the time of trial. D.A. was born on 14 January 1986 and was 17 at the time of trial. Upon moving to Pender County in 1998, the girls and their mother temporarily lived with the grandmother and defendant. They considered defendant to be their grandfather and called him \"grandpa.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both girls testified that defendant began touching them in a manner that made them uncomfortable. Specifically, when hugging them, defendant would touch the girls' breasts and buttocks, sometimes using his thumb to rub the sides of their breasts. The girls mentioned the touching to their mother, who in turn discussed it with the grandmother and defendant. Subsequently, the grandmother told the girls' mother that they needed to move out because they were causing tension in her house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the girls and their mother moved, the girls continued to visit their grandmother and at times spent the night. Three incidents occurred while the girls were staying with theirgrandmother and defendant that gave rise to the charges filed against defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During Thanksgiving weekend in 1999, when A.A. was about twelve and a half years old, defendant took her deer hunting. As they were sitting in a deer stand on defendant's property, defendant grabbed A.A.'s thigh and slowly slid his hand up to within a couple inches of her crotch area. She jerked away so defendant's hand fell off. A.A. testified that she felt \"[u]ncomfortable, disgusted, violated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In early July 2001, D.A., who was age 15, was sleeping on her back on the couch in her grandmother's house. Early in the morning, while D.A. was still asleep, defendant came in, lay on top of her, sucked her ear, and kissed her neck. Defendant stayed on top of her for about ten minutes. She started acting as if she were waking up so that defendant would leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Subsequently, in late July 2001, A.A. spent the night at her grandparents' house on two consecutive nights. The first night, A.A. was sleeping on her stomach in the guestroom, but awoke around midnight when she felt someone on top of her. Defendant had his hand under her shirt and was rubbing her stomach. A.A. could feel his erection as he lay on her. After A.A. told defendant that she was feeling sick, defendant said that he loved her and kissed her on the lips. A.A. tried to mention the incident to her grandmother, but her grandmother told A.A. to leave the house if she was going to say something. On the next night, defendantrepeated his conduct, but A.A. pretended she was asleep, and defendant ultimately left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.A. was withdrawn when she arrived home and, a couple of days later, she told her mother what had happened. A.A. expressed concern that she would get her grandfather in trouble, that her grandmother would be mad at her, and that she would lose her family. Her mother then sat down with D.A. as well and learned what had happened to her. The girls' mother decided to report the incidents and the Gurganious family subsequently cut off contact with the girls and their mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant called his wife as a witness, who denied ever hearing complaints about defendant's behavior with A.A. and D.A. and testified that defendant treated them appropriately. He also called a series of other witnesses to challenge A.A.'s, D.A.'s, and their mother's credibility. Finally, he called three female witnesses to testify that he had always hugged and kissed them in a manner they deemed appropriate. As rebuttal witnesses, the State called two women who had had contact with defendant in their adolescent years. Both women testified that defendant had touched them inappropriately during that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant was charged with two counts of indecent liberties as to A.A. and one count of indecent liberties as to D.A. The record does not reflect what transpired in the first trial on these charges. The jury in the second trial found defendant guilty on all three charges. The trial judge consolidated the two counts involving A.A. and imposed a sentence of 17 to 21 monthsimprisonment. The judge imposed a second, consecutive sentence of 17 to 21 months for the offense involving D.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant first argues that the trial court erred in allowing joinder of the three counts for trial. Because defendant's trial counsel did not move for severance or otherwise object to joinder, defendant seeks review under the plain error standard. Plain error review \"is limited to errors in a trial court's jury instructions or a trial court's rulings on admissibility of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We are unable to discern any material reason why it would be to defendant's advantage to testify in one case and not the other. Certainly his unsupported statement of possible prejudice is not sufficient to show abuse of discretion on the part of the trialjudge in allowing the motion to consolidate the charges for trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20S.%20Ct.%2047\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, as in\n   <em>\n    Davis,\n   </em>\n   we have been unable to identify any material reason that it would be advantageous to defendant to testify in the trial involving one sister, but not in the trial involving the other sister. In addition, the State has pointed out that defendant has a 1993 felony conviction for indecent liberties and this conviction would likely have been admissible under Rule 609 of the Rules of Evidence (providing that evidence of a felony conviction is admissible if less than 10 years old) if defendant chose to testify in one of the cases. Since defendant has offered no explanation why he might choose to testify given the existence of this conviction or why he might choose to testify in only one case, his bald assertion that he might testify, without more, is insufficient to establish prejudice from the consolidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant's second suggestion of prejudice, regarding the impact of consolidation on the jury, is likewise without merit. This suggestion presumes that evidence of one charge would not be admissible at the trial of the other.
