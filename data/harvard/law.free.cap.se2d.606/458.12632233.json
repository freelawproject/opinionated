As specified in defendant's written plea agreement, the trial court consolidated the offenses and sentenced defendant as a Prior Record Level IV to a mitigated term of 80 to 105 months' imprisonment. Defendant gave notice of appeal in open court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   By his first assignment of error on appeal, defendant shows that the judgment entered by the trial court erroneously lists his Prior Record Level as V, based on fifteen prior record points. He notes that his sentence of 80 to 105 months is not authorized fora Class C felony and Prior Record Level V.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(c), (e) (2003). The materials of record reveal that the judgment's reference to a Prior Record Level V \"is plainly a mere clerical error which has not prejudiced defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Both the hearing transcript and defendant's sentencing worksheet reflect that he had sixteen prior record points and a Prior Record Level V, if the felonies alleged in his habitual felon indictment were included in his prior record calculation. After subtracting the three used to confer defendant's habitual felon status, defendant was left with a Prior Record Level IV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-7.6\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-7.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). Because he pled guilty to habitual felon status, defendant was properly sentenced as a Prior Record Level IV and received the lowest possible mitigated sentence under G.S. \u00a7 15A-1340.17. Moreover, his plea agreement provided that he would be \"sentenced as a Level 4 Class C felon . . . [to] an active sentence of 80 mo[nths] minimum to 105 mo[nths] maximum.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although defendant was not prejudiced by this clerical error, we deem it appropriate to remand the judgment to the trial court for the limited purpose of correcting the prior record level and prior record points reflected thereon.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

He first claims the trial court erred under G.S. \u00a7 15A-1022(a)(6) (2003), by advising him during the plea colloquy that he faced a maximum possible punishment of 1044 months, which was calculated based upon a Prior Record Level VI, rather than defendant's Prior Record Level IV. He further claims the trial court erred in accepting his guilty plea in 03 CRS 56282 without a sufficient factual basis under G.S. \u00a7 15A-1022(c).\n   <em>\n    See generally State v.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 15A-1022] were violated\") (citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Before accepting a defendant's guilty plea, G.S. \u00a7 15A-1022(a)(6) requires the trial court to \"inform[] him of the maximum possible sentence on the charge for the class of offense for which the defendant is being sentenced, including that possible from consecutive sentences[.]\" Here, petitioner's guilty plea to habitual felon status subjected him to sentencing as a Class C felon for each of his four substantive felony charges. Under G.S. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(c), (e), the \"maximum possible sentence\" for a Class C felony is 261 months. Allowing for the possibility of four consecutive sentences, the trial court properly informed petitioner that he faced a total \"maximum possible punishment\" of 1044 months' imprisonment \"for the class of offense[s] for which [he was] being sentenced[.]\" N.C.Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1022(a)(6). Contrary to defendant's assertion, nothing in G.S. \u00a7 15A-1022(a)(6) requires the trial court to adjust the \"maximum possible sentence\" based upon a particular defendant's projected prior record level.\n   <em>\n    Cf.

Defendant expressly stipulated to the existence of a factual basis for his plea at the plea hearing. He did not challenge the sufficiency of the prosecutor's factual summary, did not object to the trial court's determination that a factual basis for the guilty plea existed, and did not move to withdraw his guilty plea. Accordingly, he has waived appellate review of this issue.\n   <em>\n    State v.
