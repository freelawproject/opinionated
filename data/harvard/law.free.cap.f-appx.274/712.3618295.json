We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and AFFIRM Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">In May 2006, Mr. Taghizadeh was charged in a four-count indictment with sexual exploitation of a minor in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a). The indictment alleged that, on four separate occasions, Mr. Taghizadeh knowingly employed, used, and persuaded a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of that conduct. In September, Mr. Taghizadeh pleaded guilty to count two of the indictment pursuant to a plea agreement with the Government. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Mr. Taghizadeh acknowledged that, by pleading guilty, he was admitting that he \u201cused a video-camera to tape an approximately 11-year old girl standing on a table with a lascivious exhibition of her genitalia and [that] during the tape [he] appears and engages in sexual acts with the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">Pursuant to the plea agreement, the Government agreed that Mr. Taghizadeh was eligible for a two-level downward adjustment of his sentence under \u00a7 3El.l(a) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d) for acceptance of responsibility as long as Mr. Taghizadeh committed no further crimes and complied with the agreement\u2019s terms. The Government also agreed to move for an additional one-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) if Mr. Taghizadeh accepted the agreement\u2019s terms by a specified deadline. In addition, under the agreement, both parties retained the right to make arguments regarding sentencing, provided their positions were not expressly prohibited by the agreement. Both parties also agreed to waive their rights to appeal a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range as determined by the District Court, while reserving their rights to appeal a sentence outside this range. Specifically, Mr. Taghizadeh reserved his right to appeal a sentence above the advisory range, and the Government reserved its right to appeal a sentence below the advisory range.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s advisory Guidelines sentence was 120 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment. Applying the 2002 Guidelines Manual, the U.S. Probation Office calculated Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s base offense level at 27. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(a) (2002) (specifying base offense level for sexual exploitation of a minor).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The probation office also concluded that the offense level should be increased six levels \u2014 four levels because the victim was under twelve years of age, \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(l)(A), and two levels because the victim was in Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s supervisory control, \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2). After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, \u00a7 3El.l(a), (b), Mr. Taghiza-deh\u2019s adjusted (and total) offense level was 30. Based on his total offense level and a criminal history category of I, the range under Chapter Five of the Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>lines was 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment. But because the statutory minimum for the offense of conviction was ten years\u2019 imprisonment, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(d) (2002) (current version at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(e)), the applicable range was 120 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Prior to the sentencing hearing, the District Court indicated that the Guidelines might not account for all the offense conduct in this particular case, notifying both parties that they \u201cshould be prepared to address whether a sentence above the guideline range is appropriate based on the commission of a sexual action in connection with the offense of conviction and in light of [Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s] personal participation in that act.\u201d At the sentencing hearing, the court first identified the offense conduct that the applicable guideline (\u00a7 2G2.1) covers, explaining that the guideline accounts for the fact that Mr. Taghizadeh sexually exploited a minor, who was under the age of twelve and within his supervisory control, by videotaping the minor engaged in sexually explicit behavior. The court then explained that the guideline does not account for two aspects of the offense conduct: (1) the fact that Mr. Taghizadeh videotaped sexual acts being performed on the minor, as opposed to simply videotaping the minor in sexually explicit poses; and (2) the fact that Mr. Taghizadeh himself, not a third person, performed those sexual acts on the minor (conduct the District Court described as statutory rape).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Because the advisory Guidelines sentence does not account for that offense conduct, the court determined that \u201ca sentence above the guideline range ... is required for the combination of the various factors identified\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In calculating the degree of the variance, however, the court drew upon the language and methodology of the Guidelines. It stated that newer versions of \u00a7 2G2.1 provide for a two-level enhancement when, as in the instant case, the offense involves the commission of a sexual act. <em>See, e.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) (2004). The court then explained that the Guidelines sentence for Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s participation in that sexual act, which it again described as statutory rape, would be essentially the same as the Guidelines sentence under \u00a7 2G2.1 for sexual exploitation of a child. In addition, the court noted that any such sentence would fail to account for the fact that Mr. Taghizadeh harmed the victim by videotaping the sexual act. Drawing on the methodology of the Guidelines, the court ultimately concluded that a two-level increase in Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s offense level was warranted because the exploitation involved the commission of a sexual act, and that the conduct amounting to statutory rape warranted a five-level increase. This resulted in an offense level of 37, which produced a sentencing range of 210 to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court then imposed a sentence of 216 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">On appeal, Mr. Taghizadeh challenges his sentence primarily on procedural grounds. He argues that the District Court impermissibly \u201cdouble counted\u201d certain offense conduct and did not adequately explain the chosen sentence, which is 95 months above the top of the advisory Guidelines range. In addition, he contends that his sentence of 216 months\u2019 imprisonment is substantively unreasonable because the court gave excessive weight to the conduct that it characterized as statutory rape. Finally, he argues that we should remand for resentencing because the Government breached the terms of the plea agreement. We address these arguments below and affirm Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">We review all sentences, whether inside or outside the advisory Guidelines range, under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first consider whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error, such as ... failing to consider the \u00a7 3558(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the sentence is \u201cprocedurally sound,\u201d we then determine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable, considering \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In considering the extent of a variance, however, we are mindful that we \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">A. <em>Sentencing Procedure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">As a preliminary matter, we note that Mr. Taghizadeh characterizes his sentence as a \u201cdeparture\u201d under the Guidelines, rather than a variance based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In explaining his sentence, however, the District Court explicitly stated that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors require \u201ca sentence above the guideline range.\u201d The court therefore applied the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, rather than Chapters Four or Five of the Guidelines, to arrive at a sentence above the advisory Guidelines range. We have previously made clear that we review an increase or decrease based on \u00a7 3553(a) as a variance, not a departure. <em>See United States v. Atencio, </em>476 F.3d 1099, 1101 n. 1 (10th Cir.2007) (explaining that a deviation from the recommended range through application of Chapters Four and Five is a departure, while a deviation from the recommended range through application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is a variance). Because we review Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s sentence as a variance, we do not consider whether his sentence is procedurally sound as a departure under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">Contrary to Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s contentions, the District Court did not commit procedural error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As reflected in the sentencing transcript, the court adequately explained its reasons for deviating upward from the advisory range. After acknowledging that the recommended Guidelines sentence accounts for some of the offense conduct in this ease, the court specifically discussed the conduct that the Guidelines do not contemplate \u2014 that is, the videotaping of sexual acts and Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s actual participation in those acts. As the court noted, this conduct speaks to a number of \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offense and the need for the chosen sentence to provide just punishment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(2). Furthermore, in addition to identifying the facts supporting the variance as a general matter, the coui't specifically discussed how it arrived at a variance of this length, drawing upon the language of the Guidelines to explain why Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s conduct warrants a sentence 95 months above the recommended range. After reviewing the court\u2019s explanation, we are satisfied that it \u201cconsidered the parties\u2019 arguments and ha[d] a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number><em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The court did not therefore commit procedural error by failing to provide an adequate explanation for the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Moreover, in explaining the variance, the court adequately explained what it characterized as separate increases based on offense conduct not accounted for by the Guidelines. In the context of departures, we have explained that sentencing courts may not depart upward twice based on the <em>same </em>conduct. <em>See United States v. Wolfe, </em>435 F.3d 1289, 1300-03 (10th Cir.2006). Similarly, when a sentencing court justifies a variance, it commits a procedural error if the reason for the variance is already factored into the sentence. <em>See Atencio, </em>476 F.3d at 1106; <em>see also United States v. Pepper, </em>518 F.3d 949, 952 (8th Cir.2008) (explaining that a sentencing court impermissibly \u201cdouble counted\u201d when it failed to adequately explain a variance based on the defendant\u2019s lack of violent history, a factor the court also used to justify a departure). Consequently, a court commits an error akin to double counting when it uses the same justification \u2014 for example, the same offense conduct \u2014 to support multiple deviations from the advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In this case, the court did not \u2014 as Mr. Taghizadeh argues \u2014 impermissibly double count by using the same offense conduct to justify separate increases. Instead, the court increased his sentence to account for two distinct actions and punish different kinds of harm. <em>Cf. United States v. Fadl, </em>498 F.3d 862, 867 (8th Cir.2007) (reasoning that a court does not double count under the Guidelines when it adjusts a sentence to \u201caccount for different kinds of harms\u201d (quotation omitted)). Specifically, the court varied upward to account for Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s videotaping of a sexual act (in contrast to footage that only depicts the minor in a sexually explicit pose) and Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s participation in those acts (in contrast to a third person\u2019s participation). Because one action \u2014 and the coincident harm \u2014 may occur without the other, they are clearly separate grounds for a variance. <em>Cf. id. </em>(concluding that the district court did not double count when one enhancement could theoretically apply in the absence of the other). Thus, the court did not err in using this offense conduct to support separate increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">B. <em>Substantive Reasonableness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">Mr. Taghizadeh also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the extent of the variance is unreasonable. Although we may consider the degree of the variance, we note that we do not subject variances to any form of heightened scrutiny. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596 (explaining that heightened scrutiny of sentences outside the Guidelines range is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with an abuse-of-discretion standard of review). Rather, we review all sentences for abuse of discretion, giving due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 597. Recognizing that a range of permissible sentences exists in any given case, \u201cwe will defer to the district court\u2019s judgment so long as it falls within the realm of these rationally available choices.\u201d <em>McComb, </em>519 F.3d at 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Mr. Taghizadeh essentially argues that the District Court gave excessive weight to the conduct it described as statutory rape. In support of this argument, he contends that the court improperly characterized his offense of conviction as a different, more serious offense. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>488 F.3d 1244, 1260-62 (10th Cir.2007) (holding that a district court may not \u201cre-characterize\u201d the offense and impose a sentence based solely on uncharged, unrelated conduct). But the court clearly did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>not impose a sentence based on a different offense; rather, it reasonably adjusted Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s sentence to account for conduct related to the offense and charged in the indictment. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1260, 1262 (vacating a sentence because the sentencing court \u201crecharacterized\u201d the offense of conviction \u2014 a drug offense \u2014 as either \u201cattempted sexual abuse of a child or solicitation of murder\u201d). Thus, the court clearly did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence of 216 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">C. <em>Plea Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Finally, Mr. Taghizadeh contends that the Government breached the plea agreement. We review this question de novo. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rivera, </em>518 F.3d 1208, 1211-13 (10th Cir.2008). In interpreting a plea agreement, we apply general principles of contract law. <em>Id. </em>We construe any ambiguities against the government as drafter of the agreement, and we \u201cinterpret the agreement according to the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of its terms.\u201d <em>United States v. Cachucha, </em>484 F.3d 1266, 1270 (10th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted); <em>see also Rodriguez-Rivera, </em>518 F.3d at 1212-13 (noting that we \u201clook to the express language in the agreement to identify both the nature of the government\u2019s promise and the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of this promise at the time of the entry of the guilty plea\u201d (quotation omitted)). Mr. Taghizadeh argues that we should remand for resentencing because, under the agreement\u2019s terms, he reasonably expected the Government to recommend a sentence within the advisory range. Given this expectation, he contends that the Government breached the agreement when it argued that the sentencing court should impose a sentence above the advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Mr. Taghizadeh\u2019s interpretation is not, however, a reasonable understanding of the agreement\u2019s terms. Mr. Taghizadeh bases his interpretation on language in the agreement reflecting the parties\u2019 promise not to appeal a within-Guidelines sentence. In essence, he contends that, by agreeing not to appeal a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range determined by the court, the Government implicitly agreed to argue for a Guidelines sentence and to refrain from asking the court to deviate from the Guidelines. But under the unambiguous terms of the agreement, the Government only promised to recommend downward adjustments for acceptance of responsibility. Furthermore, the agreement contains the following language explicitly allowing the parties to make other sentencing arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">Apart from any expressed agreements and stipulations, the parties reserve the right to advocate for, and present evidence relevant to, other guideline adjustments and sentencing factors for consideration by the U.S. Probation Office and the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Thus, under the agreement\u2019s terms, the Government could make arguments regarding sentencing as long as it did not argue against the downward adjustments it expressly promised to recommend. The Government did not therefore breach the agreement by arguing for a sentence above the advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM Mr. Taghiza-deh\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b739-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-16\">. Unless otherwise specified, all citations to the Guidelines are to the 2002 manual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-10\">. When a party fails to make a contemporaneous objection to the court's sentencing procedure, we review a procedural challenge only for plain error. <em>See United States v. McComb, </em>519 F.3d 1049, 1054-55 (10th Cir.2007). It is unclear whether Mr. Taghizadeh made the necessary objection. But because we determine that the District Court did not commit any procedural error, we need not decide whether plain-error review applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
