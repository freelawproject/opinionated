This court lacks jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s determination that the evidence would not alter its prior discretionary determination that petitioners failed to establish the requisite hardship. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601 (9th Cir.2006). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-25\">Petitioners also submitted an unsworn declaration of the harm they feared they would face upon return to Mexico. Because petitioners\u2019 motion was not supported by affidavits or other evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>material, the BIA acted within its discretion in denying the motion to reopen on this basis. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c); <em>Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 785 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that a motion to reopen must establish a prima facie case demonstrating \u201ca reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied\u201d). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss, construed as a motion for summary disposition of the petition for review, is granted in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b618-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
