Cir. R. 27(f) and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction Ruth A. Bradford\u2019s petition for review from the Merit Systems Protection Board. Bradford opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-18\">The Board issued its final order sustaining OPM\u2019s denial of retirement benefits on April 17, 2007, 105 M.S.P.R. 647. The Board transmitted its decision to Bradford via electronic mail on April 17, 2007. Bradford\u2019s petition was received by this court on June 19, 2008, 68 days after Bradford was deemed to have received the Board\u2019s final order. <em>See 5 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.14(0 (\u201cBoard documents served electronically on registered e-filers are deemed received on the date of electronic submission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-19\">Our review of a Board decision or order is governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7708(b)(1), which provides that \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law, any petition for review must be filed within 60 days after the date the petitioner received notice of the final order or decision of the Board.\u201d This filing period is \u201cstatutory, mandatory, [and] jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Monzo v. Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>735 F.2d 1335, 1336 (Fed. Cir.1984); <em>see also Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007) (the timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement that cannot be waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-22\">Bradford contends that her petition was timely because pursuant to Rule 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure she was entitled three additional calendar days after \u201cservice\u201d of the Board\u2019s order to file her petition. However, this provision does not apply to petitions for review of Board decisions or orders. As noted above, a petition for review is due within 60 days after the petitioner \u201creceived notice,\u201d not within 60 days of \u201cservice.\u201d Because Bradford\u2019s petition was not received within 60 days of the date she received notice of the Board\u2019s decision, and because Rule 26(c) is inapplicable to her petition, we must dismiss Bradford\u2019s petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-23\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b905-24\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b905-25\">(1) The motions are granted. The petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-26\">(2) All sides shall bear their own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
