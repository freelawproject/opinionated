The district court dismissed the petition, adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, which found that Tom-linson could not satisfy the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). However, under limited circumstances, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255. That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-16\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-17\">\u00a7 2255. Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. The burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy rests with the movant. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-18\">When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from the Court of Appeals before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255. We have held that such restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). Consequently, a petitioner who has filed a previous, unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion may not circumvent the successive-motion bar simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Id. </em>We have established that the savings clause only applies when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244. In order for a prisoner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy under the test in <em>Wofford, </em>all three criteria must be satisfied. As we have made clear, all three criteria will be met only in the narrowest of circumstances. <em>Id. </em>A petitioner may not argue the merits of his claim until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that the savings clause applies to his claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no error. Tomlin-son has failed to show that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. Thus, the district court did not err by dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
