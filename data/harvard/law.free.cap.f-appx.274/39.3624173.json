Nelson, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Bin Lin, </em>No. A98 560 438 (B.I.A. July 12, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 560 438 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 8, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. <em>Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007). For applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">Upon review of the administrative record, we find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The multiple specific examples of discrepancies between Lin\u2019s testimony and the record \u2014 e.g., his failure to disclose during his airport interview that he had been arrested and detained for fifteen days,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as his inconsistent testimony about whether his girlfriend\u2019s father had been arrested \u2014 provided sufficient bases on which the agency could conclude that he was not credible. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). While Lin offered explanations for the discrepancies identified by the agency, no reasonable fact-finder would have been compelled to accept them. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, the IJ properly noted Lin\u2019s evasive demeanor during testimony, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), and we afford substantial deference to that finding. <em>See Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 381 (2d Cir.2007). Based on these findings, no error argued by Lin would induce us to disturb the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination as it can be confidently predicted that the agency would reach the same conclusion on remand. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 335 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">Lin based his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief on the same factual predicate as his asylum claim. Accordingly, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination necessarily precludes success <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>on those claims as well.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\">. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the airport interview statement was sufficiently reliable to merit consideration. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179-80 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b67-17\">. Because Lin failed to argue before either this Court or the BIA his claims for relief based on the illegal nature of his departure from China, we consider that basis for relief abandoned. <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
