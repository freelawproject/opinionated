On appeal, O\u2019Connell argues that the district court wrongfully extended the deadline to file dispositive motions, and that the district court improperly found her complaint preempted by the Federal Employment Compensation Act (\u201cFECA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101 et seq. She also claims that the district court wrongly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on her Rehabilitation Act, retaliation and gender discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion to continue. This case was not ready to proceed to trial, and by granting the motion, the district court more efficiently handled the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">To the extent that O\u2019Connell\u2019s injuries were job-related, FECA\u2019s remedy is exclusive. However, to the extent her claims are based on injuries that are not covered by FECA, they fail on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">Before claiming discrimination in federal court, a plaintiff must first exhaust her administrative remedies. <em>Brown v. Gen. Sen. Admin., </em>425 U.S. 820, 832, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976). In this case, O\u2019Connell failed to exhaust her administrative remedies because she did not claim retaliation in her original discrimination complaint. Therefore, her retaliation claim fails for lack of exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">To succeed on a Rehabilitation Act claim, O\u2019Connell must show that (1) she is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) she is \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d to receive the benefit; (3) she was denied the benefits of the program solely by reason of her disability; and (4) the program receives federal financial assistance. <em>Lovell v. Chandler, </em>303 F.3d 1039, 1052 (9th Cir.2002). A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is one who \u201cmust be able to perform the essential functions of employment at the time that one is discriminated against in order to bring suit.\u201d <em>Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., </em>198 F.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">Here, the alleged discrimination occurred after O\u2019Connell submitted two medical certificates from her treating physician <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>stating that she was totally incapacitated and unable to work. Because she was unable to work, she could not perform her employment duties and was not a qualified individual. <em>See Weyer, </em>198 F.3d at 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">To establish a prima facie case of discrimination, she must show that \u201c(1) she belongs to a protected class, (2) she was performing according to her employer\u2019s legitimate expectations, (3) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) other employees with qualifications similar to her own were treated more favorably.\u201d <em>Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir.1998). Here, O\u2019Connell\u2019s claim fails because she was not similarly situated with the male employees in her office, whom she claims received more favorable treatment. At the time of the alleged discrimination, the three males were \u201climited duty\u201d employees and, thus, were entitled to receive work assignments ahead of \u201clight duty\u201d employees such as O\u2019Connell.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
