Because this evidence addressed the same basic hardship grounds previously considered by the agency, this court lacks jurisdiction to review this aspect of the denial of the motion to reopen. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 600 (9th Cir.2006). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss is granted in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">With regard to the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), we conclude the BIA did not abuse its discretion because petitioner did not show she would more likely than not be tortured upon return to Mexico and therefore failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2); <em>Mendez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, </em>340 F.3d 865, 869-70 (9th Cir.2003). We therefore summarily deny this petition in part because the questions raised are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The motion for stay of voluntary departure, filed after the departure period had expired, is denied. <em>See Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b620-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
