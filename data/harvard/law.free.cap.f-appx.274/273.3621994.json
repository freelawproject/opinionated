(\u201cCSX\u201d) appeals from a jury verdict in favor of Plaintiff Mark E. Benson. We find no error in the trial below. However, we hold that the district court erred in not granting CSX a setoff in the amount Benson received from a settlement with defendants GATX Financial Corp., Arkema, Inc., Paducah and Louisville Railway, Inc., and Rescar, Inc. (together, the \u201cSettling Defendants\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for entry of a <em>pro tanto </em>setoff against the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">On May 7, 2003, Benson suffered two exposures to hydrochloric acid (\u201cHC1\u201d) while working as a locomotive engineer in CSX\u2019s Parkersburg, West Virginia, train yard. HC1 is a highly corrosive hazardous material that can cause injury when breathed into the lungs. The first exposure occurred shortly after 5:00 a.m., when Benson coupled his locomotive to a tank car containing HC1. Benson soon noticed an unusual odor and began to experience dryness in his eyes and mouth, as well as a metallic taste on his tongue. After a few minutes, a co-worker notified Benson that the tank car was leaking, releasing a cloud of HC1 vapor six to eight feet into the air above the car.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Benson immediately exited the locomotive and left the area of the leaking car. He reported the leak to his supervisor, yardmaster Michael Smith. Smith in turn contacted Carl McDowell, a CSX yardmaster with hazardous materials training and summoned him to the yard. By the time McDowell arrived, Benson had re-boarded the engine in order to move the leaking car, resulting in a second HC1 exposure. The parties dispute whether Benson re-boarded the engine at his own initiative or in response to Smith\u2019s order to do so. In order to move the tank car, Benson was required to engage in a number of \u201czigzag\u201d movements through the yard. Each movement of the car released a cloud of HC1 vapor from the top of the car, and Benson again experienced dry eyes and mouth, a metallic taste, nausea, and choking.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Benson worked two shifts after the exposure. However, he continued to have difficulty breathing and chest pain when exposed to diesel exhaust, preventing him from returning to work as an engineer. Consequently, Benson brought this suit pursuant to the Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act (\u201cFELA\u201d), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51, <em>et seq., </em>claiming that his HC1 exposures resulted from the defendants\u2019 negligence and left him with \u201csevere and permanent injuries to his lungs and respiratory system.\u201d J.A. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Prior to trial, Benson settled all his claims against the Settling Defendants for approximately $88,500. He then proceeded to trial against CSX, limiting his claim to injuries caused by CSX\u2019s negligence in ordering him back onto the engine to move the tank car (ie., injuries resulting from the second exposure).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">At trial, CSX sought to assert a defense of contributory negligence based on its claim that Benson re-boarded the engine without having been instructed to do so. The district court granted Benson\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on this issue, finding the evidence insufficient to support that defense. The jury found CSX liable and awarded Benson $750,000. The district court denied CSX\u2019s post-trial motion to alter or amend the judgment, in which CSX argued (as it had throughout the trial) that it was entitled to a setoff against the verdict for the amount Benson received from the Settling Defendants. CSX now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">CSX\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law on CSX\u2019s contributory negligence defense. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), a \u201cdistrict court may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law during a jury trial after a party has been fully heard on an issue only if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to have found for that party with respect to that issue.\u201d <em>Brown v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>18 F.3d 245, 248 (4th Cir.l994)(internal quotation and citation omitted). We review the district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">FELA provides that the damages an injured employee may recover from his common carrier employer are to be reduced in proportion to the amount of injury caused by the employee\u2019s contributory negligence. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 53. By contrast, FELA prohibits the common law defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>of assumption of the risk. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 54. Accordingly, a district court in a FELA suit must determine whether an employer\u2019s evidence supports the permitted defense of contributory negligence, or whether it instead supports the prohibited defense of assumption of the risk. <em>See Tiller v. Atl. Coast Line R. Co., </em>318 U.S. 54, 66-67, 63 S.Ct. 444, 87 L.Ed. 610 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Contributory negligence is a \u201ccareless act or omission on the plaintiff\u2019s part tending to add new dangers to conditions that the employer negligently created or permitted to exist.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., </em>787 F.2d 1309, 1316 (9th Cir.1986). By contrast, \u201can employee\u2019s voluntary, knowledgeable acceptance of a dangerous condition that is necessary for him to perform his duties constitutes an assumption of risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">[W]hen an employee carries out his supervisor\u2019s general order in an unsafe manner, he is responsible under FELA for his own contributory negligence. But when an employee carries out a direct order, even if he has reason to know the order exposes him to danger, he is not contributorily negligent; rather his conduct falls under the abolished doctrine of assumption of risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\"><em>Jenkins v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., </em>22 F.3d 206, 211 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Here, CSX claims that Benson was contributorily negligent because he re-boarded the engine coupled to the leaking tank car without being instructed to do so. In support of this argument, CSX cites McDowell\u2019s trial testimony that (1) he did not ask Smith to order Benson to re-board the engine, and (2) based on his experience and training in dealing with hazardous materials, he would not have ordered anyone to go near the leaking tank car before he arrived on the scene and assessed the situation. Benson, by contrast, testified that he re-boarded the engine in response to a direct order from Smith, which he believed was relayed from McDowell. Smith did not testify. Accordingly, Benson contends that the evidence supports at most the common law defense of assumption of the risk, which is not permitted under FELA.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">We hold that the district court correctly granted Benson\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. The only relevant testimony CSX points to \u2014 McDowell\u2019s statement that he never told Smith to order Benson to re-board the engine \u2014 does not contradict Benson\u2019s testimony that Smith gave him such an order. Because the uncontra-dicted evidence at trial thus showed that Benson boarded the locomotive upon the direct order of his supervisor, his actions did not constitute contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">CSX also argues that the district court erred by refusing to grant a setoff against the jury\u2019s verdict in the amount Benson recovered from the Settling Defendants. We review this legal issue <em>de novo. Chisholm v. UHP Projects, Inc., </em>205 F.3d 731, 734 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">Joint and several liability is the traditional rule in FELA cases. <em>Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. Ayers, </em>538 U.S. 135, 163, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261 (2003). Within this framework, a FELA defendant is entitled to a <em>pro tanto </em>setoff against a jury verdict in the amount of any settlement the plaintiff obtained from another party who, together with the defendant, is jointly and severally liable for the plaintiffs harm. <em>See, e.g., Schadel v. Iowa Interstate R.R., Ltd., </em>381 F.3d 671 (7th Cir.2004); <em>Hess v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 389, 835 N.E.2d 679 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">The question in this case is whether CSX and the Settling Defendants are jointly and severally liable for Benson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>injury, such that a setoff is required. Benson contends that they are not because the negligent conduct of the Settling Defendants giving rise to the tank car\u2019s initial leak, and thus Benson\u2019s first exposure, constituted a separate tort from CSX\u2019s negligence in ordering Benson to re-board the engine after the leak had been discovered (which resulted in his second exposure). CSX, on the other hand, argues that Benson\u2019s strategic choice at trial to present the two exposures as two separate torts does not change the fact that Benson suffered a unitary injury that cannot be apportioned between the exposures.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u201cIf the independent tortious conduct of two or more persons is a legal cause of an indivisible injury, each person is jointly and severally liable for the recoverable damages caused by the tortious conduct.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment Liab. \u00a7 A18 (2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Restatement further provides that an injury is indivisible if the evidence does not provide a reasonable basis for the factfinder to determine \u201cthe amount of damages separately caused\u201d by the independent tortious conduct of two or more tortfeasors. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 26. Furthermore, \u201cthere is no temporal requirement for the actions of the tortfea-sors\u201d in order for joint and several liability to attach. Rather, \u201c[t]he requirement is only that the independent tortious acts \u2018concur\u2019 to cause an injury that is not divisible based on the causal contribution of the tortfeasors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 A18.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Thus, our inquiry turns on whether Benson\u2019s injury is divisible or indivisible. Although occurring at separate times (albeit only moments apart) and resulting from distinct acts of negligence by different defendants, Benson\u2019s resulting injury is not \u201cdivisible based on the causal contribution of the tortfeasors.\u201d At trial, neither party introduced any evidence that would have permitted the jury to determine the amount of damages separately attributable to Benson\u2019s first and second exposures.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the absence of any such evidence, Benson\u2019s injury is indivisible, and CSX is jointly and severally liable for that injury with the Settling Defendants. Benson was therefore entitled to recover his full damages from any of the defendants, and CSX is entitled to a <em>pro tanto </em>setoff in the amount Benson received from the Settling Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">CSX raises several other challenges to the proceedings below, which we conclude are without merit. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for entry of a setoff against the verdict in the amount Benson received from the Settling Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-9\">. Later investigation determined that the tank car coupled to Benson\u2019s engine was leaking through a damaged rupture disc, a device designed to break once the pressure inside the tank car reached a certain point, thereby venting pressure from the car and preventing catastrophic tank failure. It is not disputed that the initial leak resulted from the negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>gence of the Settling Defendants, which are, respectively, the owner of the tank car, the shipper of the leaking HC1, the common carrier who handled the car prior to delivery to CSX, and the company that repaired the leaking car in Louisville, Kentucky, while en route to CSX\u2019s Parkersburg yard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-6\">. Courts have frequently consulted Restatements for guidance on the common law principles embodied in FELA. <em>See, e.g., Stevens v. Bangor and Aroostook R. Co., </em>97 F.3d 594, 602 (1st Cir.1996); <em>Ries v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>960 F.2d 1156, 1158-59 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">. Generally, the jury in a FELA case is not permitted to apportion damages. <em>See Ayers, </em>538 U.S. at 160, 123 S.Ct. 1210. Here, however, Benson argued that his first exposure created a \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d that was aggravated by the second exposure. When a FELA defendant\u2019s negligence aggravates a plaintiff\u2019s preexisting condition, the defendant is liable for the plaintiff's total damage unless he can prove the extent of the aggravation. <em>Stevens, </em>97 F.3d at 601-03. CSX offered no evidence on this point, and thus is liable for the full extent of Benson\u2019s injuries under the traditional rules of joint and several liability, which in FELA cases include the right to a <em>pro tanto </em>setoff for the amounts paid by the Settling Defendants. Benson may not avoid this result by recasting the injuries he suffered from the first exposure as a \"preexisting condition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
