July 27, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-20\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chen\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. As the BIA noted, its prior decision was issued in January 2003, but Chen did not file his motion until January 2007, well beyond the 90-day deadline. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA properly found that Chen\u2019s motion did not qualify for an exception to that time limitation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-21\">First, it is well-settled that the birth of U.S. citizen children is not evidence of changed conditions in China. <em>See Li Yong Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-31 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that the birth of U.S. citizen children constitutes a change in personal circumstances, not a change in country conditions, and therefore does not establish an exception to the filing deadline for motions to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Second, despite Chen\u2019s submission of various allegedly official Chinese government documents and recent U.S. State Department country reports, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that he failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his allegation that conditions in China have materially changed. In contrast to <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109, 115 (2d Cir.2006), there is no indication that the BIA failed to consider the documents Chen submitted in support of his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u201cWhere the BIA has given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings, it [need not] expressly parse or refute on the record each individual argument or piece of evidence offered by the petitioner,\u201d particularly when confronted with evidence it \u201cis asked to consider time and again.\u201d <em>Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 275 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We have previously reviewed the consideration, in the context of an untimely motion to reopen, of evidence similar to that submitted by the petitioner here and have found no abuse of discretion in its conclusion that such evidence was insufficient to establish changed conditions in China. <em>See, e.g., Jian Huan Guan v. BIA, </em>345 F.3d 47 (2d Cir.2003) (holding that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying a petitioner\u2019s untimely motion to reopen where petitioner submitted proof of the birth of her two sons, a letter from her parents warming of the danger of forced sterilization, and a purported sterilization certificate for her cousin who allegedly also had two children).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We conclude further that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Chen failed to demonstrate a \u201crealistic chance\u201d that he would face persecution if removed to China. <em>See Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 78 (2d Cir.2005) (requiring an asylum applicant seeking to reopen his case to \u201cestablish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for asylum, <em>i.e., </em>\u2018a realistic chance\u2019 that he will be able to establish eligibility\u201d). The BIA did not err in finding that Chen provided insufficient evidence that the birth of his U.S. citizen children violated the family planning policy in his area of residence in China, or that the implementation of sanctions resulting from any possible violation would rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (concluding that \u201c[i]n the absence of solid support in the record\u201d for an applicant\u2019s assertion that she would be persecuted, the BIA did not err in denying asylum because her fear was \u201cspeculative at best\u201d). We therefore need not examine Chen\u2019s argument challenging the BIA\u2019s finding that he must comply with the requirements of a motion to reopen in order to file a \u201csuccessive\u201d asylum application because, even assuming that the BIA\u2019s conclusion was erroneous, Chen failed to establish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
