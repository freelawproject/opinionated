We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Coleman v. United States, </em>Nos. 3:96-cv-00010-TWB-1; 3:07-cv-00346-GCM, 2007 WL 4303717 (W.D.N.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Dec. 10, 2007) &amp; 2008 WL 53542 (Jan. 2, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In No. 08-1012, which has been consolidated with the above case, Coleman petitions for a writ of mandamus, alleging the district court has unduly delayed acting on his petition for a writ of audita querela. He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Because the district court recently denied Coleman\u2019s petition, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">No. 08-1012 <em>PETITION DENIED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">No. 08-6074 <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
