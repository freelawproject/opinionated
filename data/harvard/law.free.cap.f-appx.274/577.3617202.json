He also appeals the revocation of the supervised release he was serving as part of the sentence imposed for a prior \u00a7 1326 violation, and the sentence imposed for violating the terms of that supervised release. We affirm the conviction and the revocation, as well as De Leon\u2019s two sentences. Because the parties are familiar with the facts of the case, we do not recite them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\n<em>1. Section 1326 Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">De Leon asserts that the district court erred in failing to grant his Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal, based on insufficient proof of alienage and voluntariness. We reject this argument. De Leon admitted his alienage, and his admission was corroborated by his prior deportations. <em>See United States v. Sotelo, </em>109 F.3d 1446, 1449 (9th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Contreras, </em>63 F.3d 852, 858 (9th Cir.1995). The jury could have inferred that his entry was voluntary because he was found at a location other than the border and had reentered following a prior deportation. <em>See United States v. Quintana-Torres, </em>235 F.3d 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 2000); <em>United States v. Rivera-Sillas, </em>417 F.3d 1014, 1021 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">De Leon also asserts that his conviction should be reversed because the district court failed to instruct the jury that De Leon\u2019s entry had to be voluntary. We agree that the district court erred but we find the error harmless. De Leon offered no evidence to rebut the government\u2019s showing that his reentry was voluntary. Because the record contains no \u201c \u2018evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the omitted element,\u2019 \u201d it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error. <em>See United, States v. Salazar-Gonzalez, </em>458 F.3d 851, 858-59 (9th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 19, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999)). We therefore affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">De Leon next argues that his 96-month sentence for his illegal reentry conviction is unreasonable. We disagree. The record reveals that the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines range of 84 to 105 months, and, after considering De Leon\u2019s arguments and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, found that a sentence in the middle of that range was warranted. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (district court should use Guidelines as starting point, listen to arguments from both sides, then consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine the proper sentence). The resulting within-Guidelines sentence was reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 994-95 (9th Cir.3008) (en banc); <em>id. </em>at 994 (\u201c \u2018[W]hen the judge\u2019s discretionary decision accords with the Commission\u2019s view of the appropriate application of \u00a7 3553(a) in the mine run of cases, it is probable that the sentence is reasonable.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007))).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">\n<em>2. Revocation of Supervised Release</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">In a separate appeal, De Leon claims that the district court abused its discretion by revoking his supervised release, because the government offered insufficient proof of alienage and voluntariness. Because we affirm his 2005 conviction, we reject this argument. De Leon\u2019s 2005 conviction for violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 shows by a preponderance of the evidence that he breached the terms of his supervised release for his prior Section 1326 conviction. <em>See United States v. Lomayaoma, </em>86 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>142, 146-47 (9th Cir.1996). We therefore affirm the revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Last, De Leon argues that the 13-month sentence he received for violating the terms of his supervised release was unreasonable. This argument fails as well. The district court properly used the Guidelines as a starting point and considered the specifics of De Leon\u2019s case and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) criteria in imposing the sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97. The resulting within-Guidelines sentence was not unreasonable. <em>Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 993-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Conviction AFFIRMED; sentence AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b604-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-16\">. De Leon argues that the district court failed to properly consider the section 3553(a) factors, but in actuality, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) governs revocation sentences. Section 3583(e) incorporates most of the section 3553(a) factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
