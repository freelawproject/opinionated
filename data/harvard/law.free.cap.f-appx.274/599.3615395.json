Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(c)(l)\u2019s requirement that a summons be served with a copy of the complaint has not been met. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c)(1). Nor did appellant serve a separate copy of the summons and complaint on the United States Attorney for the Southern District of California, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(i)(l). <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(i)(l). Moreover, the district court did not err in rejecting appellant\u2019s \u201cre-filed\u201d complaint because it was procedurally improper for appellant to re-file a complaint in that case after the had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>dismissed, even though the case was dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Accordingly, we summarily affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
