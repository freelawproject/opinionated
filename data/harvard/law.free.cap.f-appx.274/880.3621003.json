Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Lena B. Williams\u2019s appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 judgment in <em>Williams v. Mansfield, </em>07-2198 (Nov. 13, 2007), for lack of jurisdiction. Williams has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">On August 2, 2007, Williams filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, seeking review of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals\u2019 March 19, 2007, decision that denied her recognition as a surviving spouse eligible for death benefits. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims dismissed the appeal as untimely, finding that the appellant filed her appeal more than 120 days after the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals mailed its decision. Williams appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">In her informal brief, Williams states that her case does not involve the validity or interpretation of a statute, regulation, or a constitutional issue. She states that she wants the court to \u201csee that marriage is [reconsidered] by social security.\u201d Because Williams does not challenge the determination that her appeal was untimely, we deem the proper course is to summarily affirm the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motions are denied. The judgment of the Court of Veterans Claims is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
