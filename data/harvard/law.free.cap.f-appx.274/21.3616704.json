Chew, denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>In re Ji Xi Qiu, </em>No. A79 458 323 (B.I.A. Jul. 10, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A79 458 323 (Immig. <em>Ct. </em>N.Y. City May 11, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-15\">When, as here, the BIA issues a detailed opinion, affirming the IJ\u2019s decision and supplementing it, we review the BIA\u2019s opinion. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, and treat them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland See., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-16\">The BIA erred in independently assessing the record to find that Qiu\u2019s encounter with the family planning officials did not constitute past persecution and that his response did not constitute \u201cother resistance\u201d to the family planning policies. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>494 F.3d 296, 309-10 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)) (holding that while an alien is not <em>per se </em>eligible for asylum based on the forced abortion or sterilization of his wife by traditional marriage, he may establish eligibility for asylum by demonstrating \u201cother resistance to a coercive population control program\u201d or \u201ca well founded fear that he or she will be ... subject to persecution for such ... resistance ... \u201d). For all appeals filed after September 25, 2002, the BIA is no longer permitted to engage in <em>de novo </em>review of an IJ\u2019s factual findings. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (iv); <em>In re S-H-</em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 462, 466 (B.I.A.2002). Rather, \u201c[fjacts determined by the immigration judge, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, shall be reviewed only to determine whether the findings of the immigration judge are clearly erroneous.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (iv). The BIA\u2019s independent assessment of portions of the record not relied on by the IJ, as occurred in this case, is classic <em>de novo </em>review, which constitutes legal error and requires remand. <em>See Fen Yong Chen v. Bureau of Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs., </em>470 F.3d 509, 515 (2d Cir.2006) (review of record which independently assessed petitioner\u2019s credibility without giving deference to the findings of the IJ was legal error which required remand); <em>cf. Belortaja v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 619, 625 (2d Cir.2007) (BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on a factual determination made upon de novo review of the existing record was permissible under the pre-2002 regulations); <em>Xian Tuan Ye v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>446 F.3d 289, 296 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that the BIA did not engage in improper fact-finding when it emphasized the IJ\u2019s finding of an omission which was already in the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Moreover, we cannot say that remand would be futile here because of the numerous errors committed by the agency. <em>Cf. Cao He Lin, </em>428 F.3d at 401. First, the agency erred in failing to consider record evidence relevant to the question of whether Qiu \u201cresisted\u201d the Chinese family planning policy and whether he suffered past persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>see also Tian-Yong Chen, </em>359 F.3d at 128. In finding that Qiu\u2019s actions did not constitute \u201cresistance\u201d to that policy and that he was not persecuted, the agency failed to consider plainly material evidence regarding, inter alia, a physical confrontation between Qiu and family planning cadres, Qiu\u2019s detention, and a subsequent verbal confrontation between Qiu and family planning cadres at the Family Planning Board the day after his wife was forced to abort a pregnancy and sterilized, at which confrontation he was told he was being penalized for resisting and obstructing family planning regulations. <em>See Tian-Yong Chen, </em>359 F.3d at 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Second, the BIA\u2019s finding that Qiu\u2019s fear of sterilization is not objectively reasonable even assuming he engaged in and was persecuted for \u201cother resistance,\u201d was erroneous as it failed to shift the burden to the government. Where an alien\u2019s testimony has established past persecution, a presumption of well-founded fear of future persecution arises, at which point the burden shifts to the government to show otherwise. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(ii). In addition, in rejecting Qiu\u2019s claim of a well-founded fear of persecution due to lack of \u201cevidence that the cadres have demonstrated any ongoing interest in [Qiu],\u201d the BIA failed to take into account that Qui may base a claim of future persecution on \u201ca pattern or practice\u201d in China \u201cof persecution of a group of persons similarly situated\u201d to him. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii). Moreover, Qiu\u2019s testimony that the family planning authorities sterilized his wife in order to punish him lends credence to his claim that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>sought to persecute him. The BIA\u2019s hypothesis that the previous sterilization of Qiu\u2019s wife makes it unlikely for the family planning authorities to carry out their threat to sterilize Qui constituted impermissible speculation. <em>See Cao He Lin, </em>428 F.3d at 405 holding that (\u201cabsent record evidence of practices in foreign countries, the IJ must not speculate as to the existence or nature of such practices\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s order is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this decision. As we have completed our review, Qui\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
