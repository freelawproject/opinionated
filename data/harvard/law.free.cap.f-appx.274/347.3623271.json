Specifically, Al-varenga challenges the enhancement of his sentence based upon the district court\u2019s determination that his prior conviction for second degree assault is a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Because he has been released from prison and deported to Mexico, his appeal of his sentence is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Alvarenga challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v.
