The BIA ordered Nerghes deported, reversing the ruling of an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) who had granted Nerghes a deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Our review is limited to \u201cconstitutional or legal questions\u201d because Nerghes was ordered deported after committing an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d Nerghes\u2019s sole legal argument is that the BIA applied the wrong legal standard for \u201ctorture\u201d by failing to acknowledge that governmental \u201cwillful blindness\u201d to private abuses can constitute \u201ctorture.\u201d We reject this argument and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b444-22\">Alexandra Nerghes, age forty, is a native and citizen of Romania. He is also a Roma, or Gypsy,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an ethnic and cultural group that has often been persecuted throughout eastern Europe. Along with his parents, he entered the United States legally on August 30, 1975, and has lived in Cleveland, Ohio, since that time. Nerghes alleges that he has never returned to Romania, knows no family there, and speaks only \u201ca word or two\u201d of Romanian.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-23\">On April 11, 2003, an Ohio state jury convicted Nerghes of felonious assault and rape. Both counts arose from the same attack on his girlfriend that ended with her in the hospital. Five days later, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>judge sentenced him to two concurrent five-year prison terms for the two crimes. The Ohio Court of Appeals upheld both convictions on March 17, 2004. Nerghes has been incarcerated throughout these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Under United States immigration law, resident aliens who commit certain aggravated felonies, including those for which Nerghes was convicted, are subject to deportation. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Nerghes received a \u201cNotice to Appear in Removal Proceedings\u201d on August 4, 2004. On June 16, 2005, Nerghes filed to defer removal under the regulations implementing the CAT. The IJ held a full hearing on February 24, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Mr. Nerghes\u2019s mother, Eva Nerghes, testified first.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She explained that the family left Romania in 1975 to escape anti-Roma persecution. She testified that the family were treated as the \u201clast people\u201d in their village because of their ethnicity, and that when they applied for a visa to leave, the police officers beat and punched the couple while the superior officer sat around \u201claughing.\u201d Finally, she said that she had no family left in Romania and that Alexandra would suffer persecution if he were forced to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Alexandra Nerghes then testified that he had never returned to Romania, knew no one there, and spoke very little Romanian. He stated that he feared returning because he \u201cdon\u2019t know nothing [sic] about that country, sir.... I grew up here. This is all I know.\u201d When asked why else he feared to return, he responded that he \u201cwould be tortured ... because, of my race.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">Nerghes\u2019s expert, Mr. Ronald Lee, spoke last. Lee is a semi-retired journalist and author from Toronto, Canada, and a Roma himself. He testified that he has interviewed hundreds of Roma refugees, has written about the plight of the Roma, and has worked with organizations that help Roma integrate into Canadian society. Lee speaks Romani (the language of the Roma) fluently even though he has been to Romania only once.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">Lee testified at length about how the Roma are \u201cat the bottom of the pecking order\u201d in Romania and face a strong negative stereotype from the non-Roma population. Lee claimed that there have been 53 pogroms against the Roma in Romania since the fall of communism, and individual attacks are common in rural areas. The police \u201crare[ly]\u201d investigate these crimes; they are more likely to stand around and make sure the pogrom \u201cfires d[on\u2019t] spread to houses owned by Romanians.\u201d Whenever a crime is discovered, Roma are routinely rounded up as \u201cthe usual suspects\u201d and sometimes beaten by police in order to force a confession. Because private citizens are free to refuse to rent to Roma and add \u201cno Roma need apply\u201d to job applications. Roma often live in substandard conditions, and unemployment among the Roma is around sixty percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-17\">Lee acknowledged that the Romanian government does not persecute the Roma, but that persecution arises instead from the \u201cmindset of the people\u201d that the government cannot, or will not, control. While admitting that the Romanian government has passed laws favorable to the Roma, Lee claimed that the laws were \u201ccosmetic\u201d attempts to further its admission to the EU and are rarely enforced. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>final threat, Lee added, came from the mafia, which often extort or threaten the Roma because they know that the Roma cannot go to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">According to Lee, the Roma rely on extended family support to cope with these harsh conditions. He emphasized that because Nerghes has no relatives left in Romania, he would not be able to access this support system. Lee added that Nerghes would be immediately recognized as a Roma based on his physical features, and that the community would learn that he had been deported for a felony, and therefore the police would be even more likely to abuse Nerghes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Nerghes also submitted documentation on the current country conditions in Romania. The State Department\u2019s 2004 <em>Country Report </em>on Romania says that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however, there were problems in some areas. Police officers sometimes beat detainees and reportedly harassed and used excessive force against Roma. While some progress was made in reforming the police, cases of inhuman and degrading treatment continued to be reported. Investigations of police abuses generally were lengthy and inconclusive, rarely resulting in prosecution or punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The Report went on to state that \u201cno extrajudicial killings,\u201d took place, but the Report found \u201ccredible reports that police beat detainees,\u201d and identified two incidents where police and accompanying civilian thugs beat Roma civilians. It lists several government programs designed to help the Roma, but describes the programs as \u201cunderstaffed and undertrained.\u201d The 2003 State Department <em>Country Report </em>contains substantially similar statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Nerghes also submitted a 2004 Amnesty International report that discusses Romania and lists two incidents where private security guards beat Roma civilians. A series of reports from the European Ro-mani Rights Center discusses the Roma situation. The upshot of these reports is that in addition to severe discrimination, two or three dozen reported attacks on Roma occur each year, and they range from fatal beatings to property destruction to minor street violence. Police officers occasionally perpetrate the attacks, but they are more likely to look the other way when they happen. These documents paint a bleak picture of life in Romania as a Roma, but a picture less harsh than the picture Lee paints.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">On February 24, 2006, the day of the hearing, the IJ found Nerghes removable based on conviction of an aggregated felony, but granted Nerghes\u2019s request to defer deportation under the CAT. The IJ first found Nerghes and his witnesses credible, and then found that the evidence painted a \u201cgrim\u201d picture for a Roma in Romania. Four facts informed the IJ\u2019s decision that Nerghes was more likely than not to be tortured if returned to Romania: 1) Nerghes has no status and no family protection in Romania; 2) Nerghes cannot speak Romanian and thus cannot communicate; 3) Nerghes does not even have a high school education and therefore faces bleak job prospects; and 4) Nerghes\u2019s criminal record will make him an immediate target for the Romanian police. According to the IJ, these facts make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Nerghes particularly vulnerable to mistreatment well beyond \u201croutine police brutality.\u201d Most importantly, the IJ concluded that the Romania government would \u201cacquiesce\u201d to this \u201csystematic and severe mistreatment,\u201d because the record showed that \u201cthe government of Romania is willfully blind to the conduct of its citizens and police forces.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The government appealed this decision to the BIA. On July 11, 2006, a split BIA panel reversed the IJ\u2019s decision. J.A. at 6-10. While the BIA found no \u201cclear error\u201d in the IJ\u2019s credibility findings, it nevertheless held that Nerghes failed to prove that it was \u201cmore likely than not that he would be subjected to torture if returned to Romania.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. The BIA acknowledged that the record showed that incidents of violence and discrimination against the Roma were \u201ca problem in Romania,\u201d but reasoned that because of recent improvements in country conditions documented in State Department Reports, it was \u201cnot more likely than not that a <em>\u2022public official would consent or acquiesce </em>\u201d to whatever mistreatment Nerghes faced. <em>Id. </em>at 7 (emphasis added). Therefore, any mistreatment, no matter how severe, would not be <em>torture </em>within the meaning of the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The BIA also \u201cdiscounted\u201d Mr. Lee\u2019s testimony, finding that while it was \u201cprobative and useful,\u201d it deserved less weight than the IJ afforded it because Lee had no degree in any relevant field. <em>Id,, </em>at 8. Finally, the BIA concluded that the \u201cfour factors\u201d identified by the IJ were relevant only to Nerghes\u2019s risk of hardship and not to the probability of torture. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The dissenting judge believed that these four factors were relevant to the probability of torture,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but favored remanding the case to the IJ because she was skeptical of some of Nerghes\u2019s factual claims. <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Nerghes now appeals. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">We begin by explaining the limits to our jurisdiction and then consider Nerghes\u2019s sole claim over which we have jurisdiction. Our court determines its own jurisdiction de novo. <em>Abu-Khaliel v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 627, 630 (6th Cir.2006). We review the BIA\u2019s construction of a statute to determine if it is \u201cmanifestly contrary to the law.\u201d <em>Amir v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 921, 927 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">Resident aliens such as Nerghes who commit certain \u201caggravated felonies\u201d listed in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) are subject to removal. Nerghes concedes his remov-ability under this statute. The statute is part of a larger scheme designed to \u201cexpedite the removal of aliens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies,\u201d <em>Zhang v. INS, </em>274 F.3d 103, 108 (2d Cir.2001), and one of Congress\u2019s tools to accomplish that goal was a provision that limits our jurisdiction. Under the statutory scheme Congress established,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-14\">[njotwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), ... <em>no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal </em>against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1182(a)(2) or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of this title....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">This bar to jurisdiction is qualified by the next subparagraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">Nothing in subparagraph (B) or (C), or in any other provision of this chapter (other than this section) which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of <em>constitutional claims or questions of law </em>raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">We therefore have jurisdiction over Nerghes\u2019s claims only to the extent that they are \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Our circuit has stated that the phrase \u201cquestions of law\u201d in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) means \u201cmatters of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Almuhtaseb v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 743, 748 (6th Cir.2006). These \u201cmatters\u201d subject to review include whether the alien\u2019s crime was an aggravated felony, <em>Patel v. Ashcroft, </em>401 F.3d 400, 407 (6th Cir.2005), and \u201cwhether the BIA used the correct standard in reviewing the IJ\u2019s decision and whether it [the BIA] assigned him [the alien] the correct burden of proof.\u201d <em>Tran v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 937, 943 (6th Cir.2006). They do not include \u201cdiscretionary or factual questions.\u201d <em>Almuhtaseb, </em>453 F.3d at 748. The alien in <em>Tran </em>admitted that he was removable because he committed an aggravated felony, but, like Nerghes, he sought to defer removal under the CAT. <em>Id. </em>at 938. The BIA rejected his claim, and we affirmed because Tran raised no legal issues. <em>Id. </em>at 943. More recently, we held once again that when an alien facing removal after committing an aggravated felony raises \u201conly a question of fact ... we are without jurisdiction\u201d to hear the appeal. <em>Pepaj v. Mu-kasey, </em>509 F.3d 725, 728 (6th Cir.2007) (refusing to consider alien\u2019s argument about changed country conditions). These cases show that our circuit has explicitly and repeatedly held that its jurisdiction in cases such as Nerghes\u2019s is limited to \u201cpure\u201d questions of law such as statutory construction and whether the correct standard was applied. Nerghes raises one such question: whether the BIA applied the correct legal definition of \u201ctorture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">Torture is \u201cany act by which severe pain or suffering, whether mental or physical, is intentionally inflicted on a person ... by or at the <em>instigation of </em>or with the <em>consent or acquiescence of a public official </em>or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>398 F.3d 396, 404-05 (6th Cir.2005) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1) (emphasis added)). Purely private mistreatment, even extreme abuse that one might commonly call torture, is not \u201ctorture\u201d under the CAT because there is no governmental involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">This requirement makes relief under the CAT more difficult to obtain than other forms of relief under the INA because \u201ctorture\u201d requires governmental \u201cconsent or acquiescence\u201d to private abuses. \u201cTorture\u201d also covers a narrower, more severe category of abusive conduct than \u201cpersecution\u201d for purposes of asylum. <em>Mouawad v. Gonzales, </em>485 F.3d 405, 413 (8th Cir.2007). Furthermore, under the CAT the petitioner must prove that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to his native country, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2), while an alien can obtain asylum by showing only a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). We have not said how probable persecution must be in order for the alien\u2019s fear of persecution to be well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>founded, but we have stated that the alien\u2019s burden of proof is \u201csignificantly greater\u201d under the CAT. <em>Sarr v. Gonzales, </em>485 F.3d 354, 362 (6th Cir.2007). This makes sense, because the CAT explicitly requires the alien to show that a greater than fifty percent chance of torture exists to obtain relief, but one can easily have a well-founded fear when the probability of abuse is, say, twenty-five percent. But relief under the CAT is easier to obtain in one respect: the applicant need not show that \u201che fears future harm on the basis of any statutorily-defined ground.\u201d <em>Moua-wad, </em>485 F.3d at 413. The critical question for this case is what a \u201cpublic official\u201d must do, or not do, to \u201cacquiesce\u201d to private citizen\u2019s conduct to make that conduct \u201ctorture.\u201d Federal regulations provide that the official must know of the private abuse and \u201cbreach his or her legal duty to intervene to prevent such activity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">One BIA case, <em>In Re S-V- </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1306 (2000), held that under this regulation, the officials must \u201cwillfully accept\u201d the torturous activities of private parties. <em>Id. </em>at 1312. Multiple courts of appeal, including our own, have rejected this holding as \u201cmanifestly contrary to the law.\u201d <em>Amir v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 921, 927 (6th Cir.2006) (citing cases from the Second and Ninth Circuits). The correct interpretation is that \u201cacquiescence\u201d does not require <em>\u201cwillful acceptance </em>\u201d of private parties\u2019 activities, but can be satisfied if the officials are <em>willfully blind </em>to what is happening. <em>Amir, </em>467 F.3d at 927. \u201cWillful blindness\u201d is \u201cdeliberate avoidance of knowledge.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(8th ed.2004). It can co-exist with either approval or disapproval of the activity to which one is willfully blind.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nerghes argues that the BIA incorrectly applied the \u201cwillful acceptance\u201d standard rather than the \u201cwillful blindness\u201d standard because it never referred to \u201cwillful blindness,\u201d and cited <em>Matter ofS-V-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Although the BIA decision is not a model of clarity or judicial craftsmanship, three reasons support finding that it applied the correct standard. The relevant BIA discussion follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">Further, the harm feared must be \u201cinflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1); <em>see also Ali v. Reno, </em>237 F.3d 591, 597 (6th Cir.2001). When the alien alleges a likelihood of torture from nongovernmental actors, he or she must establish that the torture feared would be inflicted by or with the acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. To demonstrate acquiescence, the respondent must do more than show that the officials are simply aware of the activity constituting torture and are powerless to stop it. <em>See Matter of S-V-, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 1306, 1312 (BIA 2000). A public official\u2019s acquiescence to torture \u201crequires that the public official, prior to the activity constituting torture, have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>vent such activity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(7).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">J.A. 7. First, the BIA cited <em>Ali v. Reno, </em>287 F.3d 591, 597 (6th Cir.2001). J.A. 7. This citation is to the specific page in the specific case where our court discussed the definition of torture and the quoted language appears in the same paragraph that established that the term \u201cacquiescence\u201d included \u201cwillful blindness.\u201d <em>See Ali, </em>237 F.3d at 597. <em>Amir </em>had not yet been decided when the BIA issued its decision in this case, so the BIA cited the strongest then-existing authority in our circuit for the willful blindness standard.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Second, the proposition for which the BIA cited <em>Matter of S-V- </em>is not the proposition from the case that has been held \u201cmanifestly contrary to the law.\u201d Instead, the BIA cited <em>Matter of S-V- </em>for a proposition is logically true and still good law. The BIA wrote that \u201crespondent must do more than show that the officials are simply aware of the activity constituting torture and are powerless to stop it. <em>See Matter of S-V-, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 1306, 1312 (BIA 2000).\u201d J.A. 7. This is a logically true statement because the person seeking relief must show something more than knowledge and a lack of power; he or she must show <em>acquiescence, </em>and acquiescence can, in turn, be proven through willful blindness. A government can know about private abuses, and instead of pretending they do not happen, seek to stop them, but lack the power to do so. It is a legally correct statement because, as the Eighth Circuit explained, \u201c[a] government does not acquiesce in the torture of its citizens merely because it is aware of torture but powerless to stop it, but it does cross the line into acquiescence when it shows willful blindness toward the torture of citizens by third parties.\u201d <em>Mouawad, </em>485 F.3d at 413. By contrast, <em>Amir </em>held that <em>Matter of S</em>V-\u2019s statement that the alien must show that \u201cofficials are <em>willfully accepting \u201d </em>the torturous activities of private parties is manifestly contrary to the law. <em>Amir, </em>467 F.3d at 927. (emphasis in original). The \u201cwillful acceptance\u201d requirement is contrary to the law, but it is not in the BIA opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Third, the BIA\u2019s language mirrors that of cases where courts have found that the BIA applied the correct standard more closely than it resembles the language in cases where courts concluded the opposite. The BIA quoted the correct regulatory definition of \u201ctorture,\u201d and while it did not use the words \u201cwillful blindness,\u201d it need not mechanically recite the specific words \u201cwillful blindness\u201d in every case. Courts have not imposed such a requirement. <em>Cruz-Funez v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1187, 1192 (10th Cir.2005) (BIA correctly applied \u201cwillful blindness\u201d standard even though the BIA opinion did not use the words \u201cwillful blindness\u201d). By contrast, in cases where a court of appeals held that the BIA applied the wrong standard, the BIA opinions usually contain language patently inconsistent with the willful blindness standard. <em>See, e.g., Ornelas-Chavez v. Gonzales, </em>458 F.3d 1052, 1058 (9th Cir.2006) (BIA ignored willful blindness test by requiring petitioner to show that the government \u201csanctioned\u201d his torture); <em>Reyes-Reyes v. Ashcroft, </em>384 F.3d 782, 787 (9th Cir.2004) (BIA ignored willful blindness test by requiring petitioner to show that he would be tortured \u201cby or at the instigation of the government\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Nerghes cannot point to any such language in the BIA\u2019s opinion in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In our recent case of <em>Tran, </em>we remanded to the BIA for clarification, holding that we could not determine whether the BIA applied the correct standard of review. <em>Tran, </em>447 F.3d at 944. Our dissenting colleague believes that we should do so here. The dissent offers a plausible reading of the record, but we do not think it offers the best reading. In <em>Tran, </em>the BIA did not \u201crefer[] to <em>any </em>standard of review,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>while in this case, the BIA quoted the correct regulatory standard, never referenced the erroneous \u201cwillful acceptance\u201d standard and cited the then-leading case in which our circuit determined that the standard included \u201cwillful blindness.\u201d While the BIA should have spoken more clearly, we are satisfied that it applied the correct legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Nerghes argues that the BIA committed \u201clegal\u201d error by improperly discounting the testimony of his expert witness and by \u201crendering a decision which was not compelled by the evidence simply because it did not agree with the IJ.\u201d Both errors are no more than factual appeals dressed up as legal challenges, and are therefore not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The BIA held that while Mr. Lee\u2019s testimony was \u201cprobative and useful,\u201d it should have been given \u201cdiminished weight\u201d because he lacked any formal education in the field, had never been to Romania, and relied on \u201canecdotal interviews\u201d and \u201cinternet articles\u201d in reaching his conclusions. J.A. 8. Nerghes offers an extensive argument as to why Lee should be considered an \u201cexpert\u201d under the Federal Rules of Evidence. We need not consider the merits of this argument because the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply at immigration proceedings. <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>398 F.3d 396, 406 (6th Cir.2005). A \u201cviolation\u201d of irrelevant rules cannot be a legal error. <em>See ibid. </em>Furthermore, we note that evidentiary matters in immigration hearings are governed only by the principles of due process. <em>Ibid. </em>Nerghes received due process, as even the BIA acknowledged that Mr. Lee\u2019s testimony was \u201cprobative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">As mentioned earlier, we have jurisdiction to review whether the BIA applied the correct burden of proof. <em>Tran, </em>447 F.3d at 943. Here, the BIA applied the correct burden, that Nerghes must show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be tortured if he returns to Romania. J.A. 9. Nerghes nevertheless contends that the BIA committed a legal error by overturning the IJ\u2019s decision when \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d supported the IJ\u2019s conclusion. (Pet\u2019r Br. 17) (citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacari-as, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). Case law forecloses this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">At the outset, Nerghes fails to realize that the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test under <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>applies only when a court reviews the BIA or IJ. The BIA reviews the IJ under a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A). This is precisely what the BIA did in this case. J.A. 6 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A), and explaining that review is for clear error).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Nerghes\u2019s real claim is that the BIA incorrectly weighed the evidence when it held that the Nerghes failed to meet his burden of proof and that the IJ\u2019s contrary conclusion was clearly erroneous. This is a plausible argument, but not a legal question which we may review. <em>Pepaj, </em>509 F.3d at 728 (proof of changed country conditions is factual, not legal); <em>Tran, </em>447 F.3d at 943 (weight of evidence is a factual conclusion); <em>Hamid v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 642, 647 (7th Cir.2005) (holding IJ decision of whether torture was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be a factual, not legal question).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Nerghes faces an unpleasant future in Romania, but whether he can meet the difficult burden of proving that the future is so grim that it includes a greater than fifty percent chance of torture is a question we need not, and indeed cannot, consider. Nerghes\u2019s only claim over which we have jurisdiction lacks merit, and we cannot consider his other claims without ignoring settled law in our circuit. The judgment of the BIA is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A-d\">. We use the term \u201cRoma\u201d throughout this opinion because \u201cRoma\u201d is more accurate given that numerous non-Romani ethnic groups have been called \"Gypsies.\u201d <em>See </em>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsy (last visited March 31, 2008). Furthermore, many Roma object to the term \"Gypsy\u201d to be \"pejorative.\u201d <em>See </em>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma\u2014 people (last visited March 31, 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b445-11\">. Eva Nerghes testified that she became a citizen in 1987. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1433(a) permits parents who achieve citizenship to naturalize their foreign-bom children only if the child is under eighteen. Alexandra Nerghes was bom in 1967 and thus was twenty when his mother was naturalized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\">. At oral argument, the government suggested that the Romanian government need not find out about the convictions because aliens like Nerghes are not always sent back \"chained to a Marshal.\u201d However, there is no evidence in the record either way on this point. Fortunately, the method of Nerghes\u2019s return is immaterial to our decision today, but we would find evidence on this point helpful in future cases where the method of return is relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\">. Although the parties do not argue this point, the dissenting judge was correct. While Nerghes's inability to speak Romanian and lack of family connections may be relevant to hardship, and hardship is usually irrelevant to torture, these factors are also logically relevant to the probability that he will be picked up and beaten by the police and therefore relevant to the statistical likelihood of torture in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\">. For example, in <em>Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1194 (9th Cir.2003), Mr. Zheng feared violence at the hands of the \"Snakeheads,\u201d a powerful Chinese criminal organization who had initially smuggled Zheng out of China and into the United States. The Chinese government, while not <em>accepting </em>or <em>approving </em>of the Snakeheads\u2019 private violence, refused to step in and prevent the violence because it pretended that the Snakeheads did not exist. Acting would require the government to acknowledge the Snakeheads\u2019 existence and thereby \"lose face,\u201d something the government was unwilling to do. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\">. The dissent suggests that the citation tells us little. On that reading, the BIA did not cite <em>Ali </em>when defining \"acquiescence,\u201d but cited only <em>Matter of S-V-. </em>Dissenting Op. at 426-27. We respectfully disagree and point out that the BIA discussed and defined \u201cacquiescence\u201d throughout the entire above-quoted paragraph, and that the BIA cited <em>Ali </em>before, and the regulations both before and after, the citation to <em>Matter of S-V-.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\">. Nerghes may have thought he was arguing that the BIA failed to apply the \"clearly erroneous\u201d standard when it reviewed the IJ when he referred to the substantial evidence test in his brief. While failure to apply the \"clearly erroneous\u201d standard is a reviewable question of law, <em>Tran, </em>447 F.3d at 943, it is not an argument Nerghes made. Even if we were to consider the issue, the claim would fail because the BIA cited the correct \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. J.A. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b452-5\">JULIA SMITH GIBBONS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Azz\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Because we cannot ascertain that the BIA applied the correct standard for torture through \u201cacquiescence,\u201d pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(7), and because the proper course in such instances is to remand, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">As the majority correctly notes, \u201cacquiescence\u201d does not require \u201cwillful acceptance\u201d by a public official; \u201cwillful blindness\u201d will suffice. <em>See Amir v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 921, 927 (6th Cir.2006). As the majority also notes, remand to the BIA is appropriate where we are unable determine whether the BIA has applied the correct legal standard. <em>See Tran v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 937, 944 (6th Cir.2006). Here, although the BIA did not mention the \u201cwillful blindness\u201d standard and cited a case that provides the wrong standard, the majority nonetheless strains to conclude that the BIA applied the correct standard. I am unpersuaded by the majority\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">First, the majority reads this court\u2019s decision in <em>Amir v. Gonzales </em>too narrowly. In <em>Amir, </em>this court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">In the case at bar, the IJ applied <em>In Re S-V- </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1306 (2000), to Amir\u2019s CAT claim. In S-kj the BIA held that a petitioner \u201cmust do more than show that the officials are aware of the activity but are powerless to stop it. He must demonstrate that ... officials are <em>willfully accepting </em>of the guerillas\u2019 torturous activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1312 (emphasis supplied). Because Amir did not show that the Indonesian government was willfully accepting of the fanatical Muslim activity, the IJ dismissed the CAT claim <em>without further analysis. </em>We join the Ninth and Second Circuits in holding that <em>In Re S-V- </em>directly conflicts with Congress\u2019s clear intent to include \u201cwillful blindness\u201d in the definition of \u201cacquiescence.\u201d ... Today we explicitly hold that the IJ\u2019s reliance on <em>In Re S-V- </em>was manifestly contrary to the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">467 F.3d at 927 (emphasis added). In other words, the <em>Amir court </em>remanded not only because the IJ had erroneously applied the \u201cwillful acceptance\u201d standard, but because the IJ had not <em>analyzed whether public officials were willfully blind. Id. </em>The BIA\u2019s analysis in this case also suffers from the latter deficiency. Despite the IJ\u2019s findings of \u201cnumerous instances where the government of Romania is willfully blind to severe mistreatment of Roma citizens by its own police,\u201d the BIA made no mention of the possibility of acquiescence through willful blindness.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">Second, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, the BIA\u2019s citation of <em>Ali v. Reno, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>237 F.3d 591, 597 (6th Cir.2001), tells us little. The BIA cited <em>Ali </em>for its recognition of the regulatory definition of \u201ctorture\u201d pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1). To be sure, the <em>Ali </em>court noted later in its opinion, while interpreting \u201cacquiescence,\u201d that the legislative history of \u00a7 1208.18(a)(7) suggests that \u201cwillful blindness\u201d constitutes \u201cacquiescence.\u201d 237 F.3d at 597. Had the BIA cited <em>Ali </em>for its definition of \u201cacquiescence,\u201d we might surmise that the BIA had read to this later point in the <em>Ali </em>decision and had willful blindness in mind when it analyzed Nerghes\u2019s claim. But while interpreting \u201cacquiescence,\u201d the BIA only cited <em>Matter of S-V-, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 1306, 1312 (BIA 2000), which contains the definition of \u201cacquiescence\u201d that is now \u201cmanifestly contrary to law.\u201d <em>Amir, </em>467 F.3d at 927. The majority suggests that \u201cthe quoted language\u201d from the BIA\u2019s decision is from the same paragraph in which the <em>Ali </em>court established that \u201cacquiescence\u201d includes \u201cwillful blindness.\u201d Majority Op. at 424. Yet the quoted language from 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1) appears in a different paragraph, 30 lines (including a footnote) before the <em>Ali </em>court first mentions \u201cwillful blindness.\u201d 237 F.3d at 597. The majority\u2019s charitable reading of the BIA\u2019s reference to <em>Ali </em>seems unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Finally, the majority\u2019s suggestion that the BIA has sometimes erred more egregiously than it did in this case does not resolve whether remand is appropriate here. The majority is correct that the BIA need not recite the words \u201cwillful blindness\u201d whenever \u201cacquiescence of a public official\u201d is at issue. For example, we would not expect to see reference to the \u201cwillful blindness\u201d standard when the issue was whether a perpetrator was a \u201cpublic official.\u201d <em>See Cruz-Funez v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1187, 1192 (10th Cir.2005) (concluding that IJ did not err in finding existence of a <em>\u201cprivate </em>vendetta\u201d rather than \u201cacquiescence of a <em>public official </em>\u201d) (emphases added). But where acquiescence itself is at issue, we might expect, if not an explicit reference to the \u201cwillful blindness\u201d standard, at least a clear indication that the BIA applied the correct standard. Here, the IJ specifically found acquiescence through \u201cwillful blind[ness]\u201d by the Romanian Government. Yet, because the BIA reversed the IJ\u2019s CAT determination with no reference to the proper standard (and one citation to a dubious standard), we do not know whether the BIA also considered the \u201cwillful blindness\u201d standard. The BIA\u2019s decision here, as judged by its own opinion, in my view just as likely derives from application of an improper standard as from application of a proper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">For these reasons, I would remand to the BIA with instructions to analyze Nerghes\u2019s CAT application under the \u201cwillful blindness\u201d standard.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
