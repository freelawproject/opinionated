Jerry argues that his role in the drug trafficking operation was merely that of a middleman and, thus, is insufficient to support a three-level aggravating-role enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). He asserts that, at best, the evidence supported that he was a co-conspirator eligible for a one or two-level enhancement, but did not demonstrate that he exercised control or influence over the distribution of the drags or the collection of the drag proceeds. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881, 892 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cA district court\u2019s upward adjustment of a defendant\u2019s Guidelines offense level ... under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 is a finding of fact reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>287 F.3d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-16\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for an increase in the offense level based on the defendant\u2019s role in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. A three-level increase is applied if the defendant \u201cwas a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). In making the aggravating role determination, the district court should consider several factors, including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-17\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-18\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4). \u201cThe government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">A defendant\u2019s status as a middleman or distributor is insufficient to support a managerial role enhancement. <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir. 1993). Rather, the government must establish that the defendant exercised \u201cauthority in the organization that perpetrates the criminal conduct, the exertion of control, or leadership.\u201d <em>United States v. Alred, </em>144 F.3d 1405, 1422 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Here, the testimony presented at sentencing established that Jerry was more than a middleman in the drug-trafficking operation, which involved at least five participants, including himself, codefendants Taurus Geter, Dominick Jagne, Derrick Glen, Travis Smith, and a man known by the name of \u201cJit.\u201d The record indicates that Jerry met with a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) and instructed the Cl to retrieve \u201cbombs\u201d of heroin from codefendant Jagne, and to sell those drugs at a specific street corner in Miami\u2019s Overtown neighborhood. In addition to assigning specific locations for each seller, Jerry also facilitated the distribution of the drugs to the sellers from a central apartment. Further, Jerry collected the drug proceeds from the Cl after the sales were completed and passed the money on to codefendant Geter. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in determining that the government established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Jerry was a manager or supervisor within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In light of the foregoing, Jerry\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
