(\u201cWhirlwind\u201d) appeals from a July 21, 2006 judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Holwell, J.), following a bench trial, finding Whirlwind in breach of contract and awarding plaintiff-counter-defendant-ap-pellee Sogeti USA LLC (\u201cSogeti\u201d) contract damages and interest. The district court also dismissed Whirlwind\u2019s counterclaims of breach of contract, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation. When reviewing a district court\u2019s judgment after a bench trial, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>Grace v. Corbis-Sygma, </em>487 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir.2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-17\">First, Whirlwind claims that Sogeti failed to prove that it performed the services for which it billed because Sogeti did not produce the employee timesheets upon which its invoices were based. However, the parties\u2019 Professional Services Agreement (\u201cPSA\u201d) requires only that invoices be \u201cbased on Sogeti USA LLC time-sheets.\u201d While Whirlwind had the right under the PSA\u2019s audit provision to request timesheets for a period of one year after submission of related invoices, it never did so. At trial, Sogeti representatives testified about work performed and further testified that they had contemporaneously reviewed employee timesheets. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>these circumstances, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that Sogeti\u2019s invoices accurately reflected work performed or its award of damages based on the invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Second, Whirlwind contends that the district court erred when it rejected Whirlwind\u2019s fraudulent inducement defense. To establish fraudulent inducement under New York law, Whirlwind must, among other things, \u201cprove a misrepresentation or a material omission of fact which was false and known to be false by [Sogeti].\u201d <em>Lama Holding Co. v. Smith Barney Inc., </em>88 N.Y.2d 413, 421, 646 N.Y.S.2d 76, 668 N.E.2d 1370 (1996). Whirlwind claims that it entered the PSA and subsequent Statements of Work (\u201cSOWs\u201d) based on Sogeti\u2019s false representations that: (1) it had the necessary expertise and experience to evaluate and select an Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system; and (2) there were numerous ERPs that could perform \u201cactual costing\u201d of inventory when in fact no ERP could do so. The district court found that Sogeti made no false representations, in part based on the court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cactual costs could have been tracked by [the Oracle ERP system], either by creating a so-called work-around or by customizing the Oracle system.\u201d We find no clear error in this determination, and thus agree with the district court\u2019s rejection of Whirlwind\u2019s fraudulent inducement defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Third, Whirlwind claims that the district court erred when it awarded contract damages for services performed by two subcontractors who Sogeti engaged without the prior written consent of Whirlwind, as required by the PSA. The district court concluded that, as a matter of law, the personnel in question were not subcontractors because Whirlwind did not subcontract to them any portion of the contract, but rather hired them as outside consultants to guide Sogeti employees in implementing the ERP system. This distinction is based more in semantics than in the language of the contract. The PSA plainly states that \u201cwork to be performed may not be delegated or subcontracted ... without the prior express written consent of [Whirlwind].\u201d Regardless of the label attached to the personnel, Sogeti delegated work to these two individual without the contractually required written consent and thus breached the agreement. Nevertheless, Whirlwind knew of and approved of the personnel in question, including their hourly billing rate, and accepted and bene-fitted from their services. Accordingly, Sogeti was entitled to be paid for them services in quantum meruit. <em>See Moors v. Hall, </em>143 A.D.2d 336, 532 N.Y.S.2d 412, 414 (2d Dep\u2019t 1988) (\u201cAs a general rule, the performance and acceptance of services gives rise to the inference of an implied contract to pay for the reasonable value of such services.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Fourth, Whirlwind argues that the district court erred when it awarded contract damages for services performed by Sogeti employees who Whirlwind never expressly authorized under any SOW. The district court found, however, that Whirlwind\u2019s Chief Information Officer (\u201cCIO\u201d) \u201cknew of and approved the Sogeti personnel\u201d whose services were in dispute. The district court based this finding on evidence presented at trial that the CIO reviewed and approved of the employees\u2019 resumes and that Whirlwind provided the employees with on-site office space and network connectivity. While Whirlwind is correct that each SOW lists the names of employees who will be working on an engagement, nothing in the PSA or any SOW indicates that Whirlwind had to approve in writing any additional employees joining an engagement, as it now contends. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>find no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that Whirlwind knowingly accepted the services of the employees and thus should pay for their services.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Fifth, Whirlwind asserts that the district court erred when it awarded damages for services rendered after the interim SOW-3a expired on June 7, 2002. The district court found that Whirlwind, through its conduct, agreed that Sogeti would continue to work on the project from June 7 until June 13, when Whirlwind terminated Sogeti. The district court based this determination on testimony that the purpose of the \u201cinterim\u201d SOW-3a was to \u201cbridge from one project to another\u201d and that Whirlwind\u2019s CIO requested that the team keep working until the next SOW was negotiated. In addition, the language of SOW-3a itself states that the agreement \u201cis intended to be an interim document to facilitate continuous work on the project while both parties work in good faith to finalize\u201d the next SOW. We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s finding based on the evidence that Whirlwind requested and accepted Sogeti\u2019s services during the time period in dispute and should be compensated for those services.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Sixth, Whirlwind claims that the district court erred when it applied to Sogeti\u2019s unpaid invoices the 1.5% monthly service charge mandated by the PSA because the rate was contrary to New York law as usurious. Under New York law, \u201c[t]he rudimentary element of usury is the existence of a loan or forbearance of money.\u201d <em>Feinberg v. Old Vestal Road Assocs., </em>157 A.D.2d 1002, 550 N.Y.S.2d 482, 483 (3rd Dep\u2019t 1990). Because the monthly service charge does not constitute a loan or forbearance, <em>see F.K. Gailey Co. v. Wahl, </em>262 A.D.2d 985, 692 N.Y.S.2d 563, 564 (4th Dep\u2019t 1999); <em>Waterbury v. City of Oswego, </em>251 A.D.2d 1060, 674 N.Y.S.2d 530, 531 (4th Dep\u2019t 1998), the usury statute is inapplicable. In addition, Whirlwind, as a corporation, may not assert a usury defense under New York law. <em>See </em>N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law \u00a7 5-521 (\u201cNo corporation shall hereafter interpose the defense of usury in any action.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s application of the contractually agreed upon interest rate for late payments was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Seventh, Whirlwind argues that the district court erred when it dismissed Whirlwind\u2019s counterclaim for negligent misrepresentation because it found no \u201cspecial relationship\u201d existed between the parties. To prevail in claiming that Sogeti engaged in negligent misrepresentation under New York law, Whirlwind must show that: (1) Sogeti had a duty of care to impart correct information due to a special relationship between the parties; (2) the information was false; and (3) Whirlwind reasonably relied on the information. <em>Fresh Direct, LLC v. Blue Martini Software, Inc., </em>7 A.D.3d 487, 776 N.Y.S.2d 301, 302 (2d Dep\u2019t 2004). \u201cIn the commercial context, \u2018liability for negligent misrepresentation has been imposed only on those persons who possess unique or specialized expertise, or who are in a special position of confidence and trust with the injured party such that reliance on the negligent misrepresentation is justified.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kimmell v. Schaefer, </em>89 N.Y.2d 257, 263, 652 N.Y.S.2d 715, 675 N.E.2d 450 (1996)). Because Whirlwind, which was entirely inexperienced with ERP systems, engaged Sogeti precisely because the latter had specialized experience in the field, a special relationship may have existed in this case. We need not, however, decide this issue as Whirlwind\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim fails nonetheless because, as noted above, the district court found that Sogeti\u2019s representations concerning ERP systems were not false \u2014 a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>determination that we conclude is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Finally, we reject Whirlwind\u2019s contention that the district court failed to issue adequate and sufficient findings of fact for our review. <em>See Fair Housing in Huntington Comm. Inc. v. Town of Huntington, </em>316 F.3d 357, 364 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
