His counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Cisneros has not filed a pro se supplemental brief, but has filed a motion to amend his counsel\u2019s brief and a supplement to his motion. For the reasons discussed below, we grant the motions of Cisneros and his counsel, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-22\">Counsel argues that the district court erred because, in determining the drug quantity attributable to Cisneros, it relied on a witness who gave inconsistent testimony and is a known methamphetamine user. After careful review, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining drug quantity. <em>See United States v. Carpenter, </em>422 F.3d 738, 748 (8th Cir.2005) (district court\u2019s findings of fact regarding quantity of drugs attributed to defendant is reviewed for clear error); <em>United States v. Titlbach, </em>300 F.3d 919, 923 (8th Cir.2002) (court of appeals will disturb sentencing court\u2019s drug-quantity calculation only if entire record definitely and firmly convinces court that mistake has been made); <em>United States v. Dier-ling, </em>131 F.3d 722, 736 (8th Cir.1997) (sentencing court\u2019s credibility assessment is nearly unreviewable on appeal); <em>see also United States v. Mickelson, </em>378 F.3d 810, 822 (8th Cir.2004) (testimony of co-conspirators is sufficient evidence on which court may base quantity of drugs used for sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-23\">In his pro se motion, Cisneros asserts that his sentence should be based on only the drugs in his possession at the time of his arrest. We disagree. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>499 F.3d 817, 824-25 (8th Cir.2007) (district court did not clearly err in relying on witness\u2019s testimony regarding previous drug sales in determining drug quantity), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1222, 170 L.Ed.2d 76 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-26\">After carefully reviewing the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Accordingly, we grant the pending motions and affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-20\">. The Honorable Richard G. Kopf, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
