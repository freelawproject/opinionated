Essentially for the reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s two Reports and Recommendations dated June 6, 2007, 2007 WL 1991530, we conclude that the ERISA claims brought in each of the underlying cases were subject to claim preclusion based on the final judgment entered on September 5, 2006, in <em>Femino v. NFA Corporation, </em>Civil Action No. 05-519ML <em>(\u201cFemino </em>I\u201d), an earlier ERISA action filed in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. <em>See Gonzalez v. Banco Cent. Corp., </em>27 F.3d 751, 755 (1st Cir.1994). To the extent appellant challenges related discovery rulings made in Civil Action No. 06-143ML <em>(\u201cFemino II </em>\u201d), we see no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-16\">As to the ADA claims, the district court concluded that appellant was ineligible for protection under the ADA because she was totally disabled at all relevant times and therefore, by definition, was not a \u201cqualified individual with a disability.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a), 12111(8). Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>challenges this interpretation of the statute, and argues that the relevant language is ambiguous and should be construed to include even totally disabled former employees. We have not yet squarely addressed this issue, but we find it unnecessary to do so in this case because we conclude, as the district court did, that appellant\u2019s claims lack merit in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">On the merits, appellant\u2019s primary contention is that the district court misconstrued her claims and failed to consider her claim of \u201cdisparate-impact\u201d discrimination. Appellant states that she does not allege, as the district court suggested, that the self-reported symptoms limitation was discriminatory as written because it treated disabilities based on self-reported symptoms differently from other types of disabilities. Instead, she maintains that her claim was based on the theory that the self-reported symptoms limitation, although not discriminatory on its face, was administered in a manner that disproportionately affected individuals who, like appellant, were disabled due to fibromyalgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">To make out a prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination, a plaintiff must (l)\u201cidentify the challenged employment practice or policy, and pinpoint the defendant\u2019s use of it\u201d (2) \u201cdemonstrate a disparate impact on a group characteristic ... that falls within the protective ambit of [the ADA]\u201d; and (3) \u201cdemonstrate a causal relationship between the identified practice and the disparate impact.\u201d <em>E.E.O.C. v. Steamship Clerks Union, Local 1066, </em>48 F.3d 594, 601 (1st Cir.1995) (citations omitted); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(3). Even assuming that appellant\u2019s allegations are adequate to state a claim of disparate-impact discrimination, the only evidence she offered to demonstrate that the self-reported symptoms limitation had a disproportionately negative effect on individuals suffering from fibromyalgia was that the medical evidence in her own case was deemed insufficient to establish that her disability was not based on self-reported symptoms. This is not enough to demonstrate a disparate impact on the particular group appellant identifies. In essence, appellant\u2019s disparate-impact theory seems to be nothing more than a dressed-up claim that her benefits were arbitrarily terminated; absent any evidence of discrimination, ERISA provides the appropriate avenue for review. However, as noted above, that avenue is no longer open to appellant in light of the judgment entered in <em>Femino I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The judgments of the district court are <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b35-12\">. Appellant also has requested leave to file a supplemental appendix containing documents Hied in a related district court action. The unopposed motion is granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
