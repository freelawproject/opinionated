Jul. 25, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 257 073 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 19, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155,159 (2d Cir.2004). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">As an initial matter, we decline to review Atanasov\u2019s challenge to the pretermission of his asylum application where he failed to make any such challenge before the BIA. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007). Even if his arguments were properly exhausted, we are without jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Atanasov\u2019s asylum claim was untimely where he fails to raise a constitutional claim or a question of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a)(3), 1252(a)(2)(D). Moreover, because Atanasov failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief either before the BIA or this Court, he has abandoned that claim. <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. I.N.S., </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-14\">We further find that the IJ properly found that Atanasov failed to establish his eligibility for withholding of removal. Ata-nasov argues that he was persecuted on account of \u201chis social group, which is an underclass of Bulgarian workers with extremely limited job skills.\u201d However, the BIA has explained that in order to constitute a particular social group, a proposed group must (1) exhibit a shared characteristic that is socially visible to others in the community, and (2) be defined with sufficient particularity. <em>Matter of A-M-E &amp; J-G-U-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 69, 74-76 (BIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>2007). We performed that two-step inquiry in <em>Ucelo-Gomez v. Mukasey </em>and found that \u201cthe petitioners failed to meet their burden of proof\u2019 where \u201cnothing indicated that the individual or individuals who threatened petitioners \u2018had any motive other than increasing their own wealth at the expense of the petitioners.\u201d 509 F.3d 70, 74 (2d Cir.2007) (citing <em>A-M-E-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 76). Here, the IJ noted that Atanasov had testified that he \u201cwas not paid because the employer did not need [him] anymore\u201d and that \u201cthe employer threatened to kill [him] because [he] disrupted the employer[\u2019]s business.\u201d There is no indication that Atanasov\u2019s employer \u201chad any motive other than increasing [his] own wealth at the expense of\u2019 Atana-sov; therefore, the IJ properly denied withholding of removal where Atanasov failed to demonstrate a nexus between the harm he allegedly suffered and continues to fear and one of the five protected grounds. <em>Ucelo-Gomez, </em>509 F.3d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
