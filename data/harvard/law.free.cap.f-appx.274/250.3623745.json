Stevenson seeks to appeal the Benefits Review Board\u2019s order affirming the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision and order on remand denying Stevenson\u2019s application for black lung benefits. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>tion because the petition for review was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In a black lung benefits case, a party seeking review of a decision and order issued by the Board must file a petition for review in the court of appeals within sixty days after the order is issued. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) (2000). The sixty-day period for seeking review is jurisdictional, and a petition for review must be filed with the clerk of this court to stop the running of this period. <em>Adkins v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>889 F.2d 1360, 1363 (4th Cir.1989). \u201c[T]he sixty day filing period begins to run with the filing of a Board opinion with the Clerk of the Board.\u201d <em>Mining Energy, Inc. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>391 F.3d 571, 575-76 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In this case, the Board\u2019s decision was issued and served on the parties on June 15, 2007. Stevenson\u2019s petition for review was not filed until August 17, 2007, three days after the appeal period expired. We therefore dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
