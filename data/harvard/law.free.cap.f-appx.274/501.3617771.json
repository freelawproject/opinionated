The Honorable Bobby R.

Based on our precedent, we reject his argument and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-25\">In connection with his employment at L &amp; M Steel Services, Inc., Flores, an illegal alien, used a fraudulent alien registration number and a fraudulent Social Security number. Both numbers belonged to other individuals. Flores pled guilty to two counts of misuse of immigration documents in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a), and one count of entry without inspection under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a). He pled not guilty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>two counts of aggravated identity theft. At his bench trial, Flores argued that he could not be convicted because the Government did not prove that he knew that the identification he possessed belonged to other people, which he claims is required to convict him under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). After rejecting this argument and finding him guilty of two counts of aggravated identity theft, the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sentenced Flores to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment for the misuse of immigration documents and entry without inspection offenses and a consecutive 24 months\u2019 imprisonment for the aggravated identity theft offenses, resulting in a total sentence of 75 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">On appeal, Flores renews his argument that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) requires the Government to prove that a defendant knew that the means of identification belonged to another person. Section 1028A(a)(l) states that \u201c[wjhoever, during and in relation to any felony violation enumerated in [\u00a7 1028A(c)] knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years.\u201d The Government argues that \u201cknowingly\u201d modifies only \u201ctransfers, possesses, or uses,\u201d whereas Flores argues that \u201cknowingly\u201d modifies not only \u201ctransfers, possesses, or uses,\u201d but also the phrase \u201cof another person,\u201d which would require the Government to prove that a defendant knew the means of identification belonged to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In <em>United States v. Mendoza-Gonzalez, </em>520 F.3d 912, 914-16 (8th Cir.2008), we resolved this issue and determined that under the plain language of the statute, \u201cknowingly\u201d modified only the verbs \u201ctransfers, possesses, or uses,\u201d and not the phrase \u201cof another person.\u201d Therefore, the Government need not prove that Flores knew that the means of identification belonged to another person. Flores does not challenge the sufficiency of the Government\u2019s evidence that the means identification he possessed belonged to another person. Accordingly, we affirm Flores\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\">. The Honorable John A.
