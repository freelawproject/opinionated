Abrams, which denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Ye Hua-Geng, </em>No. A98 384 262 (B.I.A. May 15, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 384 262 (Immig. Ct. New York, N.Y., Aug. 29, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">When the BIA \u201cagrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision,\u201d this Court reviews \u201cboth the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions \u2014 or more precisely ... the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA.\u201d <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding. First, as the IJ noted, Ye initially testified at the hearing that his birthday was November 22. Only when confronted with the birthdate listed on his documents did he change his testimony, stating that he \u201cdidn\u2019t remember clearly\u201d and that \u201ceverything indicated in the documents it\u2019s the truthful one and maybe I\u2019m the one who is wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">Second, Ye\u2019s testimony that he began practicing Falun Gong in 2004 conflicted with the affidavits of his father and his friend. Ye urges us to consider this discrepancy a mere \u201cinconsistency in dates\u201d like that identified by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160 (9th Cir.2000). According to his own testimony, however, Ye\u2019s introduction to Falun Gong was an \u201cevent of major importance\u201d in the life of his family, and a fact-finder might therefore expect him and his family to have a \u201cclear recollection\u201d of when it occurred. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>77 (finding that discrepancy in applicant\u2019s testimony as to date his wife was sterilized could be used as basis for adverse credibility finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Third, Ye gave conflicting accounts of how long his parents were detained following his decision to go into hiding. In his affidavit, he stated that they were detained for a period of months, while at the hearing he testified that their detention lasted only days. Furthermore, any mention of this alleged detention is entirely missing from his father\u2019s affidavit. As the alleged detention of Ye\u2019s parents bears on the likelihood that the Chinese authorities continue to be interested in pursuing him, the conflicting testimony surrounding this incident casts doubt on his well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Because these findings together support the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, <em>see Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-07 (2d Cir.2006), we need not reach the IJ\u2019s remaining findings. Moreover, because the only evidence of a threat to Ye\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case precludes success on Ye\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and relief under CAT. <em>See Paul v. </em>Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Ye\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
