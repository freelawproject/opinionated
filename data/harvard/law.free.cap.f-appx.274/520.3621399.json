We dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">We lack jurisdiction to consider whether the IJ violated Leung\u2019s due process rights during reopened proceedings because the asserted deficiency is one that the BIA could have corrected on appeal but which Leung failed to raise. The issue is not, therefore, exhausted. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">The text of IIRIRA \u00a7 321(b) plainly indicates that Congress intended for aliens to be deportable under IIRIRA\u2019s aggravated felony definition regardless of the date of conviction (\u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision of law (including any effective date) ... \u201d). Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43); <em>Aragon-Ayon v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 847, 853 (9th Cir.2000). Thus, Leung is not saved by temporal limitations applicable to the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d or to the grounds for deportation, which have been in place since 1988. <em>Compare </em>Anti-Drug Abuse Act (ADAA) \u00a7 7344(a)(2) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (1988) (\u201c[a]ny alien ... shall ... be deported who ... is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after entry\u201d)) <em>and </em>INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (\u201c[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission\u201d is removable)).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-18\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b547-19\">Leung is ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief as IMMACT\u2019s bar, Immigration Act of 1990, \u00a7 511(a) (IMMACT) (codified at 8 U.S.C. 1182(c)), applies retroactively to aliens who were convicted following a trial of an aggravated felony. <em>Samaniego-Meraz v. INS, </em>53 F.3d 254, 256 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>1995), <em>overruled in part by Toia v. Fasa-no, </em>334 F.3d 917, 921 (9th Cir.2003) (overruling <em>Samaniego-Meraz </em>to the extent it pertains to aliens who pleaded guilty prior to the enactment of IMMACT).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b547-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
