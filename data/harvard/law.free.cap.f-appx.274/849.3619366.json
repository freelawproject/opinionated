We find no error in the BIA\u2019s order, and we, therefore, deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-34\">Petitioners are Colombian citizens who traveled separately to the United States on non-immigrant visitor visas, arriving on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>three different dates in 1999 and 2000. All three submitted applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) in March 2004. The Immigration Judge denied Petitioners\u2019 application for asylum as time-barred, denied the claims for withholding of removal and relief under CAT for failure to carry their burden of proof, and issued a removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Rodriguez hired an attorney to represent him and his family in their appeal to the BIA. The attorney timely filed a notice of appeal, but neglected to file a brief in support of the appeal. The BIA dismissed the appeal on October 19, 2006. Petitioners did not seek appellate review of that dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Petitioners filed a motion to reopen on April 16, 2007 stating that they were unaware that them attorney had failed to file a brief or that the BIA had denied their appeal and arguing that their due process rights were violated because they received ineffective assistance of counsel. The BIA denied the motion, and Petitioners timely filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). We, therefore, are limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">A motion to reopen is appropriate where the motion \u201cstate[s] the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and [is] supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B). The statute dictates that a motion to reopen immigration proceedings \u201cshall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">This court has stated that this 90-day filing deadline is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1150. <em>Abdi </em>followed the reasoning given in <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.1999), wherein this court found that the 180-day deadline for filing a motion contesting deportation orders issued <em>in absentia </em>was mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Abdi, </em>however, did not dismiss the petition \u2014 based on similar grounds to those brought here \u2014 for lack of jurisdiction, but instead went on to deny the petition applying an abuse of discretion standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">Assuming we hold jurisdiction over this petition, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by dismissing this motion to reopen. Here, Petitioners did not just barely miss the 90-day deadline, but rather missed the deadline by almost 90 days. We find no abuse of discretion where the BIA denied this clearly untimely motion to reopen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">Petitioners also argue that equitable tolling should extend the deadline for filing because it was the ineffective assistance of counsel that prevented Petitioners from timely filing their motion. Under similar circumstances in <em>Abdi, </em>this court refused to apply equitable tolling where the petitioner \u201cfailed to exercise due diligence in preserving his legal rights.\u201d 430 F.3d at 1148. Although in both <em>Abdi </em>and here the failure to preserve rights was allegedly the fault of counsel, this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>made clear in <em>Abdi </em>that equitable tolling will not be applied to these facts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">For the foregoing reasons, this petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-8\">. Because we find that the motion to reopen was properly dismissed as time-barred, we do not need to review the alternative grounds for dismissal and address the merits of the Petitioners\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
