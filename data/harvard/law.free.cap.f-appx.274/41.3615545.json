Torres was sentenced to 144 months\u2019 imprisonment, a four-year term of supervised release and a $100 special assessment. Torres\u2019s prison sentence constituted a downward departure from the applicable Sentencing Guideline Range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts of this case, its procedural posture, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-22\">Torres argues that the district court did not adequately consider the sentencing factors embodied in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when imposing sentence because it: (1) focused exclusively on the reasonableness of the applicable Sentencing Guideline; (2) did not consider Torres\u2019s drug addiction as a mitigating factor; and (3) did not explain how Torres\u2019s sentence was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to achieve the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-23\">We review sentences for reasonableness, <em>see United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), both as to \u201cthe sentence itself\u2019 and \u201cthe procedures employed in arriving at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>448 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 192, 166 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006). In the absence of record evidence indicating otherwise, we presume that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In contrast to Torres\u2019s first assertion, the record indicates that the district court properly considered the sentencing criteria contained in \u00a7 3553(a). During sentencing, the district court referenced the nature of Torres\u2019s offense, his criminal history and personal characteristics, the seriousness of his offense, and the need for his sentence to promote respect for the law. With regard to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors of deterrence and public safety, the district court explicitly stated that \u201c[a] longer sen-tenee[ ] is reasonable and necessary to deter you from committing these crimes and frankly to protect the public from further crimes committed by you.\u201d Nothing in the record suggests we should deviate from our customary presumption that the district court understood and observed its obligations under \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Although Torres argues that his drug addiction and lack of treatment should constitute mitigating factors for purposes of sentencing, the \u201crequirement that a sentencing judge consider an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factor is <em>not </em>synonymous with a requirement that the factor be given determinative or dispositive weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32. Moreover, \u00a7 3553(a)(5) instructs sentencing courts to consider any pertinent policy statements issued by the sentencing commission, including U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.4, which counsels that drug addiction should not ordinarily be considered in sentencing. It was therefore eminently reasonable for the district court, in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, to abstain from further reducing Torres\u2019s below-Guidelines sentence due to his drug addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Finally, after considering the fact that Torres\u2019s two prior sentences of three-to-six years failed to deter him, the district court concluded that a longer period of incarceration was necessary to achieve the statutory goals of sentencing. This, considered alongside the fact that Torres received a below-Guidelines sentence, causes us to reject Torres\u2019s argument that his sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the statutory objectives of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
