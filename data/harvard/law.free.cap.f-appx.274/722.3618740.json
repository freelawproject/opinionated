R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Appellant Guillermo Sanchez-Ruiz pled guilty, without entering into a plea agreement, to a one-count information charging him with illegal reentry of a deported alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b). Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s 1996 deportation followed his 1992 felony conviction for transporting and selling a controlled substance. He now appeals his thirty-seven-month sentence, arguing his sentence is unconstitutional because the district court treated his prior conviction as a sentencing factor rather than an element of his offense. He also contends the district court erred in applying a sixteen-level increase to his offense level for his prior conviction because the government failed to give the \u201cstatutorily required notice\u201d of facts concerning his prior felony conviction. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-14\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b749-15\">On February 10, 2007, Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz, along with nine other individuals, was stopped in the United States by federal border patrol agents and, when questioned, admitted he was a citizen of Mexico in the United States illegally. A subsequent immigration check established Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz had a prior 1992 conviction for transporting and selling a controlled substance for which he received a three-year sentence and, thereafter, in 1996, was deported.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The information charged Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz with being an alien who unlawfully reentered the United States after being deported without obtaining consent for admission in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b). The information did not mention Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s prior 1992 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-16\">At the plea hearing Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz pled guilty, without entering into a plea agreement, to the one-count information charging him with illegal reentry of a deported alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>\u00a7 1326(a) and (b). In pleading guilty, he admitted he was an alien who returned to the United States illegally after having been deported. A few days after pleading guilty, Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz provided a verbal statement of acceptance of responsibility, stating he crossed the border into the United States knowing he was entering illegally after being previously deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Following these events, the probation officer prepared a presentence report calculating Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s sentence under the applicable United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d or \u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d). The probation officer set Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s base offense level at eight pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a) and increased his base level sixteen levels pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) because he had previously been deported following his 1992 felony drug conviction. The probation officer also calculated a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of twenty-one. The presentence report also set Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s criminal history category at III, which, together with an offense level of twenty-one, resulted in a recommended Guidelines sentencing range of forty-six to fifty-seven months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz filed a formal motion requesting a variance from the Guidelines range under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). At the sentencing hearing Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz renewed his request for a variance, and his counsel also explained Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz had withdrawn his previous objections to the presentence report regarding the sixteen-level offense increase and his 1992 conviction. In withdrawing these objections, Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s counsel explained an issue had existed as to Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s memory of that incident and that the probation officer submitted a very thorough report with fingerprint comparisons. The record contains no other documentation or discussion of these prior objections. After counsel explained Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s objections had been withdrawn, the district court asked if any other objections existed, to which counsel stated, \u201c[n]ot to the presentence report, Your Honor.\u201d R., Vol. 3 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The district court then adopted the facts contained in presentence report, explaining that absent any objections, no evidentiary hearing would be necessary. After considering Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s request for a variance, together with the factual findings in the presentence report and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the district court determined a downward variance was warranted based on the age of Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s prior conviction, his lack of subsequent criminal history, and his stable employment history. As a result, the district court reduced his offense level to nineteen, which, together with a criminal history category of III, resulted in a Guidelines range of thirty-seven to forty-six months imprisonment. It then sentenced Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz to the low end of the Guidelines range at thirty-seven-months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">In his first argument, Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz contends his thirty-seven-month sentence is unconstitutional because the district court treated his prior conviction as a sentencing factor rather than an element of his offense. In making this argument, Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz concedes the Supreme Court, in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), held enhanced penalties for a prior conviction, such as his sixteen-level offense increase, are not elements of separate offenses, and need not be alleged in an indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. He also ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>knowledges his \u201cargument is presently foreclosed in this circuit\u201d by our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>401 F.3d 1220 (10th Cir.2005). Apt. Br. at 6. However, Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz suggests that because some Supreme Court decisions have cast doubt on the continuing validity of <em>Almen-darez-Torres, </em>he is raising the issue for the purpose of preserving it for future appeal. He also acknowledges he did not raise this issue before the district court and therefore concedes the standard of review is plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">As Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz concedes, we review an alleged error affecting substantial rights raised for the first time on appeal for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Mozee, </em>405 F.3d 1082, 1090 (10th Cir.2005). \u201cPlain error occurs when there is (i) error, (ii) that is plain, which (iii) affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and which (iv) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz-Terrazas, </em>477 F.3d 1196, 1199 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 113, 169 L.Ed.2d 80 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">In applying this standard, we cannot say any error occurred. Cleai\u2019ly, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) recommends application of a sixteen-level sentencing enhancement if the defendant was deported after committing a drug trafficking offense, which in this case occurred after a 1992 drug offense conviction. As Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz acknowledges, in <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>the Supreme Court held the existence of a prior conviction is a sentencing factor and not a separate element of the offense which must be pled in an indictment charging a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. <em>See </em>523 U.S. at 228-35, 118 S.Ct. 1219. As a result, the Supreme Court and this court have determined the government is not required to allege in the indictment the fact or existence of a prior aggravated felony conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219; <em>United States v. MartinezVillalva, </em>232 F.3d 1329, 1332 (10th Cir.2000). We have also determined the holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>continues to stand following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See Moore, </em>401 F.3d at 1223-24. Until the Supreme Court overrules <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>this court is bound by such precedent. <em>See Moore, </em>401 F.3d at 1224. Thus, in the instant case, we hold prior precedent fully forecloses Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">As to Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s second issue on appeal, it appears to be an alternative argument to avoid the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>He contends the government failed to give \u201cstatutorily required notice\u201d of his prior felony conviction, as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, making the district court\u2019s application of the sixteen-level increase for his prior conviction reversible error. Again, in making this argument, Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz concedes he failed to raise this issue before the district court, leaving us to review it for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">We begin by examining the statute on which Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz relies, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-12\">No person who stands convicted of an offense <em>under this part </em>shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason of one or more prior convictions, unless ... before entry of a plea of guilty, the United States attorney files an information with the court ... stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1) (emphasis added). The operative portion of this statute, for the purposes of this case, is the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>\u201cunder this part,\u201d which limits application of \u00a7 851 to offenses in violation of Title 21, pertaining specifically to certain drug offenses. Here, Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz was convicted for violating Title 8, or more specifically, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, pertaining to previously deported aliens entering this country illegally. Thus, unlike drug cases relating to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1), the statute under which Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz was convicted did not require the government to provide notice of his prior conviction in the information. <em>See United States v. Perez-Olalde, </em>328 F.3d 222, 224 (6th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Garcia-Olmedo, </em>112 F.3d 399, 401 (9th Cir.1997), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Ballesteros-Ruiz, </em>319 F.3d 1101, 1104-06 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1) does not support Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s argument or his attempt to skirt the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>which does not require the government to allege in the information charging a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 either the fact or existence of Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s prior felony conviction. <em>See </em>523 U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Finally, other than the issues raised on appeal, Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz does not suggest his sentence was incorrectly calculated in conjunction with application of the advisory Guidelines or that it is otherwise unreasonable under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. Even if we considered such an argument under our deferential abuse of discretion standard, <em>see United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 802, 805-06 (10th Cir.2008), nothing in the record persuades us Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. The record does not reveal any errors in calculating the sentence and the district court in this case explicitly considered the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and determined the requested variance was warranted. A presumption of reasonableness attaches to a sentence, like here, which is within the correctly-calculated Guidelines range, which Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz has not in any way rebutted. <em>United States v. Kristi, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1055 (10th Cir.2006) <em>(per </em>curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM Mr. Sanchez-Ruiz\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b749-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-12\">. We reference the conviction as occurring in 1992, even though the record and pleadings on appeal have conflicting references as to whether this conviction occurred in 1992 or sometime in January 1993. For the purposes of the disposition of this appeal, we find it immaterial in which year his conviction occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
