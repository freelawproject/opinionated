He was sentenced to sixty-three months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by a four-year term of supervised release. In 1997, the Immigration and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) initiated deportation proceedings against Morgorichev, charging him as an alien who had been convicted of an aggravated felony and of a violation of law relating to a controlled substance. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) &amp; (a)(2)(B)(i). The Immigration Judge (\u201cU\u201d) found Morgorichev deportable and ineligible for relief under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The BIA affirmed on June 9, 1998. <em>In re Morgorichev, </em>No. A23 371 786 (B.I.A. June 9, 1998), <em>aff'g, </em>No. A23 371 786 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 30,1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">In 1998, Morgorichev filed a habeas petition in the Eastern District of New York, arguing that the BIA and the IJ erred in retroactively applying the limitations on section 212(c) relief enacted by Congress in 1996.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court granted the habeas petition on June 20, 2000, and the government appealed. The appeal has been held in abeyance pending the decisions of this Court in <em>Calcano-Martinez v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 328 (2d Cir.2000), <em>aff'd, </em>533 U.S. 348, 121 S.Ct. 2268, 150 L.Ed.2d 392 (2001), <em>St. Cyr v. INS, </em>229 F.3d 406 (2d Cir.2000), <em>aff'd, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), as well as in <em>Rankine v. Reno, </em>319 F.3d 93 (2d Cir.2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">During the pendency of this appeal, Congress passed the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231, 302 (May 11, 2005), \u201csignificantly af-feet[ing] the procedure for disposing of a habeas petition that ... challenged a final order of removal.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Gonzales, </em>471 F.3d 111, 116 (2d Cir.2006). We have held that in these cases the appeal is converted to a petition for review brought under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <em>Id. </em>In so doing, we review the underlying deportation order, \u201cvacating as a nullity the district court\u2019s decision below.\u201d <em>Moreno-Bravo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 253, 257 (2d Cir.2006). And, as a petitioner\u2019s eligibility for a section 212(c) waiver \u201cis a question of law, unlike the discretionary and unreviewable decision of whether such a waiver ultimately should be granted,\u201d our review of the issue is <em>de novo. Blake v. Carbone, </em>489 F.3d 88, 98 n. 7 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">The government contends that this case is squarely covered by our decision in <em>Rankine, </em>319 F.3d at 99-100, in which we determined that the congressional elimination of section 212(c) relief is not imper-missibly retroactive as applied to those aliens who, after trial, were convicted of aggravated felonies before 1996. We reached this conclusion in the case of Rankine and his co-petitioners on the ground that, unlike aliens who had <em>pled </em>guilty to aggravated felonies, these aliens had not relied on the availability of such relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Morgorichev challenges our rationale in <em>Rankine </em>as in conflict with the Supreme Court\u2019s retroactivity analysis in <em>Landgraf v. USI Film Products, </em>511 U.S. 244, 114 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>S.Ct. 1488, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994), and in violation of principles of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">These arguments are unavailing. The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rankine </em>addresses both issues. <em>See Rankine, </em>319 F.3d at 98, 103. And we are bound by <em>Rankine </em>\u201cunless and until its rationale is overruled, implicitly or expressly, by the Supreme Court or this court <em>en banc. </em>\u201d <em>In re Sokolowski, </em>205 F.3d 532, 534-35 (2d Cir.2000) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Morgorichev further contends that the regulation implementing the various forms of section 212(c) relief, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(g), violates equal protection by determining eligibility for section 212(c) relief for criminals, otherwise similarly situated, based on the timing of the commencement of them deportation proceedings. The regulation, however, is a permissible implementation of Congress\u2019s intention in passing the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), which, as we have held, was precisely to effectuate this line-drawing. See <em>Henderson v. INS, </em>157 F.3d 106, 130 (2d Cir.1998). Although Morgorichev argues that the government might have manipulated the timing of proceedings in order to prevent aliens from receiving 212(c) relief, we note that the record does not demonstrate any unreasonable delay in the commencement of Morgorichev\u2019s deportation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">We have considered all of Petitioner-Appellee\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the district court\u2019s grant of ha-beas, and DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\">. In 1996, section 440(d) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1227 (Apr. 24, 1996), limited the availability of 212(c) relief for aliens convicted of aggravated felonies. Later that year, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996). Section 304(b) of IIRIRA repealed INA section 212(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b126-10\">. Morgorichev does not contend that he delayed seeking 212(c) relief relying on the continued availability of such relief, an argument that remains open to such litigants <em>post-Rankine. See Restrepo v. McElroy, </em>369 F.3d 627, 634-35 (2d Cir.2004); <em>see also Walcott v. Chertoff, </em>517 F.3d 149, 154-55 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
