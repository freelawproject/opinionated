R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-23\">The district court\u2019s orders were entered on the docket in January 2007 and May 2007, respectively. Kinard\u2019s notice of appeal was filed, at the earliest, on July 27, 2007.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because Kinard failed to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period as to either of the district court\u2019s orders, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-16\">. Kinard's notice of appeal states he is appealing the district court\u2019s May 29, 2007 order and \"any and all other decisions of the court in reference to the denial of his habeas corpus motion as well.\u201d We construe Kinard\u2019s notice of appeal as an attempt to appeal both the district court's May 29, 2007 order denying Kinard's motion for reconsideration and the district court\u2019s January 26, 2007 order dismissing without prejudice Kinard\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as second or successive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-24\">. Kinard did not move for an extension of time to file his appeal under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b355-25\">. Because Kinard is a prisoner and filed his notice of appeal pro se, it is deemed filed on the date he gave it to prison officials for mailing. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). July 27, 2007, is the date Kinard provided next to his signature on the notice of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
