LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b732-24\">Marshall A. Tillman, a Kansas state prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>\u00a7 2254 habeas petition. Tillman seeks a COA on the issue of whether the nine-year delay between the initial charges and Tillman\u2019s jury trial violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. We deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In 1995, Tillman was indicted for capital murder and rape. Progress toward trial was slow. The state Capital Defense Coordinator filed several motions, and the trial court repeatedly ordered evaluations of Tillman\u2019s mental competency to stand trial. Although Tillman was initially found competent, in 1997 the court concluded that he was no longer competent to stand trial and sent him to a state hospital for treatment. In September 1999, Kansas dismissed his case without prejudice and filed a new complaint charging Tillman with felony murder and rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Tillman\u2019s jury trial began on February 23, 2004. The jury convicted him of rape but acquitted him of murder. Tillman was sentenced to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment, and he received time-served credit for 2,712 days. The Kansas Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction, concluding, among other things, that his right to a speedy trial was not violated. The Kansas Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">On April 11, 2007, Tillman filed a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition challenging his conviction. He raised four grounds for relief: (1) ineffective assistance of trial counsel, (2) conflict with his attorney over continuances, (3) denial of a speedy trial, and (4) violation of the statutory limitations period. The district court rejected his speedy trial argument on the merits. As to his remaining three claims, the court concluded that they were procedurally defaulted and that no circumstances existed sufficient to excuse that default. The court also denied his subsequent application for a COA, and Tillman now seeks a COA from this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even construing his application liberally, <em>see Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991), Tillman only seeks a COA with regard to the denial of his right to a speedy trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">Tillman was entitled to habeas relief in the district court only if the state court decision he challenges was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2). A federal court \u201cmay not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly. Rather, that application must also be unreasonable.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">The district court properly analyzed Tillman\u2019s petition under <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), which sets forth four factors that inform whether pretrial delays violate a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial: (1) the length of the delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) whether the defendant asserted his right, and (4) any prejudice to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182. Applying <em>Barker </em>to Tillman\u2019s case, the Kansas Court of Appeals made a number of relevant findings. It first assumed that the nine-year delay was presumptively prejudicial. Addressing the reason for the delay, however, it concluded that Tillman consented to his counsel\u2019s numerous requests for continuances, and noted that Kansas law mandated an extensive preparation period for capital cases. In addition, the court recognized that several mental health referrals, made at defense counsel\u2019s request, further delayed the proceedings, and found that those delays were compounded by Tillman\u2019s own refusals to eat and take psychiatric medication. It thus concluded that, on balance, the second factor weighed against Tillman.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Turning to the remaining two factors, the court determined that although Tillman wrote the trial judge in 2000 and invoked his right to a speedy trial, he soon acquiesced to further continuances by counsel. Finally, the only prejudice Tillman cited was the fact that he spent nine years in prison awaiting trial, but this prejudice was offset by the time-served credit Tillman later received and the fact that, for part of the period, he was simultaneously being held on an unrelated rape charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The district court concluded that the state court\u2019s analysis was not an unreasonable determination of the facts or an unreasonable application of <em>Barker. </em>We recognize that the record does not explain with precision the exact reasons for each individual delay that compounded to create a nine-year period between the initial charges and Tillman\u2019s eventual jury trial. We do not believe, however, that reasonable jurists could debate the district court\u2019s resolution of the matter under the highly deferential standard of \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Tillman\u2019s request for a COA is therefore DENIED and his appeal 'is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\">. Because the district court denied Tillman a COA, he may not appeal the district court's decision absent a grant of a COA by this court. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). A COA may be issued \"only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\" \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This requires Tillman to show \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b733-14\">. Tillman\u2019s COA application also asserts that a Kansas prison facility \"refused to give [him] any jail credits\u201d and that a state hospital filed a forensic report that falsely attributed an alias to him. These claims were not raised to the district court in his habeas petition and are therefore waived. <em>See Rhine v. Boone, </em>182 F.3d 1153, 1154 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
