Mar. 22, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 96 241 752 (Immig. Ct.N.Y. City Aug. 2, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or, more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) <em>(en banc). </em>However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">We conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding here is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ determined that the two intra-uterine contraceptive device (\u201cIUD\u201d) booklets that Dai submitted in support of her claim were not genuine and were thus fatal to her credibility. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 170-71 (2d Cir.2007) (under the maxim of <em>fal-sus in uno, falsus in omnibus </em>(false in one thing, false in everything) \u201ca single false document or a single instance of false testimony may (if attributable to the petitioner) infect the balance of the alien\u2019s uncorroborated or unauthenticated evidence\u201d); <em>Borovikova v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>435 F.3d 151, 157-58 (2d Cir.2006) (approving agency\u2019s reliance on firmly-grounded expert finding of document fraud to reach conclusion that applicant was dissembling in her oral testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">In reaching this conclusion, the IJ reasonably relied on an expert witness\u2019s report and detailed testimony that (1) someone had deliberately manipulated the entries of the first booklet by erasing and overwriting two of the dates; (2) despite the second booklet containing dates that spanned two and one-half years, the nature of the entries indicated that they had been placed in the booklet at the same time; and (3) the ink used to overwrite the entries in the first booklet appeared (to a 90% certainty) to be the same as the ink used in the second booklet. This expert testimony provides substantial evidence for the IJ\u2019s finding that the documents were inauthentic and unreliable. The IJ\u2019s determination was, in fact, the functional equivalent of a \u201cvalid finding of fraud,\u201d and, because grounded in acceptable expert opinion, presents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>none of the concerns about \u201cunjustified assumptions and unsupported speculation\u201d noted in <em>Souleymane Niang v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 138, 146 (2d Cir.2007) (citing <em>Siewe </em>in observing that although an expert finding of fraud is not always necessary to support an IJ finding of document inauthenticity, such a finding cannot be based on pure speculation).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Dai argues that the IJ\u2019s authenticity concerns about the IUD booklets and the dates were, in any event, not material to the prime issue of her claim, <em>i.e., </em>whether she had had a forced abortion. We are not convinced. The IUD booklet was offered into evidence to establish that Dai was indeed pregnant in May 2000. Because that pregnancy is the very one she claims she was forced to terminate, the agency could reasonably conclude that fraudulent entries in the IUD booklets were material to undermining her claim of persecution through forced abortion. Dai\u2019s claim that the agency failed to consider her testimony that she did not know that the booklets had been altered, <em>see Siewe, </em>480 F.3d at 171 <em>(falsus in uno </em>does not apply where alien does not know or have reason to know of lack of authenticity), was not exhausted before the BIA, and we therefore lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Taken as a whole, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence. Because the only evidence of a threat to Dai\u2019s life or freedom or a likelihood of torture depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on her claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
