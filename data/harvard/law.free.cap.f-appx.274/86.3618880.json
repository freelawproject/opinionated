Moreno was convicted after a guilty plea to illegally reentering the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-23\">The 46-month sentence represents the bottom of the applicable advisory Guidelines range of 46 to 57 months. Moreno challenges his sentence as procedurally unreasonable, chiefly on the ground that the district court gave \u201cpresumptive weight\u201d to the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-24\">Sentencing entails a two-step procedure. First, the sentencing court must determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the applicable Guidelines range, which \u201c[a]s a matter of administration and to secure nationwide consistency, ... should be the starting point and the initial benchmark.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Second, the sentencing court must consider that range, along with the other factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and \u201cmake an individualized assessment [of the defendant] based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The record here reflects that the sentencing court followed this procedure, giving consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in order to fashion \u201ca sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to serve the purposes of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). That the court might have used the applicable Guidelines range as \u201ca benchmark or a point of reference or departure\u201d does not constitute procedural error. <em>United States v. Rubenstein, </em>403 F.3d 93, 98-99 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Moreno also argues that the district court erred in declining to weigh the \u201cunwarranted sentence disparities\u201d created by the government\u2019s fast-track programs in other districts. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). We rejected the same argument in <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 158 (2d Cir.2006), and decline to revisit that decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
