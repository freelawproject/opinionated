Ritter appeals, arguing first that his sentence is unreasonable and, second, that the district court lacked authority to order him to reside at a residential re-entry center after his release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-23\">We conclude that the sentence, which was within the statutory maximum and resulted from the district court\u2019s consideration of appropriate factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Nelson, </em>453 F.3d 1004, 1006 (8th Cir.2006) (appellate court reviews revocation sentence to determine whether it is unreasonable in relation to, inter alia, \u00a7 3553(a) factors and advisory Guidelines range). Ritter\u2019s second argument is meritless. <em>See United States v. Griner, </em>358 F.3d 979, 981-82 (8th Cir.2004) (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d) \u201ccontinues to include community corrections confinement as a discretionary condition of supervised release\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-24\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-19\">.
