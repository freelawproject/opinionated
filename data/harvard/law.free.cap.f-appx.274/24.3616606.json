Schoppert, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Martin Tinaj, </em>No. A79 417 346 (B.I.A. June 18, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A79 417 346 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 1, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. We treat these findings as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">As a preliminary matter, because Tinaj failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of his asylum application in the exercise of discretion, we deem any such argument waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Wu Zheng Huang v. INS, </em>436 F.3d 89, 96-97 (2d Cir.2006) (discussing our authority pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) to review the agency\u2019s discretionary denial of asylum).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Regarding the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Tinaj could not carry his burden of proof in light of substantial changes in political circumstances in Albania \u2014 most notably the Democratic Party\u2019s return to power through general elections in July 2005. <em>See Hoxhallari v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 179, 188 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Qyteza v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 224, 228 n. 2 (2d Cir.2006). While Tinaj\u2019s brief to this Court refers to Albania\u2019s poor human rights record in some areas, there was no record evidence that Democratic Party supporters necessarily faced a threat to their life or freedom. In fact, the 2003 U.S. State Department report (found in the record) noted that there were no political killings, no reports of politically motivated disappearances, and no reports of detainees held strictly for political reasons. As such, the agency properly found that Tinaj failed to demonstrate that a future threat to his life or freedom was objectively likely. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148,155-56 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">Finally, we dismiss Tinaj\u2019s petition for review as to his CAT claim because he did not exhaust before the BIA his challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of that claim. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
