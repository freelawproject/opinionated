Pone contends that the sentence is plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>We will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is within the prescribed statutory range and is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437-39 (4th Cir.2006), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007). In making this determination, we first consider whether the sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 438-39. Only if a sentence is found to be unreasonable will this court determine if it is \u201cplainly\u201d so. <em>Id. </em>at 439. Although the district court must consider the Chapter Seven policy statements, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>Ch. 7, Pt. B, as well as the statutory requirements and factors applicable to parole revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a) &amp; 3583 (2000), the district court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke the previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 438-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Although the district court provided no explanation for its sentence, it is undisputed that the district court properly calculated the applicable range and imposed a sentence within that range. We find nothing clearly or obviously erroneous in the sentence imposed by the district court. <em>See United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 657 (4th Cir.2007) (defining a \u201cplainly unreasonable sentence\u201d as one that is \u201cclearly\u201d or \u201cobviously\u201d erroneous).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
