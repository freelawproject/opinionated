Sept. 14, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Chen\u2019s petition for review is only timely as to the BIA\u2019s September 2007 order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Therefore, we must limit our review to that decision. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 89-90 (2d Cir.2001). To the extent Chen challenges the agency\u2019s denial of relief in the underlying merits proceeding, we dismiss the petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Surprisingly, and fatal to the petition for review, Chen does not advance any argument challenging the BIA\u2019s September 2007 order \u2014 the only order we are \u201cempowered to review.\u201d <em>See Nwogu v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 80, 84 (2d Cir.2007)(per curiam). A petitioner\u2019s attorney must \u201cinclude his most cogent arguments in his opening brief, upon pain of otherwise finding them waived.\u201d <em>McCarthy v. SEC, </em>406 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir.2005). Here, Chen failed to directly address the agency\u2019s determination that her motion was untimely and failed to qualify for an exception to the time limits applicable to motions to reopen or that her motion should have been construed as a successive petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Where the petitioner has been represented by counsel throughout these proceedings, \u201cit is not our obligation to ferret out [his] arguments. That, after all, is the purpose of briefing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, because we do not find that manifest injustice would result if we decline to reach the BIA\u2019s September 2007 order, we deem waived any challenge thereto. <em>See Yueq-ing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\">. These serious deficiencies compel us to express our concern about the quality of representation provided by Chen\u2019s attorney, John Wang. Counsel is warned that continuing conduct of this nature could result in the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against him. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 46(b)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
