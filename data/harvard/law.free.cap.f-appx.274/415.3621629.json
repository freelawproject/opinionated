In this petition for review, Peralta-Garcia argues: (1) the immigration judge (IJ) deprived him of a fair hearing and due process by refusing to allow a witness to testify in support of Peralta-Garcia\u2019s application for cancellation of removal; (2) the IJ abused its discretion by denying Peral-ta-Garcia\u2019s application for cancellation of removal by neglecting to consider significant favorable factors; and (3) the BIA erred in finding that Peralta-Garcia was removable based upon his conviction for unlawful carrying of a weapon. The respondent has filed a motion to dismiss Peralta-Garcia\u2019s petition for lack of juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>diction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). The motion to dismiss is granted to the extent that Peralta-Garcia seeks review of the BIA\u2019s finding that favorable discretion for cancellation of removal would not be exercised. <em>See Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). However, the motion to dismiss is denied as to his remaining two arguments, which raise a constitutional claim and a question of law. <em>See Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Peralta-Garcia\u2019s argument regarding the IJ\u2019s refusal to allow a witness to testify fails to raise a valid constitutional claim. Because Peralta-Garcia does not have a due process right to cancellation of removal, he does not have a due process right in pursuit of that relief. <em>Cf. Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, </em>461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, the BIA properly found that Peralta-Garcia was removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C) based upon his conviction for unlawful carrying of a weapon because the information specifically identified the weapon as a firearm, and the information was could be considered pursuant to the approach set forth in <em>Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. 183, 127 S.Ct. 815, 818-19, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Peralta-Garcia\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
