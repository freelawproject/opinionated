We find that we lack jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>tion to review Wilson\u2019s claim that the Board should have exercised its sua sponte power to reopen his removal proceedings. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006) (collecting cases). We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
