Astrue is substituted for his predecessor Jo Anne Barnhart as Commissioner of the Social Security Administration. Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b578-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Antonio Sanfilippo appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security that Sanfilippo is not entitled to Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits. The parties are familiar with the facts, which we repeat here only to the extent necessary. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits de novo, <em>see Gillett-Netting v. Barnhart, </em>371 F.3d 593, 595 (9th Cir.2004), and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">This court will affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Batson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1193 (9th Cir.2004). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>See Howard ex rel. Wolff v. Barnhart, </em>341 F.3d 1006, 1011 (9th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Generally, the administrative law judge will afford more weight to the opinions of treating medical professionals. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). However, a treating physician\u2019s opinion is not binding. <em>Batson, </em>359 F.3d at 1195. Where an administrative law judge rejects the opinion of the treating physician in favor of a conflicting opinion, she must provide \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record for so doing.\u201d <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 722 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">Here, the administrative law judge rejected the opinion of Sanfilippo\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Marc Rose. Sanfilippo argues that the administrative law judge failed to identify \u201cspecific and legitimate\u201d reasons or substantial evidence for rejecting the treating physician\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">An AL J must \u201cgive more weight to opinions from [a claimant\u2019s] treating sources, since these sources are likely to be the medical professionals most able to provide a detailed, longitudinal picture of [the claimant\u2019s] medical impairment(s) and may bring a unique perspective ... that cannot be obtained from ... individual examinations.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). \u201cWhen confronted with conflicting medical opinions, an ALJ need not accept a treating physician\u2019s opinion that is conclusory and brief and unsupported by clinical findings.\u201d <em>Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1149 (9th Cir.2001)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">De novo review of the record reveals that here, contrary to the ALJ\u2019s decision, Dr. Rose\u2019s opinion is not brief, conclusory, or unsupported. The record includes Dr. Rose\u2019s clinical findings, as well as extensive descriptions of Sanfilippo\u2019s pain management consultation and a thorough residual function questionnaire. The ALJ\u2019s decision fails to demonstrate that he accorded Dr. Rose\u2019s opinion the weight required by the regulatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>scheme. Because the ALJ\u2019s justification for rejecting Dr. Rose\u2019s opinion is not a specific and legitimate reason, we need not address whether substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Sanfilippo also argues that the ALJ applied the wrong legal standard to the opinion of a treating chiropractor. The ALJ stated that a chiropractor is not an \u201cacceptable medical source,\u201d and that therefore a chiropractor's opinion is not entitled to controlling weight. The ALJ is correct that a chiropractor is not an \u201cacceptable medical source.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(a). However, an ALJ \u201cmay\u201d consider the opinion of an \u201cother\u201d medical source, such as a chiropractor, to determine the severity of an impairment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(d)(1). 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d) states that \u201cregardless of source,\u201d the Social Security Administration \u201cwill evaluate every medical opinion [it] receive[s].\u201d The ALJ applied the wrong standard with regard to the opinion of the treating chiropractor. Accordingly, we remand for the administration to apply the proper standard to the treating chiropractor\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Accordingly, we REVERSE with instructions to the district court to REMAND this case to the Commissioner of Social Security for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b578-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b579-8\">FERNANDEZ, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A-bc\">concurring and dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">I agree that the ALJ erred in his assessment of Dr. Rose\u2019s opinion. However, I disagree as to Dr. Reese, whose opinion is not entitled to the same deference and analysis as that accorded to the opinion of a medical doctor. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(d)(1); <em>Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>912 F.2d 1149, 1152 (9th Cir.1990), <em>rev\u2019d en banc on other grounds, </em>947 F.2d 341 (9th Cir.1991). Thus, I concur in part and, respectfully, dissent in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
