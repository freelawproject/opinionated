(\u201cUPS\u201d) appeals from an order of the district court granting summary judgment to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local No. 174 on UPS\u2019s complaint seeking to vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award. We affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">Our review of an arbitrator\u2019s award is extremely deferential. We determine <em>\u201cwhether </em>the arbitrator interpreted the collective bargaining agreement, <em>not </em>whether he did so correctly.\u201d <em>Hawaii Teamsters &amp; Allied Workers Union, Local 996 v. United Parcel Serv., </em>241 F.3d 1177, 1178 (9th Cir.2001). \u201c[S]o far as the arbitrator\u2019s decision <em>concerns </em>consfruction of the contract, the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from his.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1183 (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">There is no basis for vacating the award to the extent that the parties agree upon what the arbitrator held \u2014 that UPS must cover absences of 22.3/40 employees with part-time employees in seniority order from the extra work sign-up list. The arbitrator did not disregard the plain language of the agreement when he made that ruling. His construction of \u201ccoverage\u201d is not inconsistent with the plain meaning of that term, and his failure to quote the full provision in one part of his award does not support a conclusion that he modified the agreement. Instead, he simply elected to quote in part the contract language that he had previously quoted in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">We need not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute over whether the arbitrator also decided how many part-time employees UPS must use. Even if UPS were correct that the arbitrator decided that it must use <em>one </em>part-time employee, not <em>two, </em>from the extra work sign-up list, that award would not exceed the scope of his authority. The parties expressly delegated to the arbitrator the authority to define the issue. Moreover, an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the issue before him is entitled to the same deference we extend to his award. <em>Pack Concrete, Inc. v. Cunningham, </em>866 F.2d 283, 285 (9th Cir.1989). \u201c[Cjourts are not at liberty to substitute their own interpretation of the parties\u2019 submission for that of the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Ass\u2019n of W. Pulp &amp; Paper Workers, Local 78 v. Rexam Graphic, Inc., </em>221 F.3d 1085, 1089 (9th Cir.2000). Assuming that the arbitrator decided how many employees from the extra work sign-up list UPS must use, the decision would fall easily within the scope of the issue submitted to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-16\">Nor can we say that a decision by the arbitrator that one rather than two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>employees must be used would be a basis for vacating the award on the ground that he ignored the parties\u2019 verbal agreement to the contrary. Even if the arbitrator made a legal error by ignoring the bargaining history on this question, such an error would not be a basis for vacating the award. <em>See United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union v. Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 38, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">In sum, there is no basis for vacating the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion that the agreement required UPS to cover absences of 22.3/40 employees with part-time employees in seniority order from the extra work sign-up list. We need not decide whether he also concluded that UPS must use only one employee, rather than two, from that list as there would be no basis for vacating such a ruling. Nor do we decide whether the district court\u2019s determination on this point was correct in order to determine that it properly refused to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award. Because the arbitrator retained jurisdiction over the implementation of his decision, should any further interpretation or clarification of his award be necessary or desirable, he has such authority, and he is in the best position to provide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
