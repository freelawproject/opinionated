TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b744-15\">Christopher Santillanes pleaded guilty to possessing with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of methamphetamine, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). His advisory guidelines sentence was calculated by comparing the amount of methamphetamine mixture (406.5 grams) with the actual amount of pure methamphetamine contained in the mixture (168.9 grams), and then using whichever amount would result in a higher offense level. In Santillanes\u2019s case, the actual amount of 168.9 grams yielded a higher offense level of 34. The guidelines calculations yielded a sentence range of 121-151 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-19\">At sentencing, Santillanes requested a downward variance, arguing the disparity between mixed and actual methamphetamine in the Guidelines produced a sentence that was greater than necessary under the factors delineated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court, concluding it did not have the power to accept Santil-lanes\u2019s argument based on a mere policy disagreement with the Guidelines, sentenced him to a term of 121 months. In light of the subsequent Supreme Court decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), we REVERSE and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-23\">We review a federal criminal sentence for reasonableness, giving deference to the district court under \u201cthe familiar abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 805 (10th Cir.2008). Reasonableness \u201chas both procedural and substantive components.\u201d <em>United States v. Atencio, </em>476 F.3d 1099, 1102 (10th Cir.2007); <em>see also Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-26\">Santillanes argues the district court erred procedurally by failing to adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>address his argument about the guidelines disparity between actual and mixed methamphetamine. After Santillanes\u2019s sentencing, the Supreme Court decided <em>Kim-brough, </em>holding that, in determining whether a particular sentence complies with the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cthe judge may consider the disparity between the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. The government, filing its brief shortly after <em>Kimbrough </em>was decided, conceded we should remand for resentencing. Because both parties agree on how we should resolve this case, we remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">On the substantive reasonableness side, we stress that, although we may apply a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentences, \u201cthe presumption ... applies only at the appellate level.\u201d <em>United States v. Conlan, </em>500 F.3d 1167, 1169 (10th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). On remand, the district court\u2019s task is to impose a sentence satisfying the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The Guidelines are but one of these factors and are thus not to be presumed reasonable at the district court level.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">For these reasons, we REVERSE San-tillanes\u2019s sentence and REMAND to the district court with instruction to VACATE the sentence and resentence Santillanes.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b744-27\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-11\">. This disposition obviates any need for us to address Santillanes's broader argument challenging the actual/mixed methamphetamine disparity as unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
