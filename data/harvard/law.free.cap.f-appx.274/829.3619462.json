The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s findings that any persecution or fear of persecution by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) that Gomez might have suffered was solely on account of his governmental contacts through his work as a salesperson and, thus, lacked a nexus to one of the five enumerated grounds in the Immigration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) to establish eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. On petition for review, Gomez contends that he met his burden in proving eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal, contending that he was persecuted, and fears future persecution, by the FARC on account of: (1) his political opinion and imputed political opinion, based on his contacts with government officials; and (2) his membership in a particular social group consisting of his family, because his brother was killed, allegedly for his failure to cooperate with the FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir. 2001) (quotation omitted). We lack jurisdiction to consider claims that Gomez raises in his petition for review unless he exhausted his administrative remedies with respect thereto by raising them before the BIA, regardless of whether the BIA addressed the claims <em>sua sponte. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if an alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-6\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). As the asylum applicant, Gomez carried the burden of proving his statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. In order to have carried this burden, Gomez must have, with specific and credible evidence, established (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, Gomez must have shown that it is more likely than not that, if returned to his country, his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Upon review of the entire administrative record, and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we discern no reversible error. We conclude, first, that Gomez did not challenge, before the BIA, the IJ\u2019s denial of his claim for CAT relief and, likewise, did not argue before the BIA, as he now argues before us, that he feared persecution on account of his membership in a social group consisting of his family. Accordingly, he failed properly to exhaust these claims before the BIA, and, we, therefore, are without jurisdiction to consider them on petition for review. Second, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s findings that Gomez has not demonstrated that he suffered past persecution, or has a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Colombia, on account of his political opinion or imputed political opinion. Gomez\u2019s evidence demonstrates, rather, that the FARC was interested in him solely on the basis of his potentially useful connections to government officials. Thus, the record does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>compel reversal, and, we deny Gomez\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
