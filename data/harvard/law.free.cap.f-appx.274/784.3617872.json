On appeal, Lake argues that the district court erred in (1) finding him accountable for more than five kilograms of cocaine and imposing the statutory minimum sentence based on that finding, and (2) finding that he was not entitled to safety-valve relief pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Lake\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">\n<em>Drug quantity and statutory minimum sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">On appeal, Lake argues that the district court erred in determining the drug quantity at sentencing because, in a drug conspiracy case, the quantity for sentencing purposes is the amount reasonably foreseeable to the defendant, not the amount admitted at the plea colloquy. In particular, Lake argues that he should be accountable only for three kilograms he directly distributed and that the distribution of a greater amount was not reasonably foreseeable to him. Lake also argues that the district court failed to make an individualized finding of the drug quantity based on the record. Lake further argues that the court erred in applying the statutory minimum based on a drug quantity of five kilograms.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory. 543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Although the Guidelines are only advisory, a district court must calculate the advisory sentencing range correctly and must consider it when determining a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005). <em>Booker </em>does not alter our previously established standards of review of the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of drug quantity used to establish a defendant\u2019s base offense level for clear error. <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2000). When a defendant fails to object to allegations of fact in a PSI, those facts are deemed to be admitted for sentencing purposes. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2096, 167 L.Ed.2d 816 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">In the case of a drug conspiracy, the Sentencing Guidelines provide that a defendant is liable for his own acts and the reasonably foreseeable acts of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-13\">With respect to offenses involving contraband (including controlled substances), the defendant is accountable for all quantities of contraband with which he was directly involved and, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, all reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (n.2(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-15\">In the case of a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) involving five kilograms or more of a substance containing cocaine, a defendant faces a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of ten years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii). \u201c[I]n determining a defendant\u2019s penalty under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) for a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, the drug quantity must be reasonably foreseeable to that defendant where the effect of the quantity is to require the imposition of a statutory mandatory minimum sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Neal, </em>362 F.3d 1310, 1316 (11th Cir.2004), <em>vacated on other grounds, Sapp v. United States, </em>543 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>1107, 125 S.Ct. 1114, 160 L.Ed.2d 1027 (2005). This reasonably-foreseeable requirement is the same as that in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. <em>O\u2019Neal, </em>362 F.3d at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Because Lake did not challenge the fact that he distributed approximately three kilograms of cocaine and his partner in the drug business distributed five kilograms of cocaine, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err when it found Lake accountable for more than five kilograms of cocaine. We also conclude from the record that the district court properly used that drug quantity for the purpose of applying the ten-year minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">\n<em>Safety valve</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Next, Lake argues that the district court improperly denied him relief under the safety valve. Specifically, he asserts that the district court relied on disputed hearsay testimony and that prior flight is not an exception to safety-valve relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">\u2018When reviewing the denial of safety-valve relief, we review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual determinations,\u201d but review \u201cde novo the [district] court\u2019s legal interpretation of the statutes and sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Under the safety-valve provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, a district court must impose a sentence without regard to the statutory minimum if, among other things, before the sentencing hearing, the defendant gives the government truthful and complete information concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct. <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1304-1305 (11th Cir.2000); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5). \u201cThe question of whether the information [that the defendant] supplied to the government ... was truthful and complete ... is a factual finding for the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d 1302, 1305 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">The record shows that Lake\u2019s statements were inconsistent and incomplete regarding his own role in the conspiracy and the roles of others in the offense. Because Lake\u2019s statements were inconsistent and we give due regard to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Lake had not provided truthful and complete information to the government and, thus, that he did not qualify for safety-valve relief. Accordingly, we affirm Lake\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
