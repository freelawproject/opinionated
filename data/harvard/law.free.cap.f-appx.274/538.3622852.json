We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Duenas-Duenas\u2019s contention that the IJ failed to issue a cognizable decision and order as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(l)(A) and the regulations, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1008.37(a), 1240.12, 1240.13, is unavailing. Due\u00f1as could have presented his due process challenge to the BIA because the asserted deficiency is one that the BIA could have corrected on appeal, but did not do so. To this extent the issue is not exhausted. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004). To the extent that Duenas-Duenas also argues that we lack jurisdiction on account of the absence of a final order, we disagree. The record reflects that the IJ ordered Duenas-Duenas removed to Mexico based on her written findings. As all issues were disposed of, we have jurisdiction and decline Duenas-Duenas\u2019s request for remand. Finally, Duenas-Duenas suggests that the IJ failed to rule on his motion to terminate based on prior \u201cinchoate\u201d deportation proceedings, but she did, on March 18, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Duenas-Duenas submits that the conviction for an attempt to violate Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11351 under Penal Code \u00a7 664 is not an aggravated felony in the absence of a sentence. Duenas-Duenas does not challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that his \u00a7 11351 conviction is analogous to a federal felony under the Controlled Substances Act. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. He remains convicted of this offense despite the effect of CaLPenal Code \u00a7 654(a), which is merely to preclude double punishment for the same act. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 101(a)(48), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Given this disposition, we do not need to reach Duenas-Duenas\u2019s arguments with respect to his conviction under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11370.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">Nor is Duenas-Duenas\u2019s reliance in reply on <em>United, States v. Snellenberger, </em>493 F.3d 1015 (9th Cir.2007), viable; that case will be reheard en banc and the panel opinion cannot be cited to or by any court in the Ninth Circuit. 519 F.3d 908 (9th Cir.2008). In any event, Duenas-Duenas preserved no such challenge to the IJ\u2019s conclusions, and has never claimed that he is not deportable by reason of having committed an offense relating to a federally controlled substance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">The IJ found that Duenas-Duenas\u2019s previous order of deportation was discharged through self-deportation. This finding is supported by the record. Therefore, Due-nas-Duenas\u2019s position that the proceedings should have been terminated absent evidence of the 1976 order of removal lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b564-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-8\">. The IJ also found that Duenas-Duenas was removable as charged under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), given that he was convicted for a violation of a law \"relating to\u201d a controlled substance. Duenas-Duenas does not contest this conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
