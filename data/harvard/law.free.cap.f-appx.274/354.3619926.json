McGensy argues on appeal that he was entitled to a two-level reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) based upon his role in the offense. McGensy contends that he was significantly less culpable than other participants because he was not the owner or driver of the tractor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>trailer in which the aliens were found and because his mental state constituted an impediment to his ability to reason or take a leadership role in the offense. The evidence presented at trial and in the presen-tence report indicated that McGensy may have participated in the decision to transport the aliens, that he concealed the aliens, and that he gave the aliens advice to facilitate their concealment. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s finding that McGen-sy was not entitled to this minor-role adjustment is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Villa-nueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Because McGensy has shown no error in the district court\u2019s judgment, that judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
