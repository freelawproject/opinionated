Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history, we need not recount it here. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Solikhin\u2019s argument that the immigration judge violated his due process rights by retroactively applying 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(2) to his case is foreclosed by <em>Garcia-Ramirez v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 935 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Solikhin also argues that the Non-Immigrant Information System (\u201cNIIS\u201d) printout does not constitute reliable evidence of the date he departed the United States because the information it contains is collected by airline employees, not government officials, and because the printout at issue here is missing entries for the departure carrier or flight number. However, he did not produce any evidence to contradict the December 28,1996 departure date. Thus, his argument that the NIIS data is unreliable is insufficient to meet his burden of establishing he had not been outside of the United States for a period of more than ninety days. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
