The complaint alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), the National Housing Act (\u201cNHA\u201d), procedural due process, and New Jersey state law in relation to several Section 236 rent-increase applications reviewed by HMFA and approved by HUD for the Zion Towers Apartments between 1999 and 2004. On appeal, HTC challenges HUD and HMFA\u2019s approval of Zion Towers, Incorporated\u2019s (\u201cZTI\u201d) rent-increase requests despite alleged inadequacies in its rent-increase applications.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, HTC argues that ZTI\u2019s \u201cnarrative statement[s] of reasons for the requested increase[s] in maximum permissible rents\u201d and \u201cstatus report[s] on the project\u2019s implementation of its current Energy Conservation Plan,\u201d required under 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.315(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were insufficient to permit tenants to meaningfully comment on the proposed increases. Further, HTC argues that it holds a property interest in the notice and comment opportunities outlined by relevant federal and state statutes and regulations and was denied constitutional due process when those opportunities were not meaningfully afforded. For the reasons stated below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">DISCUSSION<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">I. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">First, as an initial matter, we must examine whether the District Court prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>erly exercised jurisdiction over HTC\u2019s complaint, an issue raised by HUD. HUD contends that its decisions to approve ZTI\u2019s rent-increase requests are not subject to judicial review under the APA, as those decisions are strictly committed to agency discretion. HTC responds that \u201cit is well-settled that agencies do not possess the discretion to disregard specific legal obligations and, even assuming HUD possesses substantive discretion to make rent-increase determinations, it may not exercise that discretion in a matter that violates federal law.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Reply Br. 14.) We agree that HUD\u2019s actions are not immune from review.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">HUD\u2019s jurisdictional argument is based on a misreading of HTC\u2019s claims. HTC does not challenge the substantive determinations underlying HUD\u2019s decisions to approve ZTI\u2019s rent-increase applications, but instead challenges \u201cHUD\u2019s compliance with the specific <em>procedural </em>protections prescribed by the Due Process Clause, the NHA, and federal regulations.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 16 (emphasis in original).) There is no question that the APA provides the District Court with the authority to review this type of challenge; in fact, the APA explicitly <em>requires </em>a reviewing court to \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be[, <em>inter alia,] </em>without observance of procedure required by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(D). As we recognized in <em>Hond-ros v. United States Civil Service Commission, </em>720 F.2d 278, 293 (3d Cir.1983), \u201ceven those actions \u2018committed to agency discretion by law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are renewable on grounds that ... the decision violates any constitutional, statutory, or regulatory command.\u201d Accordingly, HUD\u2019s jurisdictional argument is simply without merit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">II. Procedural Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">In its Letter Opinion dismissing HTC\u2019s complaint, the District Court asked, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cwhether the tenants of Zion Towers were provided with statutorily sufficient information before [ZTI]\u2019s rent-increase proposals were granted.\u201d Dist. Ct. Op. at *4. After reviewing the relevant federal and state statutes, regulations, and case law, the District Court answered this question in the affirmative. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">The NHA explicitly requires that Section 236 tenants be provided with \u201cadequate notice of, reasonable access to relevant information about, and an opportunity to comment on [rent-increase requests,] and that such comments are taken into consideration by the Secretary.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-lb(b)(l). HTC contends that, due to insufficiencies in ZTI\u2019s rent-increase applications, the tenants of Zion Towers were \u201cnot provided information sufficient to constitute \u2018adequate notice\u2019 of the reasons supporting the rent increase, and were not provided \u2018reasonable access to relevant information about\u2019 the request, nor a meaningful opportunity to comment\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. 21) as prescribed by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-lb(b)(l). HTC specifically challenges the sufficiency of ZTI\u2019s \u201cnarrative statements] of reasons for the requested increase^] in maximum permissible rents\u201d and \u201cstatus report[s] on the project\u2019s implementation of its current Energy Conservation Plan,\u201d as required by 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.315(a)(3), (a)(5). <em>See also </em>N.J.A.C. 5:80-9.4(a)(3), (a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The District Court recognized that although federal regulations require a Section 236 rent-increase application to include \u201c[a] narrative statement of the reasons for the requested increase in maximum permissible rents\u201d and \u201c[a] status report on the project\u2019s implementation of its current Energy Conservation Plan,\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.315(a)(3), (a)(5), the regulations do not define \u201cnarrative statement\u201d or \u201cstatus report.\u201d In considering what these terms might require, the Court inferred from HMFA\u2019s letters to Mr. Rivers<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and from HUD\u2019s approval of ZTI\u2019s applications that the agencies found that ZTI\u2019s materials satisfied the narrative statement and ECP status report requirements. After laying out the basic principle that an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of its own i\u2019egulations merits \u201csubstantial judicial deference,\u201d Dist. Ct. Op. at *6 (citing <em>Morrison v. Madison Dearborn Capital Partners III L.P., </em>463 F.3d 312, 315 (3d Cir.2006); <em>Mutschler v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>337 N.J.Super. 1, 766 A.2d 285, 292 (2001)), the District Court concluded that \u201cHMFA and HUD\u2019s determination that the narrative statement and ECP were sufficient falls within their controlling interpretation of the relevant regulations,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">We find no error in the District Court\u2019s reasoning. It is clear from the record that the tenants of Zion Towers, including Mr. Rivers, were in fact provided with an opportunity to review and comment on ZTI\u2019s rent-increase requests, as required by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-lb(b)(l). As the District Court recognized, HTC\u2019s own complaint references the dialogue between Mr. Rivers and HMFA regarding the content of ZTI\u2019s rent-increase applications. While Mr. Rivers may not have received the responses for which he had hoped,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> he did receive the consideration to which he was entitled. In the end, it was not error for the District Court to defer to HUD and HMFA\u2019s reasonable interpretations of them own regulations absent plain error or clear inconsistency between the agencies\u2019 interpretations and the regulations themselves. <em>See Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, </em>512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994); <em>In re Freshwater </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number><em>Wetlands Prot. Act Rules, </em>180 N.J. 415, 852 A.2d 167, 184 (2004). We find neither. Accordingly, we will AFFIRM.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-9\">. In its appellate briefing and before the District Court, HTC also challenged ZTI\u2019s legal capacity to seek rent increases during the periods in which its corporate status was revoked. As HTC conceded this aspect of its appeal at oral argument, we address it no further here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-10\">. The implementing regulations applicable to HMFA are substantially similar to the federal regulations on which HTC focuses most of its arguments. Under N.J.A.C. 5:80-9.4(a)(3) and (a)(4), a rent increase application for Section 236 developments \"shall consist of[, <em>inter alia,] </em>a status report on the housing project\u2019s implementation of its current energy conservation plan; [and a] narrative statement of the reasons for the rent increase.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Acp\">. As we write for the benefit of the parties alone, we need not undergo a lengthy recitation of the facts, which, in any event, are not in dispute at this stage in the proceedings. In reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), all allegations in the complaint must be taken as true and viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); <em>Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts, Inc. v. Mirage Resorts Inc., </em>140 F.3d 478, 483 (3d Cir. 1998).

As recognized by HTC, even the cases cited by HUD in support of its jurisdictional argument actually support the District Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in this case. <em>See, e.g., Sutton v.

In regard to ZTI\u2019s 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 rent-increase applications, the record indicates that Mr. Rivers wrote to HMFA, complaining that ZTI\u2019s narrative statements and ECP status reports were inadequate.
