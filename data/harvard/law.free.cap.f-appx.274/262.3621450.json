Lynch ultimately entered into a plea agreement with the Government, in which he agreed to plead guilty to both counts in the indictment. In conformity with Lynch\u2019s advisory guidelines range, the district court sentenced Lynch to thirty-three months\u2019 imprisonment on Count One and to a consecutive seven-year sentence on Count Two. Lynch timely noted his appeal, and now argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in the district court. We affirm the judgment of the district court for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-23\">Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are not cognizable on direct appeal unless counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears on the record. <em>United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003). In order to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must show that: (1) counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To satisfy <em>Strick</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>land\u2019s </em>second prong in the guilty plea context, a petitioner must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, he would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). In his brief, Lynch does not allege, much less demonstrate, that but for counsel\u2019s errors he would not have pled guilty but insisted on going to trial. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
