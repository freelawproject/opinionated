The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) did not err with respect to Social Security Ruling (SSR) 99-2p in evaluating appellant\u2019s chronic fatigue syndrome.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-14\">a. The ALJ was not required to obtain additional treating physician evidence to properly determine appellant\u2019s residual functional capacity. <em>See </em>SSR 99-2p (ALJ should recontact treating source if he determines the evidence is inadequate to determine disability). The magistrate judge correctly determined that the ALJ found the evidence adequate to reach a concrete determination. <em>See Naber v. Shalala, </em>22 F.3d 186, 189 (8th Cir.1994) (\u201can ALJ is permitted to issue a decision without obtaining additional medical evidence so long as other evidence in the record provides a sufficient basis for the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-15\">b. The ALJ appropriately discredited appellant\u2019s testimony regarding functional limitations. The magistrate judge correctly found that the ALJ provided clear and convincing reasons, based on substantial evidence, for questioning appellant\u2019s credibility. The ALJ cited lack of significant signs of fatigue associated weakness, inconsistences regarding complaints of discomfort when undergoing an abdominal exam, and the ability to engage in daily activities such as gardening for up to four hours and riding a bicycle for up to one hour. <em>See Batson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1196 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that inconsistency during examination, among other reasons, is an appropriate basis for discrediting testimony). The ALJ did not violate SSR 99-2p in failing to specifically discuss appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>diary because the ALJ considered \u201cpertinent non-medical evidence.\u201d Moreover, appellant\u2019s diary, while providing documentation of symptoms, is not specific regarding impact on functioning. <em>See </em>SSR 99-2p (consideration of the individual\u2019s own record, such as a diary, of his impairments\u2019 impact on functioning over time should be made in assessing credibility).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">c. The ALJ did not violate SSR 99-2p with respect to third party statements. The magistrate judge appropriately determined that the third party statements offered by appellant are not relevant to appellant\u2019s functional abilities because they reflect little knowledge of appellant\u2019s physical situation and offer observations only every few months. <em>See </em>SSR 99-2p (third party information helps to assess an individual\u2019s ability to function on a day-to-day basis and to depict the individual\u2019s capacities over a period of time).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">2. The ALJ did not improperly evaluate appellant\u2019s ability to perform past relevant work. Appellant listed past relevant work including \u201cdeli clerk\u201d which he described as slicing meat products and customer service. The ALJ appropriately relied on the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), No.316.684-014 (deli cutter/slicer) to determine that appellant could perform this past relevant work as it is generally performed in the national economy. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1560 (use of DOT as a resource to determine past relevant work <em>either </em>as the claimant actually performed it <em>or </em>as generally performed in the national economy).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b598-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited except as provided by 9th Cir.
