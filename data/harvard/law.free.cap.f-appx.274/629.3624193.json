EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Defendant Regina Rainwater previously-pleaded guilty to mail fraud and aiding and abetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 &amp; 1341. The district court sentenced Rainwater to 33 months in prison and three years of supervised release. The conditions of Rainwater\u2019s supervised release prohibited her from committing any federal, state, or local crimes; however, during the period of her supervised release, Rainwater pleaded no contest to three felony offenses she committed in Oklahoma. Based on these offenses, the U.S. Probation Office filed a \u201cPetition for Warrant or Summons\u201d for Rainwater, and Rainwater stipulated that she had violated the terms of her supervised release. The district court therefore revoked Rainwater\u2019s supervised release and sentenced her to a term of 24 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">On appeal, Rainwater\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), which presented Rainwater\u2019s challenge to her sentence. In addition, counsel moved for leave to withdraw as Rainwater\u2019s counsel. Neither Rainwater nor the Government filed a brief responding to counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief. We have independently reviewed the record as required by <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Based on that review, we conclude that because the district court\u2019s explanation of its reasoning to impose the selected sentence was inadequate, the appeal is not entirely frivolous. For the reasons stated below, however, Rainwater cannot prevail on her non-frivolous ground for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Rainwater argues that the district court erred because it failed to explain how it reached the sentence it imposed in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the policy statements in Chapter 7 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Chapter 7. Rainwater failed to raise this objection in the district court, and we accordingly review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Cordova, </em>461 F.3d 1184, 1186 (10th Cir.2006). \u201cPlain error occurs when there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, which (3) affects substantial rights, and which (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Burbage, </em>365 F.3d 1174, 1180 (10th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">It is well established that a district court must consider both the policy statements contained in Chapter 7 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines and several factors provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when imposing a sentence following revocation of supervised release. <em>Id. </em>at 1188. To fulfill this responsibility, we do not require the district court to recite \u201cany magic words\u201d nor do we require the court to consider each factor individually. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Quintanilla, </em>442 F.3d 1254, 1258 (10th Cir.2006). We do, however, require that the district court judge provides us with some basis to conclude \u201cthat he has considered the parties\u2019 legal arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmak-ing authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In the instant case, the district court did not mention, nor did it apparently consider either the required \u00a7 3553(a) factors or Chapter 7 policy statements. Instead, with respect to the sentence, the court merely stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">The Coui\u2019t finds that the defendant has violated the condition of supervised released as alleged in the petition for offenders under supervision filed on July 18, 2007. It is the order of the Court that the defendant is committed to the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons to be imprisoned for a term of 24 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Thus, the district court erred because this sparse statement gives us no reason to conclude that the court considered the Chapter 7 policy statements and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when imposing Rainwater\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Although the district court erred, we affirm the sentence imposed because Rainwater cannot satisfy the third prong of plain error review. \u201cFor an error to have affected substantial rights, the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Romero, </em>491 F.3d 1173, 1179 (10th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 319, 169 L.Ed.2d 225 (2007). In the instant case, nothing in the record indicates that the district court would have imposed a different sentence had it explicitly considered the Chapter 7 policy statements and the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although the statute capped the possible sentence upon revocation at 24 months, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), the Chapter 7 policy statement recommended a sentencing range of 33-41 months, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). In addition, Rainwater\u2019s significant criminal history supports a lengthier sentence. Nothing in the record militates for a lesser sentence, and thus, we conclude that the error was not prejudicial. Accordingly, Rainwater\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED and we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
