Dean, denying her application for asylum and withholding of deportation. <em>In re Bi Qi Li, </em>No. A73 649 865 (B.I.A. June 20, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A73 649 865 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 11, 1999). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-21\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, i.e., \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating these findings as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-22\">We find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>substantial evidence. <em>See Iouri v. Ashcroft, </em>487 F.Sd 76, 81-82 (2d Cir.2007). First, the IJ properly found that Li was not credible because the factual basis for her claim before the asylum officer differed entirely from her claim before the IJ. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 391, 398 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that it was proper for the IJ to \u201crely on the commonsense observation that it is inconsistent for a petitioner to respond to the same question about the nature of his asylum claim with two entirely different responses\u201d). Contrary to Li\u2019s argument, the IJ \u201cexplicitly acknowledged\u201d her explanation for the differences between the two applications and found it \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399. Nothing in the record demonstrates that any reasonable adjudicator would have been compelled to reach the opposite conclusion. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Second, the IJ properly relied on Li\u2019s lack of corroboration for her claim. The IJ\u2019s finding that Li\u2019s abortion certificate did not support her claim because the word \u201cabortion\u201d was crossed out was not clearly erroneous, and the IJ did not err in rejecting Li\u2019s explanation. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 167-68 (2d Cir. 2007); <em>Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In addition, because the IJ already questioned the credibility of Li\u2019s testimony, it was not improper for him to rely on the absence of her husband\u2019s testimony as further support for his adverse credibility determination. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Kanacevic v. INS, </em>448 F.3d 129, 137 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Because substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility determination, the agency\u2019s denial of Li\u2019s asylum application was not improper. Furthermore, because the only evidence of a threat to Li\u2019s life or freedom depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility determination necessarily precluded success on her claim for withholding of deportation. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
