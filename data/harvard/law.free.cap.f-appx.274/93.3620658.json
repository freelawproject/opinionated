Nelson denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Shan Tong Chan, </em>No. A 98 560 400 (B.I.A. Sept. 6, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 98 560 400 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 13, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">When the BIA adopts and supplements the decision of the IJ, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its factfinding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was based on the IJ\u2019s assessment of Chan\u2019s demeanor and a substantial inconsistency. In rendering her adverse credibility determination, the IJ observed that Chan was hesitant and \u201cthat there were many questions that he answered by rote.\u201d This Court has found that \u201c[a] fact-finder who assesses testimony together with witness demeanor is in the best position to discern ... whether a witness who hesitated in a response was nevertheless attempting truthfully to recount what he recalled of key events or struggling to remember the lines of a carefully crafted \u2018script.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 73. Contrary to Chan\u2019s argument that the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding is unsupported, the IJ cited a portion of Chan\u2019s testimony where he contradicted himself in responding to a series of questions concerning how the government would have known that his wife\u2019s IUD was no longer in place. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The IJ also properly relied on the inconsistency between Chan\u2019s testimony that his wife was forcibly sterilized in 1995 while he was in jail and his statement at his credible fear interview that the sterilization occurred while he was in jail in 2004. The record belies Chan\u2019s assertion that he did not explicitly state in his credible fear interview that his wife was sterilized in 2004. Moreover, when asked to explain the discrepancy, Chan stated that he was arrested in 2000-a claim he had never previously made. While Chan suggests that the records of the credible fear interview are not always reliable, he does not assert that the record of his particular interview is inaccurate or unreliable for any particular reason. <em>See Ramsamea-chire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179-80 (2d Cir.2004) The IJ properly found that the inconsistency regarding when Chan\u2019s wife was forcibly sterilized was significant when measured against the record as a while. Indeed, it involved a nine-year discrepancy concerning the most material elements of his claim-his wife\u2019s forcible sterilization and his detention. The inconsistency thus calls into question whether his wife was forcibly sterilized and whether he was actually detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Having found that Chan\u2019s testimony was not otherwise credible, the agency properly found that Chan\u2019s corroborating evidence alone could not establish his eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006). Therefore, the agency did not err in denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>that relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Because the only evidence that Chan was likely to be tortured depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claim for CAT relief. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Chan\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
