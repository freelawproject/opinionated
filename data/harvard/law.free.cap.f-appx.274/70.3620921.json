Nelson, which denied their application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Gezim Pepushaj and Dhurata Tata, </em>Nos. A97 831 841, A97 831 840 (B.I.A. May 31, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>Nos. A97 831 841, A97 831 840 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 14, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), overrated <em>in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that conditions in Albania have fundamentally changed such that Pepushaj and Tata no longer have a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1); <em>Hoxhallari v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 179, 187 (2d Cir.2006). In addition to relying on changes in the Albanian government, the agency reasonably found that any risk of persecution is further diminished by the fact that many of Pepush-aj\u2019s relatives, who are also Democratic Party supporters, live in Albania unharmed. <em>See Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir.1999). Under these circumstances, we see no basis to disturb the agency\u2019s conclusion that Pe-pushaj and Tata lack a well-founded fear of persecution, and that they are therefore ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Hoxhallari, </em>468 F.3d at 187. Likewise, because Pepushaj\u2019s and Tata\u2019s application for CAT relief was based on the same factual predicate as their application for asylum and withholding of removal, the agency did not err in denying them such relief. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
