Elstein denying their applications for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>In re Jean Marie Monfort, </em>Nos. A77 570 898, A77 570 900, A77 570 899 (B.I.A. Oct. 20, 2004), <em>aff'g </em>Nos. A77 570 898, A77 570 900, A77 570 899 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 19, 2003). The petitioners also seek review of the February 11, 2005 order of the BIA denying their motion to reopen and reconsider. <em>In re Jean Marie Monfort, </em>Nos. A77 570 898, A77 570 900, A77 570 899 (B.I.A. Feb. 11, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the Monforts did not challenge before the BIA the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was dispositive to the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal, and they therefore failed to exhaust that issue before the agency. Because no manifest injustice would result, we dismiss the petition for review to the extent that it challenges the BIA\u2019s October 2004 order affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of relief due to the Monforts\u2019 failure to exhaust the dispositive issue before the agency. <em>See, e.g., Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 118 (2d Cir.2007). Thus, the finding stands as a valid basis for the agency\u2019s denial of the Monforts\u2019 application for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or concluso-ry statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">We find that there was no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s finding that the Monforts\u2019 motion to reconsider was untimely. Unlike a motion to reopen, there are no exceptions to the time limitation for motions to reconsider. <em>Compare </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2), <em>with 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Here, there is no dispute that the Monforts\u2019 January 2005 motion to reconsider was submitted almost two months after the statutory deadline, and their argument that this deadline is trumped by international law is misplaced. <em>See Oliva v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 229, 235-36 (2d Cir.2005). Furthermore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Monforts\u2019 motion to reopen where they failed to assert any new facts other than the unsupported assertion that Jean Marie Monfort\u2019s sister disappeared and is presumed to be dead. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petitions for review are DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
