Shadur, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b479-20\">SHADUR, Senior District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b479-21\">Anton Lamont Thompson (\u201cThompson\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s finding, made at his sentencing hearing, that the United States had established by a preponderance of the evidence that he was previously convicted of two state crimes. Because the district court did not commit clear error in making that finding, we affirm Thompson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-22\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b479-23\">On December 8, 2006 Thompson pleaded guilty to one count of attempted bank robbery and one count of armed bank robbery. When the United States Probation Office prepared a Presentence Investigation Report, it calculated the sentencing range under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) as 92 to 115 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-24\">As always, that calculation was predicated in part on Thompson\u2019s criminal history. It treated him as having amassed 10 criminal history points, thus putting him into Criminal History Category V. One of those 10 points was based on two prior North Carolina misdemeanor convictions \u2014 one for carrying a concealed weapon and one for breaking and entering \u2014 both stemming from a single incident that occurred on December 20,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>In a written presentence memorandum Thompson objected to that calculation because, he maintained, the United States had failed to present sufficient proof of the two misdemeanor convictions. Without those convictions, Thompson explained, he would have 9 rather than 10 criminal history points, placing him in Criminal History Category IV and reducing the Guidelines range to 77 to 96 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">At Thompson\u2019s February 22, 2007 sentencing hearing the United States was unable to produce a copy of the judgment reflecting the two North Carolina convictions. For his part Thompson\u2019s attorney explained that his own investigation into the matter came up empty, telling the district court that \u201cthere was no judgment\u201d confirming the prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In lieu of a judgment covering those convictions, the United States submitted three other supporting documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">1. a two-page computer printout, certified by the Deputy Clerk of the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, showing that Thompson had pleaded guilty to the two misdemeanor charges and had been sentenced to 12 months\u2019 probation for the breaking and entering offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">2. an uncertified copy of a grand jury indictment charging Thompson with carrying a concealed weapon; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">3. an uncertified copy of a plea transcript (a standardized form used to document the plea agreement between Thompson and the district attorney) signed by Thompson, the district attorney and the presiding state court judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">At his sentencing hearing Thompson again argued that those documents did not suffice to support a finding that he had twice been convicted in North Carolina. But the district court disagreed, finding that the \u201ccertified copy of an electronic record that reflects the conviction,\u201d as well as the uncertified copy of the plea transcript, \u201ctogether are reliable evidence that there was a conviction.\u201d Thompson was then given concurrent sentences of 92 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release on the two federal counts. After sentencing he filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error <em>(United States v. Katzopoulos, </em>437 F.3d 569, 574 (6th Cir.2006)). Such findings are \u201cclearly erroneous only when, despite some evidence to support the finding, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed, based on a review of the record as a whole\u201d <em>(United States v. Raleigh, </em>278 F.3d 563, 566 (6th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">III. Absence of Clear Error</p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">At sentencing the United States bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence any factors used to support a sentencing enhancement <em>(United States v. Gibson, </em>985 F.2d 860, 866 (6th Cir.1993)). As we said in <em>United States v. Warwick, </em>149 Fed.Appx. 464, 467 (6th Cir.2005), citing <em>United States v. Unger, </em>915 F.2d 759, 760 (1st Cir.1990):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-15\">Similarly, the Government bears the burden of proving the existence of prior convictions used to determine the defendant\u2019s criminal-history category under the Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-16\">On appeal Thompson challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that the United States met that burden, advancing the same arguments he had made below. But those arguments fail here, just as they did at the district court level.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-17\">We do not write on a clean slate in that respect. We have twice affirmed sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>tenees that \u2014 like Thompson\u2019s \u2014 were based in part on criminal histories that the United States established not by producing actual judgments but by proffering other reliable documents that supported the fact of prior convictions <em>(United States v. Crowell, </em>493 F.3d 744, 748-49 (6th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>470 F.3d 616, 623-24 (6th Cir.2006)). And other circuits have done the same (see, e.g., <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>94 F.3d 1373, 1381 (10th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Colletti, </em>984 F.2d 1339, 1345 (3d Cir.1992); <em>Unger, </em>915 F.2d at 761; and <em>United States v. Dyer, </em>186 Fed.Appx. 866, 868 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">As in <em>Crowell </em>and <em>Sanders, </em>here the United States did not produce a copy of the judgment stemming from Thompson\u2019s North Carolina convictions. But just as in those cases, it did produce documents (the computer printout and the plea agreement) that the district court reasonably relied upon in making its factual finding. Those documents are substantively no different from the documents relied upon by the district courts in <em>Crowell </em>and <em>Sanders. </em>Indeed, given the <em>Sanders </em>discussion (470 F.3d at 624) of <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) and the types of documents that <em>Shepard </em>allows a sentencing judge to consider in making factual determinations as to prior convictions, the district court here could properly have considered even the third document produced by the United States \u2014 the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">As for the two documents that the district court did rely on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">1. As to the plea agreement, nothing in our case law supports Thompson\u2019s argument that a document must be certified for it to be deemed reliable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">2. As to the two-page computer printout showing Thompson\u2019s North Carolina guilty plea, his challenge to its reliability is trumped by the document\u2019s having been <em>certified </em>by the deputy clerk of North Carolina\u2019s Superior Court of Mecklenburg County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Indeed, there is a special irony in Thompson\u2019s having argued in one breath that the district court is somehow obligated to consider only certified documents, when in the next breath he casts vague unsubstantiated aspersions on the one certified document in the lot (accord, <em>United States v. Chacon-Sanchez, </em>16 Fed.Appx. 749, 750 (9th Cir.2001), explaining that appellant cannot \u201cchallenge[] the reliability of the computerized search in only a vague way, merely asserting that the search is not always accurate\u201d without producing \u201cevidence to substantiate this claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">Finally, Thompson maintains that the district court should have placed more weight on his attorney\u2019s assertion at sentencing that \u201cthere was no judgment\u201d reflecting the prior state convictions. But just such a barebones denial sought to be made in <em>Crowell </em>was not enough to stand up to the weight of the other evidence that was presented to the district court there, and that we found adequate (493 F.3d at 748-49) \u2014 even where the defendant there had tried to corroborate his assertion with a computer-generated document from the clerk of court indicating that Crowell had no juvenile record. Thompson\u2019s purely oral denial, lacking even the type of paper submission that we found inadequate in <em>Crowell, </em>cannot dictate a different result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">IY. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">Given the evidence presented at Thompson\u2019s sentencing hearing as to his prior North Carolina convictions, the district court did not commit any clear error in finding that the United States had established those convictions by a preponderance of the evidence and in sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Thompson accordingly. Thompson\u2019s objection to the existence of those convictions and to the United States\u2019s failure to produce a copy of the judgment do not lead us to a contrary conclusion. Thompson\u2019s sentence is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
