Villagran argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) after finding that the offense \u201cinvolved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d The question whether a defendant\u2019s conduct creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury is a legal question, and therefore is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Solis-Garcia, </em>420 F.3d 511, 514 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">The record reflects that Villagran was driving a tractor trailer carrying five illegal aliens. Three of the five aliens were inside of a box under the bunk of the sleeping compartment. The box under the bunk was not intended for human travel. Because the aliens were in a closed compartment, the aliens could not easily communicate with the driver of the vehicle. Moreover, if the tractor trailer had been involved in an accident, no one would think to look for injured passengers in the compartment under the bunk. Given that three of the five aliens that Villa-gran concealed under the bunk in the sleeper compartment faced a greater risk than ordinary passengers traveling without seatbelts, the district court\u2019s adjustment under \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) was not error. <em>Id. </em>at 516 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
