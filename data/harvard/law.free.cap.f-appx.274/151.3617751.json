In a prior appeal, we affirmed those convictions and remanded for resentencing pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Crawford now appeals the 240-month sentence that the District Court imposed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-24\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the facts and proceedings below, we will not revisit them here. Crawford argues that his sentence is unconstitutional because it required the District Court to find, as a matter of fact, that he had a prior felony drug conviction. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). This argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Ordaz, </em>398 F.3d 236, 240-41 (3d Cir. 2005) (citing <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 244, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-25\">We have considered all of Crawford\u2019s arguments and conclude that no further discussion is necessary. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-18\">. Even if we were not bound by <em>Ordaz </em>and <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>we would still affirm the District Court\u2019s sentence. The government must establish that the defendant is a convicted felon to obtain a conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1). At trial, the government relied on Crawford's 1993 felony drug conviction to establish this element. In convicting Crawford of violating \u00a7 922(g)(1), the <em>jury </em>found beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the 1993 felony upon which the District Court relied in sentencing Crawford.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
