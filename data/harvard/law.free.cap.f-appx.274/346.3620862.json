Amaya argues that the district court erred in treating two of his prior convictions as separate offenses when calculating his criminal history score under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). Because Amaya did not object in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Rodriguez, </em>415 F.3d 452, 454 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-19\">Amaya contends that the offenses at issue were related because he was sentenced for these two offenses on the same day, albeit under different cause numbers. When sentences for factually distinct offenses are imposed \u201con the same day and/or in the same proceeding,\u201d those offenses are not considered related under \u00a7 4A1.2. <em>United States v. Huskey, </em>137 F.3d 283, 288 (5th Cir.1998). The district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise, in determining that Amaya\u2019s convictions were unrelated for the purpose of calculating his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
