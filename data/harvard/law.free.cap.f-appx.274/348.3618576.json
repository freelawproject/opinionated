Oswalt appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights complaint, in which he claimed, inter alia, that the defendants had him falsely charged with arson so that his insurance company would not have to pay for the fire damage to his home. Oswalt also alleged that the defendants conspired to interfere with his civil rights, deprived him of his constitutional right to his home, and denied him equal protection under the law. Oswalt sought monetary damages in the amount of 16 million dollars. The district court dismissed Oswalt\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). Oswalt has filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>one-page appellate brief with this court, asserting that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint. Oswalt has not, however, analyzed the district court\u2019s merit-based dismissal of his claims. Thus, Os-walt\u2019s claims are deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Oswalt\u2019s brief fails to raise any issue of arguable merit. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Oswalt\u2019s suit as frivolous and for failure to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Ham-mons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Oswalt is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
