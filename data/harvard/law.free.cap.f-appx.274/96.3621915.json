We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">\u201cIf the petitioner claims to be a national of the United States, and the court of appeals finds from the pleadings and affidavits that no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner\u2019s nationality is presented, the court shall decide the nationality claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(A). If, however, this Court finds that a genuine issue of material fact does exist, the Court \u201cshall transfer the proceedings to the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the petitioner resides for a new hearing on the nationality claim and a decision on that claim.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B). We decide whether there is a genuine issue of material fact using the same principles employed when reviewing a grant of summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See Agosto v. INS, </em>436 U.S. 748, 754, 98 S.Ct. 2081, 56 L.Ed.2d 677 (1978). \u201cAccordingly, the government, as the party seeking what amounts to summary judgment, \u2018bears the burden of establishing that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the undisputed facts establish [its] right to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Joseph v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>Attorney General, </em>421 F.3d 224, 230 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Rodriguez v. City of New York, </em>72 F.3d 1051, 1060-61 (2d Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a), applicable to petitioner because it was in effect when petitioner was 18, provided that a child born outside of the United States of alien parents became a citizen of the United States upon the fulfillment of certain conditions. Section 1432(a)(3) provided for the naturalization of a child upon \u201c[t]he naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child where there has been a legal separation of the parents\u201d if, at the time of the parent\u2019s naturalization, the child was under the age of eighteen and was residing in the United States pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a)(3), (4), (5). A divorce constitutes a \u201clegal separation\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1432(a)(3). <em>See Brissett v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir.2004). In this case, the only disputed issue was whether petitioner\u2019s father had \u201clegal custody\u201d of petitioner at the time the father was naturalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The record reveals a genuine issue of material fact as to whether petitioner\u2019s father had actual, uncontested custody over him at the time petitioner\u2019s father was naturalized. Petitioner presented affidavits and sworn testimony to support his contention that his father had legal custody over him at the time his father was naturalized. The Government submitted documentary evidence to the contrary that purported to contradict petitioner\u2019s evidence. Because there is a genuine issue of fact, and petitioner\u2019s evidence would be sufficient to support a finding that his father had legal custody of petitioner at the time his father was naturalized, there is a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Agosto, </em>436 U.S. at 756, 98 S.Ct. 2081 (\u201ca court of appeals cannot refuse to allow a de novo review of a citizenship claim if the evidence presented in support of the claim would be sufficient to entitle a litigant to trial were such evidence presented in opposition to a motion for summary judgment\u201d). Because petitioner\u2019s last known address was in Deer Park, New York, this Court must transfer the proceeding to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for a hearing and decision as to whether petitioner was in his father\u2019s legal custody at the time of his father\u2019s naturalization. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Accordingly, the proceedings are TRANSFERRED to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for a de novo hearing on petitioner\u2019s nationality claim and a decision on that claim; petitioner\u2019s motion for a stay of removal pending the District Court\u2019s ruling on the nationality claim is GRANTED; petitioner\u2019s motion for in forma pau-peris status is GRANTED; and petitioner\u2019s petition for review is HELD IN ABEYANCE.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
