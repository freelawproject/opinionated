He argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a minor-role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Yero contends that he was a mere courier who was substantially less culpable than other participants in the offense. Yero further contends that the district court incorrectly applied the Sentencing Guidelines due to the denial of the minor-role adjustment and, as a result, his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Whether a defendant is a minor or minimal participant is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2(b), a district court may decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if the defendant was a minor participant. An adjustment for a minor role applies to a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Yero has not shown that the district court clearly erred in denying the minor-role adjustment because courier status does not automatically entitle Yero to minor participant status. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 241 &amp; n. 7 (5th Cir.1995). Yero\u2019s role of transporting drugs was important to the success of the drug venture. <em>See United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989) (\u201c[Cjouriers are an indispensible part of drug dealing networks.\u201d) Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in denying Yero a minor-role adjustment, and his within-guidelines sentence was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
