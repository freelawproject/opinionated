Stallings, </em>463 F.3d 1218, 1220 (11th Cir. 2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2446, 167 L.Ed.2d 1144 (2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If a defendant possessed a weapon during a drug trafficking offense, a two-level increase is warranted. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). \u201cThe adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3). The government has the burden of demonstrating the proximity of the weapon to the site of the charged offense by preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Audain, </em>254 F.3d 1286, 1289 (11th Cir.2001). If the government meets its burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that a connection between the weapon and the offense was clearly improbable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-13\">Here, the district court properly applied the firearm enhancement to Pennic\u2019s sentence. The government demonstrated \u2014 and Pennic admitted \u2014 that a gun was present in his car in the same area where drugs and drug paraphernalia were discovered during a routine traffic stop. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that a fact is deemed admitted when a defendant fails to object to a factual statement in the presentence investigation report). The government was not required to prove that the gun was used to aid in the offense or that its possession was illegal. <em>See Audain, </em>254 F.3d at 1289. And Pennic failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that a connection between the gun and the drugs clearly was improbable. For the district court to apply the section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement to Pennic\u2019s sentence was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-14\">We now turn to Pennic\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court did not consider sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>his post-arrest drug rehabilitation. We review his sentence for reasonableness in the light of the factors set out in section 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir. 2005).'<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence, protection of the public, and just punishment, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical, educational, and corrective needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) \u2014 (T). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">We conclude that Pennic\u2019s sentence is reasonable. The district court correctly calculated the Guidelines range as 8 to 14 months<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and sentenced Pennic to the upper end of that range, but well below the 20-year statutory maximum. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C); <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788 (noting that \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable\u201d); <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246 (comparing, as one indication of reasonableness, the actual prison term imposed against the statutory maximum). The district court also considered the section 3553(a) factors in determining Pennic\u2019s sentence; the court specifically balanced the seriousness of Pennic\u2019s offense and the need to impose appropriate punishment against Pennic\u2019s commendable drug rehabilitation, educational, and family endeavors. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A), (D). The district court\u2019s statement of reasons was sufficient. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (a lengthy explanation is not necessarily required when a judge decides to follow the Guidelines in a particular case, especially where a sentencing judge has listened to the arguments of the parties, considered the supporting evidence, and was aware of the special conditions of the defendant). And the weight given to a section 3553(a) factor is within the sound discretion of the district court; \u201c[w]e will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3040, 168 L.Ed.2d 755 (2007), <em>abrogated in part on different grounds by Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">Based on the factors outlined in section 3553(a) and our review of the record, we conclude that Pennic has not carried his burden of showing that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-9\">. Pennic also was charged with carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); but the district court later dismissed this count on the government\u2019s motion based on Pennic\u2019s guilty plea and cooperation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-10\">. At the outset, we note that we address the merits of Pennic\u2019s appeal even though his plea agreement contained a sentence appeal waiver. The government has not raised the issue of waiver, but instead, has addressed the merits of the appeal. And the application of the waiver is not outcome determinative. <em>See United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 745 n. 1 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-15\">. Pennic\u2019s reliance on <em>Stallings, </em>where we vacated a district court\u2019s application of a section 2D 1.1 (b)(1) enhancement because the government provided no evidence that guns discovered in defendant\u2019s home \u2014 where no activities about the drug conspiracy took place \u2014 belonged to him or were connected to the conspiracy, is misplaced. <em>See </em>463 F.3d at 1221. Here, Pennic produced proof of his ownership of the gun, and the gun was discovered next to the drugs. We also reject Pennic\u2019s argument that the dismissal of the section 924(c) charge militates against application of the enhancement because a higher standard of proof is required to sustain a section 924(c) conviction than a section 2D 1.1 (b)(1) enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b879-6\">. In addition, reasonableness review employs an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b879-9\">. After calculating the Guidelines range, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion for a two-level downward departure based on Pennic\u2019s cooperation, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b879-21\">. In fact, the court noted that, based on testimony about Pennic\u2019s rehabilitation efforts, it imposed a lower sentence than it otherwise would have. Thus, Pennic\u2019s argument that the court did not sufficiently consider this factor is belied by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
