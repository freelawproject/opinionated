The Immigration Judge found them credible but determined their asylum application was untimely, and also concluded that they had established neither past persecution nor a pattern or practice of persecuting Chinese Christians in Indonesia. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Johnson and Sung did not present an argument to us why they are entitled to asylum or relief under the Convention Against Torture, so we will not consider those issues. As to their withholding of removal claim, their argument is that the Immigration Judge ignored relevant evidence demonstrating a pattern or practice of persecution of Chinese Christians.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We review the Board\u2019s and Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of relief under a deferential substantial evidence standard under which agency findings \u201cmust be upheld unless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 483-84 (3d Cir. 2001). Having reviewed the record and the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision, we are satisfied that he reviewed the relevant evidence. <em>See </em>A.R. 92-95 (reviewing reports). An Immigration Judge \u201cneed not discuss each and every piece of evidence presented by an asylum applicant when rendering a decision, as long as that decision is substantially supported.\u201d <em>Yan Lan Wu v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 418, 425 n. 10 (3d Cir.2005). Further, the evidence here does not compel a conclusion that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of Chinese Christians in Indonesia. We have already held that no such pattern or practice has been established, <em>Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 537 (3d Cir.2005), and our review of the more recent reports in the record reveals no reason to revisit that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\">.
