Straus denying her motion to reopen. <em>In re Bao Zhen Lin, </em>No. A77 994 632 (B.I.A. Jul. 18, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A77 994 632 (Immig. Ct. Hartford Oct. 23, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. Wang<em>chuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in finding that Lin\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely and that she did not qualify for equitable tolling of the 90-day filing deadline. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). A party seeking equitable tolling on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate that she exercised \u201cdue diligence\u201d in vindicating her rights. <em>See Jin Bo Zhao v. INS, </em>452 F.3d 154, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Cekic v. INS, </em>435 F.3d 167, 171 (2d Cir.2006). As the BIA noted, Lin provided little information about what efforts she took to keep track of her case at any point after the IJ\u2019s April 2004 decision accepting the withdrawal of her asylum application and granting her voluntary departure. Accordingly, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Lin failed to exercise due diligence was not \u201carbitrary or capricious,\u201d <em>Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233-34, and therefore was not an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also Cekic, </em>435 F.3d at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">Moreover, the agency did not abuse its discretion in finding that Lin failed to show that her motion to reopen qualified for an exception to the 90-day filing deadline based on \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d in China. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The IJ and BIA properly found that Lin\u2019s conversion to Christianity did not constitute changed circumstances in China. <em>Cf. Jian Huan Guan v. BIA, </em>345 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir.2003). In addition, the BIA properly noted that while Lin submitted evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>China\u2019s poor treatment of Christians, she failed to establish that the situation for Christians in China has worsened since her April 2004 hearing. Much like her motion to reopen, Lin\u2019s brief to this Court identifies no specific information in the voluminous amount of country conditions evidence she submitted that would support her assertions. As such, the agency\u2019s finding was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur, </em>418 F.3d at 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Regarding Lin\u2019s claim that the IJ violated her right to due process of law (by failing to advise her of the consequences of withdrawing her applications for relief with prejudice and of the requirements of voluntary departure), we find no abuse of discretion in the agency\u2019s conclusion that Lin\u2019s discussion with her attorney rendered harmless any possible error on the IJ\u2019s part. Ultimately, Lin points to no evidence that she failed to \u201creceive a full and fair hearing which provide[d] a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 104-05 (2d Cir.2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b75-10\">. As the BIA properly declined to toll the 90-day filing deadline because Lin failed to demonstrate that she exercised due diligence, <em>Cekic, </em>435 F.3d at 170, it is unnecessary to examine the agency\u2019s alternative finding that she failed to establish that her former attorney's allegedly defective performance prejudiced the outcome of her case. <em>Cf. Garcia-Martinez v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>448 F.3d 511, 514 n. 2 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
