Because the Demos cannot establish an essential element of their negligence and derivative consortium claims \u2014 Red Roof Inns\u2019 responsibility for causing their injuries \u2014 we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-26\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b503-27\">Attending a funeral in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Donald Demo and his wife, Melony, stayed at a Red Roof Inn. The hotel room doors opened to a portico. Each of the three wooden stairways leading to upper floors had a roof but was exposed to the elements from the sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The Demos took a room on the second floor. Twice that night, Donald climbed the middle stairway -without incident. The next day brought bleak conditions \u2014 fog, rain, and accumulated snow \u2014 as Donald discovered when he emerged at 4:30 a.m. to find breakfast. He dropped off his wife\u2019s meal at the room before realizing he neglected to buy a drink. Knowing about snow and ice in the parking lot, he took a new route on the side stairway to make a safer trek to the vending machines. As he stepped off the landing, Donald \u201cjust took off falling.\u201d JA 103. Although he later surmised \u201cit was a sheet of ice there,\u201d he conceded that \u201cno one can actually say.\u201d JA 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Five minutes later he recovered and made his way to the hotel office to report his fall. He declined an ambulance and returned to his room but eventually filled out an accident form citing wet and icy steps. The hotel responded to his report by sending someone to salt the stairway.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The Demos filed a complaint in state court, in which Donald claimed that the hotel\u2019s negligence caused his fall and resulted in severe back and leg injuries; Melony asserted a derivative claim for loss of consortium. Invoking federal diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1), Red Roof Inns removed the action to the Western District of Michigan, where the court granted summary judgment in its favor. The Demos now appeal that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Bry-son v. Regis Corp., </em>498 F.3d 561, 569 (6th Cir.2007). Summary judgment follows \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). As the non-moving parties, the Demos are entitled to all reasonable factual inferences. <em>See Matsushi-ta Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Under Michigan law, which governs this diversity action, a plaintiff asserting a negligence claim must prove: (1) \u201cthat the defendant owed a legal duty to the plaintiff,\u201d (2) \u201cthat the defendant breached or violated the legal duty,\u201d (3) \u201cthat the plaintiff suffered damages,\u201d and (4) \u201cthat the breach was a proximate cause of the damages suffered.\u201d <em>Schultz v. Consumers Power Co., </em>443 Mich. 445, 506 N.W.2d 175, 177 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">The Demos argue that the district court erred in resolving proximate causation against them on summary judgment. Although causation is sometimes a jury question, the district court may decide causation as a matter of law if the plaintiff presents insufficient evidence to \u201csupport a reasonable inference\u201d of causation. <em>See, e.g., Weymers v. Khera, </em>454 Mich. 639, 563 N.W.2d 647, 648 (1997) (\u201cA mere possibility of ... causation is not enough; and when the matter remains one of pure speculation or conjecture, or the probabilities are at best evenly balanced, it becomes the duty of the court to direct a verdict for the defendant.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Nicholson by Nicholson v. Children\u2019s Hosp. of Mich., </em>139 Mich.App. 434, 363 N.W.2d 1, 2 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">Michigan law holds that \u201ca plaintiff cannot satisfy th[e] burden [of drawing a \u201creasonable inference\u201d of causation] by showing only that the defendant may have caused his injuries,\u201d <em>Craig ex rel. Craig v. Oakwood Hosp., </em>471 Mich. 67, 684 N.W.2d 296, 309 (2004), or that the proposed cause of an injury is \u201cmere speculation,\u201d <em>Skinner v. Square D Co., </em>445 Mich. 153, 516 N.W.2d 475, 480 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Red Roof Inns and the district court below primarily relied on Donald\u2019s deposition admissions, a technique supported by Michigan case law. <em>See, e.g., Northern v. Fedrigo, </em>115 Mich.App. 239, 320 N.W.2d 230, 233 (1982) (\u201cPlaintiff is bound by the statements in his deposition.\u201d). Donald admitted several times during his deposition that he was not sure how he had fallen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">DEMO: I got to that point [at the top of the stairs] and it just \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it was just a layer of ice that I didn\u2019t see or what it was, I don\u2019t know, you know, but it surprised me, you know, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">COUNSEL: So as you sit here today, you have no idea what caused you to fall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">DEMO: No, sir. It\u2019s the only thing I could think of it was a sheet of ice there, and no one can actually say. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">JA 103. He later said, \u201c[Ajnything I could think of was just a layer of ice because it just, you know, it happened so quick.\u201d JA 104. These statements amount to speculation about the cause of Donald\u2019s fall, and the fall\u2019s occurrence alone fails to trace the Demos\u2019 injuries to the hotel\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">We are unable to differentiate the Demos\u2019 claim from two other slip-and-fall cases where Michigan courts held plaintiffs to them equivocal deposition testimony. In <em>Stefan v. White, </em>76 Mich.App. 654, 257 N.W.2d 206, 208 (1977), the plaintiff fell down stairs, explaining at her deposition that she \u201cjust went down\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t feel nothing\u201d that caused the fall. Even though the plaintiffs husband filed an affidavit pointing to a metal strip at the top of the stairs that could have caused the fall, the court held that the plaintiff could not identify a causal relationship, and \u201c[t]he mere occurrence of plaintiffs fall [was] not enough to raise an inference of negligence on the part of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210. Similarly, in <em>Pete v. Iron County, </em>192 Mich.App. 687, 481 N.W.2d 731, 732 (1991), the plaintiff fell down outdoor courthouse stairs. The plaintiff admitted during her deposition that she did not know how she had fallen, but that water on the stairs might have been the culprit. <em>Id. </em>Like the metal strip in <em>Stefans, </em>the hypothetical water did not establish causation, and the court granted summary judgment to the defendant. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">The Demos acknowledge these cases but insist that the accident report form Donald filed after his accident citing wet and icy stairs and the hotel\u2019s responsive salting of the stairway create a genuine dispute about causation. But according to Donald\u2019s deposition testimony, ice or rain were only conjectural causes. The Demos invite us to \u201cdispense with\u201d the causation requirement, but like the district court, we decline to do so and affirm the grant of summary judgment against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">Red Roof Inns also argues that the absence of a duty justifies summary judgment, but because causation alone is fatal to the Demos\u2019 claim and because Red Roof Inns did not argue about duty below, we do not discuss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">With the merits of Donald\u2019s claim settled, Melony\u2019s claim also fails because a loss of consortium claim depends on the success of the primary negligence claim. <em>See Moss v. Pacquing, </em>183 Mich.App. 574, 455 N.W.2d 339, 343 (1990). Therefore we also affirm the grant of summary judgment to Red Roof Inns on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
