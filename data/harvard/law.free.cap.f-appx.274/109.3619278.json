Garvan Murtha, United States District Judge for the District of Vermont, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b135-23\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b135-24\">Angelo Praias appeals from a judgment of conviction entered on October 11, 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>sentencing him principally to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 10 years of supervised release. His conviction followed a guilty plea to one count of transporting an individual under 18 years of age in interstate commerce with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Praias contends on appeal that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines for \u201cunduly influencing] a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(2)(B) (2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case, and with the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">We review a district court\u2019s sentencing decision for both substantive and procedural reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>521 F.3d 149, 156-57 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Section 2G1.3(b)(2)(B) of the Guidelines \u2014 the 2005 version of the Guidelines is applicable here \u2014 instructs a sentencing court to increase a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if it finds that the defendant \u201cunduly influenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.\u201d The application note to this section further provides that \u201c[i]n a case in which a participant is at least 10 years older than the minor, there [is] ... a rebuttable presumption, ... that such participant unduly influenced the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.3 cmt. n.3(B) (2005) (\u201cApplication Note 3(B)\u201d). The rebuttable presumption is warranted because \u201csome degree of undue influence can be presumed because of the substantial difference in age between the participant and the minor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Praias does not dispute that at the time of the commission of the offense he was 71 years old and the victim was 15. The rebuttable presumption arising from a greater than 10-year age difference from Application Note 3(B) therefore applied. We conclude that the district court did not err in finding that Praias failed to rebut the presumption. The district court adopted the findings in the Presentence Report, which asserted that Praias drove in his own car from New York to Kentucky to transport the victim to his apartment, tied the victim\u2019s breasts together, took photos of the victim\u2019s vagina, and discussed engaging in a \u201cmaster/slave\u201d relationship with the victim. In light of the age difference, Praias\u2019s use of his superior resources to accomplish the offense, and the evidence of psychological manipulation, the district court did not err in finding that the enhancement applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
