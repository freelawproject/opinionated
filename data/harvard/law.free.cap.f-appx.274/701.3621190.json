TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Darrell G. Hafen appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of his pro se complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the complaint, Hafen alleged the State of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA) violated his state and federal constitutional rights by (1) reneging on a supposed contract to purchase 10,000 acres of land from the State of Utah, and (2) undermining his plans to build a solar city on a separate parcel. Hafen demanded that either he be allowed to attend any future SITLA meeting concerning the two parcels or SITLA be prohibited from holding such a meeting. Because Hafen proceeded <em>in forma pau-peris </em>(IFP), the district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Hafen\u2019s complaint as frivolous, concluding the factual allegations to be wholly incredible and fantastic. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">We agree with the district court\u2019s reasoning and therefore DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">The magistrate judge\u2019s opinion describes well the factual and procedural background of this case. <em>See </em>R., Vol. II, Doc. 43. We summarize only a few key points, highlighting the wholly speculative nature of Hafen\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-14\">Hafen alleges he entered into a contract with the State of Utah to purchase 10,000 acres of land. At the same time, he alleges he contracted with a private landowner to purchase a plot adjacent to the 10,000 acres. After the private contract was entered, the landowner demanded Hafen pay him twice the agreed upon price or he would shoot Hafen. Knowing that person to have a history of violence, Hafen did not purchase his parcel and also asked the State of Utah to put the 10,000-acre contract \u201con hold.\u201d Hafen then waited for the landowner and his three sons to die. They are now allegedly deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-15\">Hafen also claims he spoke during a special session of the Utah legislature, expressing his intention to build a solar city on another large plot of land, known as \u201cthe south block.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-16\">Hafen then learned that SITLA was contemplating to use or sell both the 10,-000-acre plot and the south block. A SIT-LA meeting regarding these two parcels was allegedly scheduled for November 30, 2006, and Hafen sought to speak at the meeting. But SITLA executives, the two Defendants in this case, allegedly prohibited him from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-17\">Hafen sued, alleging that SITLA and unnamed co-conspirators destroyed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>contract for the 10,000 acres and took the south block away from him. In various documents filed with the complaint, Hafen also related the following: he was possibly suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease; he was taking a leave of absence from his current job to work with California Governor Schwarzenegger (his personal acquaintance); and he could use his relationship with Governor Schwarzenegger to help all western states with water and power issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Hafen proceeded IFP below and is thus subject to the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. Under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), district courts must dismiss an IFP complaint if it \u201cis frivolous or malicious.\u201d The term \u201cfrivolous\u201d in this context refers to a complaint containing \u201cinarguable legal conclusion[s]\u201d or \u201cfanciful factual allegation[s].\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The legal standard for dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) differs from that of a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Id. </em>at 325-28, 109 S.Ct. 1827; <em>see also McKinney v. Okla. Dep\u2019t of Human Sews., </em>925 F.2d 363, 365 (10th Cir.1991). Under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), district court judges have \u201cthe unusual power to pierce the veil of the complaint\u2019s factual allegations and dismiss those claims whose factual contentions are clearly baseless\u201d\u2014 for example, \u201cclaims describing fantastic or delusional scenarios.\u201d <em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 327-28, 109 S.Ct. 1827. Thus, \u201ca finding of factual ffivolousness is appropriate when the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible.\u201d <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">When, as here, the district court\u2019s determination of frivolousness does not turn on an issue of law, we review a <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 27, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728. Carefully reviewing all filings, the district court concluded Hafen\u2019s \u201cpleadings are replete with incredible and fantastic factual allegations that have little or no relation to his asserted legal claim,\u201d and \u201cmost, if not all, of those allegations have little or no basis in fact.\u201d R., Vol. II, Doc. 43 at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">We do not see an abuse of discretion in this determination and agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS Hafen\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b728-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-19\">. Because Hafen is proceeding pro se, we review his filings liberally. <em>See Haines v. Ker-ner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\">. <em>Neitzke </em>and all other cases we cite dealt with \u00a7 1915(d), which in 1996 became \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
