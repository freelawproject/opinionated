Duarte pleaded guilty and was convicted of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute marijuana. The district court sentenced him to 70 months of imprisonment, four years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">Duarte argues that he was wrongly denied a downward adjustment for his minor or minimal role in the offense. The advisory Sentencing Guidelines provide for a reduction in the base offense level of a \u201cminor\u201d or a \u201cminimal\u201d participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. To merit a reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2, the defendant must have been \u201csubstantially less culpable\u201d than the average participant. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of establishing that he is eligible for the adjustment.\u201d <em>United States v. Partida, </em>385 F.3d 546, 566 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-22\">The presentence report indicates that Duarte was one of many lower-level participants in a drug trafficking organization. He participated for an extended period of time in activities such as conducting counter-surveillance to monitor law enforcement activity, driving loads of marijuana, and general loading and unloading of marijuana. Duarte has not shown that he is substantially less culpable than the average participant in the conspiracy, given that there were many lower-level participants such as himself. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). He has also not shown that his participation was \u201cperipheral to the advancement of the illicit activity\u201d or that his participation was not \u201ccritical to the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 204 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Tremelling, </em>43 F.3d 148, 153 (5th Cir.1995). We find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s denial of a reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
