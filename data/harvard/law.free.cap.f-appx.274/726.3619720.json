KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">Defendant-Appellant Jose Valentin Melendez-Dones appeals from the sentence imposed following his guilty plea to one count of reentry of a removed alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2). He was sentenced to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 a term at the low end of the applicable Guidelines range \u2014 followed by two years\u2019 unsupervised release. On appeal, Mr. Melendez argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-18\">A sentence within the correctly determined Guidelines range is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Kristi, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1054 (10th Cir.2006). Mr. Melendez argues that this presumption is no longer valid after <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). <em>See </em>Aplt. Reply Br. at 2, 7. However, <em>Gall </em>clearly states that \u201c[i]f the sentence is within the Guidelines range, the appellate court may, but is not required to, apply a presumption of reasonableness.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 597. We review a sentencing decision for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Sutton, </em>520 F.3d 1259, 1262-63 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-23\">The reasonableness of a sentence \u201cincludes a procedural component, which includes how the sentence was calculated, and substantive component concerning the length of the sentence actually imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Melendez concedes that the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines range, Aplt. Br. at 10, and only ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>gues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. First, he argues that his criminal history double counts his prior convictions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l). We have routinely upheld this practice as reasonable where the Guidelines authorize it. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l), cmt. n. 6; <em>United States v. Ruiz-Terrazas, </em>477 F.3d 1196, 1204 (10th Cir.2007). The district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting arguments that Mr. Melendez\u2019s two prior violent felony convictions \u2014 attempted armed robbery and aggravated burglary\u2014 over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history, particularly given Mr. Melendez\u2019s lengthy criminal history and recidivism. Second, Mr. Melendez argues that his cultural assimilation and his reason for illegally reentering the United States, to visit his terminally ill sister, also cause his sentence to be substantively unreasonable. We have not previously determined whether cultural assimilation is an appropriate ground for departure, and we decline to address the question here. See <em>United States v. Galarza-Payan, </em>441 F.3d 885, 889-90 (10th Cir.2006). Mr. Melendez has failed to demonstrate that these facts cause the sentence to be unreasonable based on the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), particularly given that having been removed to Mexico in July 2005 after serving a federal sentence for reentry, he returned to the United States and was convicted of a controlled substance offense. <em>See KristL, </em>437 F.3d at 1055; II R. (PSR) 9, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b753-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
