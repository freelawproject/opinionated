After examining the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. Thus the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed.

On direct appeal, Scott \u2014 through new counsel \u2014 raised, among other things, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>oral argument, we cautioned Scott\u2019s attorney that an ineffective assistance claim was almost impossible to sustain on a direct appeal and that, if it failed, Scott could not again raise the claim in a later collateral attack. Scott\u2019s counsel responded that his client was aware of the risks but wanted to proceed with the claim. We subsequently rejected Scott\u2019s appeal, finding nothing in the record to rebut the presumption that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>284 F.3d 758, 761 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Scott now brings a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, arguing that his <em>appellate </em>counsel was ineffective for raising on direct appeal Scott\u2019s claim that his former counsel was ineffective at trial. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the district court found that Scott\u2019s appellate counsel properly informed Scott of the risks of raising an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal, but Scott nevertheless instructed his counsel to proceed. The court accordingly dismissed Scott\u2019s petition, finding no case law to support the proposition that an appellate counsel must refuse to follow his client\u2019s informed instructions. <em>Scott v. United States, </em>No. 03-CV-3265, 2007 WL 853967, at *4 (C.D. Ill. Mar. 16, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">We agree that Scott\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim cannot succeed. As the district court correctly noted, a lawyer may be <em>entitled </em>to disregard a client\u2019s direction to present an issue on appeal but is not <em>constitutionally required </em>to do so. <em>See Wallace v. Davis, </em>362 F.3d 914, 920 (7th Cir.2004). Scott\u2019s argument here\u2014 that his appellate counsel did not fully inform him of the consequences of his decision \u2014 simply restates his testimony at the evidentiary hearing, which the district court found not credible. This factual determination was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Menzer v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 1000, 1003 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Finally, Scott\u2019s appellate counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise a Confrontation Clause violation argument, where we affirmed, on direct appeal, the district court\u2019s finding that Scott wrongfully caused the unavailability of a government witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
