Andrews alleged that he injured his back after he slipped and fell on water leaking from a toilet in the jail dormitory. Andrews argued that the defendant was both negligent and deliberately indifferent to his need for a reasonably safe living environment. Andrews further complained that he was not transferred back to the Avoyelles Parish Jail after being given medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-21\">The district court dismissed Andrews\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Andrews now appeals. As the district court referenced both 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), (ii) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e as grounds for dismissing Andrews\u2019s complaint, we review Andrews\u2019s challenges to the district court\u2019s decision de novo. <em>See Velasquez v. Woods, </em>329 F.3d 420, 421 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Andrews suggests that the district court erred by dismissing his civil rights action instead of entering a default judgment against the defendant for failing to file an answer to the complaint. However, the defendant was never served in the district court and was not required to file an answer. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(a)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Andrews argues that the district court erred in dismissing his civil rights complaint because the defendant acted \u201cunder the color of state law and should be held liable for his actions.\u201d However, Andrews\u2019s argument fails to address the district court\u2019s determination that the defendant\u2019s actions did not violate Andrews\u2019s constitutionally protected rights. Andrews\u2019s assertion that the defendant may have known about the leaky toilet but failed to repair it at most alleges negligence, which is not actionable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 332-36, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986); <em>Eason v. Thaler, </em>73 F.3d 1322, 1329 n. 3 (5th Cir.1996). Andrews\u2019s complaint that he was not transferred back to Avoyelles Parish Jail after being given medical treatment also is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. Andrews has no constitutionally protected right to placement in a particular facility. <em>See Maddox v. Thomas, </em>671 F.2d 949, 950 (5th Cir.1982). The district court did not err when it dismissed Andrews\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Andrews\u2019s appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983), and is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of this lawsuit as frivolous constitute two strikes for purposes of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) bar. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Andrews that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pau-peris in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
