(\u201cBizrocket\u201d) claimed that Interland, Inc. (\u201cInterland\u201d) breached a contract by denying it physical access to a computer server stored at Interland\u2019s web-hosting facility. Bizrocket also claimed that by denying it access to the server, Interland converted the server and the software on it in violation of Florida tort law. The district court granted Interland\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the conversion claim, and a jury awarded Bizrocket $800,000 in damages on the breach of contract claim. Ruling on Interland\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court granted the motion in part and reduced Bizrocket\u2019s damages to one dollar. Both parties appeal. We affirm the court\u2019s judgment on Bizrocket\u2019s conversion claim and reverse its denial in part on Interland\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">The material facts underlying Bizroek-et\u2019s breach of contract and conversion claims are essentially uncontested.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 1996, Mark Ismach founded Bios Corp. (\u201cBios\u201d). He was Bios\u2019s sole shareholder, and served as the company\u2019s president. Over the next couple of years, he created software for a search engine, called Business Ethic Bureau Investigation (\u201cBEBI\u201d), and stored a copy of it on a server.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-15\">On September 29, 1998, Ismach, either on behalf of himself, Bios, or both, signed a Co-Party Agreement with Interland, a Minnesota corporation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This web-hosting agreement provided that, in exchange for a monthly fee, Interland would store the server, designated Server 9007, and provide it with \u201cping, power, and pipe,\u201d or electricity, bandwidth, and internet connectivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-16\">On April 26, 1999, Home Care America (\u201cHCA\u201d), a Florida corporation, bought all of Ismach\u2019s shares in Bios for $500,000 plus a majority of the shares of HCA stock. HCA changed its name to Bizrock-et and Bios became its wholly-owned subsidiary. As part of the deal, Ismach remained president of Bios; he also served as president of Bizrocket. Robert Williams, the founder and president of HCA, became a vice president of Bizrock-et.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-17\">Ismach soon discovered that Bizrocket had numerous undisclosed liabilities, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>on October 22, 1999, he resigned as president of Bizrocket.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Williams replaced him as Bizrocket\u2019s president.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">In late November, Williams contacted Interland on behalf of Bizrocket, and demanded that Interland allow Bizrocket access to Server 9007, deny access to anyone else, and disconnect the server from the internet. Williams gave Interland a copy of Ismach\u2019s letter of resignation as Bizrocket\u2019s president as proof of his, Williams\u2019s, authority to speak for Bizrock-et. Interland contacted Mark Ismach and asked him about Williams\u2019s request. Is-mach told Interland that he was the sole owner of Server 9007, and he instructed Interland to deny Williams and Bizrocket access to the server and to keep the server online. Interland did so, and rebuffed Williams\u2019s continued pleas for access. At some point, Interland and Ismach terminated the original Co-Party Agreement between Bios and Interland, and Interland entered into a new web-hosting agreement with Mark Ismach for the server\u2019s storage and maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">In December, 1999, Bizrocket sued Mark Ismach for physical access to Server 9007. In July, 2000, they reached a settlement whereby, for $10,000 and a release of all claims, Ismach agreed to instruct Inter-land to give Bizrocket physical access to Server 9007 in November 2000. When Bizrocket inspected the server in December 2000, the BEBI software was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">On July 24, 2003, Bizrocket sued Inter-land (and two other corporations, one of them based in Florida) in a Florida circuit court for conversion of Server 9007 and the BEBI software, and for breach of Bios\u2019s Co-Party Agreement with Inter-land. After the Florida-based defendant was dismissed from the case, Interland removed the case to the United States Court for the Southern District of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">On Interland\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court ruled that Florida\u2019s \u201ceconomic loss rule\u201d barred Bizrocket\u2019s conversion claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court set the breach of the Co-Party Agreement for trial, and on September 2, 2005, a jury found that Interland breached the agreement by denying Bizrocket physical access to the server, and awarded Bizrocket $800,000 in \u201creliance\u201d damages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-13\">In a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, Interland argued that no reasonable jury could have found: (1) that it had breached the Co-Party Agreement; or (2) that $800,000 in \u201creliance\u201d damages was reasonably foreseeable to the contracting parties, Bios and Interland, at the time they entered into the Co-Party Agreement. The court rejected Inter-land\u2019s first argument, but was persuaded by its second argument. It therefore granted Interland\u2019s motion in part, and reduced the jury award to one dollar for nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-15\">At the time Interland denied Bizrocket access to Server 9007 \u2014 and the conversion and breach of contract claims thereby arose \u2014 the following is clear: (1) Ismach owned the majority of Bizrocket\u2019s shares; (2) Bizrocket owned all of Bios\u2019s shares; (3) Ismach was Bios\u2019s president; (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>Williams was Bizrocket\u2019s president; and (5) either Ismach or Bios, or both, owned Server 9007 and the BEBI software. With these facts in hand, we turn to Bizrocket\u2019s claims, beginning with the conversion claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Whether the economic loss rule barred the conversion claim is irrelevant, because Bizrocket failed to make out a case of conversion. In its complaint,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Bizrocket asserted that \u201cas a result of Bizrocket\u2019s purchase of all Bios stock, it became the owner of BEBI, the server that housed BEBI, and all proprietary information related thereto.\u201d Assuming Server 9007 and the BEBI software belonged to Bios and not Ismach personally at the time HCA, Bizrocket\u2019s predecessor, purchased Ismach\u2019s Bios shares, HCA did not acquire the server and software; instead, they remained the property of Bios. It therefore follows that Interland could not have infringed Bizrocket\u2019s rights in the property when it denied Bizrocket access.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">We dispose of Bizrocket\u2019s breach of contract claim for the same reason. The Co-Party Agreement was between Bios and Interland. Bizrocket\u2019s purchase of Is-mach\u2019s shares of Bios did not operate to assign Bios\u2019s rights under the contract to Bizrocket. Bizroeket\u2019s sole interest in the contract was due to its ownership of Bios\u2019 shares. Bizrocket cites no precedent, from Florida or elsewhere, for the proposition that the sole shareholder of a corporation becomes a party to the corporation\u2019s contracts with third parties by operation of law the moment it acquires ownership of the corporation\u2019s shares. Bizrocket\u2019s breach of contract claim therefore fails, and the district court erred in denying Interland\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">The judgment of the district court granting Interland judgment on Bizrock-et\u2019s conversion claim is AFFIRMED. The court\u2019s judgment for Bizrocket (for one dollar) on its breach of contract claim is REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED with instructions that the court enter judgment for Interland on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">AFFIRMED, in part; REVERSED, in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-11\">. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b803-12\">. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b803-13\">. In addition to cross-appealing the district court's partial denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law, Interland cross-appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to impose sanctions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, which Inter-land argues are justified on the ground that the damages theory Bizrocket advanced in support of its breach of contract claim had no basis in law. We affirm the court\u2019s sanctions ruling without elaboration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b803-18\">. For the most part, we recite the facts as they appear in Bizrocket\u2019s opening brief which are drawn from the parties\u2019 Revised Joint Neutral Statement of the Case to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b803-19\">.
