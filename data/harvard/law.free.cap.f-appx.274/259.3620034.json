Lewis also pled guilty to a second count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000), 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007) (Count Four). He was sentenced to life plus sixty years\u2019 imprisonment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Lewis first challenges the district court\u2019s decision to limit his cross-examination of Detective Marshburn regarding the confidential informant. A district court\u2019s decision to limit cross-examination is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Scheetz, </em>293 F.3d 175, 184 (4th Cir.2002). The Confrontation Clause does not guarantee counsel the right to unfettered, unlimited cross-examination, nor does it prevent a trial judge from imposing reasonable limits on cross-examination based upon concerns about harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, witness safety, repetition, or relevance. <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">We find Lewis\u2019s first challenge without merit. Because the confidential informant did not testify, his credibility was not at issue. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>118 F.3d 192, 196-97 (4th Cir.1997). Lewis did not challenge the validity of the search warrant. Nor was he charged with the sale to the confidential informant, and the district court specifically instructed the jury that \u201c[t] he defendant is not on trial for any other act or any other conduct or offense not specifically alleged in the indictment.\u201d While the marked twenty dollar bill acquired by Lewis from the informant provided some proof of Lewis\u2019s knowledge and intent to distribute the 53.6 grams of crack discovered in his vacuum cleaner, the testimony regarding the marking and discovery of the bill was provided by the detective, who was fully subject to cross-examination. For these reasons, we find the district court did not abuse its discretion in restricting the cross-examination of Detective Marshburn regarding the observations and actions of the confidential informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Next, Lewis argues the district court erred in failing to suppress statements he made in the bedroom of his apartment, regarding his sole occupancy and ownership of the apartment\u2019s contents, without the benefit of Miranda<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> warnings. We find the district court did not err in distinguishing <em>United States v. Parker, </em>262 F.3d 415, 419 (4th Cir.2001), and in determining that the circumstances at 104 Sea-well Avenue were sufficiently custodial to necessitate <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to the questioning of any potential suspects. Nevertheless, we conclude the district court\u2019s erroneous admission of Lewis\u2019s statement about occupancy and ownership was harmless. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a); <em>United States v. Stokes, </em>261 F.3d 496, 499 (4th Cir.2001). The Government\u2019s evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>dence at trial overwhelmingly established Lewis\u2019s possession of the gun and the crack cocaine discovered in the vacuum cleaner.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Finally, Lewis argues the court\u2019s jury instruction regarding evidence of prior bad acts was erroneous. Because there was no objection to the instruction during trial, we review the claim only for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Evidence of prior bad acts is not admissible to prove bad character or criminal propensity, but such evidence is admissible to prove motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 404(b); <em>United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 994-95 (4th Cir.1997). Such evidence is admissible only when it is: (1) relevant to an issue other than the general character of the defendant, (2) necessary, (3) reliable, and (4) the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial value. <em>Queen, </em>132 F.3d at 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Consistent with the pretrial notice, the Government introduced at trial evidence of Lewis\u2019s other bad acts under Rule 404(b). We find Lewis has failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s jury instruction was erroneous, let alone plainly so. At issue in the trial was Lewis\u2019s knowledge and intent with respect to the gun and drugs discovered in the vacuum cleaner of his apartment. Evidence of pri- or drug sales was admissible under Rule 404(b) to prove Lewis\u2019s knowledge and intent. <em>See United States v. Mark, </em>943 F.2d 444, 448 (4th Cir.1991). The district court\u2019s instruction that evidence of prior similar conduct was offered to show Lewis\u2019s \u201cfamiliarity with the drug business\u201d referred to Lewis\u2019s knowledge and intent regarding crack distribution, rather than to some general propensity for criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Lewis\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\"> <em>Miranda v.
