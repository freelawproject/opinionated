The Board and immigration judge denied his request for asylum on the ground that he failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his asylum application within one year of his arrival in the United States, and we lack jurisdiction to review this determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000), even in light of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231. <em>See Almuhtaseb v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 743, 747-48 (6th Cir. 2006) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we also cannot review the underlying merits of his asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-24\">Murokib also contends that the immigration judge erred in denying his request for withholding of removal. \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>(4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2007). Based on our review of the record, we find that Murokib failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court. We therefore uphold the denial of his request for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-16\"> Because Murokib failed to challenge the immigration judge's denial of his request for protection under the Convention Against Torture before the Board, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000) (\"A court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1049, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005) (holding that we lack jurisdiction to consider an argument that was not raised before the Board).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
