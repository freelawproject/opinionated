Wright was determined to be a career offender and was sentenced to concurrent 180-month sentences on Counts Three and Five and a consecutive eighty-four-month sentence on Count Four, for an aggregate sentence of 264 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-24\">Wright appeals. His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising two claims but stating that there are no meritorious issues for review. Wright has filed a pro se supplemental brief asserting that he was improperly found to be a career offender. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-25\">According to Wright\u2019s presentence report (PSR), he had two predicate felony convictions that qualified him for career offender status under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2006): com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>mon law robbery and first degree burglary. The district court relied on this information in finding that Wright was a career offender. In his pro se supplemental brief, Wright makes the conclusory assertion that these convictions were not for violent crimes. Because Wright did not raise this issue below, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We conclude that Wright did not meet his burden of establishing that the information the district court relied upon was incorrect. <em>See United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998). We further reject the argument in the <em>Anders </em>brief that his sentence as a career offender violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 2006) (fact of prior conviction is valid reason to enhance sentence even if not found by a jury). Accordingly, we find that he was properly treated as a career offender for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel argues that the district court erred when it also found that Wright was an armed career criminal. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.4. We need not address this issue because, as counsel correctly acknowledges, the alleged error is harmless in light of Wright\u2019s status as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and we find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy of the motion was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
