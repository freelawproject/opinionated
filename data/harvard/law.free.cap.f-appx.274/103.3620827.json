We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Maniscalco argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the summons because the government did not have standing to bring such a claim. Maniscalco\u2019s arguments are without merit. The IRS may issue a summons to ascertain the liability \u201cof any person for any internal revenue tax\u201d and to \u201cexamine any books, papers, records, or other data which may be relevant or material to such inquiry.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(a)(1). Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 7604, the IRS may initiate a proceeding to enforce such a summons in the district court for the district in which the taxpayer resides or is found. Accordingly, the district court properly adjudicated the government\u2019s petition; Maniscalco\u2019s jurisdictional arguments are frivolous, relying on false propositions of law and false assumptions about the government\u2019s ability to enforce the tax code.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">Because Maniscalco\u2019s brief does not address the merits of the district court\u2019s decision to enforce the summons, he has waived any argument to the contrary. <em>See Norton v. Sam\u2019s Club, </em>145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201cIssues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal.\u201d). Nevertheless, the district court did not err in enforcing the summons. <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>379 U.S. 48, 57-58, 85 S.Ct. 248, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964) (setting forth the framework for deciding when the IRS may obtain the enforcement of a summons).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">As we find this appeal to be entirely frivolous, we direct the appellant to show cause within 30 days why he should not be sanctioned in the amount of $1,000 pursuant to our authority under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 38 (\u201cIf a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after ... notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\u201d); <em>In re JC\u2019s East, Inc., </em>84 F.3d 527, 532 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
