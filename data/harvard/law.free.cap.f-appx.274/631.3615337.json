EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b658-17\">Plaintiff-Appellant Frederick Banks, a federal prisoner appearing <em>pro se, </em>appeals from two district court decisions dismissing, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), his host of claims. We have consolidated Mr. Banks\u2019 two appeals for purposes of disposition and exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. In appeal No. 07-6191, Mr. Banks asserts that the district court erred in dismissing his claims, brought under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, seeking damages and injunctive relief for various alleged violations of Mr. Banks\u2019 constitutional and statutory rights. In appeal No. 07-6230, Mr. Banks maintains that the district court erred in dismissing a series of FOIA, Privacy Act, and constitutional claims against certain employees of the Butner Federal Correctional Complex in North Carolina (\u201cButner\u201d). For substantially the same reasons that the magistrate judges delineated and the district court adopted, we deny Mr. Banks\u2019 motions to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) and dismiss his appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The genesis of Mr. Banks\u2019 two appeals is his confinement, from December 28, 2006 to February 14, 2007, in the segregated housing unit (SHU) at Butner, and his eventual transfer first to the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and finally on to his current correctional facility in Yazoo City, Mississippi. Apparently, Mr. Banks\u2019 initial placement in the SHU stemmed from accusations that he was stalking his prison psychologist, Defendant-Appellee Partyka. Mr. Banks, however, alleges that he was confined in the SHU without being charged or given an incident report. While in the SHU, Mr. Banks claims, the prison staff there shredded requests he made to the staff and mocked poetry he wrote to Par-tyka. In addition, Mr. Banks alleges that a Lt. Moses was in charge of the SHU and that Moses, spurred by racial animus, also put Mr. Banks\u2019 requests in the rubbish.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Moreover, Mr. Banks maintains that while in transit from Butner to his current facility in Yazoo City, he requested, under FOIA and the Privacy Act, that Defendant-Appellee Joe Keffer provide him all records relating to his transit order. Mr. Banks asserts that he received no records from Keffer. In addition, Mr. Banks claims that he propounded similar requests to the Defendant-Appellee U.S. Marshal in Oklahoma City. These requests also netted Mr. Banks nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">To synthesize his two complaints, Mr. Banks alleged violations of his Ninth Amendment \u201cright to love\u201d; deprivations of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment; violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment; violations of his First Amendment rights; and violations of FOIA and the Privacy Act. In adopting the July 6, 2007 Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge Valerie K. Couch and the August 21, 2007 Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge Doyle W. Argo in their entirety, the district court: (1) concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Defendants Partyka and Lt. Moses and dismissed the claims against them without prejudice, (2) dismissed without prejudice, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e), Mr. Banks\u2019 claims against the U.S. Marshal as legally frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and (3) dismissed with prejudice, pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e), Mr. Banks\u2019 claims against Joe Keffer because they failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Lastly, after Mr. Banks indicated his intent to appeal the dismissal of both suits, the district court certified that any appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">The federal IFP statute is intended to open the federal courts to indigent litigants. Nei<em>tzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 324, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). However, because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a) allows indigent litigants to commence lawsuits without prepayment of fees or costs \u2014 and thereby hazards abusive liti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>gation \u2014 Congress also provided for the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of \u201cfrivolous or malicious\u201d suits under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). <em>See Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 324, 109 S.Ct. 1827. Likewise, \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) provides for dismissal \u201cat any time if the court determines that\u201d the suit \u201cfails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d A suit \u201cis frivolous where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 325,109 S.Ct. 1827.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Additionally, this court has read \u00a7 1915(e)(2) to authorize the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of claims for lack of personal jurisdiction. <em>Trujillo v. Williams, </em>465 F.3d 1210, 1217 (10th Cir.2006); <em>cf. Fogle v. Pierson, </em>435 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201cA complaint may be dismissed <em>sua sponte </em>under \u00a7 1915 based on an affirmative defense ... only when the defense is obvious from the face of the complaint and no further factual record is required ...\u201d (quotation, citation omitted)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2297, 167 L.Ed.2d 1124 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2) is discretionary. <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). Accordingly, we \u201creview[] a district court dismissal under \u00a7 1915[ (e)(2) ] for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Whitney v. New Mexico, </em>113 F.3d 1170, 1172 (10th Cir.1997). Where, however, the \u201cfrivolousness determination turns on an issue of law, we review the underlying legal determination <em>de novo.\u201d Pierson, </em>435 F.3d at 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Having reviewed the record, we discern neither any abuse of discretion nor any misstatement of the law. Both Magistrate Judges properly construed Mr. Banks\u2019 complaints liberally. <em>See Lamb v. Rizzo, </em>391 F.3d 1133, 1135 n. 1 (10th Cir. 2004). But both identified no claims that should survive \u00a7 1915(e). As such, for substantially the same reasons stated in the carefully researched and reasoned reports of the Magistrate Judges, we agree with the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Mr. Banks\u2019 various claims. However, this court has an independent duty, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2), to dismiss an appeal\u2014 rather than affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal \u2014 if the appeal is frivolous. In light of the district court\u2019s analysis and our review of Mr. Banks\u2019 claims, we dismiss his appeals as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">We turn now to Mr. Banks\u2019 request to proceed IFP. The district court denied Mr. Banks\u2019 motions for IFP status, and Mr. Banks\u2019 renewed his motion in this court. Perhaps predictably, given the analysis above, we conclude that he has not demonstrated \u201cthe existence of a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.\u201d <em>McIntosh v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 812 (10th Cir.1997). Accordingly, we deny his motions for IFP status and direct him to make full and immediate payment of the outstanding balance of the appellate filing fees for both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">Finally, we consider the ramifications of these two appeals for Mr. Banks\u2019 right to seek pauper status in the future and ultimately declare four strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cIf we dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>miss as frivolous the appeal of an action the district court dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), both dismissals count as strikes.\u201d <em>Jennings v. Natrona County Det. Ctr. Med. Facility, </em>175 F.3d 775, 780 (10th Cir.1999). We count \u201ca dismissal without prejudice ... as a strike, so long as the dismissal is made because the action is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim.\u201d <em>Day v. Maynard, </em>200 F.3d 665, 667 (10th Cir.1999) (per curiam). Because we dismiss both of Mr. Banks\u2019 appeals here, we must assess Mr. Banks four strikes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, we caution Mr. Banks that he is barred from bringing a civil action or an appeal from a judgment in a civil action without prepayment of the applicable filing fee unless he establishes that he is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Because Mr. Banks\u2019 appeals present no reasoned, non-frivolous arguments, we DENY his request for IFP status, DISMISS his appeals, and assess four strikes against him.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b658-11\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\">. The \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision of the IFP statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\">. One nagging issue stems from the manner in which the district court dismissed the two suits. First, the district court dismissed the suit that gave rise to appeal No. 07-6191 \"without prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and also for lack of personal jurisdiction over defendant Moses.\u201d Second, the court dismissed Mr. Banks' other complaint in part with prejudice (for failure to state a claim) and in part without prejudice (for lack of personal jurisdiction over Dr. Partyka). The overarching question, then, is whether a mixed dismissal can constitute a strike under \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">\u201c[T]he entire purpose of \u00a7 1915(g) would be subverted if prisoners could skirt its procedural bar by appending\u201d defendants over whom the court lacks personal jurisdiction \u201cto a complaint otherwise subject to summary dismissal on the merits.\u201d <em>Pointer v. Wilkinson, </em>502 F.3d 369, 373 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Clemons v. Young, </em>240 F.Supp.2d 639, 642 (E.D.Mich.2003)) (rejecting argument that complaint dismissed in part without prejudice \u2014 for failure to exhaust claims \u2014 should not count as strike despite the fact that rump of complaint was dismissed with prejudice pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). While an action dismissed <em>\u201centirely </em>without prejudice\u201d is not a strike, <em>Pointer, </em>502 F.3d at 375, unless the \u201cdismissal is made because the action is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim\u201d <em>Day, </em>200 F.3d at 667, a prisoner may not frustrate the \"frequent filer\u201d provision by tacking on additional defendants to a complaint that is otherwise subject to dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-19\">Here, the suit underlying No. 07-6191 was dismissed entirely without prejudice, but was so dismissed under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), at least in part, because of Mr. Banks' failure to state a claim. Thus, <em>Day </em>controls and the dismissal counts as a strike. Meanwhile, <em>Pointer </em>compels the conclusion that Mr. Banks' second suit must also be deemed a strike. In the end, then, the presence of non-prejudicial dismissals here does not alter the \u00a7 1915(g) analysis.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
