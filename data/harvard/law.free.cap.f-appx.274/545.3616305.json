Bray appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to John E. Potter, the Postmaster General for Bray\u2019s employer, the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d). Bray brought this action against Potter for: (1) disability discrimination, in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 791 <em>et seq.; </em>and (2) retaliation for filing a discrimination complaint with the USPS Equal Employment Office (\u201cEEO\u201d), also in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-19\">Bray has worked as a rural route mail carrier for the Post Office in Park City, Montana since 1992. In 1998, Bray sustained back and neck injuries in an on-the-job automobile accident, but he was able to continue performing his work without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>physical limitation. In late 2002, Bray underwent elective surgery to alleviate symptoms of his back and neck injury. Bray\u2019s surgery was successful, but his doctor recommended Bray take a 5 minute break after every 30 minutes of work on a permanent basis. The USPS has always allowed Bray to take his doctor-recommended 5 minute breaks. In early 2003, while Bray was on medical leave, the USPS conducted a regularly scheduled \u201croute count,\u201d which establishes the amount of time postal delivery should take on a given rural route and which thereby sets the corresponding pay for that route \u2014 regardless how long it takes the carrier to deliver the route.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Bray challenges as discriminatory the 2003 route count because it fails to take into account the 5 minute breaks for every 30 minutes of work his doctor recommends for him (\u201cCount I\u201d). Bray also asserts his supervisor retaliated against him for filing an EEO complaint alleging the route count was discriminatory (\u201cCount II\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The district court granted Potter\u2019s motion for summary judgment on both of Bray\u2019s counts. As to Count I, the district court held the evidence does not establish a triable issue of fact as to whether Bray is disabled under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Bray failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination. As to Count II, the district court held Bray failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because he filed an untimely EEO retaliation complaint and then, when the EEO dismissed his complaint as untimely, filed an untimely notice of administrative appeal of the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>Schnidrig v. Columbia Mach., Inc., </em>80 F.3d 1406, 1408 (9th Cir.1996), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">The district court did not err by granting Potter summary judgment on Count I, because the evidence fails to create a triable issue of fact as to whether Bray was disabled. Bray cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act because he has not shown he is \u201cdisabled\u201d under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et. seq.; Allen v. Pac. Bell, </em>348 F.3d 1113, 1114 (9th Cir.2003). Specifically, the evidence does not create a triable issue of fact as to whether Bray is substantially limited in a major life activity. <em>See Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 195-97, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">The district court did not err by granting Potter summary judgment on Count II on the ground Bray failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Both of Bray\u2019s administrative filings relating to Count II \u2014 his formal EEO retaliation complaint and his appeal of the dismissal of his EEO complaint as untimely \u2014 were untimely. <em>Vinieratos v. United States, </em>939 F.2d 762, 770 (9th Cir.1991) (dismissing Rehabilitation Act claim because plaintiff did not satisfy \u201cwhat the Supreme Court has described as the \u2018rigorous administrative exhaustion requirements\u2019 of Title YII\u201d). Bray asserts for the first time on appeal that the time to file his administrative appeal should be calculated based on the later date he personally received the notice of his complaint\u2019s dismissal instead of the earlier date his attorney of record received the notice. This argument is waived be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>cause Bray failed to present it to the district court and the district court did not rule on it. <em>See In re E.R. Fegert, Inc., 887 </em>F.2d 955, 957 (9th Cir.1989). Further, the regulations governing administrative appeals to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission clearly state that when a complainant is represented by an attorney of record, the date the attorney receives notice begins the 30 day period for filing an administrative appeal. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.402(b). Bray did not file his notice of administrative appeal within 30 days after his attorney received notice of the EEO\u2019s dismissal of his untimely complaint. Thus, he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b572-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
