Johnson, </em>253 F.3d 706 (5th Cir.2001). In support of his argument, Johnson has submitted an affidavit averring that his counsel never informed him of the right to seek certiorari as well as a letter from appointed counsel Luanne Stark Thompson written after this court\u2019s decision in the direct appeal informing Johnson of the affir-mance and discussing the possibility of filing a \u00a7 2255 motion but making no mention of certiorari review.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-25\">Under this court\u2019s Plan for Representation on Appeal Under the Criminal Justice Act (the CJA Plan), \u201c[a]ppointed counsel must inform the client of the right ... to seek certiorari review in the Supreme Court.\u201d CJA Plan, \u00a7 6. This court has previously granted \u00a7 2255 relief on claims that appellate counsel failed to advise a defendant of his ability to seek certiorari <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>review from the Supreme Court. <em>See La-caze v. United States, </em>457 F.2d 1075, 1076 (5th Cir.1972); <em>Ordonez v. United States, </em>588 F.2d 448, 449 (5th Cir.1979). The Government argues that \u00a7 2255 relief is not appropriate because Johnson has not alleged a constitutional violation. However, we need not find a constitutional violation to grant the relief requested. <em>See Lacaze, </em>457 F.2d at 1078-79 (granting \u00a7 2255 relief on non-constitutional grounds). Because relief may be appropriate pursuant to <em>Lacaze, </em>and to afford Thompson an opportunity to contest Johnson\u2019s allegations, we order a LIMITED REMAND to the disfrict court for fact finding solely on the question of whether Thompson advised Johnson of his right to seek a writ of certiorari. Once the record is supplemented, the case shall be returned to this court for further proceedings. Pending the district court\u2019s compliance, this court retains jurisdiction of this case for all other purposes.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
