Jianbin Yang a.k.a. Yang Jianbin a.k.a. Yan Jin Bin, </em>No. A 74 153 665 (B.I.A. Sept. 10, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">When the BIA denies a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005). We may find an abuse of discretion where the BIA\u2019s \u201cdecision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or concluso-ry statements; that is to say, where the BIA has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">Here, the BIA accurately noted that it had dismissed Yang\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s August 1997 decision in July 2001, and that Yang did not file his motion to reopen until February 2007. Because Yang filed his motion well beyond the 90 day filing deadline, the BIA properly found that it was untimely. 8 C.F.R \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Nevertheless, the BIA abused its discretion in denying Yang\u2019s motion as timebarred because it failed to explain why his evidence was insufficient to demonstrate a change in country conditions in China. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">In support of his motion, Yang submitted an affidavit from his father, asserting that, in the past year, the family planning policy had been \u201cmore strictly implemented\u201d in the family\u2019s hometown in Fujian Province. By way of example, Yang\u2019s father provides the names of five different individuals who had been forcibly sterilized, as well as the dates of their procedures. Because Yang was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about whether he would face \u201cthe same punishment,\u201d Yang\u2019s father, reportedly upon Yang\u2019s request, \u201cconsulted\u201d with village officials. He states that the officials told him that they had already been informed that Yang had two U.S. born children and that because he did not have legal status in the United States, he was required to be sterilized once he returned to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">Given that the BIA found that the \u201csworn statement\u201d of Yang\u2019s father \u201cindicates that [Yang] will be forced to report for sterilization upon his return to China,\u201d it was obliged to provide more than a \u201cconclusory statement\u201d as to why the letter from Yang\u2019s father did not constitute \u201cevidence\u201d of changed country conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>in China. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 275 (2d Cir.2006) (emphasizing that the BIA should provide more than \u201ccursory, summary or conclusory statements,\u201d to enable the Court to discern its reasons for declining to afford relief to a petitioner)(internal quotation marks omitted). More reasoned consideration was particularly warranted, where the letter, if credited, was consistent with the response issued by the National Population and Family Planning Committee in 2006, indicating that Chinese citizens who had children abroad were subject to the family planning laws of China.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The letter from Yang\u2019s father was also relevant to the BIA\u2019s finding that Yang had not submitted sufficient evidence to show that persons in his situation were normally subjected to sanctions that would amount to persecution. The BIA noted that Yang could be subject to fines or other economic penalties upon his return, but did not mention, as it did in its changed country conditions discussion, that the letter from his father indicated the possibility of forced sterilization upon his return to China. As such, the BIA\u2019s denial of Yang\u2019s motion was an abuse of discretion. We therefore do not reach the BIA\u2019s findings concerning whether Yang was entitled to file a successive asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the decision of the BIA is VACATED, and the case REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is GRANTED, pending the issuance of a new decision by the BIA. The pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
