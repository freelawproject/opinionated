Hood, Senior U.S. District Judge for Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b582-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-20\">Nina Crytser appeals the district court\u2019s order: (1) dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction her action seeking damages for \u201cwrongful levy\u201d; and (2) dismissing for failure to state a claim her action seeking a refund from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) of her payment of taxes her husband owed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-21\">Nina Crytser brought this action against the United States alleging two alternative grounds for relief. She brought an action for wrongful levy under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(a)(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming the IRS <em>lien </em>on the Crytsers\u2019 residence amounted to a seizure of her property because the payment Nina Crytser made to the IRS to obtain discharge of the lien was \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d She also claimed damages in the alternative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1846(a)(1),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which in combination with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(a)(4)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> authorizes a third party who paid the taxes of another to obtain discharge of a lien to bring an action for refund on the ground the third party had an interest in the property the IRS placed a lien upon that was superior to the United States\u2019 interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The district court dismissed Nina Cryt-ser\u2019s wrongful levy action under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground her complaint alleged a <em>lien, </em>not a <em>levy; </em>without a levy, there can be no wrongful levy action. The district court dismissed Nina Crytser\u2019s third-party refund action under Rule 12(b)(6) on the ground she failed to exhaust her remedies \u2014 Nina Crytser was required, under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(a)(4), to request and obtain a certif\u00edcate of discharge of the lien before bringing a refund action, but she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">On appeal, Nina Crytser challenges only the district court\u2019s dismissal of her 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(a)(1) wrongful levy action; she maintains the IRS lien against her husband\u2019s property was \u201cthe functional equivalent\u201d of a levy because she felt she had no choice but to turn over to the IRS the proceeds of the sale of their residence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">Substitution of value. \u2014 If a certificate of discharge is issued to any person under section 6325(b)(4) with respect to any property, such person may, within 120 days after the day on which such certificate is issued, bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States for a determination of whether the value of the interest of the United States (if any) in such property is less than the value determined by the Secretary. No other action may be brought by such person for such a determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss de novo, <em>Silvers v. Sony Pictures Entm\u2019t, Inc., </em>402 F.3d 881, 883 (9th Cir.2005), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">The district court correctly dismissed Nina Crytser\u2019s wrongful levy action, the elements of which are as follows: First, the person must not be one \u201cagainst whom is assessed the tax.\u201d Second, the person must claim a legally cognizable \u201cinterest\u201d in the property. Third, the property must have been \u201cwrongfully levied upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\"><em>Arford v. United States, </em>934 F.2d 229, 231 (9th Cir.1991). Nina Crytser\u2019s complaint alleged only that the IRS placed a lien (not a levy) on the Crytsers\u2019 residence. That Nina Crytser \u201cfelt compelled\u201d to pay Scott Crytser\u2019s assessed taxes with the proceeds of the sale of their residence to obtain discharge of the lien and avoid a civil action by the purchaser for breach of contract does not convert the IRS lien into a levy. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>514 U.S. 527, 536, 115 S.Ct. 1611, 131 L.Ed.2d 608 (1995) (third party taxpayer who felt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>compelled to pay her ex-husband\u2019s taxes to obtain release of an IRS lien on her residence alleged only a lien \u2014 not a levy). Because Nina Crytser failed to allege an essential element of a wrongful levy ac<em>tion </em>\u2014 i.e., a levy \u2014 she failed to state a claim for wrongful levy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b582-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
