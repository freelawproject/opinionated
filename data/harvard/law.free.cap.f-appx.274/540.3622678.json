In conducting our review, we accept the allegations in the dismissed complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to Appellants. <em>In re Daou Systems, Inc. Secs. Litig., </em>411 F.3d 1006, 1013 (9th Cir.2005). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-20\">As a preliminary matter, we address Appellees\u2019 motion to strike Appellants\u2019 opening brief and Appellants\u2019 request for judicial notice. The motion to strike is granted as follows: all documents in the Addendum to Appellants\u2019 opening brief are stricken except the district court\u2019s order in <em>In re BioLase Tech. Sec. Litig., </em>No. 04-947 DOC (C.D.Cal. Jan. 27, 2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(a); <em>Kirshner v. Uniden Corp. of Am., </em>842 F.2d 1074, 1077 (9th Cir.1988). In all other respects, Appellees\u2019 motion to strike is denied. As to the <em>BioLase </em>order, we grant Appellants\u2019 request to take judicial notice. Fed.R.Evid. 201. Appellants\u2019 request for judicial notice as to all other extra-record materials is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-21\">Fraud is not an essential element of the claims raised in the Complaint, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Complaint neither specifically alleges fraud, nor does it allege facts that <em>necessarily </em>constitute fraud. <em>See Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, </em>317 F.3d 1097, 1104-05 (9th Cir.2003). Section 11 does not require a plaintiff to allege or prove fraud, but even if fraud is not an essential element of such a claim, \u201cthe particularity requirements of Rule 9(b) [of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] apply to claims brought under Section 11 when ... they are grounded in fraud.\u201d <em>In re Stac Electronics Secs. Litig., </em>89 F.3d 1399, 1404-05 (9th Cir.1996). <em>See also In re Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1027. Where the allegations in a complaint do not use the word \u201cfraud\u201d to describe a defendant\u2019s actions, a complaint \u201csounds in fraud\u201d or is \u201cgrounded in fraud\u201d and Rule 9(b) nonetheless applies whenever a complaint relies entirely on a \u201cunified course of fraudulent conduct.\u201d <em>Vess, </em>317 F.3d at 1105-06, 1108. <em>See also In re Stac, </em>89 F.3d at 1404-05. A complaint containing allegations that \u201cneither mention[ ] the word \u201cfraud,\u201d nor allege[ ] facts that would necessarily constitute fraud\u201d does not allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct. <em>Vess, </em>317 F.3d at 1105-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Here, the Complaint does not rely upon a unified course of fraudulent conduct. Indeed, Appellants do not allege a claim under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act \u2014 a claim that would require them to allege fraud. Nor do they allege facts in the complaint that necessarily constitute fraud. Accordingly, the allegations in the Complaint do not \u201csound in fraud,\u201d and we conclude that the Complaint is not properly subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b). <em>See Vess, </em>317 F.3d at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Because we reverse and remand on this basis, we do not reach Appellants\u2019 additional argument that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the Complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b566-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-17\">. Appellees\u2019 request for monetary sanctions is denied. We note that at oral argument, counsel for Appellants acknowledged that the inclusion of documents in the Addendum that were not properly before the district court violates Rule 10(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and represented that such conduct would not recur. We have no reason to believe that counsel will not abide by his representations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b567-9\">RYMER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AFes\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">I would affirm for the reasons stated by Judge Breyer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
