At that time, Lewis had committed two prior drug felonies. As a result, his crimes yielded a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment on the conspiracy charge and of five years (to be served consecutively) on the firearm-possession charge. His sentence also included ten years on supervised release, a fine of $25,000 (the bottom of the federal Sentencing Guidelines range), and a special assessment of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">On appeal, Lewis contends that his sentence was \u201charsh and excessive.\u201d We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and review for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 218 (3d Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">Lewis makes two arguments. First, he argues that the District Court failed to consider the relevant sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This argument fails because the District Court had no discretion to diverge from the statutory minimum sentences that applied. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i). Second, Lewis claims that mandatory m\u00ednimums themselves are unconstitutional because they limit trial courts\u2019 discretion. In <em>Harris v. United States, </em>however, the Supreme Court rejected that very theory. 536 U.S. 545, 567, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) (\u201cWithin the range authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict, however, the political system may channel judicial discretion ... by requiring defendants to serve minimum terms after judges make certain factual findings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">For these reasons, we affirm the sentence imposed by the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
