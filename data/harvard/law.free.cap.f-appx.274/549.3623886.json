We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">SFPP\u2019s allegations that Union Pacific violated the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 60101-60137, and the Constitution are not frivolous; we have subject matter jurisdiction. See <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 682-83, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946). SFPP\u2019s fourth claim alleging that Union Pacific\u2019s demand is an unconstitutional taking is ripe \u201c[t]o the extent that [SFPP] argues that [Union Pacific\u2019s demand] is a facial taking because it is not sufficiently related to legitimate state interests.\u201d <em>San Remo Hotel v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>145 F.3d 1095, 1102 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">However, SFPP fails to state any claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). In order to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, sufficient facts must be pleaded \u201cto state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). We construe SFPP\u2019s complaint in the light most favorable to it, but are not \u201crequired to accept legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations if those conclusions cannot reasonably be drawn from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Clegg v. Cult Awareness Network, </em>18 F.3d 752, 754-55 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">SFPP\u2019s claims under the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act and the Constitution require state action. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 60121(a); <em>Single Moms, Inc. v. Mont. Power Co., </em>331 F.3d 743, 746-47 (9th Cir.2003). SFPP does not sufficiently plead that Union Pacific is performing a function that is \u201ctraditionally and exclusively\u201d a public function. <em>Lee v. Katz, </em>276 F.3d 550, 554 -555 (9th Cir.2002). Although SFPP alleged that the railroad is a state actor, that allegation is a legal conclusion that we need not, and do not, accept. <em>See Clegg, </em>18 F.3d at 754-55. SFPP\u2019s factual allegations, even when taken as true, do not support the conclusion that Union Pacific is acting as a state actor by demanding compliance with a private agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-16\">SFPP argued at oral argument that it had sufficiently alleged violations of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act not dependent upon state action. However, that argument is not fairly raised in its opening brief; rather, SFPP argued only that it had sufficiently plead that Union Pacific\u2019s attempt to require compliance with AREMA standards was \u201cregulating\u201d by a state actor. <em>See Greenwood v. FAA, </em>28 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cWe re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>view only issues which are argued specifically and distinctly in a party\u2019s opening brief.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In addition, SFPP\u2019s claims under the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act fail because SFPP did not provide the requisite notice 60 days before filing its original complaint. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 60121(a)(1)(A); <em>Hallstrom v. Tillamook County, </em>493 U.S. 20, 25-33, 110 S.Ct. 304, 107 L.Ed.2d 237 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b576-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
