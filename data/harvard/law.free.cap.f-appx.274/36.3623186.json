Aug. 21, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-20\">Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), a motion to reopen \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, there is no dispute that Uddin\u2019s July 2007 motion to reopen was untimely where the BIA issued its decision dismissing his appeal from the IJ\u2019s order of removal in October 2001. However, Uddin challenges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the BIA\u2019s decision not to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen his proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review a decision of the BIA regarding whether to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen a case under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.2(a). <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006). In an effort to create jurisdiction, Uddin argues that the BIA violated his due process rights by-denying his motion to reopen as untimely because an unopposed motion, as described in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(g)(3), is analogous to a jointly filed motion to reopen, as described in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(iii), to which the time and numerical limitations do not apply. Uddin\u2019s argument is an unsuccessful attempt to \u201ccreate [ ] jurisdiction ... simply by cloaking an abuse of discretion argument in constitutional garb.\u201d <em>Saloum v. USCIS, </em>437 F.3d 238, 243 (2d Cir.2006). Indeed, Uddin has failed to submit any argument that the BIA deprived him of due process by failing to provide him with a full and fail\u2019 opportunity to present his claims. <em>Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 104-05 (2d Cir.2006) (citations omitted). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision. <em>Saloum, </em>437 F.3d at 243-44.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b62-22\">. Where, as here, an alien files a timely petition for review from the denial of a motion, but not from the underlying removal order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the Court may review only the denial of the motion. <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 89-90.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b63-9\">. Even if we maintained jurisdiction over the instant petition, we would find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s decision. We find that there is a clear difference between an unopposed motion and a motion that is \"[ajgreed upon by all parties and jointly filed.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(iii); <em>see Forest Watch v. U.S. Forest Service, </em>410 F.3d 115, 117 (2d Cir.2005) (providing that \u201d[t]he plain meaning of language in a regulation governs unless that meaning would lead to absurd results\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
