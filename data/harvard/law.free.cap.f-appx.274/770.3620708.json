Upon entry into this country, he was immediately detained, but was paroled until his removal proceeding could take place. Before his removal hearing, he married a United States citizen, who filed a family-based visa petition on his behalf. Duque-Suarez moved to continue his removal hearing to allow United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to review the visa petition. The IJ denied that motion and also denied his application for asylum. Duque-Suarez appealed to the BIA, which dismissed the appeal and denied his motions for remand and reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">Duque-Suarez first contends that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination on the ground that the evidence in the record compelled a finding that his testimony was credible, and that it was sufficient to support a finding of past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s reasoning, although it did rely on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Accordingly, we will review the BIA\u2019s decision, but also will review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">\u201cTo the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, [our] review is <em>de novo.\u201d D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decisions that are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (internal quotation marks omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow \u201cre-weigh[ing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo reverse the ... fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-15\">An alien may receive asylum if he can carry the burden of proving that he is a \u201crefugee,\u201d which is defined as \u201cany person who is outside any country of such per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>son\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail [himself] ... of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)). \u201cA showing of past persecution creates a presumption of a \u2018well-founded fear,\u2019 subject to rebuttal by the [government].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231. If an alien does not establish past persecution, he bears the burden of showing that it is more likely than not that he will suffer persecution on the basis of a protected ground, and he would not be able to avoid persecution by relocating to another part of his country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Withholding of removal may be granted if the alien establishes that, if returned to his country, his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). Where a claimant fails to establish eligibility for asylum, which carries a lower burden of proof than for withholding of removal, he likewise fails to establish eligibility for this other form of relief. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">We have held that the IJ must \u201cdetermine credibility, and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Yang v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, we will defer to the IJ\u2019s credibility finding as we would to any factfinding, unless the evidence compels us to do otherwise. <em>Id. </em>Credible testimony of the applicant \u201cmay be sufficient to sustain the applicant\u2019s burden without corroboration.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818-19. \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. Because applicants have the burden to establish eligibility for asylum, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support an IJ\u2019s decision to deny an application for asylum, particularly where there is no other evidence of persecution. <em>Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). Once the IJ makes an adverse credibility determination, the burden shifts to the applicant to show that the determination was \u201cnot supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Chen v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Here, the IJ made an adverse credibility determination based on omissions and inconsistencies in Duque-Suarez\u2019s testimony. Specifically, the IJ noted that there were significant omissions from the initial sworn statement Duque-Suarez gave upon entry into the United States. The IJ also found that his inability to remember the full name of a friend he claims was murdered by Colombian guerillas cast doubt on his credibility. On the basis of that adverse credibility determination, the BIA properly concluded that the IJ\u2019s determination was not clearly erroneous, and that Du-que-Suarez did not establish his eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">Duque also contends that, although the BIA and IJ may have lacked jurisdiction over his adjustment application stemming from his marriage to an American citizen, the BIA still had jurisdiction to grant his motion for remand or to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>the case until the USCIS acted on his adjustment application.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of Duque-Suarez\u2019s motion for remand under these circumstances only for an abuse of discretion. <em>See generally Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1301 (stating that where a motion to remand seeks to reopen proceedings we review the BIA\u2019s disposition of that motion for an abuse of discretion); <em>Bull v. INS, </em>790 F.2d 869, 869 (11th Cir.1986) (noting that we review the BIA\u2019s decision to grant a continuance for an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Under the rule which was in effect when Duque-Suarez\u2019s motion to remand was being considered, the USCIS had exclusive jurisdiction over all adjustment of status applications for arriving aliens in removal proceedings, with one narrow exception that is not relevant to this appeal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1) (2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Duque-Suarez\u2019s motion to remand clearly requested that the BIA reopen his case and remand it to the IJ so that he could have the \u201copportunity to apply\u201d for an adjustment of status before the IJ. The BIA correctly determined that Duque-Suarez was not eligible to apply for adjustment of status in removal proceedings because the USCIS had exclusive jurisdiction over adjustment applications filed by arriving aliens. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1) (2003). Accordingly, the appropriate course of action for Duque-Suarez was to file an application for adjustment of status with the USCIS, which he already had done, and wait for this application to be adjudicated, independent of his removal proceedings. Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">Duque-Suarez\u2019s final contention is that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of that motion only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1340-41 (11th Cir.2003). The BIA did not abuse its discretion because Duque-Suarez did not specify any errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s previous order, and he attempted to raise issues that could have, and should have, been raised in his initial motion to remand. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C) (\u201cThe motion [for reconsideration] shall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d). It was not an abuse of discretion for the BIA to reject arguments raised for the first time in a motion for reconsideration where those arguments could have been raised earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">PETITIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\">. On May 12, 2006, regulations that prohibited arriving aliens in removal proceedings from adjusting status were deleted, and an interim rule clarified the eligibility of arriving aliens to have their adjustment applications considered while in removal proceedings. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1) (2003); <em>cf. </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1) (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
