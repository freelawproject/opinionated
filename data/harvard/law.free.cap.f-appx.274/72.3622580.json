Klodzinski appeals from an order, entered by the district court on March 7, 2007, granting the Social Security Commissioner\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and denying Klodzinski\u2019s motion for same. Klodzinski\u2019s civil action challenges the July 21, 2005 decision of Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) Charles R. Center that he is not entitled to disability benefits or supplemental security income under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423,1381a. We assume the parties\u2019 and counsel\u2019s familiari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ty with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case, and with the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Klodzinski\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that the ALJ violated the so-called \u201ctreating physician rule,\u201d now codified at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2) and 416.927(d)(2). The medical opinion of the physician engaged in the primary treatment of the claimant is given \u201ccontrolling weight\u201d if it is \u201cwell-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] case record.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Greeny-Youn-ger v. Barnhart, </em>335 F.3d 99, 106 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Rosa v. Callahan, </em>168 F.3d 72, 78-79 (2d Cir.1999). Conversely, \u201c[w]hen other substantial evidence in the record conflicts with the treating physician\u2019s opinion, ... that opinion will not be deemed controlling.\u201d <em>Snell v. Apfel, </em>177 F.3d 128, 133 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Here, Klodzinski\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Stephen Serivani, opined that Klodzin-ski could stand or walk for less than two hours per day and could sit for less than six hours per day. The ALJ found, however, that Klodzinski could stand or walk for two hours per day and could sit for six hours per day. Klodzinski argues that the ALJ violated the \u201ctreating physician rule\u201d by improperly substituting his own judgment for Dr. Serivani\u2019s competent medical opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">We are not persuaded. Because the ALJ did not explicitly acknowledge the \u201ctreating physician rule\u201d or declare why Dr. Scrivani\u2019s opinions were not entitled to controlling weight, we have conducted \u201ca searching review of the record to assure [that Klodzinski] received the rule\u2019s procedural advantages.\u201d <em>Halloran v. Barnhart, </em>362 F.3d 28, 32 (2d Cir.2004) (per curiam). The record reflects that Dr. Scrivani\u2019s opinion was not well-supported by clinical findings and was contradicted by substantial evidence in the record. We therefore conclude that \u201cthe substance of the treating physician rule was not traversed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The Social Security Administration\u2019s regulations codifying the treating physician rule provide, in part: \u201cThe more a medical source presents relevant evidence to support an opinion, particularly medical signs and laboratory findings, the more weight we will give that opinion. The better an explanation a source provides for an opinion, the more weight we will give that opinion.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(3), 416.927(d)(3). Dr. Scri-vani\u2019s report was prepared on a standardized multiple-choice form issued by the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance which we have previously criticized as \u201conly marginally useful.\u201d <em>Halloran, </em>362 F.3d at 31 n. 2. Dr. Serivani simply checked a box indicating that Klod-zinski\u2019s ability to stand or walk was limited to less than two hours per day and another box indicating that Klodzinski\u2019s ability to sit was limited to less than six hours per day. Although the form indicated that these were medical opinions \u201c[b]ased on the medical findings provided in [the] report,\u201d the remainder of Dr. Scrivani\u2019s report contained few details regarding the severity of Klodzinski\u2019s medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">The Social Security Administration\u2019s regulations also state: \u201cGenerally, the more consistent an opinion is with the record as a whole, the more weight we will give to that opinion.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(4), 416.927(d)(4). According to Klodzinski\u2019s own testimony at the administrative hearing, he could sit for up to 45 minutes until he would have trouble standing up, and he could walk to a nearby store which was up to 15 minutes away. It would be reasonable to infer from this testimony that Klodzinski could sit for up to six hours total, and stand or walk for up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>to two hours total, in any eight-hour work day, \u201cif given several breaks or allowed to change position often.\u201d <em>Halloran, </em>362 F.3d at 32 (internal quotation marks omitted). In light of the fact that Dr. Scriva-ni\u2019s report made no reference to the possibility of Klodzinski shifting positions throughout the day, Klodzinski\u2019s own testimony may be given more weight than Dr. Scrivani\u2019s check marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Although the ALJ should have explicitly announced in his written opinion that he was rejecting Dr. Scrivani\u2019s opinion and explained the reasons for doing so, we are confident that the ALJ considered and rejected it for reasons that are appropriate under the regulations and evident from the record and the ALJ\u2019s findings. The ALJ found that the \u201creported medical findings have been unremarkable\u201d \u2014 an accurate description of Dr. Scrivani\u2019s report which indicates that Dr. Scrivani\u2019s opinion was not well-supported by his clinical findings. The ALJ also found that Klodzinski could sit for six hours and stand or walk for two hours so long as he could alternate positions every half hour \u2014 an implicit finding that Dr. Scrivani\u2019s opinion was not consistent with the testimony of Klodzinski himself and the record as a whole. We therefore \u201cconclude that the ALJ applied the substance of the treating physician rule.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
