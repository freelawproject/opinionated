The district court dismissed the \u00a7 107 contribution claim and directed the entry of a separate judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Rialto\u2019s \u00a7 107 claim. Both Rialto and Goodrich filed timely notices of appeal from the separate judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">1. Goodrich\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">' The defendants contend that we do not have jui\u2019isdiction over Goodrich\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Although Goodrich\u2019s complaint included a \u00a7 107 contribution claim that was substantially similar to Rialto\u2019s Claim Two, the district court did not rule on Goodrich\u2019s claim. The district court\u2019s Rule 54(b) order directing entry of a separate judgment applies only to the order dismissing Rialto\u2019s Claim Two. Thus, there is no separate, final judgment regarding Goodrich\u2019s action. We accordingly dismiss Goodrich\u2019s appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">2. Rialto\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">The district court dismissed Claim Two of Rialto\u2019s Third Amended Complaint, which sought contribution under CERCLA \u00a7 107, but the court did not address Claim One, which sought recovery of response costs pursuant to CERCLA \u00a7 107. On appeal, Rialto abandoned its claim for an <em>implied </em>right of contribution under \u00a7 107. We have jurisdiction over Rialto\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">The district court relied on <em>Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., </em>543 U.S. 157, 125 S.Ct. 577, 160 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004). Subsequent to the district court\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Atlantic Research Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2331, 168 L.Ed.2d 28 (2007). The Court examined the structure of \u00a7 107(a)(4) and concluded that \u201cthe plain language ... authorizes cost-recovery actions by any private party, including PRPs.\u201d Id. at 2336.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-17\">The Court explained that CERCLA \u00a7 113(f) grants an explicit right to contribution to PRPs and that \u00a7 107(a), by contrast, \u201cpermits recovery of cleanup costs but does not create a right to contribution. ... Accordingly, the remedies available in \u00a7\u00a7 107(a) and 113(f) complement each other by providing causes of action \u2018to persons in different procedural circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2338 (quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. UGI Utils., Inc., </em>423 F.3d 90, 99 (2d Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2995, 168 L.Ed.2d 702 (2007)). Under <em>Atlantic Research, </em>therefore, a PRP has the right to bring a cost-recovery action under \u00a7 107(a), but may not bring a claim for contribution under \u00a7 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-20\">Pursuant to <em>Atlantic Research, </em>we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Rial-to\u2019s claim for contribution under \u00a7 107. Rialto\u2019s cost recovery claim in Claim One, however, remains viable. Further, Rialto need not establish that it is not a PRP in order to pursue its cost recovery claim. The judgment of the district court is affirmed and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-21\">In No. 05-56694, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-22\">In No. 05-56749, AFFIRMED and REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-23\">In both appeals, each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b542-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\">. Because the parties are familiar with the complicated factual and procedural background, we do not recite it here, except as necessary to aid in understanding this disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-13\">. These appeals were consolidated for oral argument with <em>Kotrous v. Goss-Jewett Co., </em>No. 06-15162, and <em>Adobe Lumber, Inc. v. Hellman, </em>No. 06-16019, which are disposed of by a separate opinion, filed concurrently with this memorandum disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
