EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b694-24\">Plaintiff Chauncey Gruenwald, a Kansas state prisoner proceeding pro se, challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>section 1988 civil rights complaint. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">This case arises out of events that occurred on August 27, 2006, at the El Dora-do Correctional Facility (EDCF). The precursor to these events was a \u201ccondition 30\u201d that was called against Gruenwald for misuse of state property. As part of the condition 30, Defendant Patrick Mansfield, a correctional officer at EDCF, responded to Gruenwald\u2019s cell. Upon Mansfield\u2019s arrival Gruenwald asserted to Mansfield that he was willing to cooperate and be restrained in order to facilitate his pending removal from the cell. Mansfield neither acknowledged nor responded to Gruen-wald\u2019s gesture.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Thereafter, Defendants Leonard Maddox and Jason Myers, also correctional officers at EDCF, arrived at Gruenwald\u2019s cell. Gruenwald again stated to these officers a willingness to be restrained, or \u201ceuff[ed] up.\u201d At some point, however, Gruenwald placed a pillow in the food slot of his cell\u2019s door. Gruenwald did this in an effort to prevent the officers from spraying mace through the food slot and into his cell. Despite Gruenwald\u2019s continued willingness to be cuffed up, Maddox and Myers engaged in an effort to remove the pillow from the food slot. Eventually, it is alleged, Gruenwald aided the efforts to clear the food slot, and mace was sprayed into his cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">As mace filled his cell, Gruenwald\u2019s eyes began to burn and his breathing became strained. Maddox chided Gruenwald, asserting \u201cit burns, don\u2019t it?\u201d After the introduction of the mace, the officers eventually cuffed Gruenwald on Mansfield\u2019s command and escorted him to a shower for detox. While in the shower, Maddox \u201cslammed [Gruenwald\u2019s] head into the wall and placed one arm around his neck.\u201d Thereafter, \u201cwith his right hand [Maddox] pulled [Gruenwald\u2019s] forehead back and proceeded to grab [Gruenwald\u2019s] throat with his left hand forcing his face under the running shower water.\u201d Gruenwald yelled that Maddox was choking him and that he was not attempting to resist. However, \u201chis cry for help was low and to[o] faint\u201d so he attempted to defend himself by \u201cside stepping]\u201d Maddox. This maneuver caused the pair to tumble to the ground, at which time Gruenwald again let out cries that he was being choked despite the fact that he was not resisting.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">Subsequently, Defendant Roland Buchanan, another correctional officer at EDCF, entered the scene and stated that everyone needed to relax. Buchanan helped Gruenwald and Maddox to their feet and informed Gruenwald that shackles would be placed around his legs. Without incident, Gruenwald complied with this demand and was again placed under the shower. While Gruenwald was under the shower this second time, Maddox again pressed Gruenwald\u2019s head against the wall, which along with the down pouring water, prevented Gruenwald from breathing. Gruenwald responded by attempting to force his body to the floor. Despite these efforts, Gruenwald was placed on his feet and again forced into the shower as Maddox gouged his left eye and forced his head under the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">The detox being complete, Gruenwald was carried upstairs to a cell and placed on the floor. While being held by Myers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Gruenwald\u2019s hands were cuffed behind his back and he was laid out on his stomach. Abuse ensued. As Buchanan held Gruen-wald\u2019s face to the floor, Maddox began beating Gruenwald\u2019s back with closed fists. Maddox\u2019s blows grew harder and harder. Gruenwald yelled that he was not resisting and requested that Maddox stop. Maddox ignored Gruenwald\u2019s pleas and continued to pummel Gruenwald\u2019s back. Eventually the officers exited the cell, with Myers warning Gruenwald that if he moved, \u201cwe\u2019ll do this again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">After the officers exited, Gruenwald was ordered to the cell\u2019s door in order to have his cuffs removed. \u201c[Gruenwald] refused, stating he wanted to see the lieutenant or captain to show [them] what was done to his body and that he wanted pictures taken of him as evidence.\u201d Upon this request, Buchanan, Maddox, and Myers again entered Gruenwald\u2019s cell and placed him on the floor. The trio then discussed how they would remove Gruenwald\u2019s cuffs and exit the cell. Evidently some plan was concocted and one of the defendants grabbed Gruenwald\u2019s legs and pulled him towards the door. Gruenwald resisted, asserting \u201cyou can beat me all night but I will have photos taken to show what you have done to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">It is alleged that officers proceeded to beat him. While Myers held down Gruen-wald\u2019s body and Buchanan held down Gru-enwald\u2019s face, someone struck Gruenwald two times on the right side of his head. Thereafter, Gruenwald was pulled towards the door as Maddox twisted his left ankle. Gruenwald yelled, \u201che\u2019s trying to break my foot, he\u2019s trying to break my foot, he\u2019s hurting me.\u201d In response to Gruenwald\u2019s screams, Buchanan responded that the perpetrator of the foot incident had exited the cell. Buchanan further remarked that he was now the only officer holding Gruen-wald down and that he was going to remove the cuffs. Buchanan did so and leaped from the cell slamming the door shut.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Unhappy with the abuse he sustained and the resulting injuries he suffered,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gruenwald filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas on December 8, 2006. Gruenwald subsequently amended his complaint on April 12, 2007. In his amended complaint, Gruenwald asserted causes of action against Buchanan, Maddox, and Myers in both their individual and official capacities, for violating his Eighth Amendment rights by \u201cmaliciously and sadistically\u201d using physical force against him. Gruenwald asserted a similar cause of action against Mansfield, in both his individual and official capacities, for failure to intervene. In addition to his Eighth Amendment claims, Gruenwald asserted assault and battery claims arising under Kansas law against Buchanan, Maddox, and Myers. Finally, Gruenwald also named as Defendants Roger Werholtz (Kansas Secretary of Corrections), Ray Roberts (Warden of EDCR), and William Cummings (Kansas Secretary of Corrections Designee), in both their individual and official capacities, asserting that their actions constituted deliberate indifference and resulted in the abuse that Gruenwald sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">Defendants Buchanan, Maddox, and Myers filed a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Gruenwald\u2019s complaint against them on the basis of qualified immunity. The district court granted this motion. According to the court, Gruenwald\u2019s allegations against Buchanan, Maddox, and Myers, even if assumed to be true, did not amount to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>violation of the Eighth Amendment. In this regard, the district court concluded that Gruenwald alleged \u201cno facts sufficient to show that Maddox, Myers, and Buchanan\u2019s use of force [against him] was either \u201cwanton and unnecessary\u2019 or that these defendants acted maliciously and sadistically.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Similarly, Gruenwald\u2019s claims against Defendants Mansfield, Roberts, Cummings, and Werholtz were dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In relation to Mansfield (who was charged with the failure to intervene), the district court reasoned that given its conclusion that Buchanan, Maddox, and Myers did not violate Gruenwald\u2019s Eighth Amendment rights, it necessarily followed that neither did Mansfield. As for Roberts, Cummings, and Werholtz, the district court similarly dismissed Gruenwald\u2019s claims against these Defendants, asserting that Gruenwald did not allege that these individuals were personally involved in the events, and under section 1983, they could not be held responsible under a theory of respondeat superior.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Gruenwald now appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On appeal, Gruenwald\u2019s brief may be fairly construed to assert a claim that the district court erred in dismissing his various causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">This court reviews de novo a decision to dismiss for failure to state a claim. \u201cDismissal of a pro se complaint ... is proper only where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the facts he has alleged and it would be futile to give him an opportunity to amend.\u201d <em>Gaines v. Sten-seng, </em>292 F.3d 1222, 1224 (10th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). In addition to construing a pro se complaint liberally, this court \u201cmust accept the allegations of the complaint as true and construe those allegations, and any reasonable inferences that might be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">A. Eighth Amendment Claims Against Buchanan, Maddox, and Myers</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">On the basis of qualified immunity, the district court granted Buchanan, Maddox, and Myers\u2019 motion to dismiss Gruenwald\u2019s claims against them in their individual capacities. \u201cOur analysis of qualified immunity involves two steps. The threshold inquiry is whether the alleged facts (or, on summary judgment, the evidenced facts) taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff show a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Simkins v. Bruce, </em>406 F.3d 1239, 1241 (10th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001)). \u201cIf no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established, there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. \u201cOn the other hand, if a viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>tion could be made out on a favorable view of the parties\u2019 submissions, the next, sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The use of excessive force by a correctional officer violates a prisoner\u2019s rights under the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause when the prisoner is subjected to an \u201cunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\u201d <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 319, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986); <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 173, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976). \u201c[Wjhenever prison officials stand accused of using excessive physical force in violation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, the core judicial inquiry is that set out in <em>Whitley: </em>whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6-7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). Under this approach,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">the extent of injury suffered by an inmate is one factor that may suggest whether the use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary in a particular situation, or instead evinced such wantonness with respect to the unjustified infliction of harm as is tantamount to a knowing willingness that it occur. In determining whether the use of force was wanton and unnecessary, it may also be proper to evaluate the need for application of force, the relationship between that need and the amount of force used, the threat reasonably perceived by the responsible officials, and any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response. The absence of serious injury is therefore relevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry, but does not end it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 7, 112 S.Ct. 995 (quotations, citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">With this standard in mind, our review of the complaint indicates that Gruenwald sufficiently alleged that Buchanan, Maddox, and Myers committed an Eighth Amendment violation, and that the district court failed to take Gruenwald\u2019s well-pleaded allegations as true or to construe them in the light most favorable to Gruenwald.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Throughout Gruenwald\u2019s complaint, Gruenwald alleges the various attacks upon him were unnecessary due to his stated willingness to cooperate and be restrained., At one point, Gruenwald alleges that Maddox stated, of the mace, \u201cit burns, don\u2019t it?\u201d Given Gruenwald\u2019s apparent cooperativeness at the time of this incident, Gruenwald\u2019s complaint suggests there was no need for the mace incident to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">True, at other times during the events, it appears by Gruenwald\u2019s own admissions that he resisted the officers\u2019 actions. However, it is equally true that at other times, Gruenwald alleges that he displayed no resistance whatsoever yet was mercilessly beaten. Indeed, it appears the most savage attack of the overall event occurred when Gruenwald was returned to a cell, held to the floor by Buchanan, and then repeatedly pummeled in the back by Maddox, all the while screaming that he was not resisting. At this time, the officers could not have reasonably perceived that Gruenwald, who was handcuffed and held to the floor, was any threat to them. Based on the allegations in Gruenwald\u2019s complaint, there simply does not appear to have been any rhyme or reason for this particular attack, aside from a malicious and sadistic purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">The district court appeared to place great weight on the fact that Gruenwald failed to allege that he suffered a signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>cant injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the court appeared to believe that the force used against Gruenwald was de minimis, and therefore could not amount to an Eighth Amendment violation. However, the injuries suffered by Gruenwald cannot be sufficiently distinguished from injuries that the Supreme Court specifically asserted were <em>not </em>de minimis in <em>Hudson: </em>\u201cbruises, swelling, loosened teeth, and a cracked dental plate.\u201d 503 U.S. at 10, 112 S.Ct. 995. In this regard, in addition to stating in his complaint that he suffered \u201csignificant injuries\u201d that resulted in \u201cchronic pain,\u201d Gruenwald attached to the complaint a statement from another correctional officer in which the officer indicated that Gruenwald suffered noticeable injuries on his back, throat, left eye, forehead, and both ears. Also attached was a signed affidavit from a fellow inmate indicating that after the incident, he observed Gruen-wald with \u201cblack eyes, swelling, bruises on his back and the area behind his ribs ..., cuts on his upper and mid back, marks on his wrists where the cuffs dug in and broke the skin, and ... severe redness covering the greater portion of his body.\u201d It cannot be gainsaid that such a compilation of injuries is <em>not </em>de minimis. With all of this in mind, we conclude that Gruen-wald\u2019s complaint sufficiently states a claim that he was subjected to an \u201cunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\u201d in violation of his Eighth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The court is mindful that correctional officers have a significant responsibility in instituting order and discipline in our nation\u2019s prisons. Nevertheless, this responsibility does not come with the attendant right to use prisoners as personal punching bags. There no doubt may be times when prisoners agitate correctional officers or act in an otherwise unruly fashion. However, the Eighth Amendment demands that correctional officers respond to such incidents in a fashion that is appropriate for the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">Because Gruenwald\u2019s allegations demonstrate that the officers violated his Eighth Amendment rights, the court has little difficulty in concluding that his claims clear the second hurdle of the qualified immunity analysis as well. This hurdle asks whether \u201cit would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151. We conclude that it would have been clear to a reasonable officer in the shoes of Buchanan, Maddox, or Myers, that the malicious and sadistic infliction of pain exhibited in this case was unlawful. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision granting Buchanan, Maddox, and Myers\u2019 motion to dismiss Gruenwald\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims against them in their individual capacities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">B. Eighth Amendment Claim Against Mansfield</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">Gruenwald\u2019s amended complaint asserts a cause of action against Mansfield for Mansfield\u2019s alleged failure to intervene and stop Buchanan, Maddox, and Myers\u2019 use of excessive force. Although the district court was not explicit, it appears the court dismissed Gruenwald\u2019s claim against Mansfield pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state claim. In this regard, the court reasoned that if Gruenwald failed to state Eighth Amendment claims against Buchanan, Maddox, and Myers, he surely failed to state such a claim against Mansfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of an in forma pauperis complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim. <em>Kay v. Bemis, </em>500 F.3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir.2007). As with a motion to dismiss, we accept Gruenwald\u2019s allegations as true and construe them, and any reasonable inferences to be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to Gruenwald. <em>Id. </em>at 1217. Since Gruenwald is proceeding pro se, his complaint must be construed liberally. <em>Id. </em>at 1218 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\u201c[A] law enforcement official who fails to intervene to prevent another law enforcement official\u2019s use of excessive force may be liable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Mick v. Brewer, </em>76 F.3d 1127, 1136 (10th Cir.1996). Specifically, \u201can officer who is present at the scene and who fails to take reasonable steps to protect the victim of another officer\u2019s use of excessive force, can be held liable for his nonfeasance.\u201d <em>Fundiller v. City of Cooper City, 111 </em>F.2d 1436, 1442 (11th Cir.1985); <em>see also Mick, </em>76 F.3d at 1137 (asserting that an officer may be liable for a failure to intervene if he <em>\u201cwatched </em>the incident and did nothing to prevent it.\u201d (emphasis added)). In the instant case, however, Gruenwald failed to allege in his amended complaint that Mansfield witnessed any of the events that underlie the instant action. Aside from indicating that Mansfield was the first officer to respond to his cell as part of the condition 30 and that after the introduction of the mace Mansfield ordered his fellow officers to cuff Gruenwald, Gruenwald\u2019s complaint makes no further mention of Mansfield\u2019s whereabouts during the events. Even construing Gruenwald\u2019s complaint liberally, the simple conclusory allegation that Mansfield failed to intervene \u2014 when not once does Gruenwald allege that Mansfield witnessed any of the events in question \u2014 is insufficient to state claim. <em>See Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991) (asserting \u201ccon-clusory allegations without supporting factual averments are insufficient to state a claim\u201d (internal citations omitted)). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Gruenwald\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims against Mansfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">C. Claims Against Roberts, Werholtz, and Cummings</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">For substantially the same reasons articulated by the district court, we affirm the court\u2019s dismissal of Gruenwald\u2019s claims against Roberts, Werholtz, and Cummings.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">D. Claims for Equitable Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">For substantially the same reasons articulated by the district court, we affirm the court\u2019s dismissal of Gruenwald\u2019s claims for equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">E. State Tort Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">Gruenwald asserted a number of state tort claims against Buchanan, Myers, and Maddox. Having dismissed all of Gruen-wald\u2019s federal causes of action, the district court dismissed these claims pursuant to its discretion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). Based on our conclusion that the district court erred in dismissing all of Gruen-wald\u2019s federal causes of action, we remand for the district court to reconsider whether it should exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Gruenwald\u2019s pendent state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">We REVERSE the district court\u2019s decision granting Buchanan, Maddox, and Myers\u2019 motion to dismiss Gruenwald\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>claims against them in them individual capacities and REMAND those claims for further proceedings. With this in mind, we also REMAND for the district court to reconsider whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Gruenwald\u2019s pendent state law claims. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision in all other respects. Gruenwald\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is GRANTED, and we remind him that he is obligated to make partial payments on the filing fee until the fee has been paid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-15\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.
