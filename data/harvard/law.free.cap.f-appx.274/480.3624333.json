Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate her claimed disability and retaliated against her by placing her on short-term medical leave with full pay and benefits, rather than continuing the accommodation of her choosing. The district court granted summary judgment to Defendant because Plaintiff could not establish that she had suffered an adverse employment action, a required element of both her discrimination and retaliation claims, and Defendant reasonably accommodated Plaintiffs claimed disability by placing her on paid short-term leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-20\">We have carefully read the parties\u2019 briefs, the applicable law, and the district court\u2019s opinion, and we agree no genuine issues of material fact exist and Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on each of Plaintiffs claims. Because the district court\u2019s decision is well-reasoned, we see no reason to embellish upon its opinion. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendant on Plaintiffs ADA, OCRA, and FMLA claims for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
