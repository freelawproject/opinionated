Malone argues that the defendant demonstrated deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the defendant treated his skin condition with only a shot and one bar of soap. Malone alleges that he should have also received lotion and dandruff shampoo.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Malone fails to allege facts to support a claim of deliberate indifference to a serious medical need as is required in order to proceed under the Eighth Amendment and \u00a7 1983. <em>See Vamado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Malone\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. </em>King, 707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Therefore, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Malone\u2019s complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of Malone\u2019s appeal count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Malone is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
