U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 421 </em>F.3d 954, 957 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). To the extent the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we also review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Although here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, the BIA did agree with the IJ\u2019s reasoning and briefly articulated its reasons for doing so,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, thus, this Court reviews both decisions. <em>Chacom-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 956. To the extent that the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions were based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, meaning that we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s [and the IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation omitted). Under the substantial evidence test, the denial of asylum may be reversed only if the evidence would <em>compel </em>a reasonable factfinder to find that the requisite fear of persecution exists. <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zaca-rias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to her home country or to avail himself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his or her statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). In order to be eligible for asylum, the asylum applicant must \u2014 in addition to demonstrating past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution \u2014 establish that such persecution is \u201con account of\u2019 one of the enumerated statutory grounds. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i) (\u201cTo establish that the applicant is a refugee ... the applicant must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant\u201d); <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that the asylum applicant must provide evidence that \u201che was mistreated because of his political opinion, or one of the other grounds, rather than for some other reason.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). \u201cDemonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on account of [a statutory factor].\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (internal quotations and citation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Here, the facts do not compel us to conclude, contrary to the IJ\u2019s factual findings and the BIA\u2019s decision, that Gamboa met her burden to establish a nexus between her political opinion or membership in a social group (medical personnel) and the incidents on which she relies to show past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution. As the BIA put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">[T]he respondents failed to establish that they faced a well-founded fear of persecution in Colombia on account of their political opinion or any other protected ground. The Immigration Judge properly noted that the guerillas are not focused on the lead respondent\u2019s political ideology, but rather, that she was speaking to youths and thus hindering their recruitment efforts, and because she herself refused to join the guerillas to provide medical care to their soldiers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">On this record, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the BIA\u2019s conclusion, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision, the evidence presented in this case does not compel a conclusion contrary to the finding of the BIA on the nexus element of Gamboa\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\">. Because Petitioners have not established a case for asylum, we do not consider whether they satisfied the higher standard for withholding of removal under the INA or CAT relief. <em>See Forgue v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\">. To the extent Petitioners also raise an argument concerning Gamboa\u2019s credibility, the IJ found her to be credible and the BIA affirmed that finding. We see no occasion to revisit the issue of her credibility here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b777-13\">. The Board also cited one of its own decisions, <em>Matter of Burbano, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994), for the proposition that \u201cadoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is 'simply a statement that the Board\u2019s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision.\u2019 \u201d In any event, the parties agree that our review encompasses both decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
