Suwarjo contends: (1) we have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s finding that Suwarjo\u2019s asylum application was untimely and did not qualify for an exception to the timeliness requirement because the BIA and IJ violated Suwarjo\u2019s right to due process, and (2) substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s finding that Suwarjo failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. After review, we deny Suwarjo\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Id. </em>Here, because the Board followed the reasoning of the IJ with comment, we review both the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">\n<em>A. Timeliness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">\u2018We review questions of subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General\u201d regarding the timeliness of an asylum application. In order to apply for asylum, an alien must \u201cdemonstrate[ ] by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An untimely application may be permitted, however, if the alien \u201cdemonstrates ... either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">The REAL ID Act of 2005 added a new provision instructing that \u201c[njothing in ... any other provision of this chapter ... which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law\u201d raised in a petition for review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We held, however, the changes implemented by the REAL ID Act did not alter the effect of \u00a7 1158(a)(3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>as it relates to our jurisdiction to review the timeliness of an asylum application, and we were without jurisdiction to review \u201cwhether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established ... circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing.\u201d <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The BIA and the IJ both explained why Suwarjo did not qualify for the changed-circumstances exception to the one-year filing requirement, and thus there was no due process violation. Whether circumstances in Indonesia have changed is an inquiry this Court lacks jurisdiction to review. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we dismiss the petition as to Suwarjo\u2019s asylum claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">\n<em>B. Withholding of Removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">When evaluating a petition to review a decision by the BIA to deny an application for withholding of removal, we review findings of fact under the \u201csubstantial evidence test,\u201d and must affirm the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). We review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and may not overturn findings of fact unless the record compels it. <em>Id. </em>at 1286-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">An alien seeking withholding of removal under the INA must show his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). To do so, he must demonstrate \u201che more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2003). In addition, there must be a nexus between the persecution and the protected activity, <em>i.e., </em>the persecution must because of the victim\u2019s protected characteristic. <em>See Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007) (discussing \u201cnexus\u201d in the context of an asylum claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">Once an alien establishes past persecution in his country based on a protected ground,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-10\">it is presumed that his life or freedom would be threatened upon his return to his country unless the INS [or DHS] shows by a preponderance of the evidence that, among other things, (1) the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would no longer be threatened upon his removal; or (2) that the alien could avoid a future threat to his life or freedom by relocating to another part of the country of removal, and it would be reasonable to expect him to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-11\"><em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. \u201cAn alien who has not shown past persecution, though, may still be entitled to withholding of removal if he can demonstrate a future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">The applicant must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of [a statutory factor].\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (considering asylum claim) (quotations omitted). An applicant may also sustain his burden of proof without showing that he would be singled out for persecution in his home country if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-13\">(i) The applicant establishes that in that country there is a pattern or practice of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race, religion, nationality, member<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>ship in a particular social group, or political opinion; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-5\">(ii) The applicant establishes his or her own inclusion in and identification with such group of persons such that it is more likely than not that his or her life or freedom would be threatened upon return to that country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2) (withholding of removal). Furthermore, while the INA does not define persecution, this Court recognizes \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decision that Suwarjo was not entitled to withholding of removal under the INA. First, the record supports the conclusion that Suwarjo failed to demonstrate he suffered past persecution. Su-warjo did not show a nexus between the robbery and assaults and his ethnicity because they appear to be common criminal acts based upon his vulnerability, not his ethnicity. Even assuming Suwarjo was able to establish a sufficient nexus between the robberies and assaults and his ethnicity, the record does not compel a conclusion the robberies and assaults were extreme acts amounting to persecution. Suwarjo also testified he was afraid and unable to return home during the 1998 riots, and he had to obtain government documents stating he was of Chinese descent. While unpleasant, the discrimination and harassment of which Suwarjo complains was not extreme mistreatment. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">As Suwarjo has not established past persecution, he is not entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. As suggested above, the incidents on which Suwarjo relies to sustain his burden of proof do not compel the conclusion he more likely than not will be persecuted if he returns to Indonesia. Additionally, Su-warjo\u2019s parents and siblings continue to live in Indonesia, and beyond the single incident concerning his sister in 1998, the record does not contain any evidence that his family suffered harm in that country. The fact Suwarjo\u2019s family has lived unharmed in Indonesia for several years undermines his claim there is a pattern and practice of persecuting similarly situated individuals in Indonesia. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir. 2006) (concluding an alien did not establish a well-founded fear where, among other things, his family continued to live in Colombia without incident). Further, although various news articles support Su-warjo\u2019s testimony regarding the violence and prejudice against ethnic Chinese in Indonesia, the 2005 Country Report indicates instances of discrimination and racially motivated harassment against ethnic Chinese Indonesians declined compared with previous years, which suggests the government is not unwilling or unable to protect Suwarjo. <em>See id. </em>(stating the IJ may \u201crely heavily\u201d upon State Department country reports). In addition, the assertion the Indonesian government is considering to institute economic policies that disfavor ethnic Chinese does not amount to an extreme act that could be considered persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">The record does not compel us to conclude Suwarjo suffered past persecution or that it is more likely than not he will suffer persecution if returned to Indonesia. Accordingly, we deny Suwarjo\u2019s petition as to his claim for withholding of removal because substantial evidence supports the findings of the BIA and the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">We lack jurisdiction to review whether Suwarjo was eligible to apply for asylum. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Additionally, substantial evidence supports the IPs and BIA\u2019s conclusion that Suwarjo did not qualify for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-10\">. Although the IJ and the BIA denied relief under the CAT, Suwarjo did not raise the issue in his petition. Thus, he abandoned that claim. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
