She was sentenced to time served and two years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay a $700 assessment and restitution in the amount of $561,789. She challenges her conviction on appeal. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Pena raises four main issues on appeal. She argues (1) that the district court erred in denying her motion for a new trial based on \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; (2) that she was prejudiced by the district court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on a multiple conspiracy charge; (3) that the government introduced testimony concerning her invocation of her right to counsel, thus violating her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and her right to due process, and (4) that she received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a Rule 33 motion for \u201cabuse of discretion, upholding findings of fact that were made in the course of deciding the motion[] unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>433 F.3d 273, 295 (2d Cir.2006). Pena contends that the district court made an error of law by denying the motion on the ground that the testimony proffered by her co-conspirator at Pena\u2019s sentencing did not constitute newly discovered evidence. Her argument, that as the testimony was \u201cnewly available,\u201d it should be considered \u201cnewly discovered,\u201d is foreclosed by this Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>United States v. Owen, </em>500 F.3d 83 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Pena\u2019s objection to the court\u2019s failure to instruct on multiple conspiracies is raised for the first time on appeal. We have said that \u201c[w]hile a defendant\u2019s failure to object may waive his right to a multiple conspiracy instruction, even where one is warranted, a conviction will be reversed where the defendant can show that (1) the indictment charged a single conspiracy, but the proof disclosed several independent conspiracies, and (2) defendant was so prejudiced by this variance as to be denied a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Desimone, </em>119 F.3d 217, 225-26 (2d Cir.1997). We find no error, much less prejudice, resulting from the court\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">Pena\u2019s next argument \u2014 that the government\u2019s introduction of certain testimony concerning Pena\u2019s husband\u2019s advice to her not to talk to agents of the Internal Revenue Service violated her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and her right to due process \u2014 was not raised below. We therefore review the admission of the testimony under plain error analysis. To succeed under such analysis, Pena must show that there was an error, that it was plain, and that it affected substantial rights. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>274 F.3d 655, 667 (2d Cir.2001) (en banc). \u201cIn addition, even if these three requirements are met, we only exercise our discretion to notice the error if the plain error prejudices the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Gaines, </em>295 F.3d 293, 301 (2d Cir.2002). Especially in view of Pena\u2019s contention at trial that she was unaware of her husband\u2019s fraudulent machinations, we doubt whether there was any error in the receipt of this evidence. If there was error, it did not involve a violation of Pena\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege or of her due process rights. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>that the evidence should not have been received, any such error was neither \u201cplain,\u201d nor of sufficient importance to \u201caffect substantial rights\u201d or \u201cprejudice the fairness\u201d of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Finally, Pena claims that she suffered ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. As \u201cin most cases a motion brought under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective assistance,\u201d <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003), we dismiss her claim without prejudice to its being brought as part of a subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Pena\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance is DISMISSED without prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
