Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). The BIA did not err in concluding that petitioner\u2019s expedited removal interrupted her continuous physical presence in the United States for the purpose of cancellation of removal relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) (requiring ten years of physical presence to be eligible for cancellation of removal); <em>Juarez-Ramos v. Gonzales, </em>485 F.3d 509, 511-12 (9th Cir.2007) (holding that expedited removal interrupts an alien\u2019s continuous physical presence in the United States for the purpose of cancellation of removal relief). Additionally, petitioner\u2019s argument that she should have been afforded an opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal at the time of her expedited removal is unavailing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(b) (setting forth procedures for expedited removal). Accordingly, this petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b623-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
