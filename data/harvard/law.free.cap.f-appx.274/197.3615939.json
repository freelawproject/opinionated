(Plaintiffs/Appellants) appeal the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Rick Burd, Mary Bender, and Nathan Myer (Defendants/Appellees). Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants retaliated against them for speech concerning the mistreatment of dogs at a Pennsylvania kennel. For the following reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-20\">As we write only for the parties, our summary of the facts is brief. Keystone Golden Retriever Rescue Inc. (Rescue) is a private, non-profit organization that aids in the care and adoption of homeless golden retrievers. Christine Rougher (Rougher) serves as Rescue\u2019s president. In June 2003, Angie H. Holloway (Holloway), who operated an unlicensed kennel in Pennsylvania, placed three dogs with Rescue. The dogs arrived at Rescue suffering from a variety of physical ailments. Seeking an investigation of Holloway\u2019s operation, Rougher contacted Tracy Miller (Miller), a Pennsylvania state dog warden employed by the Bureau of Dog Law Protection (Bureau) of the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (Department); Rick Burd (Burd), Executive Director of the Bureau; and Mary Bender (Bender), Director of Enforcement for the Bureau. The Bureau ordered Holloway to apply for a kennel license, and Bender, Burd, Miller, and a state veterinarian conducted an inspection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>of Holloway\u2019s kennel in October 2008. After discovering 131 dogs living in unsanitary conditions, Miller filed state animal cruelty charges against Holloway. The Bureau directed Miller to withdraw these citations, based upon its position, reiterated in a December 2003 memorandum, that dog wardens lack the proper authority to file such charges. On November 20, 2003, Holloway was denied a kennel license and ordered to cease and desist operations; the denial was affirmed at an administrative hearing in January 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In October 2003, Rougher sent a letter to the Department\u2019s Secretary complaining about the Bureau\u2019s inaction on the Holloway matter. That same month, while traveling together, Burd allegedly told Miller that he was considering filing criminal charges against Rougher due to her interference in the Bureau\u2019s Holloway investigation. Against Burd\u2019s request, Miller informed Rougher of the conversation, advising her to be careful. Rougher continued to communicate with various state officials and interest groups after the meeting between Burd and Miller; in 2004, Rescue experienced a delay in receiving its kennel tags.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In January 2004, Miller refiled animal cruelty charges against Holloway. He also spoke to the <em>Bedford Gazette </em>regarding the Bureau\u2019s ongoing investigation of Holloway\u2019s kennel, in spite of a policy that dog wardens refer all media inquiries to the Department\u2019s press office. On January 6, 2004, the article ran in the <em>Bedford Gazette. </em>Miller subsequently received a one-day suspension due to his unauthorized communication with the press about a pending investigation and his failure to complete required kennel inspections for 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">In October 2004, Rougher, Rescue, and Miller filed a \u00a7 1983 action against Burd, Bender, and Nathan Myer (Myer), a member of the Dog Law Advisory Board, alleging that Defendants retaliated against them for their speech.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, finding that Rougher and Rescue failed to establish retaliatory action, while Miller\u2019s expressions fell within his public duties and therefore were not protected. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">When the District Court grants a motion for summary judgment, \u201c[o]ur review is plenary.\u201d <em>Jensen v. Potter, </em>435 F.3d 444, 448 (3d Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issues of material fact are presented and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). We \u201cresolve all factual doubts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of [the appellants].\u201d <em>DL Res., Inc. v. FirstEnergy Solutions Corp., </em>506 F.3d 209, 216 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">Plaintiffs first argue that Defendants took retaliatory action against Rougher and Rescue for their speech regarding the Holloway kennel operation. Namely, they allege that Defendants delayed Rescue\u2019s license renewal, misdirected Rougher and Rescue, and threatened Rougher with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>criminal prosecution. A \u00a7 1988 retaliation claim predicated on the First Amendment must show that: (1) the plaintiff engaged in activity protected by the First Amendment, (2) the government responded with retaliatory action sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his or her rights, and (3) the protected activity was the cause of the retaliatory action. <em>Lauren W. ex rel. Jean W. v. Deflaminis, </em>480 F.3d 259, 267 (3d Cir.2007); <em>Estate of Smith v. Marasco, </em>318 F.3d 497, 512 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Here, the District Court found that the retaliation claims of Rougher and Rescue were either <em>de minimis </em>or too vague to support a First Amendment violation, save for the criminal prosecution threat allegedly communicated by Burd. Regarding this threat, the court determined that Burd\u2019s conduct did not rise to the level of actionable retaliation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Rescue was temporarily denied kennel tags and that Rougher and Rescue received misinformation from the Bureau \u201cin their efforts to monitor the puppy mill issue and the Holloway investigation,\u201d Appellant Br. at 24, are not sufficient to support a First Amendment violation. <em>See McKee v. Hart, </em>436 F.3d 165, 170 (3d Cir.2006) (effect of alleged retaliation on protected activities \u201cneed not be great in order to be actionable, but [ ] must be more than <em>de minim-is </em>\u201d) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Plaintiffs argue that the sufficiency standard for measuring the necessary level of retaliatory action only applies in the public employment context. They contend that \u201cthere is no such thing as a <em>de minimis </em>act of retaliation in the government\u2019s dealing with [ ] private citizen[s]\u201d such as themselves. Appellant Br. at 26. This assertion is not grounded in law, and courts have acknowledged that alleged retaliatory action against private citizens must reach a certain level in order to be actionable. <em>See, e.g., Suarez Corp. Industries v. McGraw, </em>202 F.3d 676, 686 (4th Cir.2000) (\u201cjust as the nature of retaliatory action impacts whether a public employee\u2019s rights were adversely affected, so too the nature of the retaliatory acts impacts whether those acts were actionable when a private citizen is the speaker and a public official is the retaliator.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Plaintiffs also contest the District Court\u2019s determination that Rougher and Rescue, who continued to engage in protected speech after the conversation between Burd and Miller, failed to establish that they were injured by Defendants\u2019 actions. Plaintiffs argue that they need only demonstrate that Defendants\u2019 conduct was intended to deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his First Amendment rights. While the District Court did find that Rougher and Rescue failed to show that Defendants\u2019 actions adversely affected the exercise of their First Amendment rights, the court based summary judgment on its determination that Plaintiffs established no retaliatory action. Burd\u2019s conduct \u2014 telling Miller in confidence that he was <em>considering </em>criminal charges against Rougher \u2014 did not constitute retaliatory action. Burd did not inform Miller that he was definitely going to file charges, and Rougher never faced prosecution. Thus, the District Court properly determined that the claims asserted against Defendants by Rougher and Rescue failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Plaintiffs also argue that the District Court erred in determining that Miller\u2019s retaliation claims failed because they concerned unprotected speech. To state a First Amendment retaliation claim, a public employee plaintiff such as Miller must allege: (1) that the activity in question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>protected by the First Amendment, and (2) that the protected activity was a substantial factor in the alleged retaliatory action. <em>See Hill v. City of Scranton, </em>411 F.3d 118, 125 (3d Cir.2005). \u201cThe first factor is a question of law; the second factor is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Hill v. Borough of Kutztown, </em>455 F.3d 225, 241 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">A public employee\u2019s statement is protected activity when: \u201c(1) in making it, the employee spoke as a citizen, (2) the statement involved a matter of public concern, and (3) the government employer did not have \u2018an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public\u2019 as a result of the statement he made.\u201d <em>Id. (quoting Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 418, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006)). When a public employee makes a statement pursuant to his official duties, he does not speak \u201cas a citizen.\u201d <em>Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. at 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951. \u201cWhether an employee\u2019s speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\u201d <em>Rankin v. McPherson, </em>483 U.S. 378, 384, 107 S.Ct. 2891, 97 L.Ed.2d 315 (1987) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Miller\u2019s speech was not protected by the First Amendment. Miller admits that his claims \u201cdo involve some element of [ ] Miller\u2019s performance of his official duties,\u201d but argues that his actions \u201cinvolve[d] much more than that.\u201d Appellant Br. at 15. Miller contends that the District Court could not segregate his official duties from his expressive conduct as a private citizen concerned about the enforcement of state dog laws. Miller\u2019s actions that led to his suspension, however, were entirely job-related.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He filed charges against Holloway in his capacity as a state dog warden, and his unauthorized contact with the press concerned matters related to his professional duties. Therefore, the District Court correctly determined that \u201cMiller\u2019s claims fail[ed] because his expressions fall clearly within the scope of his professional duties as a state dog warden.\u201d Appendix (App.) 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Finally, Plaintiffs note that the District Court did not explicitly address the liability of Defendant Myer, and assert that Myer should not have been granted summary judgment due to an alleged relationship between Holloway and Myer that resulted in the Bureau\u2019s preferential treatment of Holloway and retaliation against Plaintiffs. The court\u2019s summary judgment determination, however, was based on its determination that no actionable retaliation existed; any supposed facts concerning a Holloway-Myer relationship would not change this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\">. Plaintiffs also brought suit against Holloway; however, the District Court dismissed these claims <em>sua sponte, </em>since Holloway is a non-state actor and cannot be liable under \u00a7 1983. Plaintiffs do not appeal this determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\">. Miller also asserts that he was denied an opportunity for a promotion in retaliation for his communications with the media. The District Court properly found this claim abandoned for lack of record support, and we will not further address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
