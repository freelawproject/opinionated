Jackson, a federal prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his pro <em>se </em>motion to vacate, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court granted a limited certificate of appealability on the issue of whether Jackson received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to subpoena and call a particular individual, Corey Jones, as a defense witness during his trial. On appeal, Jackson argues that Jones was an indispensable witness for his defense because he possessed letters from Luis Perez, a cooperating government witness who testified against Jackson at trial, letters which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>allegedly exculpated him of the offense conduct. Jackson further asserts that Jones\u2019s testimony could have been used to impeach Perez, contradicting (1) his explanation at trial that his written statements and affidavit exculpating Jackson of the offense conduct were only made out of fear of Jackson, and (2) his other trial testimony that these written statements and affidavit contained false statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Whether counsel was ineffective is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cIn a Section 2255 proceeding, we review legal issues <em>de novo </em>and factual findings under a clear error standard.\u201d <em>Otero v. United States, </em>499 F.3d 1267, 1269 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is governed by the standards of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>Grossman v. McDonough, </em>466 F.3d 1325, 1344 (11th Cir.2006). Under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>two-part test, petitioner must demonstrate: (1) that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and (2) that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 184, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 2473, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1313 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). A reasonable probability is one \u201csufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Our scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance is \u201chighly deferential,\u201d and we indulge a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable. <em>Chandler, </em>218 F.3d at 1314 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe must avoid second-guessing counsel\u2019s performance: It does not follow that any counsel who takes an approach we would not have chosen is guilty of rendering ineffective assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Thus, \u201c[gjiven the strong presumption in favor of competence, the petitioner\u2019s burden of persuasion \u2014 though the presumption is not insurmountable \u2014 is a heavy one.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">Jackson failed to satisfy either prong under <em>Strickland. </em>First, the district court did not clearly err in finding that trial counsel made reasonable efforts to contact and interview Jones prior to learning, during a pre-trial hearing, that the government did not intend to elicit any testimony regarding Jones during Jackson\u2019s trial. Moreover, trial counsel reasonably ceased in his efforts to contact Jones after that hearing, since Jones\u2019s testimony no longer appeared to be relevant to his defense of the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, Jackson failed to show that he was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance. As we previously found in affirming Jackson\u2019s convictions and sentences on direct appeal, even if counsel had successfully interviewed Jones and had become aware of the letters from Perez before trial, it would likely not have produced a different result.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Since Jackson failed to demonstrate either part of the test in <em>Strickland, </em>we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-7\">. Trial counsel was unaware, prior to trial, that Jones would have provided exculpatory testimony. At the time, counsel reasonably believed that Jones's only relevance to the his trial strategy was that Jones could rebut testimony from Perez that Jones introduced Perez to Jackson for the purpose of facilitating a drug deal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b775-13\">. At most, the letters were additional impeachment material against Perez, who already was cross-examined extensively during trial. Moreover, there was sufficient evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>dence, other than Perez\u2019s testimony, on which a reasonable juror could have relied to find Jackson guilty of the offense conduct at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
