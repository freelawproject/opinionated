Dean responds to the court\u2019s order directing him to respond why his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>appeal should not be transferred to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and moves to file an appeal or petition for writ of mandamus in the \u201cUnited States Court of Appeals for the Proper Circuit\u201d or, in the alternative, to certify the question of jurisdiction of this appeal to the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Dean filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. <em>Dean v. Law Firm of Morris, Schneider, and Prior, </em>No. 1:07-CV-1706. The complaint included claims pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Act (FDCA) and state law. On November 8, 2007, a magistrate judge denied Dean\u2019s motion to disqualify all magistrate judges from participating in his case. On November 20, 2007, Dean filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the November 8 order in the Eleventh Circuit. Dean later moved to dismiss that appeal and filed a \u201cNotice of Interlocutory Appeal\u201d seeking review of the November 8 order in this court. On January 11, 2008, the Eleventh Circuit dismissed Dean\u2019s appeal as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Because Dean\u2019s case appeared to involve FDCA and state law claims not within this court\u2019s jurisdiction, we directed Dean to show cause why the appeal should not be transferred to the Eleventh Circuit. In response, Dean states that he believes that jurisdiction is proper in this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, which concerns cases in which the United States is the defendant. Dean states \u201cIt seems feasible to Appellant that the injunctive relief sought ... was a claim for less than 10,000 and not sounding in tort, but in equity against The United States per any Federal Judge, and is [appealable] to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, because this injunctive application does not appear to merge into the original non-federal case but is a claim against the United States.\u201d Essentially, it appears that Dean\u2019s argument is that because his motion in the district court sought to disqualify federal magistrates, that motion was against the United States and thus falls within this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">This court\u2019s jurisdiction over appeals of district court decisions is limited primarily to cases involving patents and suits against the United States not exceeding $10,000. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1), (2). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(2), this court has jurisdiction over an appeal of a final judgment \u201cif the jurisdiction of [the district court] was based, in whole or in part, on section 1346.\u201d Thus, whether an appeal falls within this court\u2019s jurisdiction is governed by the basis of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(2); see <em>also Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Sys., </em>535 U.S. 826, 829, 122 S.Ct. 1889, 153 L.Ed.2d 13 (2002) (\u201cthe Federal Circuit\u2019s jurisdiction is fixed with reference to that of the district court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">In this case, the defendant in the district court is not the United States. Thus, the district court\u2019s jurisdiction is not based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346. Because the district court\u2019s jurisdiction is not based on section 1346 and Dean suggests no other basis for this court to assert jurisdiction over his appeal, this court lacks jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">The court may transfer pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 if an action is filed in the wrong court \u201cif it is in the interest of justice.\u201d We determine that transfer is not in the interest of justice because the Eleventh Circuit has already determined that the appeal is premature. Thus, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">(1) The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>(2) All pending motions and petitions are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">(3) All sides shall bear their own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
