Aug. 2, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 673 158 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 3, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, this Court, for the sake of completeness, may consider the IJ\u2019s decision in reviewing the BIA\u2019s if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. Dep\u2019t Homeland Sec., </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Manzur v. Dep\u2019t Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 288-89 (2d Cir.2007). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">We find that the agency did not err in denying Chen\u2019s asylum claim based on her alleged \u201cresistance\u201d to China\u2019s planned birth policy. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 312-13 (2d Cir.2007) <em>(en banc) </em>(citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)). The agency properly noted that Chen did not allege that she experienced any harm in China on account of the May 2003 incident at her sister\u2019s home. Regarding her claim that she has a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of that incident, the agency properly found that there was insufficient evidence in the record to establish that the government maintained any interest in persecuting her. Moreover, even assuming that Chen is correct that she will face a \u201cpenalty\u201d in China on account of her alleged resistance, she does not point to any evidence that such a penalty would rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Xiu Fen Xia v. Mukasey, </em>510 F.3d 162, 166 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Regarding Chen\u2019s fear of persecution under China\u2019s family planning policy based on the birth of her United States citizen daughter, we find no error in the agency\u2019s conclusion that this fear was not well-founded where Chen has only one child. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 128-29 (2d Cir.2005). Chen herself testified that the family planning policy as enforced in her home province of Fujian would allow her to have more than one child because she possesses a rural, or agricultural, household registration and because her firstborn was a girl. The U.S. State Department\u2019s Asylum Profile (found in the record) confirms that married couples in Fujian are allowed to have one child without applying for permission and that residents of rural areas enjoy more flexibility in having a second child. In light of the foregoing, the agency reasonably concluded that Chen failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Finally, while Chen argues that the agency erroneously denied her application for CAT relief, she fails to point to any record evidence that would contravene the agency\u2019s finding that she did not establish that it was more likely than not that she would face torture in China. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(c), 1208.17; <em>Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 168 (2d Cir.2004). As such, the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
