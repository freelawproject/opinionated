For the reasons set forth below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">We will uphold an adverse credibility determination if it is supported by substantial evidence, <em>see Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006), and reverse the Board\u2019s decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">Having reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision, we find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding, as affirmed by the Board, and the ruling that Hailegeorgis failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution as necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(I), (ii) (West 2005) (providing that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006) (same). Because the record does not compel a different result, we will not disturb the Board\u2019s denial of Hailegeorgis\u2019 application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-10\"> Because Hailegeorgis did not challenge the denial of withholding of removal or relief under the CAT in her brief, those claims are not preserved for review. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
