They contend that changed circumstances \u2014 that the Hamas organization has taken over control of the Palestinian Authority \u2014 warrant the grant of an untimely motion to reopen. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-22\">The Quomsiehs entered the United States in 2001, and, in January 2002, they filed their petitions for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. An Immigration Judge (IJ) denied their petitions, and the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. A panel of this court denied the Quomsiehs\u2019 petitions for review in March 2007. <em>See Quomsieh v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.8d 602 (8th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-23\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Quomsiehs failed to establish changed circumstances which would justify reopening the removal proceedings. <em>Alemu v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 907, 909 (8th Cir.2007) (standard of review). \u201c[M]otions to reopen are disfavored because they undermine the government\u2019s legitimate interest in finality....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Attorney General retains considerable discretion over such motions, and that discretion is abused only where the BIA \u201cgives no rational explanation for its decision; departs from its established policies without explanation; relies on impermissible factors or legal error; or ignores or distorts the record evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-24\">The evidence the Quomsiehs submitted with their motion includes articles discussing the Hamas takeover of the Palestinian Authority. In reviewing this evidence and a State Department report on the status of religious relations in Israel and the Occupied Territories, the BIA concluded that while there were \u201ctensions between Christians and Muslims ... the new Palestinian Authority (PA) government ha[d] taken steps to eliminate religious incitement.\u201d This finding is a reasonable interpretation of the evidence presented by the Quom-siehs and from the State Department report, and the evidence does not show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the territory has undergone a material change in circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
