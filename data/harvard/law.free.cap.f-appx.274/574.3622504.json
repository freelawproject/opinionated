The Attorney General also challenges the district court\u2019s grant of Appel-lees\u2019 motions to dismiss based on federal preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">The district court properly denied the Attorney General\u2019s motion to remand, as the Attorney General\u2019s claims raised a substantial federal question under the Federal Power Act (FPA). The Attorney General\u2019s antitrust claims depend on whether Powerex and PNM sold in-state electricity as out-of-market electricity, a federal issue over which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has exclusive jurisdiction. <em>See California ex rel. Lockyer v. Dynegy, Inc., </em>375 F.3d 831, 843 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201c[Rjemoval jurisdiction lies over a claim to enforce obligations that squarely fall within the exclusive jurisdiction provision of the Federal Power Act.\u201d) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">The district court also properly granted Appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss based on federal preemption. Because the Attorney General\u2019s antitrust claim would require either a determination of a reasonable rate or a classification of the energy sources involved, it is preempted. <em>See Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish County v. Dynegy Power Mktg., Inc., </em>384 F.3d 756, 761 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that state antitrust claim was \u201cbarred by the filed rate doctrine, by field preemption, and by conflict preemption\u201d). The Attorney General\u2019s reliance on <em>Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, </em>410 U.S. 366, 93 S.Ct. 1022, 35 L.Ed.2d 359 (1973), is misplaced, as that case involved a federal rather than state antitrust action. <em>Id. </em>at 368, 93 S.Ct. 1022; <em>see also Connell Const. Co., Inc. v. Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Local Union No. 100, </em>421 U.S. 616, 635-36, 95 S.Ct. 1830, 44 L.Ed.2d 418 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">Relying on <em>California ex rel. Lockyer v. FERC, </em>383 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir.2004), the Attorney General asserts that Powerex cannot rely on the filed rate doctrine because Powerex failed to properly file its rates pursuant to the FPA. In <em>Lockyer, </em>however, we did not hold that FERC\u2019s failure to require strict reporting requirements precluded reliance on the filed rate doctrine in the preemption context. <em>See id. </em>at 1015-17. In any event, the Attorney General\u2019s claims are also preempted based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>on field preemption and conflict preemption. <em>See Snohomish, </em>384 F.3d at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b601-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

Because we affirm the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction based on the the FPA, we do not address Powerex's alternative argument concerning the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
