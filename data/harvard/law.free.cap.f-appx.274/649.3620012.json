ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Defendant and appellant Jose Alvarado-Valencia pled guilty to the following: one count of conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(ii); three counts of possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(ii) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; one count of attempted possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(ii) and 846; one count of being an alien in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5); one count of possession of more than five grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a)and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; one count of use of a communication facility to facilitate drug trafficking, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b); and one count of aiding and abetting the use of drug-involved premises, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. He was sentenced to 280 months\u2019 imprisonment on the first five counts, with lesser sentences on the remaining counts, all to run concurrently. Alvarado-Valencia appeals his sentence, which we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The counts to which Alvarado-Valencia pled guilty stem from a large drug distribution enterprise involving Alvarado-Valencia and a number of co-defendants, pursuant to which they brought drugs, primarily cocaine, from Mexico and distributed them in the Kansas City, Kansas, area. In preparation for sentencing, the United States Probation Office prepared a presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) which calculated an advisory United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d), sentence of 262 to 327 months. At the sentencing hearing, neither party objected to the PSR. The government asked for a sentence of 280 months, \u201ctowards ... [but] less than the exact midpoint\u201d of the Guidelines range. Tr. of Sentencing at 6, R. Vol. III. Alvarado-Valencia asked for a sentence at the low end of the advisory range. The district court listened to arguments from both sides concerning the appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">The district court sentenced Alvarado-Valencia to 280 months, towards the middle of the Guidelines sentencing range, and explained the sentence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-12\">In appropriating this sentence, I\u2019m giving substantial weight to the sentencing guidelines because they promote uniformity in sentencing and also taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors including the defendant\u2019s clean criminal history as well as the seriousness of this offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-13\">And I also believe that a sentence in this range would promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, and protect the public from further crimes not only by this defendant, but by others. So it seems to me this would be a reasonable sentence considering all the factors under Section 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 12-13. The district court then asked Alvarado-Valencia\u2019s counsel if he had any comment, to which counsel answered \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. Alvarado-Valencia\u2019s only argument on appeal is that the sentence was imposed in a procedurally unreasonable manner because the district court failed to adequately explain the chosen sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">\u201cIn sentencing, the district court has a duty under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) to show it has considered the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Tindall, </em>519 F.3d 1057, 1065 (10th Cir.2008). <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d). However, the Supreme Court \u201calso made clear that a district judge is not required to give an exhaustive list of reasons.\u201d <em>Tindall, </em>519 F.3d at 1065. Indeed, \u201c[a] one-sentence explanation accompanying a within-guidelines sentence \u2014 in the absence of the need to address specific \u00a7 3553(a) arguments brought to the district court\u2019s attention \u2014 satisfies the district court\u2019s duty to impose a procedurally reasonable sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1065; <em>see also United States v. Ruiz-Terrazas, </em>477 F.3d 1196, 1199 (10th Cir.2007) (stating that \u201cSection 3553(c) requires the court to provide only a general statement\u201d in explaining the imposition of a sentence falling within the Guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">The district court did more than enough in this case to satisfy that standard. Accordingly, the court committed no procedural error in explaining Alvarado-Valencia\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Alvarado-Valencia\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b676-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\">. Alvarado-Valencia made no specific objection to the district court\u2019s methodology in arriving at the sentence. Thus, our standard of review would be for plain error. <em>See United States v. McComb, </em>519 F.3d 1049, 1054-55 (10th Cir.2007). Alvarado-Valencia maintains that he made the equivalent of an objection by arguing for a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range. Alvarado-Valencia\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable under any standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
