We review this decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ray v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 582 (9th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.2004)). We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen because petitioners\u2019 motion was untimely, as well as number-barred, and the petitioners have not provided additional evidence to support an exception to the numerical or time limits for motions to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) and (3). Accordingly, this petition for review is summarily denied in part because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>(9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">As to petitioners\u2019 request for sua sponte reopening, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision to deny sua sponte reopening of petitioners\u2019 case. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(a); <em>Ekimian v. </em>INS, 303 F.3d 1153 (9th Cir.2002). We therefore dismiss this petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">All pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b617-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
