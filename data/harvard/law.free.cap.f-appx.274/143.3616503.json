We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">On February 17, 1997, Goldwire led Juakeim Bates and his two companions, who were looking to buy drugs, to a supposed drug dealer living on Mt. Vernon Street in Philadelphia, PA. Before finding the drug dealer, Goldwire entered his own home at 3820 Wallace Street to retrieve a gun, and returned with co-defendant Montrell Oliver and someone identified as Jimmy following from a distance. After Bates and Goldwire exited the car and knocked on some doors in apparent search of the drug dealer, Bates re-entered the car. Oliver and Jimmy then approached and fired at Bates, who was fatally shot as the car sped away. Bates\u2019 two companions later testified at trial that they also saw Goldwire firing a gun at the car. Goldwire was arrested an hour later when he returned with his brother Khalif and Marcus Best to the gas station where he first saw Bates. Goldwire denied any participation in the shooting and attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">After trial in a Pennsylvania trial court, the jury convicted Goldwire of various crimes, including first-degree murder, aggravated assault, and robbery. The jury deadlocked on the penalty phase; thus the trial court sentenced Goldwire to life imprisonment, and the Superior Court affirmed. Goldwire filed a PCRA petition, which was denied. The Superior Court affirmed, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied allocatur. Goldwire then filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Magistrate Judge issued a report and recommendation that the District Court should dismiss Goldwire\u2019s petition, which the District Court approved and adopted. This court granted a certificate of appeala-bility on two issues of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">The District Court exercised jurisdiction over Goldwire\u2019s petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). We have jurisdiction over the District Court\u2019s final order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. \u201cWhere, as here, a district court dismisses a habeas petition based solely on a review of the state court record without holding its own evidentiary hearing, our standard of review of the district court\u2019s determination is plenary.\u201d <em>Marshall v. Hendricks, </em>307 F.3d 36, 50 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">Goldwire\u2019s petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241-2255. Where a claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings, federal habeas corpus relief will only be granted if the state decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2254(d)(1). To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, Goldwire must show both that his counsel\u2019s performance was lacking and that this deficient performance resulted in prejudice. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">Goldwire first argues that counsel was ineffective for suggesting that Goldwire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>would not testify at trial. In his opening statement, Goldwire\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">It\u2019s a house divided.... Maybe [Gold-wire] gets off, but [Khalif Goldwire] gets arrested. If the mother says something, maybe they let Omar off and they arrest [Khalif] now. And my client, he\u2019s the older brother, his father is dead. He doesn\u2019t want to take the stand and snitch on his brother. He just doesn\u2019t want to. I\u2019m still trying to convince him, but he just doesn\u2019t want to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">App. at 21. The prosecutor responded to this statement in his closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av4\">Well, number one, you don\u2019t know why Omar Goldwire didn\u2019t take the stand. What you do know is anyone who takes the stand is subject to cross examination and everything about him comes out, who they are and what they are all about. So there could be a lot [of] reasons why Omar Goldwire wouldn\u2019t want to take the stand and testify, but I submit to you it\u2019s not because he points the finger at his brother and possibly becoming a witness against Khalif at some other trial. That\u2019s what they want you to believe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">App. at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">On PCRA review, the Pennsylvania Superior Court rejected Goldwire\u2019s claim because it found trial counsel had a \u201creasonable trial strategy,\u201d App. at 37, which was \u201cto suggest a case of mistaken identity and to place the blame on [Goldwire]\u2019s brother, Khalif,\u201d App. at 36. The court cited <em>Commonwealth v. Howard, </em>553 Pa. 266, 719 A.2d 233, 237 (1998), for the proposition that where matters of strategy are at issue, counsel\u2019s assistance is generally deemed constitutional unless a viable alternative defense was suggested that offered substantially greater potential for success than the chosen course. Here, the Superi- or Court found that Goldwire \u201cfailed to indicate what alternative strategy offered a potential for success greater than the course chosen by his trial counsel.\u201d App. at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">Pennsylvania\u2019s standard for evaluating ineffective assistance claims is identical to the federal standard. <em>See Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em>515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973, 976-77 (1987). Thus, the Pennsylvania court did not apply a rule of law that contradicts the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Strickland. </em>We also do not find that \u201cthe state court decision, evaluated objectively and on the merits, resulted in an outcome that cannot reasonably be justified under <em>Strickland.\u201d Werts v. Vaughn, </em>228 F.3d 178, 204 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), established the general rule that comments by the prosecution or the court on a defendant\u2019s decision not to testify violate the Fifth Amendment. Here, \u201c[t]he defendant appears to be confusing the prohibition against direct or indirect references by a prosecutor to a defendant\u2019s decision not to testify with some imagined rule that applies with equal force to his defense counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Guerrero, </em>938 F.2d 725, 731 (7th Cir.1991). Even if there were such a rule, <em>\u201cStrickland </em>and its progeny make clear that counsel\u2019s strategic choices will not be second-guessed by <em>posthoc </em>determinations that a different trial strategy would have fared better.\u201d <em>Rolan v. Vaughn, </em>445 F.3d 671, 681-82 (3d Cir.2006). Goldwire may rebut the presumption of reasonable professional conduct by \u201cshowing that no sound strategy posited by the [government] could have supported the conduct.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Varner, </em>428 F.3d 491, 500 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">Here, both the state Superior Court and the District Court concluded that defense counsel pursued a reasoned trial strategy in light of the evidence available, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>included two positive identifications by eyewitnesses to the shooting. In fact, in this court Goldwire concedes that trial counsel\u2019s overall strategy of presenting a mistaken identity defense was \u201cperfectly sound\u201d and that it might even have made \u201ctactical sense\u201d to assert in closing argument Goldwire\u2019s reason for not testifying. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10-11. He objects, however, to counsel\u2019s inclusion of that assertion in his opening statement. It was not unreasonable strategy to begin with the theory of mistaken identity that defense counsel proffered at the outset of trial, and to attempt to portray Goldwire as an innocent man torn by the choice between his brother\u2019s liberty or his own.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with the District Court that under the facts of this case, the Pennsylvania Superi- or Court\u2019s determination that trial counsel rendered effective assistance was not an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">With respect to the second claim of ineffective assistance \u2014 that counsel failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks regarding Goldwire\u2019s failure to testify \u2014 the government argues at length that this claim is waived and/or proeedurally defaulted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, we find it unnecessary to decide this issue because it is apparent that the claim lacks merit. \u201cUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2), we may reject claims on the merits even though they were not properly exhausted, and we take that approach here.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Bronshtein v. Horn, </em>404 F.3d 700, 728 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">The Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[wjhere the prosecutor on his own initiative asks the jury to draw an adverse inference from a defendant\u2019s silence, <em>Griffin </em>holds that the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination is violated. But where as in this case the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the defendant\u2019s opportunity to testify is a fair response to a claim made by defendant or his counsel, we think there is no violation of the privilege.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>485 U.S. 25, 32, 108 S.Ct. 864, 99 L.Ed.2d 23 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">Although the prosecutor\u2019s statement may come close to violating <em>Griffin, </em>when it is considered in context, we conclude that it was a fair response to defense counsel\u2019s opening statement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>cutor\u2019s statement was in direct response to defense counsel\u2019s assertion that Goldwire did not testify only because he refused to implicate his brother; the prosecutor was entitled to respond to this assertion after defense counsel had opened the door. <em>See id. </em>at 33, 108 S.Ct. 864 (in order for the jury to determine defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, \u201cit is important that both the defendant and the prosecutor have the opportunity to meet fairly the evidence and arguments of one another\u201d); <em>United States v. Isaac, </em>134 F.3d 199, 206 (3d Cir.1998) (\u201c[W]hen the defendant uses his <em>Griffin </em>protection as a sword, rather than a shield, the prosecution may respond appropriately.\u201d). As the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUp\">It is one thing to hold, as we did in <em>Griffin, </em>that the prosecutor may not treat a defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to remain silent at trial as substantive evidence of guilt; it is quite another to urge, as defendant does here, that the same reasoning would prohibit the prosecutor from fairly responding to an argument of the defendant by adverting to that silence. There may be some \u201ccost\u201d to the defendant in having remained silent in each situation, but we decline to expand <em>Griffin </em>to preclude a fair response by the prosecutor in situations such as the present one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><em>Robinson, </em>485 U.S. at 34, 108 S.Ct. 864.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">For the above-stated reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court denying Goldwire\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-5\">. Even if this strategy was considered defective, however, Goldwire has not shown prejudice, which requires a finding that \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. We must consider the totality of the evidence at trial: \" 'a verdict or conclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gray, </em>878 F.2d 702, 711 (3d Cir.1989) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 696, 104 S.Ct. 2052). Here, Goldwire admitted to police that he had taken Bates to Mt. Vernon Street, and the Commonwealth presented two eyewitnesses who testified that Goldwire had participated in the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-6\">. The PCRA court rejected Goldwire\u2019s claim on the merits. The government contends Goldwire subsequently failed to properly present this claim to the Superior Court, and failed to raise it in his federal habeas petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b172-13\">. Furthermore, potential waiver is not a jurisdictional impediment to review, and Goldwire was proceeding pro se in the District Court. Thus, we have given him the benefit of the doubt and have reviewed his claim on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b172-14\">. In fact, Goldwire\u2019s PCRA appellate counsel admitted as much in his brief to the Superior Court, in which he challenged trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness in opening the door to the prosecutor adversely commenting on Goldwire\u2019s failure to testify: \"[Goldwire] cannot complain about [the prosecutor's closing statements] as being error \u2014 it was invited comment, pure and simple---- [T]he prosecutor was entitled to run through the wide open door provided for him by trial counsel.\u201d Supp.App. at 106-07.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\">. Furthermore, even if the prosecutor\u2019s remarks exceeded the bounds of a fair response, Goldwire has not shown prejudice. <em>See supra </em>note 1. The trial court also instructed the jurors that arguments made by both defense counsel and the prosecutor were not evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
