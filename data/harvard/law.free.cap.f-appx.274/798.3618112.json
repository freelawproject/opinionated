On appeal, Alas argues that (1) the district court erred in denying a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, and (2) his sentence was greater than necessary to comply with the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-20\">\n<em>Denial of downward departure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-21\">Alas argues that his criminal history category over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history, as illustrated in the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, but that the district court did not understand its authority to depart downward from the guidelines range on that basis. Alternatively, Alas argues that the basis for the district court\u2019s denial of a departure was vague and that, therefore, a remand is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-22\">We generally do not review a district court\u2019s denial of a downward departure from the guidelines range, except in cases where the district court incorrectly believed that it did not have authority to depart. <em>United States v. Adams, </em>316 F.3d 1196, 1197-98 (11th Cir.2003). After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 246, 125 S.Ct. 738, 757, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which held that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory, we reaffirmed that we have no jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-23\">\u201cIf reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, a downward departure may be warranted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l). \u201cA downward departure from the defendant\u2019s criminal history category may be warranted if, for example, the defendant had two minor misdemeanor convictions close to ten years prior to the instant offense and no other evidence of prior criminal behavior in the intervening period.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">A review of the record reveals that the district court understood its authority to depart from the guidelines range pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b), but chose not to depart. In addition, the record reflects that the district court clearly stated its basis for denying the departure. Accordingly, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Alas\u2019s motion for downward departure, and we dismiss his appeal as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">\n<em>Substantive Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Alas argues that his sentence was greater than necessary to comply with the statutory goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He argues that a lower sentence would have been sufficient in light of his criminal history, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and his history and characteristics. Alas also argues that the district court failed to consider the mitigating circumstances of his personal background.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264, 125 S.Ct. at 767. Unreasonableness may be procedural\u2014 when a court\u2019s procedure does not follow the requirements of <em>Booker </em>\u2014 or substantive. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">For a sentence to be proeedurally reasonable, a district court must first correctly calculate the range under the Guidelines and then must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">If the district court committed no significant procedural error, we evaluate a sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, considering the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S.-,-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection,\u201d namely to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to any victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). The burden of showing that a sentence is unreasonable is on the party challenging the sentence. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. There is a range of reasonable sentences, and we ordinarily expect a sentence in the guideline range to be reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>district court correctly calculated the guideline range, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and heard Alas\u2019s arguments in mitigation. Moreover, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that a sentence four months below the applicable guideline range was necessary to comply with the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, we affirm Alas\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
