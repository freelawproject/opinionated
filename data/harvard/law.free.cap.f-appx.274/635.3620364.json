HOLMES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b662-20\">Petitioner Candal Nguyen filed a petition in this Court seeking to challenge the affirmance by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) of his continued detention under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(6) and now seeks to have this matter transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. We do not have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), but we do have authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 to transfer the case. We conclude that transfer is not warranted under these circumstances and, accordingly, DENY the motion to transfer and DISMISS the petition for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b662-22\">Mr. Nguyen, a citizen of Vietnam who entered the United States in 1980 and had his status adjusted to a lawful permanent resident, became subject to a removal order on July 16, 2003, after being charged as removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) for a 1985 Mississippi conviction of grand larceny, an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>waived his appeal of the removal order. When his removal could not be effectuated, he remained in custody, and after various administrative processes the BIA upheld his continued administrative detention under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.14 on the ground that his release would present a special danger to the public. On March 18, 2006, Mr. Nguyen filed in this Court a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision regarding his continued detention, along with a motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Mr. Nguyen later concluded that this Court does not have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(1) (granting jurisdiction to review only \u201ca final order of removal\u201d) \u2014 a point as to which the parties agree. He acknowledges that a challenge to his immigration detention should have been brought in federal district court as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, <em>see Ferry v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 1117, 1131 (10th Cir.2006) (noting \u201ca district court\u2019s jurisdiction to review habeas petitions challenging an alien\u2019s detention\u201d), and that this Court does not have original jurisdiction over habeas petitions, <em>see Trevino-Casares v. U.S. Parole Commission, </em>992 F.2d 1068, 1070 (10th Cir.1993) (\u201c[T]he circuit courts of appeal have no original jurisdiction to consider habeas corpus petitions.\u201d). Therefore, Mr. Nguyen moved, on August 23, 2006, to have the petition transferred to the District Court for the District of Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Previously, on July 15, 2005, Mr. Nguyen had filed a habeas petition in the District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging that his continued detention violated the principles set forth in <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001). In June 2006, the government granted Mr. Nguyen supervised release, delivering him to a social service agency in North Carolina. The district court denied the habeas petition as moot on the grounds that Mr. Nguyen had obtained all of the relief that he would be entitled to under the petition. Subsequently, the BIA reopened the removal case and remanded the matter back to an immigration judge, who in turn administratively closed the case without issuing a new removal order. Because the administrative action meant Mr. Nguyen was not currently subject to a removal order, the district court denied a motion for reconsideration as moot on March 23, 2007, and closed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">We do not have jurisdiction over this petition because Mr. Nguyen only seeks review of the administrative decision regarding his continued detention, not review of the \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. 1252(a)(1). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, we have authority to transfer \u201ca petition for review of administrative action\u201d for which we lack jurisdiction to any other court in which the action could have been brought, \u201cif it is in the interest of justice.\u201d The decision whether to transfer under \u00a7 1631 instead of dismissing without prejudice is a matter of discretion. <em>See Trujillo v. Williams, </em>465 F.3d 1210, 1222-23 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Here, we do not find the transfer to be \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d Mr. Nguyen has represented to this Court that his habeas proceeding in the District Court for the District of Colorado, <em>Nguyen v. Gonzales, </em>No. 05-CV-1332 (D.Colo.), raised the \u201csame issues\u201d and sought \u201cresolution of the same controversy\u201d involving the \u201csame parties\u201d as the petition before us. Pet. Abeyance Mot. at 5. The district court dismissed that case as moot. Thus, there is every reason to conclude that the district court would find Mr. Nguyen\u2019s petition here equally moot because of his release and the absence of a removal order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Dismissal will work no prejudice on any other potential claims Mr. Nguyen may have in his current situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Mr. Nguyen\u2019s motion for transfer to the district court is DENIED. This petition is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. The motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b662-15\"> This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata, </em>and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1. After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this three-judge panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not be of material assistance in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
