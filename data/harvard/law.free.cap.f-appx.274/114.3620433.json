Martin, acting <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment granting plaintiff-appel-lee Virginia Martin\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case, and with the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-22\">A debt is non-dischargeable in bankruptcy if it \u201cwas or could have been listed or scheduled by the debtor in a prior case concerning the debtor ... in which the debtor waived discharge, or was denied a discharge under [11 U.S.C.] section 727(a)(2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7).\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(10). Appellant\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that the debt found to be non-dischargeable in this case was \u201ccontingent\u201d and therefore not within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(10). However, we have previously concluded that \u201cCongress has adopted the broadest possible definition of \u2018debt\u2019 \u201d to render it \u201csufficiently broad to cover any possible obligation to make payment, whether that obligation is liquidated or unliquidated, fixed or contingent, disputed or undisputed, and whether or not it is embodied in a judgment.\u201d <em>In re Mazzeo, </em>131 F.3d 295, 302 (2d Cir.1997) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The debt at issue is therefore subject to the exception to discharge set forth at 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-25\">For the foregoing reasons, in addition to the reasons identified in the opinion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>bankruptcy court, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
