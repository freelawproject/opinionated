He asserted that the District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1345 <em>&amp; </em>1355, which provide the United States District Courts with original jurisdiction over actions commenced by the United States and forfeiture proceedings initiated under an Act of Congress. Brown alleged that defendants violated his constitutional rights by subjecting him to forfeiture proceedings in which he was forced to represent himself and which he was unable to appeal. Specifically, Brown argued that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court erred in denying his petition for allowance of appeal and that the Commonwealth Court erred in dismissing his appeal on procedural grounds without reaching the merits of his claims. He also made numerous arguments regarding the conduct of the forfeiture proceedings, among them that the property subjected to forfeiture was discovered by virtue of an unconstitutional search and was therefore inadmissible, that the trial court erred in permitting counsel to withdraw from representing him, in failing to subpoena a key witness and in denying his motion for a continuance, that he was denied his right to a jury tidal, and that the evidence was insufficient to support forfeiture. He sought an order reversing the Court of Common Pleas\u2019 forfeiture order and/or the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order dismissing his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The District Court dismissed his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> holding that, under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, it was without subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate Brown\u2019s claims against defendants, because to do so would be to exercise \u201cjurisdiction over claims that were actually litigated or \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with adjudication by a state\u2019s courts.\u201d <em>Parkview Assocs. P\u2019ship v. City of Lebanon, </em>225 F.3d 321, 325 (3d Cir.2000); <em>see also ITT Corp. v. Intelnet Int\u2019l Corp., </em>366 F.3d 205, 211 (3d Cir.2004). A federal claim is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a state court claim if \u201c \u2018federal relief can only be predicated upon a conviction that the state court was wrong.\u2019\u201d <em>Parkview, </em>225 F.3d at 325 (quoting <em>Centifanti v. Nix, </em>865 F.2d 1422, 1430 (3d Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Appellant has been granted <em>informa pau-peris </em>status pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, we review this appeal for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal must be dismissed under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">The District Court properly determined that it was without subject matter jurisdiction over Brown\u2019s allegations regarding the forfeiture of his property, as any grant of relief would \u201crender [the state court] judgment ineffectual.\u201d <em>FOCUS v. Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, </em>75 F.3d 834, 840 (3d Cir.1996). In fact, this is specifically the relief Brown requests in his complaint: \u201can order dismissing the lower court\u2019s forfeiture order and/or the lower court\u2019s order dismissing appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">For the foregoing reasons, Brown\u2019s appeal is without legal merit and will be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Brown\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\">. The District Court actually dismissed his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), which was the precursor to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
