Casey appeals <em>pro se </em>from the District Court\u2019s order affirming the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s dismissal of his bankruptcy petition. We will affirm as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-23\">Casey filed an individual Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. Early in the bankruptcy, the trustee moved to dismiss Casey\u2019s petition under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(e)(2)(B) because Casey had failed to provide him with a copy of his most-recently-filed tax return as required by \u00a7 521(e)(2)(A)(i). The Bankruptcy Court held a hearing (which has not been transcribed) on June 13, 2006. That same day, it entered a summary order granting the trustee\u2019s motion and dismissing Casey\u2019s petition. Casey appealed to the District Court, which affirmed by order entered May 3, 2007, 2007 WL 1301005. Casey now appeals to this Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">This appeal involves an obligation imposed on certain debtors by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub.L. 109-8, 119 Stat. 54. Individual Chapter 7 debtors, like Casey hez\u2019e, are required to submit to the trustee a copy of their most-recently-filed tax return (or a transcript thereof) \u201cnot less than 7 days before the date first set for the first meeting of creditors.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(e)(2)(A)(i). If a debtor fails to comply with that obligation, \u201cthe court <em>shall </em>dismiss the case unless the debtor demonstrates that the failure to so comply is due to circumstances beyond the control of the debtor.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added). The statute speaks in mandatory terms and requires dismissal unless the debtor makes that demonstration.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Casey\u2019s first meeting of creditors was first set for May 22, 2006. Casey was thus obligated to provide a copy of his most-recently-filed tax return to the trustee by May 15. Although the trustee notified Casey of this requirement, Casey did not submit anything to the trustee by that date. The trustee, citing the statute\u2019s mandatozy penalty of dismissal, filed his motion to dismiss on May 19. Casey later mailed the trastee a copy of his 2004 Federal income tax return with a letter explaining that his 2005 return was under extension and not yet due to be filed. There is no dispute, however, that he failed to submit a copy of his most-recently-filed tax return (i.e., his 2004 retan) within the time required by \u00a7 521(e)(2)(A)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Thus, the question is whether Casey\u2019s failure to do so was due to circumstances beyond his control. The Bankruptcy Court must have rejected Casey\u2019s arguments that it was, but we are prevented from reviewing its reasoning directly by Casey\u2019s failure to obtain a transcript of the hearing. Nevertheless, it is clear to us, as it was to the District Court, that the circumstances on which Casey relies on appeal are legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Casey argues that \u00a7 521(e)(2)(A)\u00ae required him, not to submit his already-filed 2004 tax return by May 15, but to complete, file and then submit his 2005 tax return by that date. He further asserts that he was unable to complete his 2005 tax return by that date because he was suffering from medical problems and otherwise lacked access to the necessary records. Even assuming the truth of these factual assertions, this argument rests on an erroneous legal premise. As the District Court noted, \u00a7 521(e)(2)(A)\u00ae by its terms requires the submission only of an <em>already-filed </em>tax return, not the completion, filing and submission of any subsequent return. <em>See In re Merrill, </em>840 B.R. 671, 673 (Bankr.D.N.H.2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Thus, the circumstances on which Casey relies did not prevent him from complying with \u00a7 521(e)(2)(A)\u00ae \u2014 i.e., from submitting to the trustee a copy of his already-filed 2004 tax return by May 15. Casey asserts no other circumstances that conceivably might qualify. He does not argue that he lacked notice of the scheduling of the first meeting of creditors, that he lacked access to his 2004 tax return before May 15, or that any other circumstance beyond his control prevented him from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>submitting it to the trustee by that date. Under \u00a7 521(e)(2)(B), the Bankruptcy Court was thus required to dismiss Casey\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-14\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(d) and 1291. \u201cWe review the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and we exercise plenary review over its conclusions of law.\u201d <em>In re Fleming Cos., </em>499 F.3d 300, 304 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\">. Indeed, the filing and submission of subsequent tax returns are governed by other provisions of the statute that are not implicated here. <em>See </em>\u00a7 521(f)(2) (providing for the submission of copies of returns that are filed while the bankruptcy is pending), 521(j) (establishing a procedure for conversion or dismissal if debtor fails to file returns that become due while the bankruptcy is pending).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b233-18\">. Casey raised arguments in the District Court that he has not raised on appeal. Those arguments, therefore, are waived. Even if they were not, we would reject them for the reasons explained by the District Court. We do not address arguments and assertions contained in Casey's brief that are not relevant to the narrow issue presented on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
