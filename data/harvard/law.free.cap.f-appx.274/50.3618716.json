Schoppert, which denied her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Mei Ya You, </em>No. A96 395 495 (B.I.A. Aug. 16, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 395 495 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 5, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">As an initial matter, You has abandoned any challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of her application for CAT relief. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). Additionally, You failed to exhaust before the BIA her challenge of the IJ\u2019s finding that she could reasonably relocate within China to avoid persecution and her claim that there is a pattern and practice of persecution against similarly situated individuals. However, because the BIA specifically considered the IJ\u2019s relocation finding, we can be confident that the purposes of the exhaustion requirement have been met, <em>see Theodoropoulos v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 162, 165-69, 174 (2d Cir.2004), and despite the government\u2019s argument to the contrary, we will consider such issue exhausted. <em>See Xian Tuan Ye v. DHS, </em>446 F.3d 289, 296-97 (2d Cir.2006). Unlike the issue of the reasonableness of relocation, the BIA did not consider You\u2019s unexhausted pattern and practice claim. Because the regulations make clear that a pattern and practice claim is a distinct basis of asylum relief, You\u2019s pattern and practice theory cannot be viewed as an extension of her argument that she had a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117-18 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b) (2) (iii). Accordingly, we decline to consider You\u2019s pattern and practice claim. <em>See Steevenez, </em>476 F.3d at 117-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). In this case, without rejecting the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, the BIA assumed You\u2019s credibility and agreed with the IJ\u2019s alternative burden of proof finding. Therefore, we assume, without determining, You\u2019s credibility. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271-72 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Here, You challenges the agency\u2019s determination that she failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution because she would be able to safely relocate within China. The agency\u2019s regulations provide that \u201c[a]n applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality ..., if under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d 8 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(ii). In cases where the purported \u201cpersecutor is a government or is government-sponsored, ... it shall be presumed that internal relocation would not be reasonable, unless the [government] establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that, under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3)(ii). In determining whether such relocation would be reasonable, the IJ \u201cshould consider ... whether the applicant would face other serious harm in the place of suggested relocation; any ongoing civil strife within the country; administrative, economic, or judicial infrastructure; geographical limitations; and social and cultural constraints, such as age, gender, health, and social and familial ties.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">In finding that You could avoid persecution by relocating within China, the IJ unreasonably relied, in part, on You\u2019s ability to avoid persecution by remaining in hiding. <em>See Mema v. Gonzales, </em>474 F.3d 412, 419 (7th Cir.2007) (acknowledging that it is unreasonable to expect an applicant to live in hiding to avoid persecution); <em>see also Mece v. Gonzales, </em>415 F.3d 562, 577 (6th Cir.2005) (same). The IJ further found that any threat of persecution that You purportedly faced in China was \u201clocalized,\u201d and that she would not face persecution elsewhere in China because she has never practiced Falun Gong and she abandoned selling Falun Gong materials years before leaving China. However, as the BIA recognized, there are \u201cobjective reports of China\u2019s persecution of persons having only tangential involvement in Fa-lun Gong.\u201d Additionally, the IJ erred in failing to determine whether relocation would be reasonable for You. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(ii). Indeed, the IJ does not appear to have evaluated any of the factors required by the regulations. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s order is VACATED with respect to petitioner\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this decision. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
