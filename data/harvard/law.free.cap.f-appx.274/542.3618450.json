Wright II, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b569-18\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-19\">The Center for Biological Diversity (\u201cCBD\u201d) appeals from an order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of the United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Service (\u201cFWS\u201d) and Intervenor-De-fendants Building Industry Association of Washington, et al. (\u201cBIAW\u201d). The order upheld a decision by the FWS not to designate the Southwestern Washington/Columbia River (\u201cSWW/CR\u201d) Distinct Population Segment (\u201cDPS\u201d) of the Coastal Cutthroat Trout (\u201cCCT\u201d) as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1531-1544. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-20\">CBD argues that FWS failed to consider sufficiently whether this DPS of the CCT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>was threatened in the Lower Columbia River (\u201cLCR\u201d), which is a significant portion of the DPS\u2019s range. It also asserts that FWS failed to consider at all whether the marine, estuary and near-shore ocean areas of this DPS constitute a significant portion of its range.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">1. The agency concedes that the LCR is a significant portion of the DPS\u2019s range; the parties dispute whether the agency sufficiently considered whether the DPS was threatened in the LCR, as opposed to the entire geographic range.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Upon review of the record, we are satisfied that FWS\u2019s determination that this DPS of the CCT is not threatened in the LCR was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>see also Nw. Ecosystem Alliance v. U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Serv., </em>475 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir.2007). After assessing the available data, FWS \u201cno longer conclude[s] that returns of anadromous cutthroat trout in almost all lower Columbia River streams have \u2018declined markedly over the last 10 to 15 years\u2019 as described in the proposed rule.\u201d Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Withdrawal of Proposed Rule To List the Southwestern Washington/Columbia River Distinct Population Segment of the Coastal Cutthroat Trout as Threatened [\u201cWithdrawal Notice\u201d], 67 Fed.Reg. 44934, 44940 (July 5, 2002). Instead, FWS found that \u201c[r]esident/freshwater forms remain well distributed and at reasonable densities in the lower Columbia River,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 44949, and that \u201cwe do not find that population trends indicate that coastal cutthroat trout are likely to be extirpated from <em>any significant portion of their range </em>in the foreseeable future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44959 (emphasis added). Moreover, the agency specifically discussed the LCR at several points throughout its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">Thus, while FWS\u2019s decision lacks perfect clarity at some points, overall it did consider the evidence before it and the required factors<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and determined that the DPS is not threatened in the LCR as such. A mere lack of \u201c \u2018ideal clarity\u2019 \u201d is not sufficient to cause us to overturn FWS\u2019s actions where, as here, \u201c \u2018the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beno v. Shalala, </em>30 F.3d 1057, 1073-74 (9th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Ins., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">2. In contrast, the FWS did not properly consider whether the estuary and other marine areas constitute a significant portion of the range of this DPS. First, the Withdrawal Notice recognizes that there has been degradation of the estuary and marine areas. Withdrawal Notice, 67 Fed.Reg. at 44948. Second, the agency\u2019s own reasoning underscores the significance of these areas to the DPS: They are vital to the anadromous life-form of the DPS,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the anadromous life-form is important to the DPS\u2019s long-term survival strategy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although there is also some evidence that other life-forms can spawn anadromous life-forms, the Withdrawal Notice recognizes that this is only signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>cant if there are estuary and marine areas for the anadromous fish to inhabit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, because the agency\u2019s own reasoning recognizes the danger to the estuary and marine areas and the importance of those areas, FWS was required to consider whether those areas constituted a significant portion of the range. <em>See Defenders of Wildlife v. Norton, </em>258 F.3d 1136, 1145 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Although the agency now argues that the areas are not a significant portion, we can only consider what the agency did, not what it could have done. Thus, the appropriate analysis had to be made in the agency\u2019s decision. Its absence makes the ultimate decision arbitrary, and requires us to remand. <em>See Defenders, </em>258 F.3d at 1146-47 &amp; n. 12. Therefore, we must reverse the district court\u2019s decision and remand to the district court with directions that the case be remanded for further consideration in light of this disposition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b569-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

We have not overlooked BIAW\u2019s assertion that the ESA does not authorize listing of a DPS of a subspecies. However, FWS has interpreted the ambiguous language of 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1532(16) to allow just such a listing. <em>See </em>Policy Regarding the Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate Population Segments Under the Endangered Species Act, 61 Fed.Reg. 4722, 4724 (Feb. 7, 1996). Because that is a permissible construction of the statute, we must accord it deference. <em>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843-45, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>Nw. Ecosystem Alliance, </em>475 F.3d at 1143. Thus, we reject BIAW's attack.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
