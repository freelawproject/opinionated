Judiciary Article upon a question affecting the Executive powers and duties in the matter of the appointment of Circuit Judges under an Act of the Legislature, whereof a copy is hereto attached, providing for two Circuit Judges of the additional Twelfth Judicial Circuit, said two judges being additional to the Circuit Judge for Duval County, the particular question being whether the Constitution limits the Governor in <em>this </em>instance to the appointment of one such judge only.\u201d</p><p id=\"b654-5\">Your communication limits us to the consideration of the Executive powers and duties which are prescribed by the terms of an Act of the Legislature referred to in the communication directing the Governor to appoint \u201ctwo additional Circuit Judges, other than the Judge of the Circuit Court for Duval County\u201d and the Judiciary Article of the Constitution as it affects such Executive powers and duties so prescribed.</p><p id=\"b654-6\">The Act of the Legislature referred to in your Excellency\u2019s communication to which a certified copy of the said act was attached, is entitled \u201cAn Act Creating an Additional Judicial Circuit in the State of Florida to be Designated the Twelfth Judicial Circuit and Providing for Two Additional Circuit Judges therefor, and Defining and Fixing the Territorial Limits and Boundaries of the Fourth, Eighth and Twelfth Judicial Circuits and Prescribing When Said Circuit Courts shall take Jurisdiction and the Effect on Pending Cases and the Time for Holding the Term of Court in the Fourth and Twelfth Judicial Circuits.\u201d</p><p id=\"b654-7\">Section One- of the Act is as Follows:</p><p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>\u201cSection 1. There is hereby created and established an additional judicial circuit in the State of Florida to be known and designated the Twelfth Judicial Circuit of the State of Florida. This additional judicial circuit shall be composed of the Counties of Duval and Nassau. And for this additional judicial circuit there shall be appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate two additional circuit judges, other than the Judge of the Circuit Court for Duval County under Section 42 of Araicle V of the Florida Constitution.\u201d</p><p id=\"b655-5\">It is apparent that this section of the Act gives rise to the \u201cinstance\u201d referred to in your communication and would be necessarily involved in the consideration that we may give to any portion of the Constitution affecting the Executive powers and duties in the matter of the appointment of Circuit Judges under that act. In effect any opinion which we may -give to your Excellency upon Section 8 of Article V of the Constitution as amended in 1902 and Sections 35 and 42 of Article V as adopted in 1910 and 1912 respectively, which sections of the Judiciary Article of the Constitution affect the Executive powers and duties in the matter of \u00a3he appointment of Circuit Judges would be an expression of our opinion upon the constitutionality of said Act in so far as the same requires your Excellency to appoint \u201ctwo additional Circuit Judges other than the Judge of the Circuit Court for Duval County under Section 42 of Article V of the Florida Constitution\u201d for the additional judicial circuit created by said act.</p><p id=\"b655-6\">The Justices of this Court have invariably, since the adoption of the Constitution of 1885, expressed the opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>ion that Section 13 of Article IV of the Constitution does not authorize the Justices of the Supreme Court to give to the Governor at his request an. opinion upon statutory enactments affecting his Executive powers an,d duties. See Advisory Opinion to the Governor 39 Fla. 397, 22 South. Rep. 681; 50 Fla. 169, 39 South. Rep. 187; 54 Fla. 136, 44 South. Rep. 756; 62 Fla. 4, 57 South. Rep. 345; 64 Fla. 1, 59 South. Rep. 778.</p><p id=\"b656-5\">An advisory opinion of the Justices while not binding upon the court, and is open to reconsideration and revision, yet, if it questioned the validity of a statute, would create a doubt as to the effect of such statute which the Justices of this court should not upon an ex parte consideration of the subject bring about.</p><p id=\"b656-6\">If the opinion should be expressed that the Judiciary Article does not contemplate the assignment of more than one Judge to each Circuit except in Duval County where by special constitutional provision another Judge of the Circuit Court for that county was directed to be appointed by the Governor, its effect would be to hold the Section One of the Act Referred to in your communication, so far as it requires the appointment of two additional judges for the additional judicial circuit is in conflict with the portions of the Judiciary Articles referred to, and therefore the Executive powers and duties in the matter of the appointment of Circuit Judges are not affected by the said Act.</p><p id=\"b656-7\">Entertaining these views as to the substance and pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>port of your request, we are constrained to decline giving any opinion upon the question propounded.</p><p id=\"b657-5\">Very respectfully,</p><p id=\"b657-10\">In our judgment the question as propounded does not ask an interpretation of any portion of the State Constitution; it is too general in its scope and- therefore not proper to be answered. We do not concur in the reasoning of the majority of the Justices leading them to this same conclusion.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
