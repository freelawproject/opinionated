A Circuit Judge continues to be the Judge in the County of his residence, irrespective of legislative changes in the Circuit embracing that county.</p><p id=\"b669-8\">2. The Justices are not authorized in an advisory opinion to construe statutes.</p><p id=\"b669-13\">The Legislature of this State at its present session has passed an Act entitled:</p><p id=\"b669-14\">\u2018\u2022An Act Creating an Additional Judicial Circuit in the State of Florida to be designated the Twelfth Judicial Circuit and Providing for Two Additional Circuit Judges therefor, and Defining and Fixing the Territorial Limits and Boundaries of the Fourth, Eighth and Twelfth Judi cial Circuits and Prescribing when said Circuit Courts shall take Jurisdiction and the Effect on Pending Cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>and the Time for Holding the Term of Court in the Fourth and Twelfth Judicial Circuits.\u201d</p><p id=\"ANA\">The Act, as its title indicates, has created another Judicial Circuit known as the Twelfth Judicial Circuit of Florida, consisting of Duval and Nassau Counties, and has assigned to the previously existing Fourth Judicial Circuit Putnam County, in addition to Clay and St. Johns Counties, which were previously a part of the Fourth Circuit. A copy of the Act in question, duly certified by the Secretary of State is attached to and made a part of this communication. At the time of such division of the Fourth Judicial Circuit and the creation of the Twelfth Judicial Circuit, by the legislation above referred to, the Judge holding office as Judge of the Fourth Judicial Circuit was and still is Honorable George Couper Gibbs. At the time of such division Judge Gibbs was residing and still resides in Duval County, which County under the Act is now included in the Twelfth Judicial Circuit.</p><p id=\"AIZ\">In the circumstances above stated it has become and is essential for the Governor of Florida to determine whether under the provisions of Sections 8 and 35, as amended, of Article V of the Constitution of Florida, it is the duty of the Governor to appoint another Judge of the Fourth Judicial Circuit, as now constituted by the above Act, or whether Judge Gibbs, the present incumbent, continues in office as Judge of the Fourth Judicial Circuit as re-constituted by the Act of the Legislature above mentioned. Section 8, as amended, of Article V of the Constitution, provides that \u201cthe Circuit Judges holding-office at the time of such division shall severally continue in office until the expiration of their then existing terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>as Judges of the Circuits respectively in which under such division the County of his residence may be included, and a Judge for the additional Circuit shall be appointed for a term equal to the unexpired term of other Circuit Judges, upon such division being made.\u201d Section 8, as amended, increased the number of Judicial Circuits from seven to eight. Section 35, as amended, subsequently removed the limitation of the number of Judicial Circuits and authorized the Legislature to establish additionad Judicial Circuits from time to time, and provided for the appointment by the Governor and the confirmation by the Senate of additional Circuit Judges whose terms of office and general jurisdiction should be the same as is provided in the Constitution for other Circuit Judges.</p><p id=\"b671-5\">I am in doubt whether the above quoted provisions of amended Section 8 apply to the appointment of Judges of the Circuit Courts for Circuits established under amended Section 35. A proper interpretation of amended Section 8 may restrict its operation to the original eight circuits and the eight Circuit Judges whose offices are provided for by said amended Section 8. On the other hand, amended Section 8, of Article V, might be interpreted in connection with amended Section 35, of the same Article, so as to extend to the additional Circuit Courts and Circuit Judges created and appointed under amended Section 35 all of the provisions of amended Section S which relate to the tenure of Circuit Judges holding office at the time of the creation of an additional Circuit. The importance and difficulty of these questions of interpretation are evident, especially in view of the fact that either of the interpretations suggested in this letter may be fairly urged as having sound support in the Constitution itself.</p><p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Therefore, pursuant to Section 13 of Article IY of the Constitution, the opinion of the Judges of the Supreme Court is hereby required by the Governor of Florida as to the interpretation of Sections 8 and 35 as amended, of Article V of the Constitution, affecting the executive power and duty of the G'overnor to appoint a Judge of the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Florida, as constituted by the above Act, in lieu and stead of Judge Gibbs, if Judge Gibbs continues in office as Judge of the Twelfth Judicial Circuit by reason of his residence in Duval County; or, in the circumstances stated, if Judge Gibbs continues to be Judge of the newly constituted Fourth Judicial Circuit, as to the duty of the Governor not to make an appointment of a Circuit Judge of said Fourth Judicial Circuit.</p><p id=\"b672-5\">The point upon which the opinion of the Judges of the Supreme Court is required may be stated in another way as follows:</p><p id=\"b672-6\">Under the statute and facts hereinabove stated, is it the duty of the Governor of Florida to appoint a Judge of the Fourth Judicial Circuit of the State of Florida or a judge of the Twelfth Judicial Circuit of the State of Florida, either or both, as such Circuits are constituted by the Act of the Legislature above referred to, assuming that the Judge of the Fourth Circuit, as formerly constituted, has never resided and does not now reside in any County within said Fourth Judicial Circuit as now constituted by law?</p><p id=\"b672-7\">Respectfully,</p><p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>An Act Creating An Additional Judicial Circuit in the State of Florida to be Designated the Twelfth Judicial Circuit and Providing for Two Additional Circuit Judges therefor, and Defining and Fixing the Territorial Limits and Boundaries of the Fourth, Eighth and Twelfth Judicial Circuits and Prescribing When said Circuit Courts shall tak.e Jurisdiction and the\u2019Effect on Pending Cases and the Time for Holding The Term of Courts in the Fourth and Twelfth Judicial Circuits.</p><p id=\"b673-6\">Section 1.

There shall be a State Attorney for the Twelfth Judicial.

The Fall Term of said Court shall commence in the County of Clay on the third Monday in October, in the county of St; Johns on the third Monday in November, and in the County of Putnam on the second Monday in December.</p><p id=\"b675-5\">Section 8.
