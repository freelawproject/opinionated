The findings are conclusive if sustained by any substantial evidence. Phillips v. Commissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 51 S.Ct. 608, 75 L.Ed. 1289; Helvering v. Rankin, 295 U.S. 123, 55 S.Ct. 732, 79 L.Ed. 1343; American Sav. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Burnet (C.C.A.) 45 F. (2d) 548. The issue is whether the findings award was warranted that the debt deducted from the income tax return for 1929 was worthless that year or should, as the Board found, have been deducted prior to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-24\">Section 23, Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 799, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23 and note, Deductions for Gross Income, provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-25\">\u201cIn computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u201c(j) Bad Debts. Debts ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the taxable year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Treasury Regulations 74, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1928, Art. 191, which have the force of law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides among other things:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u201cWhere the surrounding circumstances indicate that a debt is worthless and un-collectible and that legal action to enforce payment would in all probability not result in the satisfaction of execution on a judgment, a showing of these facts will be sufficient evidence of the worthlessness of the debt for the purpose of deduction. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Honesty of belief of the taxpayer in the worth of an asset in charging the same off is not binding on the Board of Tax Appeals. Revenue Act 1924, \u00a7 900 (43 Stat. 336, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1211-1222 [Old Title]) ; Avery v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C.C.A.) 22 F.(2d) 6, 55 A.L.R. 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Where the liabilities of the debtor are large and he has no available assets and such situation has continued for many years, even though during two or three times the debtor would recoup some funds or collateral, but applied none to liquidating any of his indebtedness and again lose same in new enterprises, the ultimate fact of worthlessness drawn from the probative facts is the function of the Board of Tax Appeals and the court is bound by such findings if there is any substantial evidence to sustain the findings.

United States, 292 U.S. 282-287, 54 S.Ct. 692-694, 78 L.Ed. 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The instant debt, the finding states, was inaugurated in 1910 for $110,000, payable July 6, 1913, for the purpose of acquiring the stock and properties of the Western Steel Corporation. In 1912 this corporation, the debtor\u2019s sole asset, failed. At about this time judgment was entered against the debtor for $1,000,000. There was other indebtedness of the debtor. No payments were made upon the debt in issue. To avoid the bar'of the statute of limitations suit was commenced against the debtor upon this claim in 1918. On July 27, 1918, after suit, a new note was executed for principal and interest for $163,930.07 and the suit dismissed and' an agreement entered into that within one year the creditor would accept $26,649.75 in full for the note. This was not paid. Nothing was paid on the indebtedness and in 1927 suit was commenced by the holder of this note to avoid it being barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">In 1918 it appears the debtor \u201csuffered a nervous breakdown and went to Florida. For two years he was under the care of doctors.\u201d The debtor' recovered his health largely, if not altogether. On September 23, 1918, the debtor wrote to the creditor with relation to this indebtedness and spoke of the judgment of $1,000,000 against him and of the instant indebtedness and stated with this all hanging over him that it was impossible to do anything and concluded the letter by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-13\">\u201cThere are some good things in the country but I dare not touch them \u2014 In fact that judgment makes an absolute coward of me \u2014 and as I get older I become more cowardly \u2014 Now H. E. you understand the situation \u2014 Can you help change it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">And in the letter suggested that something be done to satisfy the million dollar judgment which he said could be done for $100,000; that the holder had offered to take $75,000 in satisfaction from him some time'before, but he could not do it. The only hope of the creditor for payment was a \u201cstrike\u201d which would make returns sufficient to meet all his liabilities. The dynamic energy,, the superior qualities and ability to achieve, to transform and to accomplish, which had been demonstrated by the accumulation of several million dollars, and loss thereof, as stated, and the nervous breakdown requiring the trip to Florida in search of health in 1918, and the confession that this indebtedness \u201cmakes an absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>coward of me \u2014 and as I get older I become more cowardly,\u201d and the very large indebtedness; and the long period of time over which it extended without any payments of interest' or principal, or the exercise of any of the options to satisfy the two large claims of indebtedness for a low percentage thereof, was certainly sufficient to overcome hope and confidence in the confirmance of any value in this asset. Justice Stone in U. S. v. S. S. White Dental Mfg. Co., 274 U.S. 398, at page 403, 47 S.Ct. 598, 600, 71 L.Ed. 1120, said: \u201cThe taxing act does not require the taxpayer to be an incorrigible optimist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The findings of the Board of Tax Appeals are amply sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Boske v.
