E. and Dora Moore, as parties of the first part, made and entered into a written contract with F. M. Setchell, as party of the second part, providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-21\">\u201cFor One Dollar and other valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, parties of the first part agree:\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-22\">\u201cTo accept on the purchase price of real estate and any other property herein referred to or mentioned, and, to credit, One Hundred Dollars and accrued interest on' the purchase price, for each one hundred dollar share of the Western Power, Light &amp; Telephone Co., stock received by or thru F.

In case of failure of second party to complete any of the covenants on his part of this agreement to forfeit all payments made if first parties so desire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The contract also contained this additional agreement on his part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">\u201cIn the event second party completes his part of this deal or is \u25a0 able to complete it, he agrees to tender six shares of the above-named stock to first parties on an option to buy a rooming house now known as the (Norwood) in Larned and eighty acres of land located southeast of Larned, Ks. Said rooming house and land to be priced at $8,700.00 net total to first parties ($3200.00 land, $5500.00 rooming house), the six shares of stock to apply as six hundred dollars on purchase price. Balance to be paid on basis of two hundred fifty dollars and seven per cent interest on unpaid balance twice a year on each of the properties beginning six months after this deal is completed and each six months thereafter until paid. Purchaser to pay last half of taxes on said eighty acres and rooming house when due and to receive all rents on said properties from this date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">On October 22, 1932, the Moores brought suit in the district court of. Pawnee county, Kan., against Setchell, in which action they sought to have this contract adjudged null and void and ordered canceled and held for naught, and prayed that their title in and to the real property described in the .contract be quieted in them, and that the defendant be excluded from any right, title, or interest in or to the same. They also prayed for general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">The suit was removed from the state court to the court below by the defendant Setchell. After removal Setchell filed his answer putting in issue the allegations of the petition pertinent to the decision of the case. He also set up as a defense in his answer that the facts alleged in the petition were insufficient to constitute a cause of action in equity. By way of cross-bill he set up the same contract of January 18, 1932, entered into between him and the Moores, and alleged that he had fully performed all the conditions required of him *on his part, that he was ready, willing, and able to carry out the contract according to its terms, and prayed specific performance by the Moores. To the cross-bill the Moores filed a reply in'which they, as an affirmative defense, repeated in substance and effect. the allegations contained in their petition. In the affirmative defense contained in their reply-they alleged that the .contract was void and contrary to public policy and, in violation of certain sections of the Blue Sky Law of the State of Kansas, for reasons in the reply detailed. Among other alleged violations of the Blue Sky Law of the state they alleged that the defendant was engaged in the business of buying the stock of the Western Power, Light &amp; Telephone Company for the purpose of reselling the same to the plaintiffs; that he was 'not the issuer or owner of said stock; that he was also engaged in the business of selling the stock of other corporations in the state of Kansas; and that he was not a licensed broker or authorized to sell such securities in the state of Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">On April 2, 1935, W. E. Moore having theretofore been adjudged insane, Fay Meador, his duly appointed guardian, was substituted as party plaintiff in the action in his stead. On the 3d of April, 1935, the cause came on for hearing before the trial court, at which time Setch-ell\u2019s attorney informed the court that he was unable to proceed with the trial at that time, and upon plaintiff\u2019s application the court made an order referring the case to a referee to take the testimony and report his findings of the facts. Thereafter the case was heard by the referee and findings of the facts reported by him to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">At the hearing before the referee it was stipulated by, defendant\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-16\">\u201cThat the- defendant F. M. Setchell did not at any time prior to the execution of the contracts referred to in this action, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>at any other time, have a broker\u2019s or agent\u2019s license to sell or deal in the sale of stock or speculative securities within the State of Kansas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">On the 23d day of March, 1936, the court, upon the evidence and the findings of the facts by the referee, made conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201cThat the contract referred to in the pleadings of said parties is void and un-inforcible for the following reasons, to-wit:\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">\u201cSaid contract does not have inserted upon the face thereof the notations required by section 17 \u2014 1239, R.S.Supp. 1931.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201cThe securities referred to in said contract were not registered in Kansas and their sale had not been authorized as required by the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">\u201cThe defendant was not at the time of the signing of the contract the owner <em>of </em>issuer of said securities mentioned therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">\u201cThe defendant was not a licensed broker, and the transactions in selling said securities were in violation of section 17 \u2014 1223, Supp.1931 subd. (4).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">\u201cThe sales made by the defendant of the securities mentioned constituted repeated and successive sales of the same security.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\">\u201cSaid contract fails to comply with the Statute of Frauds in that there is nothing in the contract describing or identifying a part of the real estate referred to in said contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">\u2014and thereupon entered its decree wherein it was ordered and adjudged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-13\">\u201cThat the contract set forth in plaintiff\u2019s petition be and the same is hereby declared void and uninforcible, and said contract is hereby decreed cancelled and set aside, and it is further ordered and decreed that the answer and cross-petition of the defendant for specific performance of said' contract be and the same is hereby denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">Counsel for the appellant in their brief discuss the question of the sufficiency of the petition of plaintiffs to support the decree entered in the] case. As already indicated, the same issues arose upon the cross-bill and the reply thereto as were stated or attempted to be stated in the petition. Since the findings of the referee and the conclusions and decree'of the trial court logically and legally respond to the issues arising on the cross-bill of appellant and the reply of appel-lees thereto, it is not necessary to the decision of the case on its merits to pass upon the sufficiency of the petition. In fact, to do so would be a mere idle gesture. Sanders v. Village of Riverside (C. C.A.) 118 F. 720; Southern Lumber Corp. v. Doyle (D.C.) 204 F. 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-17\">As we have seen, the trial court found that the defendant Setchell was not a licensed broker and the transactions in selling said securities were in violation of section 17 \u2014 1223 Supp.1931, subd. 4. That section of the statute in part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-18\">\u201c(4) \u2018Broker\u2019 shall mean and include every person, other than an agent, who sells directly or through an agent any securities of which he \u2022 is not the issuer. \u2018Broker\u2019 shall also include every person, other than an agent, who engages, or professes to engage, either for all or part of his time, directly or through an agent, in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring any securities of which he is not the issuer for another or for the purpose of reselling same to others, or of accepting and executing buy and sell orders for such securities for a commission, or of buying, selling, or otherwise dealing or trading in such securities for a commission or at a profit, whether such securities are exempted by section 2 hereof or are sold by such person acting as representative in a manner exempted by section 3 (1) hereof or not. Any person who acts as promoter for and on behalf of an issuer to be formed shall be deemed a broker. \u2018Dealer\u2019 shall mean \u2018broker* as herein defined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-19\">\u201c(5) \u2018Issuer\u2019 shall mean and include every person who proposes to issue, has issued, or shall hereafter issue any securities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-20\">\u201c(6) \u2018Agent\u2019 shall mean and include every person, other than a broker, employed, appointed or authorized, by an issuer or broker to do anything subject to the provisions of this act. The term \u2018agent\u2019 shall not include the partners of a partnership or officers of a corporation or association licensed as a broker or for whom securities are registered. \u2018Salesman\u2019 shall mean agent as herein defined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-21\">In addition to the foregoing section, section 17 \u2014 1230, 1931 Supp.R.S.Kan.1923, in part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\u201c17 \u2014 1230. Registration of brokers. No broker shall engage in business in this state as such broker, or sell any security, including securities exempted in section 2 of this act, except in transactions exempted under section 3 of this act, unless he has been registered as a broker in the office of the bank commissioner pursuant to the provisions of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Setchell could not lawfully sell the stock of the Western Power, Light &amp; Telephone Company without a broker\u2019s license unless the transaction came within the exemption of section 3 of the act above mentioned (R.S.Supp.Kan.1931, 17\u2014 1225). This section in part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">\u201cThe provisions of this act, except as herein expressly provided, shall not apply to sales of the following character:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">' \u201c(1) Any isolated sale of any security by the issuer or owner thereof, or by a representative for the account of such issuer or owner, such sale not being made in the course of repeated and successive sales of securities of the same issue by such issuer or owner or by such representative for the account of such issuer or owner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The evidence taken at the hearing before the referee and his findings thereon support the conclusion of the court that the defendant Setchell was a broker within the meaning of the statutes above quoted. But in addition to the extraneous evidence introduced at the hearing before the referee, an inspection of the contract, in connection with the situation of the parties at the time it was made, convinces that Setchell himself intended to deal with the Moores as a broker. The record shows that prior to the date of this contract the Moores had purchased from or acquired through Setchell shares of this same stock. In his cross-bill he alleged that \u201con and prior to the 18th day of January, 1932, plaintiffs were the owners of a large number of shares of stock of the Western Power, Light &amp; Telephone Company * * *; that on or about the 18th of January, A. D. 1932, plaintiffs expressed a desire to the defendant for additional shares of said stock issued by said company, and thereupon plaintiffs and defendant entered into\u201d the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">Remembering now that the Moores were desirous of obtaining more shares of this stock, that they had previously acquired this stock from him or through him, and having expressed a desire to obtain additional shares, he and they make the agreement by which in exchange' for certain real estate and other property for a stipulated price \u25a0 of $24,000, he would attempt to fill the order at $100 per share for the stock, provided he was given until the 15th .day of July next to do so. In the contract the Moores agreed in consideration of one dollar and other valuable consideration, receipt of which was acknowledged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-13\">\u201cTo accept on the purchase price of real estate and any other property herein referred to or mentioned, and, to credit, One Hundred Dollars and accrued interest on the purchase price, for each one hundred dollar share of the Western Power, Light &amp; Telephone Co., stock received by or thru F. M. Setchell or A. X. Erickson as Trustee, on or before July 15th, 1932. (Refers to seven per cent, preferred stock.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-14\">\u201cTo, Twenty-four Thousand Dollars ($24,000.00) and seven per cent interest (payable quarterly) on any unpaid balance of said $24,000.00, as the purchase price of:\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">Then follows the description of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">The Moores further agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-17\">\u201cTo not divulge any information to unconcerned parties regarding any part of this deal until same may have been completed in full.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-18\">\u201cTo relinquish all rights, and do here7 by sell, assign and transfer all our present interests and title in connection with, or on real estate and other properties upon completion of this agreement by or thru second party, to any party or parties as directed by F. M. Setchell. When said purchase price shall have been received, to execute warranty deeds of conveyance to the said real estate with merchantable abstract of title, showing that said properties are free and clear of in-cumbrance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-19\">By these agreements the Moores were to accept 240 shares of the Western Power, Light &amp; Telephone Company\u2019s stock for the real estate and other property described. They agreed to sell, assign, and transfer this property upon the receipt of this stock \u201cto any party or parties as directed by F. M. Setchell.\u201d So far \u00e1s the undertakings upon the part of the Moores are concerned, it might well be that Set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>chell was acquiring this property for himself hy means of an exchange of the stock for the real estate and other property, but we note that he on his part agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">\u201cTo try to effect this deal as stated above, or if impossible to do so, to try to obtain cash or the equivalent in the amount of the purchase price.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u201cTo waive all claim of commission from first parties, in event this deal is made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">\u201cTo not divulge information to unconcerned parties regarding this deal until same may have been completed in full.\u201d \u201cTo have any stock that may be delivered on this deal properly assigned to first parties, or as they may direct. In case of failure of second party to complete any of the covenants on his part of this agreement to forfeit all payments made if first parties so desire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u201cTo try to' effect this deal as stated above, or if impossible to do so, to try to obtain cash or the equivalent in the amount of the purchase price,\u201d is the language of a broker. \u201cTo waive all claim of commission from first parties, in event this deal is made,\u201d is also the language of a broker. The commission waived might either refer to a commission to be claimed from the Moores on account of the sale or exchange of their real estate and other property, or it might relate to a commission to be claimed on the stock purchased or acquired for them to be paid for by the conveyance of the real estate. In either case it would be a broker\u2019s commission. In addition, both parties agreed to \u201cnot divulge information to unconcerned parties regarding this deal until same may have been completed in full.\u201d This arrangement for secrecy implies that Setchell contemplated making his profit by obtaining the corporation stock from third parties at less than $100 per share, or by the sale to third parties of the real estate and other property for \u25a0\u25a0more than $24,000, or by both. If third parties with whom he might deal knew nothing of his arrangement, they would not be influenced by it. He further undertook to 1 have \u201cany stock that may be delivered on this deal properly assigned to first parties, or as they may direct.\u201d Nowhere so far has Setchell assumed any financial obligation whatever, nor does he in fact do so or intend to do so in the provision that \u201cin case of failure of second party to complete any of the covenants on his part of this agreement to forfeit all payments made if first parties so desire.\u201d As his only covenants were to try to effect the deal as stated or to obtain cash or its equivalent, if he did try and failed, no forfeiture under this provision could be enforced, and in addition to the fact that under the contract he was not required to make partial payments, the record shows he made no tender of any stock until he tendered the 246 shares mentioned in the contract. By this contract the defendant Setchell did not buy or undertake to buy the Moores\u2019 real estate and other property, nor did he sell or agree to sell to them one share of the Western Power, Light &amp; Telephone Company\u2019s stock. He only agreed to try to secure 240 shares of this stock for the Moores at $100 a share, to be paid for by the real estate and other property, provided he could make the deal in some way.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Apparently as an afterthought there was added to the contract the paragraph above quoted, reading:</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">\u201cIn the event second party complete his part of this deal or is able to complete it, he agrees to tender six shares of the above-named stock to first parties on an option to buy a rooming house now known as the (Norwood) in Larned and eighty acres of land located southeast of Larned, Ks. Said rooming house and land to be priced at $8,700.00 net total to first parties ($3200.00 land, $5500.00 rooming house), the six shares of stock to apply as six hundred dollars on purchase price. Balance to be paid on basis of two hundred fifty dollars and seven per cent interest on unpaid balance twice a year on each of the properties beginning six months after this deal is completed and each six months thereafter until paid. Purchaser to pay last half of taxes on said eighty acres and rooming house when due and to receive all rents on said properties from this date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">The language of this paragraph leaves much to the imagination respecting this so-called option to buy \u201ca rooming house now known as the (Norwood) in Larned and eighty acres of land located southeast of Larned, Ks.\u201d Assuming that this language referred to some understanding or agreement theretofore entered into between Setchell and the Moores, it will be noted that in this reference no description of the eighty acres of land located <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>southeast of Larned is given, no consideration moving to the Moores for the option is mentioned, and it fails to disclose any agreement on the part of the Moores to perform. But passing by these omissions, as the so-called option involves six shares of the stock which is involved in the main contract, that paragraph must stand or fall with the main contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Section 17 \u2014 1240, 1931, Supp.R.S.Kan. 1923, provides that: \u201cEvery sale or contract for sale made in violation of any of the provisions of this act shall be voidable at the election of the purchaser.\u201d The contract between the Moores and Setchell was in violation of section 17 \u2014 1223, Supp.1931, subd. (4), and was unenforceable against the Moores when they so elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
