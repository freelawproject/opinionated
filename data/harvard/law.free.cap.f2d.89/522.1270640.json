The matter was referred to a special master, who, after an extended hearing, filed his report on May 18, 1934, fixing the value of all of plaintiff\u2019s property, used and useful, at $20,282,143. He found a reasonable rate of return to be 6 per cent, and that the rates fixed by the commission would produce $1,294,566.51, or slightly in excess of 6 per cent. Upon exceptions the District Court, on November 29, 1935, varied the findings of the special master in three important particulars by (1) excluding from the property of the company to be considered in the determination of value a tract of some 4,854 acres of land known as the \u201cOak-landon\u201d project, (2) increasing the value to be given certain water rights from $358,605 fixed by the master to $500,000, and (3) by increasing the item of cost of common labor entering into reproduction costs by $1,333,333. These changes moved the court to fix an aggregate value on the company\u2019s property of $21,392,821. In all other respects the report of the special master was approved, and the changes noted in the court\u2019s findings did not cause it to reach a different ultimate conclusion than that reached by the master, to wit, that the promulgated rates were adequate and not confiscatory. From this conclusion, expressed in a decree, the company appeals assigning many errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>The Public Service Commission had, at -the conclusion of its investigations in 1932, fixed the aggregate value of the company\u2019s property used and useful in the furnishing of water service at $22,500,000 and had authorized and directed the placing in effect on January 1, 1933, the following schedule of rates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\">First 500 cubic feet $0.25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"auq-dedup-0\">Next 1500 \u201c \u201c .18</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a9n-dedup-0\">Next 2500 \" .16</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO7\">Next 7500 \" .14</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdU\">Next 18000 \" \" .12</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ahx-dedup-0\">Next 20000 \" \u201c - .10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANq\">Next 50000 \" .08</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"amw-dedup-0\">Over 100000 \u201d ** .06</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOZ\">Monthly minimum charge per meter: 5/8 inch meter $1.25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXq\">8/4 \u201c &lt;&lt; 3.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axs\">1 \u201c 44 4.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"abs-dedup-0\">1% \u201c 44 7.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2q\">2 <em>u </em>\u2018 44 11.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1L\">3 \u201d 44 20.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_i\">4 \" 30.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Askv\">6 \" 44 50.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A38\">Public fire protection service:\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aef-dedup-0\">Annual charge per hydrant \u00a712.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfJ\">Annual charge per inch foot .0111</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u25a0 The commission said in its report at that time that such rates would, \u201caccording to estimates furnished by its accounting department,\u201d produce a gross income of $1,335,000 (slightly less than 6 per cent.), but expressed the opinion that such rates would produce a gross income of $1,400,000 (slightly more than 6 per cent.). The commission also, said in such report that such schedule of rates \u201cmay not yield a fair rate of return\u201d upon what was then indicated as the fair value of the company\u2019s property, \u201cbut the value found for the property has not and should not be pared down to fit the rates and revenues. The rates * * * are based upon all the evidence and conditions, particularly the prevailing economic depression. The Commission is of the opinion that with a return of normal business conditions, the rates now fixed will prove sufficient and compensatory, in any event, under the prevalent conditions, the rates established are all the Commission feels warranted in authorizing at this time, and any further recoupment of the Company\u2019s losses in revenues will have to come through regained volume of business rather than through rates higher in themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The commission in its verified answer, filed in this proceeding, averred that the valuation of the company\u2019s property, as found by it, was substantially correct, but later by amendment said that the value did not exceed the sum fixed by it ($22,-500,000) and offered evidence indicating a less value.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">We have given consideration to the many assignments of error urged upon us, and will refer briefly to the more important ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Oaklandon Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">Assignment of error No. 19 challenges the correctness of the holding of the District <em>Court </em>in excluding from consideration as nonused and nonuseful certain property of appellant known as the Oaklandon lands. The commission had included this in the rate base as had the. master who fixed its fair value at $364,050. The court agreed with the master as to, its fair value, but felt that under the circumstances it should not be included.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">These lands consisted of 4,854 acres located along and upon both sides of Fall creek, beginning at a point some 15 miles northeast of Indianapolis, and were acquired over a period of 4 or 5 years preceding the time of the hearing with the authority of the commission and for the purpose of establishing a reservoir for future water needs. It was the purpose at the time of the purchase to construct a dam near the lower boundary line of such tract and retard the flow of water in Fall creek and thus build a large reservoir. Appellant\u2019s engineer tesified that preliminary studies had been made with respect to the proposed dam and reservoir and detailed plans completed. It seems that the advent of the depression retarded the consumption of water, and this factor and others caused a slowing of the project. An examination of the evidence on this subject offers no justification for an assumption that the project has been abandoned. On the other hand, it requires a finding that the property was providently purchased and in good faith and is reasonably useful for appellant\u2019s business. Under such circumstances it should have been included in the rate base. Brooklyn Borough Gas Co. v. Prendergast (D.C.) 16 F.(2d) 615, and cases cited. The time when and the precise manner in which it shall be brought into active use is for its owners to determine. Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Company v.

Springfield Gas &amp; Electric Company, 291 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Ill. 209, 125 N.E. 891. If there comes a time when it appears no longer to be useful and not reasonably to be required for the future operations of the company or the needs and health of the community, it may be excluded. The evidence does not justify the conclusion that this time has yet arrived. The valuation fixed upon this land, of $364,050, by the court finds ample support in the evidence and should have been included in the valuation of appellant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Undistributed Construction Costs and Going Value.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">In assignment of error No. 18 appellant asserts that, while the court increased the special master\u2019s valuation of water rights and common labor costs in the aggregate amount of $1,474,728, it failed to reflect such increased values in its determination of \u201cundistributed construction costs\u201d and \u201cgoing value.\u201d These two latter elements are concedcdly proper factors to be given consideration in an appraisement of appellant\u2019s property. See Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, 238 U.S. 153, 35 S.Ct. 811, 59 L.Ed. 1244; Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., 246 U.S. 178, 38 S.Ct. 278, 62 L.Ed. 649; McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., 272 U.S. 400, 47 S.Ct. 144, 151, 71 L.Ed. 316; Los Angeles Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission, 289 U.S. 287, 53 S.Ct. 637, 77 L. Ed. 1180. In the instant case they were arrived at by both the master and court on a percentage basis. The agreed inventory, seemingly used by all the parties, had grouped the various items entering into the total property, as follo.ws:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">Item 1. Organization expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">Item 1A. Water rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">Item 2. Land (exclusive of improvements).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">Item 3. Buildings, fixtures and grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">Item 4. Pumping equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">Item 5. Intakes and supply mains.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">Item 6. Purification system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-13\">Item 7. Distribution system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">Item 8. General equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-15\">Item 0. Working capital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-16\">Undistributed construction costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-17\">Going value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-18\">In the determination of undistributed construction costs the four engineering witnesses had arrived at four separate figures which, when translated into percentages, computed upon items 1 to 8, inclusive, were as follows: Fuller 17.1 per cent., Pirnie 15.5 per cent., Wenger 14.9' per cent., Hansen 14.8 per cent. The master concluded, that an allowance of 15 per cent, upon the depreciated value of such items 1 to 8, inclusive, was a fair allowance for undistributed construction costs, and with this the court agreed, but failed to extend such percentage computation to the added value above indicated of $1,474,728. The question is not whether a fixed percentage of items 1 to 8, inclusive, would have been a proper basis in itself for the determination of undistributed construction costs, as it appears that all of the experts who testified used a more scientific basis to arrive at their figures; but this was only the machinery adopted by the master and court for interpreting their conclusions. Having adopted such means, it was. necessary, in order tc follow through on'this basis, to apply same to the increased value given to such items. This would have been in harmony with the evidence, and would have been a correct application of the expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-21\">The same is true of the item of going value where the master and court adopted as, a proper valuation 9% per cent, of items 1 to'9, inclusive, but the court failed to give effect to \u25a0this in the added value placed.on. the property by it. These two discrepancies, if corrected on the basis of the. court\u2019s valuations, would add an additional value of $361,308.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-22\">It is also contended that the percentage applied, in order to ascertain \u201cgoing value,\u201d should likewise have been extended to whatever sum was found to fairly represent undistributed construction costs, as well as items 1 to 9 aforesaid. This we think fair and more nearly responsive to the evidence upon the subject. This correction on the basis of the court\u2019s findings of value of undistributed construction costs (plus the correction hereinbefore indicated) would add to the item of going value the sum of $250,079.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-23\">Effect of Rising Trend in Prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-24\">It is to be noted that the testimony before the master as well as the findings of the master and. court with reference to value were directed to April 1, 1933. The court, however, recognizing what we deem to., be a correct principle, found that the sum of $21,392,821 was not only a fair and reasonable value op that date but \u201cwas the fair and reasonable value thereof as of the time of filing the report of the Special Master (May 18, 1934), and as of the .date of these findings (Nov. 29, 1935) and that such value will continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>to be a fair and reasonable value of the Plaintiff\u2019s used and useful property for a reasonable time in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Assignments of error 16 and 17 deal with what appellant asserts was the failure of the court to give any effect to the definite increase and upward trend of values from April 1, 1933, to the date of the final decree (November 29, 1935). The master had found (which finding had been approved by the court) that \u201cthere was no indication on April 1, 1933, nor has there been at any time since, that there would be any definite trend, either upward or downward, for a reasonable time in the future, as to prices or values of any of the items of property owned by plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJY\">From the date as of which the valuations were fixed (April 1, 1933) to the date of the court\u2019s decree (November 29, 1935), 32 months had intervened. For one to say on April 1, 1933, what the trend of values was to be for the next ensuing 32 months was prophecy, but on November 29, 1935, we had, at least for this period, definitely passed from the field of speculation to one of experience. Experience had taught that for those 32 months there had been a constant and definite trend upward in commodity values. The \u201cEngineering News Record,\u201d referred to by the parties as a reasonably reliable guide as to price trends, furnishes the following index figures for a 5-year period: 1931 \u2014 181.35; 1932 \u2014 156.97; 1933\u2014 170.18; '1934 \u2014 198.10; 1935 \u2014 195.22. The \u201cAll Commodities Index. of the United States Department of Labor\u201d tells the same graphic story of the rise of prices during the same period but somewhat less conservatively than above noted. We think, therefore, that the court\u2019s findings in this respect were contrary to facts that we must judicially know and must recognize in determining a fair valuation of appellant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">It is recognized that values as applied to utility properties experience marked fluctuations from time to time. The purpose to be achieved in a determination of value is to give recognition to any increase or decrease in values at the time under consideration in order to reach a fair valuation not only for the moment but for the reasonably near future. A redeter-mination of values and rates cannot be had at frequent intervals, and consequently a determination that gives full recognition to the immediate future years is to be sought. This will largely be prophecy, unless facts are at hand that are more convincing than prophecy. We think in this instance facts were at hand that overrode the prophecy. This principle was given recognition in McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., supra; Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Company v. Public Service Commission, supra; West Ohio Gas Company v. Public Utilities Commission, 294 U.S. 79, .55 S.Ct. 324, 79 L.Ed. 773; West v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Company, 295 U.S. 662, 55 S.Ct. 894, 898, 79 L.Ed. 1640. In the case of West v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Company, supra, decided June, 1935, the Supreme Court, in rejecting a valuation by the Maryland commission, said: \u201cAs shown by the commission\u2019s exhibits, the, price trend was gradually ascending from 1923 to 1929. It then suffered a precipitate decline so-that at December, 1932, the date of the commission\u2019s valuation, it was at the nadir.. Since then it has made a sharp recovery. The commission recognized this. Its report and order were made November 28, 1933. At that time the price level, as shown by the all-commodities index of the United States Department of Labor, had' arisen 13.1 per cent, over that of December 31, 1932. * * * What the commission in effect did was to take the temporary low level of December, 1932, and' apply' this low' level for the indefinite-future in ascertaining the- so-called fair-value of the company\u2019s plant and property. The experience of the two years which have elapsed since the commission\u2019s order clearly indicates the impropriety of the use of \"its method in the appraisal of a property such as that of this company.\u201d We have quoted at length from the court\u2019s-opinion on account of the similarity of dat\u00e9s and the similarity of the point before the court with that now under consideration. The appraisal by the commission in the instant case was in the fall\u2019 of 1932, termed the \u201cnadir\u201d of the depression; the subsequent fixing of values by the master was as of April 1, 1933, with a finding that there was no indication at that time, or since, that there would be a definite trend \u201ceither upward or downward\u201d in prices and values. We now find that there was a definite rise in commodity-prices . of approximately 25 per cent, during the 32-month period referred to which-was bound to be reflected in the appraisement of appellant\u2019s property. We think-under the authorities referred to this gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>eral and persistent rise in prices should have been given effect in fixing a fair valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">But appellees- say, \u201cHow about appellant\u2019s income? Did it follow the price index and increase? * * * If good times bring high prices, they also bring increased revenues which would offset any assumed rise in values.\u201d This by no means follows. The rate of course remains stationary and unaffected, and any increase in revenues due to a general appreciation of values could only be effected by an increased use of the commodity. In the case of the ordinary merchant it would be hoped that the suggested formula would apply \u2014 and even in the case of some utilities, notably electric current, with its remarkable increase in consumption in recent years, an increase in revenue in step with advancing values might more reasonably be expected; but in the case of a company selling water this would not be marked and could in no event be in any substantial ratio to the rise in prices generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Rate of Return.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The unprecedented depression which has engulfed our country in recent years and which has amounted to an economic upheaval of worldwide magnitude, has injected into the question of what is an adequate return questions not ordinarily present. When the question of an adequate rate for this identical utility was before the Supreme Court in 1926 (McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., supra), the court, in approving a return of 7 per cent., said: \u201cIt is obvious that rates of yield on investments in bonds plus brokerage is substantially less than the rate of return required to constitute just- compensation for the use of properties in the public service. Bonds rarely constitute the source of all the money required to finance public utilities. And investors insist on higher yields on stock than current rates of interest on bonds. Obviously, the cost of money to finance the whole enterprise is not measured by interest rates plus brokerage on bonds floated for only a part of the investment. The evidence is more than sufficient to sustain the rate of 7 per cent, found by the commission. - And recent decisions support a higher rate of return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">In the recent case of West v. Chesapeake &amp; P. Tel. Co., supra, the commission had thought that a rate of 6 per cent, was a proper return, and the District Court had held that 6 per cent, was the limit \u2022beyond which the return could not be reduced without confiscation. In affirming the decree of the District Court enjoining the commission, the Supreme Court declined to discuss the rate of return.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Witnesses Dickson and Hill thought a return of 8 per cent, would be required by the company; witnesses Miller and Hansen believed that 6 per cent, was an adequate return; and the witness Payne was of the opinion that a return somewhere between 5 and 6 per cent, was adequate. The master found that 6 per cent, would be adequate under efficient and economical management to maintain and support its credit and enable it to raise the money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duties. With this finding the District Court agreed, and we think such conclusion finds ample support in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">The previous expression of the Supreme Court, indicating approval of a return of 7 per cent., is to be weighed by the conditions then confronting the court (1926), and we have given it the consideration that we respectfully feel it entitled as viewed at this date and under present conditions. We agree with the District Court that 6 per cent, was adequate under existing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">Net Income Applicable to Return.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">A dispute has also arisen with reference to the income properly applicable to return. The master found that income applicable to return for the year 1933 and for a reasonable time thereafter would be $1,294,566.51, which was some $57,000 higher than the testimony of any witness indicated. The witness Williams, chief accountant for the commission, estimated that the net income applicable to return for the year 1933 would be $1,237,294. Witness Hill for the company found the figure to be $1,206,257. It is unnecessary to detail the master\u2019s process of reasoning by which he arrived at his figure, but it is not without merit. We would, however, feel obliged to strike it down as being without substantial support in the evidence were it not for the fact that he had, before making his report (May 18, 1934), given the company the opportunity of again presenting evidence of the actual operating receipts and disbursements for the calendar year of 1933, and, upon consideration, its counsel declined to offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>further proof. The question of what the net income had been for the year, 1933, under the new schedule of rates, was not at that time any longer a matter of estimates but had become an established fact and the facts were in the possession of the company. Prophecy was then entitled to give way to experience and under such circumstances, if the company chose to remain silent with the facts in its possession, it is in no position to complain. We therefore accept the figures as found by the master and approved by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The correction of the errors herein-before specifically referred to, without reference to the failure to give effect to the rise of values generally, would produce a return of less than 6 per cent. It is unnecessary for us to- undertake an application of the upward trend of prices since April 1, 1933, to the specific items of appellant\u2019s inventory or to say in what amount a proper consideration of same would enhance the value to be given appellant\u2019s property. Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., 292 U.S. 151, 54 S.Ct. 658, 78 L.Ed. 1182. It is sufficient to observe that it would be so substantial as to make the questioned rates clearly confiscatory. Narrowly stated, our function is to ascertain whether an application of the proposed rates would amount to a confiscation of appellant\u2019s property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. We conclude that it would. \u2019 The decree of the District Court is reversed and the' cause remanded, with directions for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
