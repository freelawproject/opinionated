Each of them offered the defense of an alibi. On considering the evidence the jury refused to accept their defenses and found them guilty. That finding is supported by substantial evidence, and, it appearing that no error was committed by the court in submitting the issue to the jury, it is ordered that the judgments be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
