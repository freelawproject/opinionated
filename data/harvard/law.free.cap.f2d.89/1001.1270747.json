This exception was based upon the refusal of the trial court to dismiss the cause at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony upon his case in chief, it being the contention of the appellants that the plaintiff had made no case. No bill of exceptions has been settled or signed by the trial judge and none is part of the record before us. We must therefore refrain from expressing any opinion as to the merits of the controversy involved. The ruling of the federal courts in this respect has been well settled, as follows: \u201cIn the federal courts in actions at law a bill of exceptions, stating the ruling and the exception, settled and signed by the trial judge, is indispensable to the review of rulings on motions, oral or written, to strike out pleadings, as well as rulings on motions based on the evidence, or requests for instructions.\u201d Chicago Great Western Ry.
