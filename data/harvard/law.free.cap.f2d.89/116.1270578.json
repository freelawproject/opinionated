(hereinafter called \u201cthe board in control\u201d), to its own credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-16\">The action was brought by virtue and under authority of section 1114 (e) (f) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (title 26, \u00a7 1610, U.S.C. [26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1610]). It is not an action against a taxpayer for the collection of a tax, but is a proceeding to enforce a statutory liability under the statute cited. The statute contains the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-17\">\u201cSection 1114. <em>* * </em>* (e) Any person in possession of property, or rights to property, subject to distraint, upon which a levy has been made, shall, upon demand by the collector or deputy collector making such levy, surrender such property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-18\">The record shows, and the trial court found, that the preliminary steps were properly taken by the Commissioner and the Collector of Internal Revenue such as making the assessment, serving and filing a notice of tax lien, issuing and serving the warrant for distraint, and levy upon the credit standing upon the books of the bank in the name of said board in control.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-19\">Various defenses were set up, but the one which was adopted by the court is that the property levied upon was not subject to distraint, but that it at.all times was the property of the University of the state of Iowa, and as such not subject to levy. We shall assume, without deciding, that the words \u201csubject to distraint\u201d permit inquiry as to the ownership of the property levied upon, as well as to the kind of property levied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-20\">Many of the facts are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-21\">The date of the levy under the warrant for distraint was October 21, 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-22\">It appeared that during the months of September, October, November, and December, 1932, football games were held at the University of Iowa, which were participated in by the students of that University and of other Universities. Tickets of admission were sold by the board in control, and in addition to the admission price, there was collected from each purchaser the federal tax imposed by section 500 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926^ as amend\u00e9d by section 711 of the Revenue Act of 1932 (26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 940 and note).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This admission money and the federal tax money, together with .other moneys collected by the board in control, were deposited in the defendant bank, and a copy of the deposit slip was handed by the board in control to the comptroller of the University. It may be noted in passing that this is not the usual way of transferring the right to bank deposits.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The account in the bank in which the money was deposited was designated': \u201cBoard in control of athletics\u201d; and checks against the account were signed: \u201cBoard in Control of Athletics, .Inc.,\u201d authenticated by the signatures of two of its officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">It appears that after some of the money had been collected including the tax, there arose a question in the minds of the board in control as to whether the government was entitled to the tax collected; and the said board directed the comptroller .of the University to establish a reserve for the amount of the tax, and this was established on the books of the University and was carried as such. Such amount of reserve was part of the amount on deposit in the defendant bank'to the credit of the board in control.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">Demand was duly made by the collector of internal revenue upon the defendants for the federal tax collected, but this, by authority of the officers of the state of Iowa, was refused by the defendants. Suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">The case was triable by a jury, but a jury was expressly waived by stipulation; and at the close of all the evidence each side submitted findings of fact and conclusions of law to the trial court. The court made findings and conclusions in favor of defendants. The findings in full are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Appeal is from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The vital findings were that the credits levied upon as the property of the board in control were in reality credits belonging to the State University of Iowa and not \u201csubject to distraint\u201d; and that, therefore, they did not come within the purview of section 1114 (e) of the Revenue Act of 1926. (See finding 27, and conclusion 9). There was a good deal of testimony offered as to the necessity of a physical education as a part of a general education, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>and to the effect that these athletic contests were an essential part of the physical education at the University. But as heretofore indicated, and as shown by the findings, the trial' court restricted the case to narrower issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">In its memorandum opinion accompanying the findings, the trial court says (13 F. Supp. 380, 382):</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\u201cAlthough many questions are presented, the question to be determined by this court is whether the money levied upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>and in the hands of the defendant bank was subject to distraint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">And again:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u201cPlaintiff having definitely alleged, according to the terms of section 1114, that the property was subject to distraint, and the defendants having denied this, it seems to me that this question is not only directly in issue and can be determined in this suit, but that the burden of proof is on the government to establish that the fund levied upon was in fact subject to dis-traint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">And further:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">\u201cIt is true that a part of this fund was collected for and on behalf of the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>ment of the United States, but the fund itself had not been segregated from other property of the State University of Iowa, and until this was done it could not be considered in law as the property of the United States government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">Finally, the trial court specifically finds (finding 27) :</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">\u201cThat the money in the hands of the defendants and each of them and which is attempted to be levied upon and distrained by the plaintiff, and which is sought to be en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>forced in this' action, was at all times property and moneys of the State University of Iowa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">And concludes (conclusion 9) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\u201cThat under the law and the evidence, the funds on deposit in the First Capital National Bank of Iowa City, Iowa, defendant herein, on October 21, 1933, in an account designated Board in Control of Athletics, were not subject to distraint by the Collector of Internal Revenue for Federal taxes which have been assessed against the Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., for the months of September, October, November and December, 1932.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">One of the first questions which arises is: What was the status of the board in control in relation to the United States?</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">United States v. Johnston, 268 U.S. 220, 45 S.Ct. 496, 69 L.Ed. 925, decided May 11, 1925, holds that the relation of a similar collecting agent to the United States was that of debtor and creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">The board in control was, therefore, at least prima facie, indebted to the United States for the tax collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The board in control was incorporated in 1931 under the general law of the state of Iowa. Its general purpose was stated in article III of the articles of incorporation:</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">\u201cThe business and object of this corporation shall be to carry on intercollegiate sports and other athletic activities of the State University of Iowa, to promote athletic interest among the students of said university, and to manage the finances and business incident thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">The corporation had no stock, and we may assume, though it is not strictly proven, that it was controlled by the State University of Iowa.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">The board in control in its work used papers bearing its name with the abbreviation \u201c(Inc.)\u201d following. This was known to the bank to the University authorities, and to the collector of internal revenue of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">The board in control had its own bank account in defendant bank, on which it drew checks which were signed by officers of the said board.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-15\">The board in control kept its own accounts and made its own balance sheets. It carried on the business for which it was formed in its own name, including the collection of admissions to athletic contests.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-16\">By virtue of the United States Statutes (section 500 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended by section 711 of the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 940 and note; and section 502 of the Revenue Act of 1926, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 955 (b, c, d), 956, 957), the board in control undertook to collect and did collect the federal tax on such admissions. It was the duty of the board in control to account for the money collected (see section 502 [a] [c] [d], 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 955 (b, c) 956, 957).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-17\">' The University fiscal authorities knew that the board in control was acting as collecting agent for the federal tax, and acquiesced in this activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-18\">The federal tax so collected was deposited by the board in control in defendant bank, and in making said deposit, said board mingled the federal tax with the moneys collected for admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-19\">Demand by the collector of internal revenue on the board in control for the federal tax collected was unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-20\">Thereafter, the usual and regular proceedings, including demand upon the defendant bank, were had, which also proved unavailing. These notices and demands required by law to be served were duly served upon defendants herein. The trial court so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-21\">Suit followed against the bank and its officers under section 1114 (e) of the Revenue Act of 1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-22\">It seems obvious that the board in control was qualified to act as collecting agent of the United States to collect the federal tax in question, and did so act. Relative to this matter the trial court, in its memorandum opinion, used the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-23\">\u201cIt is true that a part of this fund [admission tax] was collected for and on behalf of the government of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-24\">-But the trial court was of the opinion that because a segregation had not been made, the federal tax money could not be the property of the United States; and the trial court was also of the opinion that because the board in control was an agency of the State University, any fitnds in the hands of the board in control belonged to that University.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-25\">We cannot agree with the latter part of this conclusion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-26\">Whatever the relation which existed between the board in control and the University of the state of Iowa, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>board in control, with the consent of the University of the state of Iowa, undertook to act and did act as collecting agent for the United States in the collection of the federal admission tax, its relationship with the University of the state of Iowa with respect to the federal tax collected became of secondary importance. It was governed, while so acting for the United States, by the statutes of the United States and the regulations issued thereunder. The bank under the circumstances existing in the instant case was certainly in no position to assert that the tax moneys so collected by the board were funds belonging to the University of the state of Iowa.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">It may be noted at this point that the deposit in the bank, according to the finding of the trial court, belonged to the University of the state of Iowa; but according to the appellees\u2019 counsel, belonged to the state of Iowa. It stood in the name of neither on the books of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">If segregation of tax moneys collected and deposited by the board from other moneys collected and deposited by it were necessary, attention is called to the fact that such had already been made by the University authorities on their books.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">It should .also be noted that the demand made upon the bank and its officers did not cover the whole amount to the credit of the board in control, but simply extended to the amount of the federal tax with interest and penalty accruing by reason -of the nonpayment of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">There was standing to the credit of the board in control at the bank more than sufficient to pay the amount demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The State University, having acquiesced in the -collection of the admission taxes for the United States by the board in control, may not in this action against the bank assert ownership in itself of the federal taxes so collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The trial court has held that the validity of\u2019the federal tax cannot be litigated by the defendants in the present action. We are in accord with this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">We find in the record no ground upon which' can be justified the attempt by indirection to prevent the money collected as a federal tax from being surrendered to the United States. We think that credit arising from its deposit in the bank was subj ect to distraint as belonging to the Board in Control of Athletics of the Stat\u00e9 University of Iowa, Inc., which had collected it for the United States. The paying over by the bank to the United States of the tax moneys collected by the board for it will not deprive the University of Iowa of any funds or assets collected by the board for the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">We think also that the special defenses available under section 1114 (e) of the Revenue Act of 1926 were not proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">The judgment is reversed and a new trial granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-10\"> \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. \u201cFindings of Fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">\u201c1. This is an action at law of a civil nature arising under a law of Congress providing for internal revenue, brought by the United States of America, pursuant to subsections (e) and (f) of Section 1114 of the Revenue Act of 1926; and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has authorized and sanctions this proceeding. (Plaintiff I)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">\u201c2. At all times mentioned in the complaint on file herein the plaintiff, United States of America, was, and now is, a corporation sovereign and body politic. (Plaintiff II)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-18\">\u201c3. At all times mentioned in the complaint the defendant, First Capital National Bank of Iowa City, Iowa, was, and now is, a national banking corporation, duly organized, existing and operat-i\u00bbg under and by virtue of the National Banking Act, of the laws of the United States, with its principal place of business at Iowa City, in the Southern District of Iowa, and during all of said time, has been and now is engaged in the banking business in said city, state and district; and the defendants F. D. Williams and Thos. Farrell were, and now are, Vice-President and Cashier and Assistant Cashier of said defendant bank, and citizens and residents of said Iowa City and of said Southern District of Iowa. (Plaintiff III).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-21\">\u201c4. On or about March 2, 1931, there was incorporated, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 394, Title XIX, of the Code of Iowa, 1931, a corporation, by the name of The Board of Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., whose incorporators and board of directors for the first year were Henning Larson, Rollin M. Perkins, Howard L. Beye, C. C. Williams, R. A. Fenton, H. A. Kuever, C. A. Phillips, Edward H. Lauer, F. G. Higbee, Rush C. Butler, and W. Earl Hall, all except 'two of. whom were either officers of or members of the faculty of the State University of Iowa, and two of whom were representatives of the alumni of the State University of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Iowa. The officers of said corporation for the first year named in said Articles of Incorporation were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">\u201cC. C. Williams of Iowa City, Iowa,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">Chairman,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">\u201cE. L.

Prior to the incorporation of said The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., there existed at the State University of Iowa a certain faculty board or committee known as The Board in Control of Athletics, which carried on intercollegiate sports and other athletic sports participated in by students in attendance at the State University of Iowa. At the time of the incorporation of said corporation the members of said faculty board or committee were the same individuals who are described in said Articles of Incorporation as the first board of directors, and the officers of said corporation were either officers of or members of the faculty of said University. (Plaintiff V)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">\u201c6. The Articles of Incorporation of said The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University ef Iowa, Inc., provide\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b175-15\">\u201cThe business and object of this corporation shall be to carry en intercollegiate sports and other athletic activities of the State University of Iowa, to promote athletic interest among the students of said university, and to manage the finances and business incident thereto. (Plaintiff VI)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-16\">\u201c7. The Articles of Incorporation of said The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., further provide\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b175-17\">\u201cMembership of this corporation shall consist of those who may sign these articles of incorporation and their associates or successors, who may hereafter be elected and designated in accordance with the By-Laws of this corporation, but no person shall be or become a member of this corporation unless nominated for membership by the President of the State University of Iowa. (Plaintiff VII)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-18\">\u201c8. During the months of September, October, November, and December, 1932, said Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., had control of the athletic games and events in which teams composed of athletes who were students of said University of Iowa competed with teams composed of athletes who were students of other universities and colleges, to which spectators were admitted upon payment of the prescribed admission price plus the amount of admissions tax - imposed by Section 500 of the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended by Section 711 of the Revenue Act of 1932. (Plaintiff VIII)</p>\n<p id=\"Anv\">\u201c9. During said months of September, October, November, and December, 1932, athletic games or contests were held or played in and upon the grounds or campus of said University of Iowa, to which the general public was admitted as spectators upon payment of the prescribed admissions price plus the Federal tax. Such admissions price and Federal tax were evidenced by tickets, which tickets were sold, and said admissions charges plus Federal tax were collected by said The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., through certain of its officers, agents and servants. Each ticket of admission had printed on the face thereof the admission price, the amount of Federal tax, and the total of admission charge and tax. The full amount shown upon the face of each such ticket of admission, being admission price plus tax, was eol-lected from the purchaser of each ticket by said The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., its officers, agents, and servants. The funds so derived from the sale of tickets to athletic games and events for admission thereto, including the funds collected from purchasers of said tickets as and for the Federal admission tax, were collected and held by said The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., and by it deposited to its credit in the First Capital National Bank of Iowa City, Iowa, defendant herein, in an account designated as \u2018Board in Control of Athletics.\u2019 (Plaintiff IX)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-23\">\u201c10. Neither The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., nor any one on its behalf, made any returns of taxes so collected and required by law to be collected, to the Collector of Internal Revenue under Section 500 of the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>by Section 711 of the Revenue Act of 1932. (Plaintiff X)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u201c11. Upon the failure of said The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., to make returns and pay the tax on said admissions, the Collector of Internal Revenue for the Collection District of Iowa caused an investigation to be made of the books, records and accounts of said The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., and on July 31, 1933, determined that for said months of September, October, November, and December, 1932, said The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., had incurred a liability for admission taxes in the amount of $3,985.50, and an assessment in said amount was thereafter duly made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, together with interest thereon at the rate of one per cent, per month as provided by Section 502 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1926 [26 U.S.O.A. \u00a7 957] amounting at the date of said assessment to $350.39. (Plaintiff XI)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u201c12. Upon the assessment of said tax and interest as aforesaid, the said Collector of Internal Revenue demanded'payment of said tax and interest of the said The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., hut said The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., neglected and refused and still neglects and refuses to pay the same or any part thereof, and said tax and interest and the whole thereof remain unpaid. (Plaintiff XII)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u201c13. The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University \u2019 of Iowa, Inc., having failed to pay said tax and interest within ten days after demand, the Collector of Internal Revenue added thereto under the provisions of Section 3184 of the Revised Statutes, a penalty of five per cent., amounting to $216.79. (Plaintiff XIII rearranged by the Court) \u201c14. On September 13, 1933, said Collector of Internal Revenue duly filed for record in the office of the Clerk of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Iowa, and also in the office of the Recorder of Johnson County, Iowa, a notice of tax lien on all the property of said The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., as authorized by Section 3186 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by Section 613 of the Revenue Act of 1928. (Plaintiff XIV rearranged by the Court)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">\u201c15. Upon failure and refusal of the Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., to pay said taxes, the Collector of Internal Revenue for the District of Iowa, issued, or caused the issuance of a warrant for dis-traint, Number 83280, on October 3, 1933, which he placed, or caused to be placed, in the hands of George Koehn, Deputy Collector of Internal Revenue of said District, for service thereof. (Plaintiff XV rearranged by the Court)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">\u201c16. On October 21, 1933, George Koehn, C. E. Doak, and P. E. Garrett, Deputy Collectors of Internal Revenue for the District of Iowa, served said warrant for distraint and levied upon the money, credit, bank deposit and bank account property rights of The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., in the hands of the defendants, and each of them, and forthwith served notice of levy on bank deposits and demand upon defendants, and each of them. (Plaintiff XVI)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">\u201c17. At the time of such levy, demand and service of notice of levy on such money, credit, bank deposit and bank account property rights and demand upon defendants, there was in the hands of the defendants a credit balance to The Board in Control of Athletics of the State University of Iowa, Inc., of $21,356.70, which represented among other revenues proceeds from the sale of admission tickets to athletic events, and included the amounts collected as federal tax on such admissions to athletic events held during the months of September, October, November and December, 1932. (Plaintiff XVII rearranged by the Court)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">\u201c18.
