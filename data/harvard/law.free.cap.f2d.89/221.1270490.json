The city appeals under 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-24\">There was a motion to dismiss the bill, but no answer, and no evidence was heard. The case, therefore, has had no full development. The recitals of the attacked ordinances which are set out in the bill tend to show conditions justifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the prohibition in the areas they cover of filling stations and garages as potential nuisances there, by virtue of the general welfare and nuisance powers of the city. The allegations of the bill tend to show an arbitrary action taken since the grant of the building permit. Such a challenge of the city\u2019s power of government deserves careful investigation and deliberate consideration, involving as it does fact issues. The jurisdiction of the court is not questioned. It did not abuse its discretion in granting an injunction pending a full trial. National Fire Ins. Co. v. Thompson, 281 U.S. 331, 332, 50 S.Ct. 288, 74 L.Ed. 881; State of Alabama v. United States, 279 U. S. 229, 49 S.Ct. 266, 73 L.Ed. 675; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 278 U.S. 322, 49 S.Ct. 157, 73. L.Ed. 402. The Texas Company, however, would build at its peril. Compare Jones v. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, 298 U.S. 1, at page 16, 56 S.Ct. 654, 80 L.Ed. 1015, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
