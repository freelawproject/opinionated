E. Ash-brook as cashier of the Fairfax Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">A liability of $800 was recognized and paid by the Casualty Company. The petition contained twelve counts, each charging a separate embezzlement by Ashbrook of the funds of the Fairfax Bank. Counts 7 and 8 were dismissed at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">Ashbrook was treasurer of the City of Fairfax and guardian of one Charles Fletcher. He carried an account as city treasurer and also a personal account in the Fairfax Bank. He carried his account as guardian in the Fairfax National Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">The transactions involved may be grouped in two classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">Typical of class 1 is the transaction alleged in count 1, with respect to which the facts are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">On March 2, 1931, Ashbrook as city treasurer, received a warrant from the county clerk for $1,546.90. He immediately forwarded it to the First National Bank &amp; Trust Company in Oklahoma City, a correspondent of the Fairfax Bank for deposit to the credit of the latter, and credit was given as directed. At the same time he deposited $670.45 to his credit as city treasurer and issued a cashier\u2019s check payable to himself for $876.45. The cashier\u2019s check was cashed on May 11, 1931, and on the same day his personal account was credited with $535.00 and a new cashier\u2019s check issued to his order for $341.45. On May 13, 1931, the last, mentioned cashier\u2019s check was cashed and the individual account of Ashbrook was credited with $330.-00, the deposit ticket showing a cash withdrawal of $11.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-17\">Typical of class 2 is the transaction alleged in count 9, with respect to which the facts are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b212-18\">On September 29, 1925, Ashbrook debited his account as city treasurer with $8,000.00. ' No check or charge slip was found in the records of the Bank after it went into liquidation, the only record being the debit entry on the ledger sheet. On the same day he drew a draft on the Fidelity National Bank of Kansas City, Missouri, a correspondent of the Fairfax Bank, for $8,000.00 payable to the Fair-fax National Bank and deposited it to his account as guardian in the Fairfax National Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-19\">From a judgment in favor of the receiver for $4,200.00 the Casualty Company has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-20\">The Casualty Company contends that in all the transactions Ashbrook acted as city treasurer, that he either withdrew or withheld from deposit funds as city treasurer and embezzled them from the City, and that the Fairfax Bank incurred no liability on account thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-21\">In the transaction alleged in count 9 Ashbrook drew a draft on Fidelity National Bank payable to the Fairfax National Bank and charged the account of the City with the amount of the draft. He gave no check as city treasurer for the withdrawal. He in effect embezzled -$8,000.00 of the funds of the Fairfax Bank and made a charge against the account of the City to offset it. In issuing the draft and making the entry in the account of the City, he acted as an officer of the Fairfax Bank, not as city treasurer. Nor is the contention that the Fairfax Bank lost nothing by the transaction well founded. If we assume that Ashbrook as city treasurer authorized himself as cashier of the Fairfax Bank to make the charge; Ashbrook knew he was without authority as city treasurer to authorize the charge and his knowledge will be imputed to the Fairfax Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-22\">It is a well settled general.rule that notice, to, or knowledge of, an agent while acting within the scope of his authority and in reference to a- matter over which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>his authority extends, is notice to, or knowledge of, his principal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">In the Restatement of the Law-Agency, \u00a7 272, the rule is stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u201cIn accordance with and subject to the rules stated in \u00a7\u00a7 273-282, the liability of a principal is affected by the knowledge of an agent concerning a matter as to which he acts within his power to bind the principal or upon which it is his duty to give the principal information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Certain qualifications of the general rule are equally well settled. Mechem on Agency (2d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 1803, 1813-1826. A principal is not chargeable with or bound by notice to, or knowledge of, an agent as to matters involved in a transaction in which the agent deals with \u25a0 the principal or another agent of the principal as, or on account of, ah adverse party. The exception applies when the agent is engaged in prosecuting some fraudulent or illegal enterprise, the success of which would be impaired or defeated by the disclosure to his principal of the notice or knowledge sought to be imputed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">A qualification of the exception is recognized where the agent, although engaged in perpetrating an independent fraudulent act on his own account, is the sole representative of the principal and the principal, with knowledge of the facts, retains the fruits of the transaction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">In such a case the principal is impaled on the horns of a dilemma. If he disclaims the agent\u2019s act as unauthorized, he has no grounds to retain the fruits thereof; on the other hand, if he retains the fruits of the agent\u2019s act, after knowledge of the facts, he must in fairness be charged with the agent\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">The reason for the qualification is stated in Mechem on Agency (2d Ed.) p. 1412 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">\u201cThe real ground upon which the situ^ ation rests is \u2014 , that where the agent is the sole representative of the corporation, the corporation can not claim anything except through him and that therefore if it claims through him, after notice of the facts, it must accept his agency with its attendant notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-16\">Here the Fairfax Bank can only claim the benefit of the charge in the City\u2019s account through the act of Ashbrook. After knowledge of the facts, its position not having changed, it may not accept the benefits of the act without accepting Ash-brook\u2019s agency and being charged with his knowledge. See cases cited, Notes, 48 A.L.R. 465 and 86 A.L.R. 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-17\">If it accepts the act it must make restitution to the City and will suffer a loss of $8,000.00. If it rejects the act, it will suffer a like loss due to Ash-broolc\u2019s embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-18\">Since the items in the second class are in excess of the penalty of the bond it is not necessary to consider the question of liability on the items in the first class.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-19\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\"> Curtis, Collins &amp; H.
