Fourteen-fifteenths of the net premium income of petitioner for the year 1930 was from workmen\u2019s compensation insurance, and the balance was from automobile liability, collision and property damage insurance, principally, and a small volume from public liability and theft insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-21\">Section 204 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 204 and note) is applicable to petitioner in the computation of its income tax for the year 1930, the year in question. By the terms of that section one item of \u201cgross income\u201d is \u201cunderwriting income as provided in this subsection, computed on the basis of the underwriting and investment exhibit of the annual statement approved by the National Convention of Insurance Commissioners.\u201d \u201cUnderwriting income\u201d is defined to be \u201cthe premiums earned on insurance contracts during the taxable year less losses incurred and expenses incurred.\u201d In computing the \u201cunderwriting income,\u201d the deduction for \u201closses incurred\u201d is to be computed as follows: \u201cTo losses paid during the taxable year, add salvage and reinsurance recoverable outstanding at the end of the preceding taxable year, and deduct salvage and reinsurance recoverable outstanding at the end of the taxable year. To the result so obtained add all unpaid losses outstanding at the end of the taxable year and deduct unpaid losses outstanding at the end of the preceding taxable year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-22\">In its return petitioner, in arriving at the amount of \u201cunderwriting income,\u201d computed the \u201closses incurred\u201d at $882,-632.55, but subsequently claimed an error therein, and asserted the correct amount to be $1,022,015.88.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-23\">In the return \u201closses paid\u201d are shown to be $865,801.55, and the \u201cunpaid losses outstanding at the end of the taxable year\u201d are shown to be $660,980. The total of these items is $1,526,781.55. From this total there is to be deducted \u201cunpaid losses outstanding at the end of the preceding taxable year,\u201d which item is shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u25a0in the return to be $644,149. The total less that deduction leaves the sum of $882,-632.55, shown in the return as \u201cLosses In\u2022curred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The claimed error arises as follows: .Section 602a, Political Code of California, provides a method for computing a \u201creserve for outstanding losses.\u201d Petitioner submitted to the Insurance Commissioner of California its annual report which included the underwriting and investment exhibit, the entire form of the statement being \u201capproved by the National Convention of Insurance Commissioners.\u201d The '\u201closses incurred,\u201d as shown on the exhibit, consisted of item specified in section 602a, Political Code of California, which are used in computing the \u201creserve\u201d therein \u25a0mentioned. Under that exhibit the \u201closses paid\u201d is in accord with the amount shown on the return \u2014 $865,801.55. However, the \u201cunpaid losses outstanding at the end of the taxable year\u201d are shown to be $596,532.85. (In the return this item is $660,980.) The total of the loss,-es paid, and the unpaid losses outstanding \u25a0at the end of the taxable year thus shown, is $1,462,334.40. The exhibit shows the \u201cunpaid losses outstanding at the end of the preceding taxable year\u201d to be $440,-318.52. (The return shows this item to be $644,149.) Deducting the $440,318.52 from the total of $1,462,334.40 leaves a \u201cbalance of $1,022,015.88 which is the \u201creserve for outstanding losses\u201d specified by the California statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The Board held \u201cthat the method used \u201cby petitioner in reporting unpaid losses in its return was proper and that the meth\u25a0od now advanced by it is not in accordance with the statute,\u201d and affirmed respondent\u2019s determination, assessing a deficiency in the sum of $1,193.45. Petitioner filed its petition with this court to review that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Petitioner contends that since section 204 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 204 and note) provides that \u201cunderwriting income as provided in this subsection, computed on the basis of the underwriting and investment exhibit of the .annual statement approved by the National Convention of Insurance Commissioners,\u201d the portions of the subsection specifying the items to be used in computing such \u201cunderwriting income\u201d by implication carry with them the provision relating to the \u201cunderwriting and investment exhibit of the annual statement\u201d; that therefore the amounts of the items mentioned in the statute are to be determined by the amounts contained in such exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Article 992 of Regulations 74, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1928, provides in part: \u201c * * * The underwriting and investment exhibit is presumed clearly to reflect the true net income of the company, and in so far as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act will be recognized and used as a basis for that purpose. All items of the exhibit, however do not reflect an insurance company\u2019s income as defined in the Act. H\u00ed Hi H1</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">Petitioner\u2019s contention is untenable. The provision [section 204(b) (1), 26 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 204(b) (1) and note] mentioning the \u201cexhibit\u201d is general, and relates to the entire subject of \u201cinvestment income\u201d and \u201cunderwriting income.\u201d Another provision [section 204(b) (6), 26 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 204(b) (6) and note] has specific reference to one deduction to be made in computing \u201cunderwriting income.\u201d The general must succumb to the specific. Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet (C.C.A.9) 55 F.(2d) 17, 25, affirmed 287 U.S. 299, 53 S.Ct. 161, 77 L.Ed. 318. The statute [section 204(b) (6)] setting the measure of the deduction of \u201closses incurred\u201d is therefore paramount. The regulation is not contrary to that construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">The amount of \u201closses incurred\u201d shown by the exhibit is established to be a reserve. While the amount of a reserve set up in the exhibit might coincide with the amount of \u201closses incurred\u201d as computed according to the statute [section 204(b) (6)], the mere fact that the reserve _ is designated for \u201closses incurred\u201d does not establish that the amount of such reserve is the amount of \u201closses incurred\u201d within the meaning of the federal statute. A reserve might be set up for payment of losses which may or may not happen in the future, but the amount thereof is not, conceivably, a loss \u201cincurred.\u201d No showing is here made that the reserve shown by the exhibit is actually the amount of \u201closses incurred,\u201d specified in the federal statute. Reliance is placed entirely on the contention hereinabove mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
