Shaw, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>290, 318, 609 A.2d 415 (1992); <em>James v. Torres, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>586, 591, 808 A.2d 873 (App.Div.2002), <em>certif. denied, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>547, 816 A.2d 1049 (2003). The motion judge dismissed plaintiffs complaint; he concluded that plaintiff failed to meet this serious impact test to maintain her cause of action for noneconomic damages. We reverse. Because a displaced fracture falls within one of AICRA\u2019s categories of self-defined injuries, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, once a displaced fracture has been demonstrated, a plaintiff need not prove that the injury had a \u201cserious impact on the plaintiff and her life.\u201d <em>See Oswin, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 318, 609 A.2d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>We construe the facts in a light most favorable to plaintiff. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). Because we reverse the summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs complaint on the grounds that plaintiff was not required to prove that her injuries had a serious impact on her and her life, we do not address the motion judge\u2019s finding that plaintiffs injuries did not meet that test. Rather, for purposes of this opinion only, we assume that plaintiffs injuries have not had a serious impact upon her life and she would not qualify for noneconomic damages under the <em>Oswin/James </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident on October 21, 1999, when defendant\u2019s vehicle turned into her lane of travel and struck her vehicle head-on. At the time of the accident, plaintiff was thirty-three years old. She remained out of work for seven months following the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">From the accident scene, plaintiff was taken by ambulance to the emergency room at West Jersey Hospital with complaints of neck pain and \u201cnumbness and tingling going down her upper extremities.\u201d Although plaintiffs complaints and symptoms abated over time, her diagnosis remained elusive. Because of the location of the spinal injuries, the fractures were difficult to visualize on radiographic studies. However, the evidence is sufficient to raise a factual dispute as to whether plaintiffs fracture was displaced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">As early as December 10, 1999, a radiological report of plaintiffs cervical spine showed a \u201cfracture deformity through the posterior arch of C2 with a few [millimeters] of displacement of the fracture fragment----\u201d A February 2, 2000 CT scan of plaintiffs upper cervical spine found both a nondisplaced fracture of the left lamina of C2, partially healed, and a complete fracture of the right pedicle of C2, without \u201cobvious bony union.\u201d Henry E. David, D.O., after reviewing various radiological reports, ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>served at the C5 level, \u201ca radial lucency ... significantly wider and displaced several millimeters, as well as ... some inferior displacement of the fracture fragment----\u201d Prom these facts a jury could conclude that plaintiffs fracture was displaced. Thus, the critical question then becomes whether plaintiff needs to show that the displaced fracture has had a serious impact on her and her life to maintain a claim for noneconomic damages under AICRA. We hold that she does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">In the predecessor to AICRA, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, passed in 1988, (the 1988 Act), recovery for noneconomic losses was restricted to nine types of injuries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">TYPE 1: death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">TYPE 2: dismemberment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">TYPE 3: significant disfigurement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">TYPE 4: a fracture;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">TYPE 5: loss of a fetus;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-14\">TYPE 6: permanent loss of use of a body organ, member, function or system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHq5\">TYPE 7: permanent consequential limitation of use of a body function or system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxF\">TYPE 8: significant limitation of use of a body function or system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-15\">TYPE 9; a medically determined injury or impairment of a non-permanent nature which prevents the injured person from performing substantially all of the material acts which constitute that person\u2019s usual and customary daily activities for not less than 90 days during the 180 days immediately following the occurrence of the injury or impairment----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-17\">[Oswin, <em>supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 314-15, 609 A.2d 415.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">Because, however, the 1988 Act \u201cdid not attain its objective of reducing automobile insurance premiums in New Jersey,\u201d <em>James, supra, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 592, 808 A.2d 873, the Legislature subsequently adopted AICRA, which provides for a \u201climitation on lawsuit option,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, commonly referred to as the verbal threshold, and a \u201cno limitation on lawsuit option,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8b; <em>Rios v. Szivos, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>578, 582-83, 808 A.2d 868 (App.Div.2002). The limitation on lawsuit option, which applies to plaintiffs automobile insurance policy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did away with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>nine types of injuries set forth in the 1988 Act, and instead limits the right to sue for noneconomic damages only to those persons who have:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">sustained a bodily injury which results in death; dismemberment; significant disfigurement or significant scarring; displaced fractures; loss of a fetus; or a permanent injury within a reasonable degree of medical probability, other than scarring or disfigurement. An injury shall be considered permanent when the body part or organ, or both, has not healed to function normally and will not heal to function normally with further medical treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">A comparison of the 1988 Act with AICRA reveals that while under the former, a Type 4 fracture did not need to be displaced to allow a plaintiff to seek noneconomic loss, see <em>Fowler v. Crystal Motors, Inc., </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>33, 40, 44, 773 A.2d 730 (App.Div. 2001), AICRA restricts the right to compensation for noneconomic loss only to those fractures that are displaced, with non-displaced fractures falling into the catch-all category of injuries that need to be permanent to allow a lawsuit for noneconomic damages. <em>N.J.S.</em>A. 39:6A-8a. Thus, with the passage of AICRA, in an effort to eliminate lawsuits for injuries that were not serious or permanent, the Legislature drew a distinction between non-displaced fractures, and displaced fractures, considering the latter inherently more serious than the former. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-l.lb (finding AICRA \u201cprovid[es] for a revised lawsuit threshold for suits for pain and suffering which will eliminate suits for injuries which are not serious or permanent____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Governor Whitman, in her conditional veto message of the AICRA legislation, hammered this point home, drawing a clear distinction between a displaced fracture, and other injuries, presumably including non-displaced fractures, which were not as serious. She noted that under AICRA, lawsuits for noneconomic loss were barred unless \u201cfractures [are] displaced and ... other injuries [are] serious enough never to heal sufficiently to regain normal function.\u201d <em>See </em>Thomas P. Weidner &amp; Michael J. Canavan, <em>The \u201cNew\u201d Verbal Threshold: But is it Improved?, </em>24 Seton Hall Legis. J. 117,132 (1999) (quoting Governor Whitman\u2019s Conditional Veto Message of Senate Bill No. 3 (Apr. 27,1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Indeed, the Legislature has categorized displaced fractures separate from other injuries that are required to be permanent to permit compensation for noneconomic loss; instead, displaced fractures are listed in the statute along with death, dismemberment, loss of a fetus, and significant disfigurement or scarring, forms of harm which, consistent with our jurisprudence, have allowed a plaintiff to sue for noneconomic damages without the need for a plaintiff to prove the injury has had a serious impact upon her life. <em>See </em>Fowler; <em>supra, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 40, 773 A.2d 730 (finding <em>Oswin </em>limited the serious impact test to Types 6, 7, and 8 under the 1988 Act); <em>Vellucci v. DiMella, </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>345, 348, 769 A.2d 410 (App.Div.2001) (finding serious impact test not necessary for type 9 injury); <em>Puso v. Kenyon, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 290, 639 A.2d 1120 (App.Div.1994) (finding <em>Oswin\u2019s </em>serious impact test not applicable to injuries which define themselves).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Against this background, the import of the plain language of AICRA is that the Legislature has drawn a distinction between non-displaced fractures, which fall into a category of injuries that must be permanent to allow a lawsuit for noneconomic damages; and displaced fractures, which are self-defined injuries and are by their very nature considered serious and not subject to a showing of permanency. Thus, while a non-displaced fracture may require a plaintiff to show that the injury had a serious impact upon her life, the displaced fracture, being inherently serious, is not subject to the <em>Oswin/James </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">This conclusion is not inconsistent with our holding in <em>James, supra, </em>where we found that the Legislature intended \u201cto require that an injury be both permanent and serious to permit a plaintiff to cross the amended verbal threshold.\u201d 354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 596, 808 A.2d 873. Because the plaintiff in <em>James </em>suffered bulging disc injuries, our analysis was informed by the Legislature\u2019s decision to \u201cdiscard! ] the existing categories six, seven, eight and nine,\u201d replacing them with the \u201cpermanent\u201d injury category. <em>Id. </em>at 592, 808 A.2d 873. A fracture \u2014 which was not a Type 6, 7, 8, or 9 injury under the 1988 Act \u2014 was not a consideration. <em>Ibid.; see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number><em>also </em>Weidner &amp; Canavan, <em>supra, </em>at 128-29 (noting that the primary change from the 1988 Act to AICRA was \u201cthe telescoping of former injury types six through nine into one type of injury: \u2018permanent\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Accordingly, plaintiffs objective evidence of a displaced fracture is sufficient to surmount the verbal threshold for purposes of the summary judgment motion without the additional requirement that plaintiff demonstrate that the fracture had a serious impact upon her and her life. The decision of the motion judge dismissing plaintiffs complaint is reversed. The complaint is reinstated and the case is remanded for further action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-10\"> \u201cDisplacement\u201d is \"[rjemoval from the normal placement or position.\u201d <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary, </em>528 (27th ed.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-19\"> Although plaintiff\u2019s automobile insurance policy has not been included in either parties\u2019 appendix, no dispute exists that AICRA is applicable to the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
