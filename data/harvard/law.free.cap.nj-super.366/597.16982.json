We hold that such an application requires a motion judge to carefully balance whether the probative value of the proposed invasive procedure outweighs any danger or extraordinary discomfort to plaintiff that may be associated with the procedure. Where a <em>R. </em>4:19 medical examination involves an invasive procedure, we conclude that if plaintiff moves for a protective order, <em>R. </em>4:10-3 and <em>R. 4:19, the </em>burden of coming forward to establish the probative value of such procedure rests with defendant; plaintiff then must produce evidence that the proposed procedure presents a risk to plaintiffs health or is of such a nature that it will create substantial discomfort or distress; thereafter, the burden shifts back to defendant to establish the safety and reasonableness of the procedure. The judge must then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>engage in the weighing process that we have described, and if the judge concludes that the benefits outweigh the risks as we define them, the judge may issue an appropriate order having due regard for plaintiffs safety and comfort. In all instances, the judge must consider whether such application or objection is made in good or bad faith.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We reverse and remand. We conclude that here, the motion judge failed to consider all of the appropriate factors and to make sufficient findings, and thus did not adequately engage in this weighing process. We further conclude that she abused her discretion when she barred plaintiffs claim if plaintiff failed to submit to the procedure. We hold that a defendant\u2019s remedy, where defendant has failed to meet his burden to compel such an examination, is to challenge plaintiffs expert on cross-examination. Where a plaintiff fails to submit to an invasive procedure that a judge has determined to be warranted, possible remedies include, but are not limited to, questioning both parties\u2019 experts as to the nature of the proposed procedure and commenting to the jury as to plaintiffs refusal to submit to the procedure. Only in the exceptional case may a judge impose the sanction of barring plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">On October 31, 1997, Plaintiff Carolyn II Grande <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> underwent a caesarean section at St. Barnabas Hospital to deliver her baby. During the surgery, defendant Robert DiBenedetto, M.D. incised plaintiffs cervix and bladder instead of the uterus, resulting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>lacerations of the dome of the bladder. The incisions were noticed post-delivery and repaired by Caterina Gregori, M.D., the surgeon summoned for an intraoperative consult.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">During her follow-up visits to Dr. Gregori, plaintiff was found to be \u201chealing well,\u201d and normal recovery of plaintiffs bladder was expected; two months after the surgery, plaintiff told Dr. Gregori \u201cthat her bladder was working okay.\u201d On June 25, 1998, plaintiff complained of pain during sexual intercourse, but Dr. Gregori\u2019s medical notes indicated no complaints of \u201cinadequate bladder capacity,\u201d frequency or painful urination either then or on plaintiffs next two visits, on December 17, 1998, and August 5, 1999. Thereafter, on October 29, 1999, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant. Among her allegations was that defendant\u2019s negligence \u201ccaused [her] to sustain severe and permanent injury and deformity ... [and] endure great pain and suffering.\u201d On August 24, 2000, plaintiff again consulted -with Dr. Gregori, complaining of \u201cburning after urination,\u201d but offered no other complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Then, on May 15, 2001, plaintiff saw Peter Boorjian, M.D., complaining of pain and burning in her left lower abdomen. Dr. Boorjian scheduled a cystoscopy and urodynamic study. Cystocopy \u201cinvolves placing [a] scope into the urethra in order to visualize the bladder____Urodynamics is the general term for the study of the storage and voiding function/dysfunetion of the lower urinary tract.\u201d On June 6, 2001, Dr. Boorjian attempted to perform these studies on plaintiff in his office, but failed when \u201c[p]assing the catheter an obstruction was met\u201d and \u201c[p]atient became diaphoretic <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and anxious.\u201d In his \u201cPre-op History &amp; Physical\u201d report, Dr. Boorjian stated that plaintiff \u201chas a significant component of anxiety associated with her experience at the time of th[e] caesarean section and this in fact may be contributing to the symptoms [of frequency and urgency incontinence] she expresses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>On July 13, 2001, plaintiff was admitted to Mountainside Hospital to complete the examination. The urodynamie study utilized gas, as the hospital was equipped with gas equipment only. Passing the catheter this time required \u201cjust a little local anesthetic.\u201d While Dr. Boorjian noted plaintiffs discomfort at the insertion, \u201cit was accomplished and it was done twice; first to measure how much urine she had left inside her bladder after she had recently voided ... and then to pass a special type of catheter through which cystometric studies are done.\u201d Plaintiff was then placed under general anesthesia and a cystourethroscopy conducted. This study revealed \u201csignificant distortion of the usual bladder anatomy\u201d and scarring on \u201cthe posterior wall of the bladder where the presumed suture line from prior laceration took place,\u201d but no \u201cscarring or obstructive phenomena\u201d of the urethra.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In his deposition, Dr. Boorjian opined that his inability to perform the studies initially was \u201cbecause of a level of anxiety and fear that created so much spasm in [plaintiffs] musculature that to go and force it would have hurt her.\u201d He offered no other medical basis for the failed first attempt. When asked whether he formed \u201cany conclusions at any point in time when [he was] treating [plaintiff] as to what the cause of [her] pain was,\u201d Dr. Boorjian replied \u201cthe possibility of scar tissue that develops pain fibers, A; B, psychogenic pain; C, malingering.\u201d Dr. Boorjian also agreed that \u201cwhatever opinions that [he has] in this case with respect to what could possibly be causing the pain [he was] able to form after [he] performed the cystoscopy and urodynamie study.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">After reviewing the depositions of plaintiff and defendant and various medical records, plaintiffs urological expert Sol M. Usher, M.D. opined that the \u201clarge bladder injury [that] occurred at the time of [plaintiffs] surgery ... has resulted in her having a major bladder dysfunction for the rest of her life.\u201d Dr. Usher concluded, based on his document review, that plaintiffs condition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">which she did not have prior to the caesarean section, is related to the intraoperative trauma that she had to her bladder, which resulted in subsequent decreased bladder capacity, scar tissue, distortion of her bladder as visualized at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>cystoscopy by the urologist [Dr. Boorjian], pain, spasm, discomfort, all the things that she\u2019s complaining of.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Defendant consulted with urologist David Saypol, M.D., who advised that an independent medical examination (IME) was necessary \u201cto determine the nature and extent of her actual damage due to the subjective nature of plaintiffs complaints.\u201d Accordingly, defendant requested plaintiff to make an appointment with Dr. Saypol for an independent cystoscopy and videotape urodynamic study. Dr. Saypol stated that \u201cto determine if [a deformity of the bladder as described in Dr. Boorjian\u2019s report] persists, and if her voiding dysfunction is presently causally related to her surgery, I would need to perform a cystoscopic examination in the office using local lidocaine jelly anesthesia.\u201d Dr. Saypol also asserted that \u201ca video urodynamic study with water manometries is mandatory,\u201d as the study done by Dr. Boorjian \u201cwas a non-video study using C02 as opposed to water,\u201d which Dr. Saypol found to \u201crepresent!] a less than adequate evaluation to determine causation.\u201d Dr. Saypol expressed his belief that he could perform the studies \u201cwith minimal discomfort to the patient,\u201d as Dr. Boorjian had indicated \u201cno urethral abnormality\u201d when he performed the prior cystoscopy. In response, plaintiff filed a Notice of Motion for Protective Order to deny defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">During the hearing on the motion, the judge considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">[W]hat do I do to be ultimately fair that preserves \u2014 protects the client more than preserves the plaintiff from any invasive, you know, harm or discomfort, etc. And at the same time, give the defendant the benefit of being able to counter the allegations of an injury. And it\u2019s all well and good for \u2014 and I forget which one of the experts submitted the document on behalf of the plaintiff, saying that it\u2019s a clear-cut thing. Well, how nice for him to say that. But, I mean, we all know that somebody on the other side, I mean, intellectually, the person defending it and the doctor who\u2019s being sued, he\u2019s responsible for whatever he did, no more no less. And shouldn\u2019t he be able to dispute that or, at least, see if there is a dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The judge also posited a jury\u2019s adverse reaction to plaintiff if the protective order were granted and the jury told of plaintiffs refusal to submit to an IME to explain why \u201cthe defendant isn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>putting any issue on.\u201d Plaintiffs counsel responded: \u201cWell, I think that that is a risk that the plaintiff would take, and we have discussed this with the plaintiff, who\u2019s adamant that the last procedure was so painful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The judge then ordered the parties to submit additional medical information regarding the relative accuracies of using C02 and water in a urodynamie study. The judge also requested that Dr. Saypol \u201cin detail, indicate what it is about the distinction between the way he wants to perform the test, as opposed to the way Dr. [Boorjian] did it ... [and] whether or not his hesitancy of making an opinion is medically based with that information or legally based.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Both parties\u2019 medical submissions revealed that while both gas or liquid are permissible bladder fillings, gas is generally considered quicker and more hygienic, but that gas, which is unphysiologic and compressible, \u201ceasily provokes detrusor<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> overactivity\u201d and \u201csubtle changes in bladder pressure may be missed.\u201d Furthermore, \u201crapid fill rates achieved [by using gas] may artifactuaily change the normal bladder response\u201d and \u201cleakage is very difficult to detect due to invisibility of the gas.\u201d Using gas, \u201c[t]he bladder capacity is often only 2/3 of the capacity measured with medium-fill water cystometry. Unstable detrusor contractions are typically seen as a gradual increase in detrusor pressure without subsequent decrease, but no essential differences exist between gas and water cystometry in the classification of qualitative data.\u201d The medical submissions also recognized the range of urodynamie procedures and recommended \u201cmore sophisticated tests [such as video-urodynamic studies] ... when the clinical examination and more simple tests are not sufficient to make an accurate diagnosis or institute treatment.\u201d Moreover, regarding cystoscopies, plaintiffs report acknowledged \u201cthe need for cystoscopy in patients <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>with persistent symptoms of urgency and frequency, ... or voiding difficulties____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In addition, Dr Saypol clarified the need for the procedures, stating that \u201cDr. Boorjian\u2019s report of his urodynamic study demonstrates no abnormalities other than reduced bladder capacity, which can be easily explained by the use of C02 and lacks the requisite detail necessary for a proper diagnosis.\u201d Finding none of the characteristics of \u201ca patient with multiple voiding complaints,\u201d Dr. Saypol questioned \u201cthe authenticity of the entire study and the patient\u2019s complaints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">When the motion hearing resumed, the judge explained, \u201cthe doctor has the right to have somebody of his own choosing [examine plaintiff], and a jury has the right to make that evaluation.\u201d Allowing the jury to hear all of plaintiffs evidence, only to be next told from defendant that \u201cbecause of some circumstances,\u201d plaintiff refused to undergo an IME, would deprive the jury of hearing \u201cboth sides\u201d of the argument, which in turn, would \u201cdiminishG the whole integrity of the system.\u201d In light of the competing considerations, the judge did not compel plaintiff to submit to the procedures. However, the judge ruled \u201cthat if the plaintiff does not submit to the urodynamic testing requested by the defendants, the claim for damages relating to her complaints of bladder dysfunction and the urinary tract complaints will not be submitted to the jury.\u201d We granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">On appeal, plaintiff asserts that the motion judge abused her discretion by barring plaintiffs claim if she refuses to submit to the examination; the pain and discomfort that plaintiff will suffer from the examination outweighs the probative value of the examination to defendant; and a judge must balance the requested procedure against the risks posed to plaintiff. Defendant counters that the trial judge properly exercised her discretion in issuing the order, as she first explored the alternatives; plaintiff has already undergone the requested studies by her doctor but that the examination was \u201cadmittedly flawed and inaccurate\u201d; the studies may reveal findings that refute plaintiffs claims and thus are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>critical to the defense; and defendant cannot obtain the sought-after information any other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">We first set forth our standard of review as well as the relevant rule governing protective orders. A trial judge\u2019s \u201cdisposition of discovery matters, including the formulation of protective orders,\u201d normally is given deference by a reviewing court, absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Payton v. New Jersey Tpk. Auth., </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>524, 559, 691 A.2d 321 (1997). However, \u201cdeference is inappropriate if the court\u2019s determination in drafting its order is based on a mistaken understanding of the applicable law.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>A judge abuses her discretion when she fails \u201cto exercise discretion because the court did not realize it has such discretion.\u201d <em>Alk Assocs. v. Multimodal Applied Systems, Inc., </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>310, 314-15, 647 A.2d 1359 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The general rule regarding adverse medical examinations is found in <em>B. </em>4:19. Under that rule, where a party asserts a claim for personal injuries or where the \u201cphysical condition of a party is in controversy, the adverse party may require the party whose physical ... condition is in controversy to submit to a physical ... examination by a medical or other expert.\u201d Upon receipt of such a request from an adversary, a party may move for a protective order pursuant to <em>B. </em>4:10-3 (stating in part: \u201cUpon motion by a party ... from whom discovery is sought, and for good cause shown, the court may make any order which justice requires to protect a party ... from ... undue burden.\u201d). Thus, \u201cthe burden of seeking relief from the court is placed on the noneomplying party,\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>4:19 (2003), who must move for a protective order and show \u201cgood cause\u201d to support the granting of such an order. <em>See R. </em>4:10-3; <em>Kerr v. Able Sanitary and Envtl. Servs., Inc., </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>147, 155, 684 A.2d 961 (App.Div.1996) (finding \u201c[ijmplicit in <em>B. </em>4:10 \u2014 3[] the notion that the movant bears the burden of persuading the court that good cause exists for issuing the protective order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">One New Jersey court has addressed the issue in dispute. In <em>Duprey v. Wager, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>81, 451 A.2d 416 (Law Div. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>1982),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Law Division judge was confronted with a plaintiff who alleged \u201cinjury to her reproductive organs\u201d and objected to a hysterosalpingography, an invasive procedure that \u201cnecessitate!)!] rupture of her hymen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84-85, 89, 451 A.2d 416. Citing decisions of other jurisdictions, the judge evaluated the parties\u2019 competing interests by weighing the reasons for defendant\u2019s request against the reasonableness of plaintiffs refusal to submit to the examination. <em>Duprey, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 86-90, 451 A.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In <em>Duprey, </em>the judge explained that to establish \u201cgood cause,\u201d the requesting party must show a need for the examination. Relevant factors include whether defendant is able to obtain the information by alternative means, whether plaintiff had previously undergone a similar examination, and whether an examination is \u201cnecessary to determine the extent, nature and permanency of alleged injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86-87, 451 A.2d 416. Then, whether plaintiffs refusal to undergo the examination is reasonable depends on the potential risk the examination presents to plaintiff, and the harm plaintiff is likely to suffer therefrom. <em>Id. </em>at 87, 451 A.2d 416. Important considerations include safety, substantial \u201cinconvenience and deleterious effect ... that [] reach beyond minor pain or discomfort,\u201d and \u201cthreat posed to [plaintiffs] health and well-being.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86, 88, 451 A.2d 416. \u201cWhen the potential physical and mental consequences appear to outweigh the proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>ble benefits to the interests of justice, the court will be constrained to deny the examination sought by defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87, 451 A.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In <em>Dwprey, </em>after discussing these factors, the judge identified the following general guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">1. The power to order a physical examination must be exercised with great restraint and with careful attention to the rights of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">2. The application must be supported by affidavit setting forth pertinent facts and reasons to justify the examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">3. The physical examination should not be ordered where it appears that the information to be elicited would be merely cumulative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">4. Compelling considerations of justice on behalf of the defendant-applicant must be established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">5. The burden is upon the defendant-applicant to affirmatively establish that the requested physical examination can be conducted without considerable pain and danger to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-11\">6. Adequate and appropriate precautions should be imposed so that privacy of the person is insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 90, 451 A.2d 416 (citing <em>Richardson v. Johnson, </em>60 <em>Tenn.App. </em>129, 444 S.W.2d 708, 710 (1969))].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">Applying these principles, the judge particularly noted that plaintiff had not previously \u201cvoluntarily submitted herself to an internal examination\u201d and the effects of the procedure \u201cwould have far-reaching cultural dimensions in [her] ability to contract marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89-90, 451 A.2d 416. Given the special harm plaintiff was likely to suffer and noting defendant\u2019s failure to show that such an order was \u201cnecessary to afford [him] justice,\u201d as an alternative procedure apparently existed, the judge found that the risks of the procedure outweighed \u201cany benefits to justice to defendant\u201d and denied defendant\u2019s motion. <em>Id. </em>at 85, 89-90, 451 A.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-14\">In general, the factors enumerated in <em>Duprey </em>are consistent with those considered in other jurisdictions whose courts have conducted a similar fact-sensitive, risk-benefit analysis. This analysis balances the specific potential harm and risk to the objecting party against the need of the requesting party, as well as equity and fairness concerns, to determine whether good cause exists for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>ordering a party to submit to an invasive or risky medical examination. <em>See, e.g., McQuillen v. City of Sioux City, </em>306 N.W.2d 789, 789-91 (Iowa 1981) (finding the trial court properly exercised its discretion in ordering plaintiff to submit to a coronary arteriography, where the procedure would elicit information regarding plaintiffs alleged condition, risk of complications was placed \u201cat less than one and one-half percent\u201d and plaintiff failed to show \u201cthat the risk of serious complications reached that level or that plaintiff would have peculiar susceptibility to risk\u201d); <em>Cardinal v. Univ. of Rochester, </em>271 <em>A.D. </em>1048, 69 N.Y.S.2d 352 (N.Y.App.Div. 1947), <em>aff'g </em>188 <em>Misc. </em>823, 71 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>614 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1946) (affirming the order compelling plaintiff to submit to an invasive procedure and expressly allowing defendant leave to seek an order to compel plaintiff to submit to a bone marrow biopsy by showing the necessity of the procedure, presenting detailed information about the procedure, how frequently it is performed, and any known risks and after-effects).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Decided after <em>Dwprey </em>and suggesting a different analytical methodology, <em>Lefkowitz v. Nassau County Med. Ctr., </em>94 A.D.2d 18, 462 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>903 (1983), utilized a burden-shifting approach in addition to the risk-benefit analysis. In <em>Lefkowitz, </em>defendants sought to compel plaintiff to submit to a hysterosalpingogram, the same procedure at issue in <em>Duprey, </em>involving an \u201cX-ray examination of the uterus and fallopian tubes after injection of a radiated opaque medium.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18-19, 462 <em>N.</em>Y.S.2d 903. Where a party objects to a procedure because of its possible danger, the <em>Lefkowitz </em>court articulated the burden shifting between the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 21, 462 N.Y.S.2d 903. First, the plaintiff has \u201cthe burden of showing that the proposed test is prima facie potentially dangerous.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted). If this burden is met, then \u201cthe burden shifts to the party seeking the test to demonstrate its safety.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The necessary evidentiary showing, the court explained, includes \u201cproof \u2018showing the necessity for such examination, the details of the procedure employed in making it, the frequency with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>which it has been done, together with the experience and observations which have been made by physicians as to pain, harm, or after results of any nature, occurring to persons so examined.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Cardinal, supra, </em>271 <em>A.D. </em>at 1048). As defendants offered only \u201ceonclusory statements of' [their] counsel,\u201d the court found they failed to meet their burden of showing that the proposed test, the safety of which was still unsettled, would not be harmful. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, <em>Lefkowitz, </em>which has been followed in New York and by other jurisdictions, requires a particular showing of harm or safety, supported by more than eonclusory statements. <em>See Langelier v. Ford, </em>159 A.D.2d 851, 852-53, 552 N.Y.S.2d 992 (N.Y.App.Div.1990) (finding that defendant met its burden, under <em>Lefkowitz, </em>of showing the safety of MRI and CAT scans, where plaintiffs expert conceded that any complications were \u201creversible with proper treatment\u201d and \u201che had never had a patient suffer permanent injury from the procedure\u201d); <em>Thomas v. John T. Mather Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>162 A.D.2d 521, 522-23, 556 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>720 (1990) (upholding the order to compel plaintiff to submit to a CAT scan under sedation, where defendants\u2019 presentation established the safety of the procedure, which is \u201ca conventionally accepted method of determining the nature and extent of the plaintiffs neurological damage,\u201d the relatively mild sedative was frequently used with \u201cfew \u2018unfavorable\u2019 side-effects,\u201d plaintiff had been prescribed more potent medications, and plaintiff had previously undergone CAT scans while sedated, while plaintiff submitted only \u201ca eonclusory affidavit from his neurologist\u201d without detailing the harm plaintiff would suffer). <em>See also Pena v.

Hatch, </em>62 P.3d 382, 384, 386 (Ok.2002) (adopting the <em>Leflcowitz </em>burden-shifting approach, but finding that under Oklahoma law, the objecting party always has the burden of persuasion to prove \u201cthe risk to the party to be examined outweighs the benefit to be derived from the examination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Plaintiff criticizes defendant\u2019s reliance on decisions that concerned sedation, rather than invasive procedures. However, courts have engaged in the same analysis with respect to both types of procedures, suggesting that the risk, rather than the invasiveness, is the critical issue. <em>See generally </em>Steven R. Gabel, <em>IME\u2019s: Are Invasive Techniques and Sedation Permissible?, </em>75 Mich. B.J. 836 (1996) (discussing sedation and invasive procedures in the context of IMEs, finding that courts must conduct a fact-sensitive inquiry when faced with a request that involves either issue in the absence of specific governing law, and suggesting that Michigan follow the New York burden-shifting approach and risk-benefit analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The interests critical to the analysis, then, are specific potential harm or risk to plaintiff in light of plaintiffs right to safety and health; defendant\u2019s need for the examination, i.e., whether the information is obtainable from other sources or is cumulative; and fairness concerns, i.e., whether the examination is required to place the parties on equal footing because the examination goes to a critical issue of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Plaintiff claims that where the procedures are invasive and potentially harmful, such that the detriment to plaintiff \u201cfar outweighs the [examination\u2019s] limited probative value,\u201d the judge may not then condition plaintiffs ability to present her injury claims on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>her voluntary submission to that examination. Plaintiff further argues that the invasive procedures \u201cwould cause [plaintiff] great pain, discomfort and anxiety,\u201d that her pain would necessitate the procedures be done under general anesthesia, thereby subjecting her \u201cto the risks inherent in the administration of general anesthesia,\u201d and that the procedures would additionally subject her \u201cto the risk of urinary tract infection and/or bleeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Defendant counters that plaintiff has presented \u201cno confirmed medical or physical reason why [she] cannot undergo the requested studies\u201d and \u201crelies upon her subjective complaints of pain and scare tactics relating to risks of anesthesia.\u201d Defendant moreover points to Dr. Saypol\u2019s opinion that the \u201ctwo studies could be performed in [his] office with minimal discomfort to the patient,\u201d as \u201cDr. Boorjian described no urethral abnormality at the time of his cystoscopic examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The risk and pain an invasive procedure potentially presents to the objecting party are foremost concerns, given plaintiffs right to health, safety and well-being. <em>See Duprey, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 90, 451 A.2d 416; <em>Simms v. Montana Eighteenth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>315 <em>Mont. </em>135, 68 P.3d 678, 682-84 (2003) (explaining that to determine whether good cause exists, the court must weigh defendant\u2019s request, including \u201c[t]he time, place, manner, conditions and scope of [the] examination\u201d and whether defendant can \u201cobtain the information necessary to an informed defense\u201d by other means, against the state constitutional rights to privacy, safety, health, and happiness). Indeed, extreme risk to plaintiff has been a sufficient ground for denying an order to compel submission to a physical examination. <em>See Carrig v. Oakes, </em>259 A.D. 138, 138-39, 18 N.Y.S.2d 917 (N.Y.App.Div.), <em>appeal denied, </em>259 A.D. 798, 18 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>918 (1940) (refusing to compel plaintiff to submit to a cystoscopic examination, described as \u201c \u2018a major operation[,] ... most painful ... [and] known to cause death,\u2019 \u201d while noting that a court may now compel a party \u201cto submit to the taking of X-ray pictures,\u201d when once they were deemed too harmful).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Dr. Boorjian\u2019s first attempt at passing the catheter to perform the cystoscopy and urodynamic studies was unsuccessful due to either \u201ca mechanical obstruction of some sort ... [or] a contraction of the pelvic musculature secondary to anxiety.\u201d Plaintiffs certification states that she was in \u201csevere pain\u201d during this attempt, but that Dr. Boorjian subsequently explained to her \u201cthat there was no obstruction but that [she] was experiencing severe pain from post traumatic stress\u201d from the caesarean section. Plaintiff further acknowledged that while \u201c[t]he subject procedure may be a routine procedure for most patients seen by the defendant\u2019s expert, [it is] not for me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">However, during the subsequent, successful attempt at these procedures, Dr. Boorjian inserted the catheter twice with only local anesthesia and with only discomfort noted; the cystoscopy was conducted while plaintiff was under general anesthesia. One of the supplemental medical submissions also indicated that cystoscopy is \u201croutine [] for the evaluation of both men and women with urinary incontinence\u201d and that as we previously noted, \u201cthere does not appear to be any controversy about the need for cystoscopy in patients with persistent symptoms of urgency and frequency.\u201d Furthermore, \u201csynchronous multichannel video-urodynamics [is believed to] offer the most comprehensive, artifact-free means of arriving at a precise diagnosis\u201d and is conducted \u201croutinely when urodynamics are indicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Based on this record, then, the trial judge could have concluded that plaintiffs pain is psychogenic and the procedures defendant seeks to perform on plaintiff are medically routine. Furthermore, plaintiff had previously undergone the procedures while under general anesthesia, and defendant points out that \u201cplaintiff has undergone [six] procedures utilizing general anesthesia and has never had an anesthesia-related complication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Plaintiffs interest, however, must then be balanced against defendant\u2019s interest in obtaining an independent medical examination to mount an adequate defense and defendant\u2019s need for the information. <em>See, e.g., Taylor v. Morris, </em>62 S.W.3d 377, 378-80 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>(Ky.2001) (finding that \u201ceven the production of voluminous records by plaintiff does not necessarily negate the defendant\u2019s interest in an independent examination of plaintiff\u2019 and upholding an order compelling plaintiff to submit to an invasive examination to maintain the parties\u2019 equal opportunity to assess plaintiffs physical condition); <em>Thomas, supra, </em>162 A.D.2d at 522, 556 N. Y.S.2d 720 (recognizing \u201ca need as well as a benefit to be derived from the [requested] CAT scan, since it may enhance the defendants\u2019 ability to prepare a defense\u201d). In fact, while plaintiff relies on <em>Carrig, supra, </em>259 A.D. 138, 18 N.Y.S.2d 917, which described a cystoscopy as \u201c \u2018a major operation ... known to cause death,\u2019 \u201d another court in <em>Klein v. Yellow Cab Co., </em>7 <em>F.R.D. </em>169, 169-70 (N.D.Ohio1944), granted defendant\u2019s motion to order plaintiff to submit to an examination that included a cystoscopy. As plaintiff alleged \u201cserious injury to his pelvis, groin, genital organs, [] bladder, and [] permanent injury to the urethra, prostate gland, and sexual function,\u201d the court found that the examination was necessary for defendant to \u201cmeet the issue as to the nature and extent of the injuries,\u201d despite plaintiffs objection that the examination would be \u201ctoo painful ... with [] the probability of serious or painful consequences.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Defendant\u2019s need, therefore, must be adequately considered. Here, plaintiff argues that \u201c[d]efendant has failed to show that the requested examination procedures are required in the interest of justice,\u201d as copies of Dr. Boorjian\u2019s reports and plaintiffs medical records, interrogatory answers and deposition have all been provided to defendant. Defendant counters that the studies conducted by Dr. Boorjian were inadequate, preventing Dr. Saypol, defendant\u2019s expert witness, from \u201creaeh[ing] a determination as to whether [plaintiffs symptoms are related to the bladder injury and what the extent, nature and cause of the bladder condition are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Where the examination would yield no results of probative value, defendant has little basis to compel plaintiff to undergo the examination. <em>See Ex parte Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>729 So.2d 294, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>298 (Ala.1999) (finding that defendants had not established actual need for the requested examination, as defendants\u2019 expert witness had already reviewed plaintiffs medical records, which he used to formulate his opinion as to the cause of plaintiffs physical discomfort, and it was not \u201cestablished that the requested examination would provide any specific additional information that is not available from another source\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">To show that defendant lacks sufficient interest in the procedures, plaintiff relies on the statement, \u201c[u]nstable detrusor contractions are typically seen as a gradual increase in detrusor pressure without subsequent decrease, but no essential differences exist between gas and water cystometry in the classification of qualitative data.\u201d However, plaintiff alleges that defendant\u2019s negligence in incising her bladder has caused various urological problems, including \u201curinary frequency, incontinence, painful urination, and smaller bladder\u201d; therefore, not only would qualitative data appear to be necessary, but also quantitative data, as to which plaintiffs medical submission states that when gas is used, \u201c[a]n artefactual, initial pressure increase may be seen,\u201d and that \u201cbladder capacity is often only 2/3 of the capacity measured with medium-fill water cystometry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Defendant\u2019s medical submission also indicated the following disadvantages of using gas: \u201c[r]apid filling [of gas] may [] lead to erroneous diagnosis of reduced bladder compliance. It is not suitable for studying voiding, and leaking is very difficult to detect due to invisibility of gas. Gas cystometry is not reliable [] and thus not recommended.\u201d Dr. Saypol indicated that the only abnormality shown in Dr. Booijian\u2019s report is \u201creduced bladder capacity, which can be easily explained by the use of C02 and lacks the requisite detail necessary for a proper diagnosis.\u201d Apparently, then, the use of gas versus liquid can yield significantly different results. Furthermore, the judge specifically asked plaintiffs counsel whether another medical procedure is available to find out the same information, but received no answer. As defendant sought the examination to determine \u201cthe extent, na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>ture and cause of the bladder condition\u201d and could not obtain the information by alternative means, the trial judge could have concluded that defendant has a strong interest in independently examining plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The judge saw the issue as a need to weigh plaintiffs resistance to the requested procedures due to the anticipated pain against defendant\u2019s need for the procedures. The judge noted that defendant\u2019s need for the information sought by conducting an IME must be sufficient to order plaintiff to submit to the exam. Indeed, the judge suspended ruling on the motion pending additional submissions by the parties regarding the accuracy of urodynamic studies when gas is used, versus when liquid is used, stating \u201cif it\u2019s a minimal difference, then we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re wasting our time.\u201d The judge also specifically averred that \u201c[e]ven if [plaintiffs] discomfort is all in her head, it\u2019s something that I still have to deal with because it\u2019s in her head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Ultimately, although the judge identified many of the issues, she failed to engage in the weighing process necessary to either authorize the procedure \u2014 a conclusion that the balance weighed in defendant\u2019s favor \u2014 or deny defendant\u2019s right to the procedure \u2014 a conclusion that the balance weighed in plaintiffs favor. She also concluded, erroneously, that she could not compel the exam but entered an order barring the claim if plaintiff failed to submit.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">A judge determining an application of this nature must engage in this weighing process and consider the factors that we have enunciated \u2014 there must be an inquiry as to the risk and legitimacy of the proposed procedure and then whether the test would produce the results sought. And, of course, specific findings are imperative not only to insure proper review, but to inform the litigants, as well. If defendant fails to demonstrate the second prong, or \u201cthe need factor,\u201d plaintiff should not be compelled to comply no matter how high or low the risk. These issues must be resolved on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">We next address the issue of the appropriate remedy. Any consideration of this issue requires us to recognize the polestar standard that orders must be crafted to accord with \u201cthe administration of justice.\u201d <em>McGovern v. Hope, </em>63 <em>N.J.L. </em>76, 84, 42 <em>A. </em>830 (Sup.Ct.1899). If the judge determines that the test is not safe, will generate substantial discomfort or will not provide the relevant information, defendant has no remedy other than cross-examination of plaintiffs health care professionals as to the bona fides of the administered tests and results. Defendant cannot comment to the jury or make inquiry of its expert regarding plaintiffs failure or refusal to submit to the test since the judge has determined that plaintiff need not submit to such exam. Defendant can explore comparisons between the various test alternatives, including providing direct proof of the \u201cbetter test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Where the judge orders the invasive procedure, different considerations apply. Under the particular circumstances here, the judge, rather than ordering plaintiff to submit to the objected-to invasive procedures, offered plaintiff the option of either \u201cvoluntarily\u201d submitting to the examination, or giving up \u201cher claim for damages relating to her bladder dysfunction and urinary tract complaints.\u201d This is a Hobson\u2019s Choice<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> not befitting the facts. \u201cA trial court has inherent discretionary power to impose sanctions for failure to make discovery, subject only to the requirement that they be just and reasonable in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Calabrese v. Trenton, State Coll., </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>145, 151-52, 392 A.2d 600 (App.Div.1978) (citations omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>321, 413 A.2d 315 (1980). Judges previously have utilized their authority to craft orders appropriate to the facts before them. <em>See, e.g., (Scott v. Scott, </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>189, 195-96, 462 A.2d 614 (Ch.Div.1983)) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>(limiting defendant\u2019s participation at trial in a matrimonial action to cross-examination, where defendant failed to \u201cfile a preliminary disclosure statement\u201d and provided no discovery); <em>Friedrichsen v. Niemotka, </em>71 <em>N.J.Super. </em>398, 401, 403, 177 A.2d 58 (Law Div.1962) (granting defendant\u2019s motion to compel plaintiffs son, not a party to the action, to submit to a physical examination, as \u201cplaintiffs cause of action depend[ed] upon the nature and extent of his child\u2019s injuries,\u201d requiring plaintiff to prove \u201cthe reasonable cost of such care and treatment as were necessitated by the injuries and only for such loss of services as resulted from the injuries,\u201d which in turn gave \u201cdefendant [] the right to prepare to meet that proof,\u201d and staying the proceedings \u201cuntil and unless [plaintiff] permits such examination\u201d). Under more extraordinary circumstances, we have approved as a sanction for a party\u2019s failure to provide discovery, the exclusion of such evidence at trial and even dismissal of the suit prior to trial. <em>See, e.g., Kolczycki v. City of East Orange, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>505, 512, 722 A.2d 603 (App.Div.1999) (upholding the trial judge\u2019s \u201csuppression of defendants\u2019 answer and defenses, because of defendants\u2019 persistent dereliction in providing discovery,\u201d as a proper exercise of discretion). \u201c[T]he overriding objective\u201d is, nevertheless, to allow \u201cthe defaulting party his day in court.\u201d <em>Clark v. Fog Contracting Co., </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>159, 161-62, 309 A.2d 617 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>319, 315 A.2d 408 (1973) (finding the court\u2019s \u201cexclusion of testimony on the ground of failure to supply information sought in discovery\u201d a proper exercise of discretion, as \u201cthere was no reasonably available opportunity to permit plaintiff to remedy his default\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Here, the judge declined to order plaintiff to submit to the procedures. However, recognizing the prejudice that defendant would suffer if unable to independently examine plaintiff, the judge then conditioned plaintiffs ability to present the relevant claims on her voluntary submission to the requested procedures. Our concern is that if the procedure had met the balancing tests we have previously addressed, other options were available that did not involve exclusion of plaintiffs claim \u2014 a bar that for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>intents and purposes eliminated a significant part of plaintiffs claim for damages. We now explore these options.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Other jurisdictions have recognized a court\u2019s discretion to issue similar discovery orders and impose sanctions against non-complying parties. By objecting, plaintiff \u201csubjects [herself] to the possibility of sanctions that may just as effectively prevent [her] from prosecuting [her] case as that refusal hinders [her] opponent\u2019s ability to defend.\u201d <em>Larsen v. New, </em>47 <em>Conn.Supp. </em>536, 812 A.2d 220, 222 (2002). Possible sanctions against plaintiff include \u201ccross-examination, comment by counsel to the jury about that refusal, exclusion of expert testimony from the plaintiff, or other sanctions that the court may find reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>at 222. Dismissal of plaintiffs claim has been approved as a sanction. <em>See </em>McQuillen, <em>supra, </em>306 <em>N.W.</em>2d at 791-92 (upholding the trial court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs petition as a proper exercise of discretion, as the trial court had found good cause for ordering plaintiff to submit to a coronary arteriography and plaintiff had willfully refused to submit to same, even though the court did not doubt \u201cplaintiffs sincerity in not wishing to assume the risks of the test\u201d and acknowledged that \u201cless drastic alternatives were available\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\"><em>Klein, supra, </em>7 <em>F.R.D. </em>169, reflects the motion judge\u2019s view. Faced with plaintiffs objection to a cystoscopy on the ground that that it was \u201ctoo painful\u201d and could result in \u201cserious or painful consequences,\u201d the court there instructed plaintiff to \u201csubmit all reports of examinations by his doctors, hospital records, and statements of what his doctors will testify to in respect of [his] alleged injuries, based upon eystoscopic examinations and other related procedure; or, if the plaintiff prefers, to stipulate that no medical evidence will be introduced by him, obtained through eystoscopic examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169-70. Thereafter, in its supplemental opinion, the court ordered plaintiff to submit to the examination, concluding that \u201c[i]f the plaintiff shall refuse to submit to such examination, ... it would seem to the Court that the plaintiff is not entitled to the benefit of this jurisdiction for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>trial of Ms case, and the action will thereupon be dismissed.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Despite the motion judge\u2019s reticence to order submission to the invasive procedure and her concern that she did not have the authority to do so, we conclude that she did indeed have that authority. Only if plaintiff then refused should the issue of that refusal have been addressed. The judge rejected use of cross-examination as insufficient. We agree that where a procedure is ordered, cross-examination as the sole remedy available to defendant is insufficient. That remedy gives him nothing more than he already has. We agree that the alternative of barring Dr. Boorjian\u2019s testimony or his test may be an inappropriate remedy if the results are so integrated into the record as to effectively bar the claim or the basis on which her expert based his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">We deem the last and least favorable option to be a bar of plaintiffs claim. Although a party places his or her physical condition in controversy upon beginning a medical malpractice lawsuit, \u201ca person should not be required to place his [or her] health or life in danger as a condition to maintaining suit.\u201d <em>Stasiak, supra, </em>169 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>55, 590 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 979. Neither should a person who has chosen a course of treatment with Ms or her own treating physician, thereby leaving him or her open to certain risks, then be compelled to be exposed to the same level of risk for discovery purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">We add one additional observation and consideration for a trial judge who has determined that a plaintiff must submit to an invasive procedure as part of an IME. During the course of the process to determine the bona fides of the proposed invasive procedure, the proponent\u2019s expert witness who will presumably administer the procedure is no longer simply a physician but in some sense, has become plaintiffs adversary. If the expert-physician undertakes the invasive procedure, his or her relationship with the patient may well be more than merely an examining expert-physician, an issue that we need not address or resolve here. Certainly, the elements of trust and confidence, critical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>concerns of a physician and patient when undergoing an invasive procedure, may be compromised in this scenario. To address these concerns, the trial judge may consider the appointment of a neutral physician to administer the procedure. This physician may be chosen by agreement of the parties or their experts or, as a matter of last resort, by the judge. The neutral physician would testify as a fact, not an expert, witness and the physician\u2019s test results would be available to the parties and their experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">An appropriate balance of the competing interests would be served by adopting, in part, the rule enunciated by the Connecticut court in <em>Larsen. </em>That will include allowing testimony by defendant\u2019s experts as to the nature of the proposed procedure, the risks involved and the benefit to be served by the results of the test. Moreover, counsel should be given the opportunity to argue to the jury that, where ordered, plaintiff has refused to allow the procedure.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">We are concerned that the trial not devolve into a dispute overly focused on plaintiffs refusal to submit to the procedure. In sum, we do not want the \u201cshield\u201d of properly-sought and warranted invasive examinations to become a \u201csword\u201d for barring legitimate claims. However, we also recognize that as to plaintiffs claim for damages here, plaintiffs refusal may well be an important consideration in the ultimate determination of the jury. Finally, we note that these cases are fact-sensitive and require careful analysis and weighing by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\"> This determination, as well as the balancing process that we describe may, in appropriate cases, require more than consideration of conflicting certifications.
