The trial judge merged the two counts and sentenced defendant to five years in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections consecutive to a sentence he was then serving. On this appeal defendant argues that (1) the trial judge should have declared a mistrial after discovering that a deliberating juror was a \u201cconvicted felon who the trial judge himself had previously sentenced to prison,\u201d (2) the trial judge \u201cimpermissibly intruded on the deliberations of the jury,\u201d (3) \u201cthe State failed to meet its burden to prove that the consent to search defendant\u2019s residence was obtained from an authorized third party,\u201d (4) and did not prove that the consent to search was \u201cvoluntarily given,\u201d (5) \u201cthe police lacked articulable suspicion necessary to justify their request to enter defendant\u2019s residence,\u201d (6) the motion to suppress should have been granted because of the \u201cwarrantless search without probable cause,\u201d (7) the evidence was \u201cinsufficient as a matter of law to support a verdict based on constructive possession,\u201d (8) the sentence \u201cshould be vacated\u201d because of the judge\u2019s failure to find mitigating factors, and (9) defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cunduly harsh and was based on double counting of an aggravating factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Our careful review of the record convinces us that these contentions are clearly without merit and warrant only the following discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The proofs adduced at trial revealed that on October 22,1997, at approximately 3:30 p.m., Detective Jeffrey Carrier of the Plain-field Narcotics Division was \u201cdriving a marked police car\u201d eastbound on the 600 block of West Third Street in Plainfield. His partner, Officer Tuwana Marshall, was also in the vehicle. As Officer Carrier passed a driveway between 233 and 235 Muhlen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>berg Place, in a \u201chigh narcotic location,\u201d he observed defendant \u201con his knees reaching up into a basement window.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">According to Detective Carrier, defendant\u2019s arm was \u201call the way up to his shoulder,\u201d reaching up in an upward direction. Carrier believed that the individual \u201cmay have been going to a stash\u201d of narcotics in the basement. The observation was made from approximately seventy-five to 100 feet away while traveling at approximately twenty-five to thirty miles per hour as he drove past the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">After observing defendant, Detective Carrier made a \u201cU-turn as quick[ly] as possible,\u201d and drove up to the driveway between 233 and 235 Muhlenberg Place. Upon entering the driveway, defendant \u201cstarted to run.\u201d Carrier noted that the individual was wearing a \u201crust-colored leather jacket, with dark pants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Detective Carrier saw defendant enter the back door of the house at 652 West Third Street. Carrier followed him but the door was locked. Carrier radioed for backup and directed Officer Marshall \u201cto go to the front of the house to make sure nobody runs out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Thereafter, Detective Carrier \u201cknocked on the door\u201d that defendant had entered. A female answered and, after a conversation, Carrier entered the \u201ccommon hallway\u201d between the two apartments, and proceeded to \u201cthe door that led to the second-floor apartment.\u201d He knocked thereon, and spoke with another female who answered that door. Carrier advised the woman that \u201cit is possible that someone just ran up into her apartment,\u201d and Carrier entered the apartment with her permission, to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">While climbing the stairs to the apartment, Carrier observed defendant in the bedroom playing a video game. Carrier also observed that defendant was no longer wearing the rust-colored coat, but saw the coat \u201cover the back of a couch.\u201d Then Carrier \u201cchecked\u201d the jacket and \u201cfrisked\u201d defendant for weapons but did not go into his pockets or find any incriminating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u2022 Thereafter, Detective Carrier had defendant \u201ccome -with\u201d him and had Detective Edward Hafeken go to the basement window where Carrier had first observed the defendant. Hafeken reached in the window and \u201ccame down with a handful of suspected drugs.\u201d The narcotics seized from the window were found to be eleven vials of cocaine and four folds of heroin. The defendant was then placed under arrest and transported to police headquarters \u201cfor processing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Officer Marshall and Detective Hafeken corroborated Carrier\u2019s testimony in terms of what occurred outside the building. Thereafter, Detective Christopher Gulbin testified as an expert about the purpose of a \u201cstash,\u201d and in response to a hypothetical question, stated that the drugs were \u201cpossessed ... with intent to distribute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Defendant testified on his own behalf, and stated that at the time Carrier observed him, he was \u201ctying [his] boot\u201d in the driveway while \u201ctalking to his next door neighbor.\u201d The defendant testified that he \u201cjogged away\u201d from the police because if the police \u201cstopped and started searching\u201d him, they would plant drugs on him because he was in a \u201cheavy drug narcotics\u201d area, and he feared being found in violation of his parole and \u201csent back\u201d to prison. However, the defendant claimed that he was not selling drugs on the day in question and did not reach into the apartment basement window.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">A warrantless search of a home is presumptively unreasonable and illegal, and will be justified only if it falls within one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment and Article I, paragraph 7, of our State Constitution. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bolte, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>579, 585, 560 A.2d 644, 648 <em>cert. denied, </em>493 <em>U.S. </em>936, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>330, 107 L.Ed.2d 320 (1989); <em>State v. Valencia, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>126, 133, 459 A.2d 1149, 1152 (1983); <em>State v. Whittington, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>45, 51-52, 359 A.2d 881, 884-85 (App.Div.1976). The burden is on the State to establish that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>search is justified under one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>Ibid. </em>Consent, however, is a well-recognized exception to the warrant requirement. <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 <em>U.S. </em>164, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974); <em>State v. Maristany, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>299, 305, 627 A.2d 1066, 1069 (1993). And \u201cconsent may be obtained from the person whose property is to be searched, from a third party who possesses common authority over the property, or from a third party whom the police reasonably believe has authority to consent.\u201d <em>State v. Maristany, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 305, 627 A.2d at 1069 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Detective Carrier testified at the motion to suppress that, after being permitted to walk through the first woman\u2019s apartment to \u201cthe common hallway,\u201d he knocked on the door leading to the upstairs apartment. He advised the female who responded \u201cthat an individual just ran\u201d into the building but did not exit. She responded that \u201cthere\u2019s no one home, but I\u2019m here with my mother and some children.\u201d Carrier then asked if he \u201ccould take a look upstairs, and she said sure.\u201d He testified that, like the woman who led him to the common hallway, the female was being \u201ccooperative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">There is no testimony about the woman\u2019s relationship to the apartment, but no evidence suggests that she did not live there or have authority to consent to the entry. To the contrary, the fact that her mother was present and there were children there suggests she was a resident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In any event, it is \u201cappearances of control\u201d at the time of the search, \u201cnot any subsequent resolution of questions of title or property rights,\u201d that must be used to assess the validity of the officer\u2019s search. <em>State v. Santana, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>63, 71, 521 A.2d 346, 350 (App.Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>In his extensive oral opinion denying the motion to suppress, Judge Walter Barisonek concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">Here I find that the police knew this person did not have authority to run through the first-floor apartment. He had to be upstairs. A woman comes to the door, says my children are upstairs and my mother [is] upstairs. It certainly would be reasonable for them objectively to assume that she had control over those premises, and lived in those premises, and had authority to allow the police to enter. So in terms of a consent there is no \u2014 that is a lawful consent____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">There is no basis in the record on which we can disturb Judge Barisonek\u2019s conclusion that it was reasonable under the circumstances for Detective Carrier to believe that the female who answered the door had control over the premises and authority to consent to his entry after he observed an individual, not known to be a resident, run into the budding.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Defendant additionally claims that the State did not prove that the female was aware of her right to refuse consent. As defendant argues, our Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe State has the burden of showing that consent was voluntary, an essential element of which is knowledge of the right to refuse consent.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>349, 353-54, 346 A.2d 66, 68 (1975). However, <em>\u201cJohnson </em>does not compel the police to specifically advise the property owner [or person in possession of the premises] of the affirmative right to refuse an inspection.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 548, 660 A.2d 1221, 1226 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>322, 670 A.2d 1064 (1995). In <em>Brown, </em>the superintendent of a building consented to the search of a porter\u2019s room where incriminating evidence was discovered. <em>Id. </em>at 544, 660 A.2d at 1224. There we held that the consent by the superintendent was not affected by the police\u2019s failure to inform him of his right to refuse. <em>Id. </em>at 547-48, 660 A.2d at 1225-26. Moreover, there, as here, the third party giving consent was \u201cextremely cooperative with the police\u201d and there was no suggestion he would have declined consent if he were advised of that right. <em>Id. </em>at 548, 660 A.2d at 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">We add that motions to suppress relate to physical evidence, <em>see, e.g., State v. Robinson, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>495, 499-501, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>540 A.2d 1313, 1315-16 (App.Div.1988); <em>State v. Keegan, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 475, 457 A.2d 1205, 1207 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>320, 460 A.2d 710 (1983), and significantly, at the motion to suppress, the only physical evidence defendant sought to exclude was the jacket found in the apartment that defendant was wearing when observed at the scene of the stash.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no challenge to the admissibility of the drugs, and we conclude, irrespective of whether the defendant could otherwise now challenge the admission of the drugs themselves, that there was no basis to exclude their admission. <em>See State v. Ford, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 356-57, 651 A.2d 103, 106-07 (App.Div.1995) (plain view observation of defendant reaching hand into exterior portion of a window; stash located therein deemed admissible over dissent). <em>See also State v. Johnson, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>192, 209-10, 793 A.2d 619, 629-30 (2002) (drugs found after defendant observed placing object in hole beside a post on the porch of a multi-family house held admissible); <em>State v. Linton, </em>356 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 258-59, 812 A.2d 382, 384-85 (App. Div.2002) (no expectation of privacy in someone else\u2019s building).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Defendant asserts that the trial judge should have granted a mistrial after it was discovered a juror, J.M., had been convicted of indictable offenses and sentenced by the trial judge. Defendant contends that the denial of a mistrial violated his federal and state constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury, and entitles him to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>During deliberations, court personnel recognized the juror or his name, and, after investigation, the judge confirmed that J.M. had three or four \u201cindictable convictions\u201d and previously had been sentenced by him on a drug-related charge. Both parties agreed that the juror was disqualified and had to be removed from jury service. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A 2B:20-l(e). The juror was questioned by the judge and stated that he did not discuss \u201chis prior convictions\u201d or \u201cinvolvement with law enforcement\u201d with the other jurors. The judge then indicated that he would \u201cbring out each juror individually and make sure this jury in no way, shape or form has been tainted based on any discussions they may have had.\u201d Defendant nevertheless moved for a mistrial, but the judge indicated any such application should abide the jury <em>voir dire.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Four jurors indicated that J.M. told the panel that he observed a friend or third party placed under arrest, and \u201cfrisked\u201d or \u201csearched.\u201d No juror indicated that J.M. felt the law was, or should be, different than the judge explained, or should not be followed, or that J.M. said anything about his personal experience with drugs or with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">One juror did report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">MS. [M.]: I kind of felt it was \u2014 his behavior was contradictory to your instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">Did he ever give you any personal examples, personal history or experiences that he may have had in life, either through him directly or somebody he may have been with or friends concerning being stopped by the police and, you know, or frisked or anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">MS. [M.]: Generally, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">THE COURT: Generally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>MS. [MJ: In his own way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">THE COURT: Did he indicate how that personal experience and how it came to, you know, how did it come about that it involved him, did it involve somebody else? Do you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">MS. [MJ: Just the fact that he lived in Plainfield and he saw this happen to people and he knew, that he observed this happening. He knows how the police behave in Plainfield. He just said he knew a lot about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">THE COURT: Okay. But did he ever describe anything to himself personally, that [ ] personally involved him with the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">MS. [M.] That had happened to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">THE COURT: Happened to him, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-11\">MS. [MJ: Gosh, I can\u2019t remember that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-13\">MS. [MJ: No, but I\u2019d like to back step and answer your previous question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-14\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">MS. [MJ: He did make personal reference to himself because I offered a rebuttal to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-16\">THE COURT: What did he say happened to him personally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-17\">MS. [MJ: Bad experiences with the police department that has he been stopped for no good reason and stuff like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-18\">THE COURT: Kind of like hassle type things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-19\">MS. [MJ: Hassle type. I offered the \u2014 in\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-20\">No juror specifically indicated J.M. said anything that would affect the juror\u2019s ability to be \u201cfair and impartial.\u201d At the conclusion of the <em>voir dire, </em>defense counsel did not \u201cwish to be heard,\u201d and the judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-21\">All right. I did an individual <em>voir dire. </em>Obviously [J.M.] was drawing on experiences that he did have personally, but at least he did not express that to the jurors, and even though there is a diversion as to what was heard by various jurors. In other words some of them said, I didn\u2019t hear this, some of them did. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because they weren\u2019t paying attention, they weren\u2019t listening to him they were talking to somebody else, but, I think, you get a gist of what was going on with Mr. [MJ. He was talking about a potential, maybe minorities being treated unfairly because of police stops and not just minorities, people being treated unfairly with stops and frisks and things of that fashion. He certainly has every right in the world to question the application of the facts to the law, and I didn\u2019t hear any inference made by this jury where he said, you know, you shouldn\u2019t follow what the judge says. He had a right to express his opinions concerning the application, as I said, of the facts to the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>... the last two jurors indicated they overheard the conversations. So a couple of the jurors indicated that they didn\u2019t hear any references to persona] experience, but, I think, the overall theme was he did interject personal experiences, which he really should not have done. He violated what I told all the jurors in terms of deliberations and decid[ing] the ease based on the facts, not based on your personal experience as it relates to police behavior and anything else. I didn\u2019t get that specific, but that\u2019s what I meant, and we excuse jurors [ jbecause they felt \u2014 some felt good about police, some felt they weren\u2019t any good, and I gave instructions to the jury about that\u2019s not how this is done. It has to be done based on the evidence fairly and impartially, but he never referenced anything happening to him personally, and I\u2019m finding that based on the conversations with these jurors what he was referencing, he made it seem like it was always somebody else \u2014 not always. It was he was with somebody else who was adversely affected as a result of police conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">So I\u2019m finding at this point that there is no taint to this jury. He\u2019s been removed. We have two alternates. The alternates have not been a party to any of those discussions because they\u2019re not part of the deliberating jury, and I am going to put in one of the alternates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The trial judge thereafter advised counsel what he would tell the jury, and without objection instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">THE COURT: I mentioned to you when I gave you my instructions, my charge, that it happens that things occur during the course of a trial we have to excuse a jur[or]. You saw it first hand. Remember when I told you how \u2014 why we have 14 jurors as opposed to 12. It happened in this case. So what we are going to do now is substitute one of the alternates for Juror No. 8, Mr. [MJ- [The name of the alternate was drawn.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">I\u2019m going to give everybody further instructions at this point, and you have to follow what I\u2019m telling you now even though you may not like it. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">As you know Juror No. 8, Mr. [M.] has been excused from this jury. Miss [C.] as an alternate juror has been selected to take his place. Because of this change in the composition of the jury, you must set aside and disregard all of your deliberations up to this point and begin your deliberations again, just as if you are entering into that jury room after listening to my charge. In other words, all deliberations, all discussions that you previously had, have to be disregarded and you have to start your discussions anew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">In beginning your deliberations again you must eliminate any impact that Mr. [M.], Juror No. 8, may have had on your deliberations and consider the evidence in the context of a full and complete deliberation with the new member of your jury. Let me just give you a little example so you understand what I\u2019m talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">It\u2019s as if all of you are starting fresh, right after I finished my charge. So you can\u2019t say we talked about that already and what we said applies. You can\u2019t use your discussions or deliberations. Again, you have to start anew as if it\u2019s a whole panel just starting out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Any objection to the recharge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">MR. HENN: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">MR. SHIARELLA: No, Judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The jury is presumed to adhere to instructions, and we must assume the jury followed that mandate. <em>See State v. Cooper, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>326, 370, 700 A.2d 306, 327 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>1084, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>809, 145 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>681 (2000); <em>State v.

In this case, the juror\u2019s statutory disqualification required his discharge, and the trial judge, after questioning the remaining jurors, concluded that his interaction with the jury did not taint the jury deliberations. His conclusion, based on a fair evaluation of a thorough <em>voir dire, </em>is entitled to deference. <em>State v. Valenzuela, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 472, 643 A.2d at 589. In fact, defense counsel at the time did not suggest the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">The real question before us is whether a mistrial was required because here the excused juror was disqualified and should not have been seated in the first place. While there is some merit to that position, its application would undermine the significance and jurisprudence relating to <em>R. </em>1:8-2. Defendant does not point to any specific or actual prejudice based on the juror\u2019s initial participation, and we therefore see no basis for treating this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>differently from others involving jurors discharged for purely personal reasons, merely because the discharged juror was disqualified. In fact, as the Supreme Court found no basis to reverse a death penalty conviction when a juror lied or gave inadequate information during <em>voir dire </em>and even deprived defendant of the ability to exercise a peremptory challenge, there can be no reversal here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Cooper, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 347-51, 700 A.2d at 315-18. <em>Compare State v. Williams, </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>111, 462 A.2d 182 (App.Div.1983), where the disqualified juror had remained on the panel until the verdict was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">It is well settled that \u201csubstitution of an alternate juror during deliberation does not in and of itself offend a defendant\u2019s guarantee of a trial by jury.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>151, 162, 793 A.2d 594, 601 (2002). And here the discharge had nothing to do with the \u201cjuror bias, outside influences, or problems arising in the interaction between jurors.\u201d <em>State v. Adams, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>360, 367, 727 A.2d 468, 471 (App.Div.1999). Moreover, the judge ensured that the jury had not been tainted or prejudiced by interviewing each juror, separately, and ensuring that each could be fair and impartial. Accordingly, we cannot say the judge abused his discretion by denying a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">It is true that we have held that a mistrial was the appropriate remedy where a juror was excused after it was learned that he had been convicted of an offense at age fifteen in North Carolina. <em>State v. Harvey, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>167, 173-75, 723 A.2d 107, 109-11 (App.Div.1999). But there, a \u201crap sheet\u201d check was done after the juror was observed, by the prosecutor\u2019s investigator, \u201cmaking facial gestures\u201d as if he disbelieved the testimony of a rebuttal witness, <em>id. </em>at 173, 723 A.2d at 110, the juror was removed \u201cduring the second day of deliberations after the jury reported 11-1 deadlock,\u201d and the removal \u201cwas triggered by the State\u2019s perception that he might be an unfavorable juror.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174, 723 A.2d at 110. Here, the discharge was required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> Although relying on the judge's findings in defending the denial of the motion to suppress, the statement of facts in the State's brief does not recite the testimony from the motion to suppress. Only Detective Carrier testified at that motion, and his credibility was not challenged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\"> Defendant also asked \"that there can be no testimony from the police at the trial before the jury about finding the jacket and arresting the defendant.\u201d We recognize that the identification of defendant and his arrest followed the entry into the apartment. However, if the entry were valid, as we conclude, there was a basis for the detention for the short period before the drugs were recovered and the arrest perfected, as Judge Barisonek concluded. <em>See State v. Stovall, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>346, 356, 788 A.2d 746, 752 (2002); <em>State v. Citarella, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>272, 281, 712 A.2d 1096, 1100 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b348-12\"> As counsel did not have to be in court during the deliberations and defendant\u2019s attorney called in sick, defendant was represented by another Public Defender when the judge placed on the record what was reported and discovered, and his intention to interview the jury. This was done after both the judge and the office associate spoke with defense counsel by phone. The jury was excused until 1:45 p.m. when defense counsel indicated he could be present. The <em>voir dire </em>was conducted in his presence, and he did not repeat the request for a mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\"> We were not presented with a transcript of the jury selection.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b353-7\">PAYNE, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aof\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">I concur with the result reached in this case. However, in doing so, I am mindful of a line of eases that hold that omission or falsification of information by a juror during <em>voir dire </em>will constitute grounds for reversal of a conviction without a showing of prejudice if it can be shown that a peremptory challenge would have been utilized to excuse the juror. <em>See e.g., State v. Cooper, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>326, 349, 700 A.2d 306, 316-17 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>1084, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>809, 145 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>681 (2000); <em>In re Kozlov, </em>79 <em>N.J </em>232, 239, 398 A.2d 882, 885 (1979); <em>Wright v. Bernstein, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>284, 293-96, 129 A.2d 19, 24-26 (1957); <em>State v. Scher, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 262-68, 650 A.2d 1012, 1018-21 (App.Div.1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>276, 658 A.2d 299 (1995); <em>State v. Thompson, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 280-82, 361 A.2d 104, 107-08. We recognized the same principle in <em>State v. Williams, </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>111, 115-17, 462 A.2d 182, 184-86 (App.Div.1983), a case in which the parties were deprived of their right to challenge a juror for cause as the result of her prior conviction of a crime. The fundamental concern in these cases is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">\u201c[wjhere a juror on <em>voir dire </em>fails to disclose potentially prejudicial material ... a party may be regarded as having been denied a fair trial.\u201d <em>[Kozlov, supra, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 239, 398 A.2d 882[, 885].] The <em>[Kozlov] </em>Court explained that \u201c[t]his is not necessarily because of any actual or provable prejudice to his case attributable to such juror, but rather because of his loss, by reason of that failure of disclosure, of the opportunity to have excused the juror by appropriate challenge, thus assuring with maximum possible certainty that he be judged fairly by an impartial jury.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also State v. Deatore, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>100, 105-08, 358 A.2d 163, 166-68 (1976).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\"><em>[Scher, supra, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 264, 650 A.2d at 1019.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">However, in each of the eases in which a reversal occurred, the \u201ctainted\u201d juror participated throughout the course of jury deliberations and in rendering a verdict. In the present case, such did not occur. J.M.\u2019s identity as a convicted criminal was discovered before a verdict had been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>A juror is disqualified from service following conviction of a crime because the juror is untrustworthy. <em>See </em>comments to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:69-1 (repealed) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:20-1. That untrustworthiness diminishes the jury\u2019s fairness and impartiality, as constitutionally guaranteed. An argument can be made that J.M.\u2019s mere presence throughout the course of trial was sufficient to render the verdict in this case infirm, even if J.M. did not participate in rendering that verdict. If a searching <em>voir dire </em>of the remaining jurors had not occurred, if an alternate juror had not been available, or if the newly-constituted jury had not been properly instructed to commence their deliberations anew, I might accept this argument. However, the necessary inquiry took place, and it disclosed no <em>impairment </em>of the jury\u2019s fairness and impartiality. An alternate was available, and the jury was properly instructed. Under these unusual circumstances, I can find no principled basis for reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction based upon actual or presumptive denial of defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Additionally, I recognize that, as the result of the parties\u2019 and the court\u2019s inability to establish a basis for a challenge for cause during the course of <em>voir dire, </em>the composition of the jury differed from that which would have existed had J.M. been challenged for cause and removed from the jury panel. An additional and presently unknown person would have been selected to serve on the jury, and, following the selection of alternates, may have served as a deliberating juror. However, case law suggests no basis for finding a constitutional deprivation in this context. <em>Cf. United States v.
