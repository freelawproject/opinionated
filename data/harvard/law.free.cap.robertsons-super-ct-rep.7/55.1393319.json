The action is for damages for fraud and deceit on the part of the defendant, in representing one J. N. Land of Forsyth, Ga. the brother-in-law and a partner of the defendant, as perfectly good, and entitled to credit, whereby the plaintiffs were induced to sell him groceries, on a credit to the extent of $2560.74, of which $2260.74 remains unpaid. The plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits, on which the order of arrest was granted, set forth a letter of the defendant, dated Forsyth, Ga. November 7th, 1866, containing the representation as to. Land\u2019s solvency; the sale and credit induced thereby; the fact that shortly after the sale, the plaintiffs\u2019 agent went to Georgia, and found that Land -had absconded, and was utterly worthless, and that by common fame he was known to be, and for several years had been without pecuniary responsibility, and unworthy of credit, and that the defendant himself admitted Land\u2019s entire insolvency. The affidavit of one of the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendant was not a resident of this state, but resided at Forsyth, in the state of Georgia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">The defendant moved to vacate the order of arrest, upon affidavits amounting to a denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations ; without showing, however, that no cause of action existed. On an order to show cause, the order of arrest was vacated, and the defendant discharged.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-6\"><em>Wm.

N. Land, whereby the plaintiffs were induced to sell him merchandise. The allegation in one of the affidavits on which the order of arrest was issued, that the defendant is a <em>non-resident, </em>is not denied. I therefore cannot perceive upon what ground the order of arrest was vacated, as it certainly was properly granted, under the first subdivision of section <em>179 of </em>the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The order appealed from must be reversed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
