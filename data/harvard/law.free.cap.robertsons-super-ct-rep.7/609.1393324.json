The order to show cause, and the affidavits on which it is founded are, however, indorsed \u201c --att\u2019ys for plff.\u201d All the papers are entitled in the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-12\">The case as shown by the moving papers is this. The defendant was arrested in this action under an order of arrest. His brother-in-law, J. Halberstadt, employed an attorney to procure the defendant\u2019s release; the attorney undertook to procure bail for the defendant- on receiving $500 to secure him. The $500 was raised by the defendant\u2019s said brother-in-law, and by him paid to the attorney who procured bail for the defendant, and thereupon the defendant was released from arrest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-13\">This suit progressed, and about the 9th of April, 1866, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and said J. Halberstadt agreed that this $500 should be paid over to the plaintiff in part satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s claim in the action against the defendant, and-\u00a1that the plaintiff should release the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>fendant\u2019s bail in this action. Afterwards the plaintiff\u2019s attorney demanded of the defendant\u2019s attorney the said sum of $500 as his legal charges in this action, and offered, on receipt thereof, to release the bail and discontinue the action. The application is founded on the affidavits of J. Halberstadt, the defendant, and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. There are opposing affidavits which it is unnecessary to consider, in the view taken of the motion.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b618-5\">Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al8M\">This application cannot be granted: <em>First. </em>The papers are wrongly entitled in this action. The application is <em>dehors </em>the action, and is in no sense a step or proceeding in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\"><em>Second. </em>It appears to be made on behalf of the plaintiff, between whom and the defendant\u2019s attorney the relation .of attorney and client does not exist. . A summary application to compel an attorney to pay over money received in his professional capacity is only entertained on motion of the client. This is a privilege given to clients for their protection against such exactions and overreachings, which the attorney by reason of the confidence placed in him by his client might resort to. But this privilege and extraordinary remedy is not extended either to outside parties or to assignees of clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Motion denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
