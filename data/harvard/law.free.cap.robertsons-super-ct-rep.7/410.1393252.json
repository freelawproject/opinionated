I purchased the ferry steamer <em>Manhattan, </em>about one third larger than the <em>Tallaca, </em>130 feet long. She is a first rate ferry\u2014one that will command the trade. Her price was $15,000. I get a -per centage of it, which I will explain. Capt. Whilldin says she is a cheap boat. <em>You and Mr. Ehinehart will he in her the same that you are in the Tallaeea\u2014that is </em>$1000, <em>each, </em>* * The \"con-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-11\">sideration for such interest was services rendered by Morgan and Ehinehart for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-12\">A motion was made to dismiss the complaint, chiefly on two grounds ; <em>first, </em>that the contract was void by the statute of frauds; and <em>second, </em>that no sufficient consideration had been shown. The motion was denied, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-13\"><em>Mr. Davis, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-14\"><em>Mr. Goodrich, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b419-15\"><em>By the Court, </em>Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlB\">The objection that the contract is void by the statute of frauds, has no foundation. The action, as I understand it, was to recover one sixth of the value of the ferryboat <em>Manhattan, </em>upon the allegation that Morgan and Ehinehart were the owners of that proportion, the whole having been sold by the defendant, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the only evidence required to sustain the action, which was for money had and received, was to show' the extent of Morgan and Rhinehart\u2019s interest in the steamboat. That was shown sufficiently, I think, by the letter of Clyde to them, admitting that their interest in the <em>Manhattan </em>was the same as in the <em>Tallaoca.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The interest of Morgan and Rhinehart was denied by the defendant, and if it could he proved by the admission of Clyde either in writing or verbally, it was'sufficient. It was not necessary to prove a contract of sale and purchase, by which one party transfers title to property to another, but merely that Morgan and Rhinehart and the defendant were co-owners of the ferryboat. That could as well be proved by the. admission of the defendant, as in any ether way. If, being joint owners, the defendant sold the whole, he is liable for the value of the other interests, and the only question was the extent of such interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">There was, therefore, no question arising under the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The consideration for the interest of Morgan and Rhine-hart, was sufficient. It was services rendered in and about the defendant\u2019s business, and it was left to the jury to determine whether the agreement was that Morgan and Rhinehart were to receive the one sixth interest on account of the services which they allege they rendered to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">I have looked into the other exceptions taken by the defendant but do not think any of them tenable..</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">This is a simple action for money had and received to the plaintiffs\u2019 use, and was sustained by proof of the interest of Morgan and Rhinehart and the sale by the\" defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">\u2022 I think the judgment and order should be affirmed,' with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
