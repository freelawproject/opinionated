It is not necessary to except to findings of fact, or refusals to pass upon them. Any question as to the necessity of, or propriety of passing upon the latter is to be determined upon an application to have such facts as are material, and upon which there is any evidence, passed upon by the judge, in settling the case.</p><p id=\"b496-8\">2. Exceptions to conclusions of law must he served within the time fixed by the Code, otherwise they are too late; unless included in a case served within that time.
