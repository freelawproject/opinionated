When a party claims to hold a husband liable for money advanced to or for the benefit of the wife, he should in his pleading either aver the money to have been loaned and advanced to the husband, or to the wife, or for her benefit, at the husband\u2019s request, or with his cons\u00e9nt; or that he subsequently acquiesced; or that she was the agent of the husband in procuring the advance; or he should allege such facts as that an implied agency from the husband to the wife may arise therefrom.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b584-10\">(Before Jones, J., at Special Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AzOh\">December, 1867.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-11\">Motion for leave to amend answer.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b584-12\">Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqQR\">If the proposed amendment constituted a valid counter-claim, I should not hesitate to allow it.
