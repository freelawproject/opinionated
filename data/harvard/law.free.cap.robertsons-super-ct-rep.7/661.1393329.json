Where the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney agreed by parol that if the defendants (against whom a default had been taken) would come to his office and be examined, he would accept such attendance and waive the default; <em>Meld </em>that if the defendants were not in fault in failing to so attend and be examined, the plaintiffs could not insist on the original default.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b669-8\">3.

The affidavits of Alvar De Comean and of the defendants\u2019 attorney show that on the last occasion, when a time was fixed for examinations, one of the defendants attended, but the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney being unable to go on with the examination, it was postponed as to both defendants. Ho day was fixed to which the examination was to be postponed, but the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney was to give a reasonable notice when he required the defendants\u2019 attendance. Ho such notice has been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>There is no contradiction to this. The affidavit of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney does not contradict it.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">If the motion is based on the defendants\u2019 default in not keeping the parol agreement made in reference to the default taken in court, then the affidavits show (as above held) no such default.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Order below reversed, and a new order made denying motion, with |10 costs. No costs to either party on appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
