The causes of demurrer, assigned, are a want of jurisdiction, another action pending, an insufficiency of facts to constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>cause of action. It does not appear there is any other action pending; the former one being ended by judgment. The 375th section of the Code, applies only to courts of record, (14 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>421;) and even if the Marine Court came within its purview, it does not supersede the remedy by action. <em>(Dean </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>29 <em>How. U. S. </em>222.) It is more than doubtful whether the first judgment is one <em>in personam </em>as regards the party not served, so as to require an application for leave to sue, under section 71 of the Code. <em>(Id. </em>221.) If it were, the omission to set up such leave is not cause for demurrer, the \"remedy being by motion to set aside the complaint or summons. <em>(Finch </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>5 <em>Abb. </em>225.) The addition of the defendantCujas, is not made ground of demurrer, -even if tenable. <em>(Id. </em>224.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The demurrer must be overruled, and judgment given for the plaintiff) with costs, with leave, &amp;e.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
