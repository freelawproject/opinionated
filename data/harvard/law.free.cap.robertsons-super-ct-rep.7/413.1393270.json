That some time during the quarter ending on February 1, 1866, Planer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Kayser assigned and transferred to the defendants, Planer, Bramsdorf and Vail, all their right, title and interest in the said premises, 85, 87 and 89 Elizabeth street, including the-additional story above mentioned, and the defendants entered into, and ever since have been, and now are in the full use and occupation and enjoyment thereof; and that $75 is a fair and reasonable rent and sum for the use and occupation of said additional story for three months,, ending May 1, -1866. The plaintiff further stated that he notified the defendants that if they used and occupied the additional story, the _ rent of the same for the year commencing on May 1,1866, would be $400, payable quarterly in advance; which rent the plaintiff\" averred is a fair and reasonable rent and sum for the occupation of the additional story; that said defendants have not paid the sum of $75 nor $400, or any part thereof. The complaint, therefore, demanded judgment for $475, and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-5\">The defendants, in their answer, denied that some time during the quarter ending February 1, 1866, referred to in the complaint, or at any other time, Planer and Kayser assigned or transferred to. the defendants all their right, title and interest in said premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-6\">The cause was tried before Justice Babboub, without a jury. Upon the trial, without evidence upon either side, the defendants moved the court to dismiss the complaint, upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; \u2022 which motion was denied, and the defendants excepted. The plaintiffs then moved the court for judgment on the pleadings. The court granted the -motion, and granted judgment for the plaintiff; and the defendants excepted. Judgment was-entered accordingly; from which the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-7\"><em>A. C.

All these allegations, except the assignment, are admitted, for want of any denial in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">That such a complaint contains facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for use and occupation for the one year, will hardly be denied. In the absence of any written or verbal agreement for the duration of their term, Planer and Kayser were only tenants of the additional story from year to year; and their term expired May 1, 1866, (1 <em>R. S. </em>744, \u00a7 1;) thus showing a clear cause of action against the defendants for use and occupation of the premises for the year beginning in May, 1866.' After that date, the defendants could not have been under-tenants of Planer and Kayser; .their term expired before the defendants\u2019 commenced. If not under-tenants, the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs as owners. ( <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>38. 7 <em>Hill, </em>88. 1 <em>R. S. </em>748, \u00a7 26.) The use and occupation of the premises would imply a promise to pay what they were reasonably worth, or, in other words, a reasonable compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>But it ie objected that an action on the case for use'and occupation is founded upon contract, and lies only when the relation of landlord and tenant exists. This is a sound principle, and rests not only upon authority but upon the statute. Such contract need not, however, be express; it may be implied from circumstances. <em>(Despard </em>v. <em>Walbridge, </em>15 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>374. 13 <em>John. </em>297, 240. 1 <em>Wend. </em>134. 17 <em>Barb. </em>149.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">It is admitted that the defendants went into possession, \u2022 occupied and enjoyed the use of the premises for fifteen months. They were notified what the rent would be if they used the premises. They deprived the plaintiffs of the use and occupation of them, and took the benefit and had the advantage. Upon these facts we are bound to infer an agreement,.and promise to pay a reasonable compensation. The promise or contract having been made out, the relation of landlord and tenant follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">This disposes of the defense to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for the year succeeding May 1, 1866, but leaves the question of compensation for the last quarter preceding that period undisposed of. It is averred that there was an assignment and transfer to the' defendants of all the interest of Planer and Kayser to the additional stoiy.; that it was. occupied by the defendants, <em>who went into possession. </em>The fact of the possession is admitted, and this is evidence of an assignment in the first instance. This principle has been held so often that it hardly needs the citation of authority to sustain it. It is broadly laid down in <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>(9 <em>Cowen, </em>88 <em>;) Williams </em>v. <em>Woodard, </em>(2 <em>Wend. </em>487 <em>;) Quackenboss </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>(12 <em>id. </em>555;) and approved in <em>Bedford </em>v. Terhune, (30 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>453.) All the facts are admitted which are required to make out the plaintiffs\u2019 case. Ko one thing is denied, except the assignment; and the occupation proves that.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">I am at a loss to see how the answer can avail the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>fendants, even if it is conceded Planer had an interest to assign. The rule implies an assignment from the occupation and possession, when proved; why does not the same implication result from the admission ? It was the duty of the defendants to have met the ease stated in the complaint, by their answer and proofs. Savage, J. says, (in <em>Quackenboss </em>v. <em>Clark,) </em>the fact of assignment is a transaction between the defendants and lessees, of which the plaintiff is not cognizant; the defendants are; there is no hardship in concluding them by their possession, \u201cunless they disclose the true state of their title. They might have set up \u00e1nd shown they were under-tenants; they might have set up and proved the term had expired before they Went into possession. These facts would have disproved an assignment, which, without such proof, would be inferred from the fact of possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The conceded facts fix the liability of the defendants for the use of the premises, and the plaintiffs\u2019 right of action for.the quarter\u2019s rent of the year. (30 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>458.) In every aspect in which we have been able to view this case, though one of some difficulty, we think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
