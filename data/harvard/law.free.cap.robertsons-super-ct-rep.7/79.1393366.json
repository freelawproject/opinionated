It is improper for a receiver to pay over moneys, to any one, without the order of the court. No one' but the court has a right to decide to whom moneys received by him belong, or are payable. Counsel cannot determine that matter to their own satisfaction, and compel a receiver to pay them the moneys to which they think themselves entitled, under penalty of removal.</p><p id=\"b87-7\">2. Hpon proper application, notice to the parties, and proof, the court will award money in the hands of a receiver to the party entitled. But until the receiver has accounted for the receipt and disbursement of moneys by him, no order can be made for the distribution of it.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
