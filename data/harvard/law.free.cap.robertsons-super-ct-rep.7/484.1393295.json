On the 3d of November, 1866, he directed Monaghan, a cartman, (who was engaged in taking coal from the dock to his coal yard,) to take a can of powder from the premises 700 Second avenue, which the defendant handed to him for that purpose, and to throw it into, the East river. At the time the defendant handed the powder to Monaghan, a man named -Gordon was standing in the cart with him; and Monaghan drove off with the powder, Gordon being with him. Monaghan drove down Second avenue one block, then turned into Thirty-seventh street, and drove towards the East river. The can being rotten, broke, from the jolting of the cart. A portion of the powder was scattered along the route. Just after Monaghan turned into Thirty-seventh street, he discovered that the can was broken. Then Monaghan and Gordon, having been told that the powder was damaged and of no use, threw the powder\u2014it being in cakes and lumps\u2014in the street. The plaintiff, a boy then about four years of age, in company with his older brother, and some other boys, were in Thirty-seventh street, between Eirst and Second avenues near the residence of plaintiff\u2019s father. There was a small fire in the street. This powder was in cakes scattered about there, and looked like coal known as \u201c coke.\u201d Some of the boys threw a portion of it in the fire; the result was an explosion which injured the plaintiff, as well as other boys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The action was tried before a justice of this court and a jury-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the complaint, on the grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-6\">1st.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahr\">In a case of this kind, where the sympathies of jurors are so apt to be drawn away from the 'Consideration of the principles which should govern the liability of any one who may be the original cause, -however remote or unwillingly, of an injury, a -full opportunity should be given to the party sought to be charged, to show acts of caution and good faith on his part. The learned justice before whom this action was tried, apparently upon that ground, instructed the jury \u201cto consider whether, under the circumstances, the extent-to which the explosive nature of the compound had been -deteriorated by reason of wet and damp, and the ground which both these parties had for believing it was not explosive, there was carelessness and negligence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the part of Monaghan in the throwing it out of the cart into the street, or in carrying it in such a manner that portions of it could be jolted out of the cart into the street.\u201d Under that instruction the jury, guided only by their own knowledge, would he likely to be governed entirely by the fact that the compound had been gunpowder and did explode, and find, therefore, that due care was not taken, because the defendant did not discover its explosive character. But I do not think it a matter of common' every day knowledge, that' gunpowder, submitted to the treatment to which that had been, in the condition that that in question was, was explosive. The can had originally been, for a time, submerged under water, after it'was thrown overboard from a vessel, and had again been wet in the plaintiff\u2019s store by letting water run over it and into a hole in its side,\" a month previous to the accident, and it then became apparently so hard and solid externally, that the pieces into which it was broken resembled coke, although internally it might have been damp. Jurors might have different degrees of experience in regard to the effect of water on gunpowder, and some, perhaps, none at all as to the explodability of powder submitted to such a process and treatment, as it was not matter of common knowledge that it would explode, and persons employed in using powder had more occasion than any of the jurors to know, by experiment, the effect on powder of such wetting, and how far there might be reason to believe it had lost its explosive character. If so, it was the duty of the defendant'to have ascertained the risk run in transporting such powder through the \u25a0 streets, by consulting such experts, as well as by making experiments himself. Undoubtedly a great many more precautions might have been taken to destroy the substance in question than were taken, but the question is, considering the risk to be run, were as many taken as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>would have been taken by a man of ordinary prudence to prevent harm, and one of those, undoubtedly, would have been consulting experts as to the risk to be run. I think, therefore, the offer of the defendant\u2019s counsel to show that the defendant \u201c submitted the powder for examination to experts, to those persons who were familiar with the use of powder in blasting, and that he was told by them that it was useless for any explosive purposes, and that his action subsequently was governed by that,\u201d was relevant, and ought to have \"been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">For that reason, I think the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial had, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
