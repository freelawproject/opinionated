On the 25th of that month, the justice who tried the cause made an order returnable before himself, on the 2d of November, for a motion for a new trial on his minutes. On the return of the order, the plaintiff objected to the motion on the grounds: 1. That the stenographer\u2019s minutes were not the judge\u2019s minutes; and 2. That there was not an order of the general term extending the trial term to November 2. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>justice overruled the objections, and denied the motion for a new trial. The order denying the motion for a new trial was entered on the 12th of November. Subsequently, the plaintiff' applied to the justice for a resettlement of the order of the 12th of November, so that it might embrace the objections to Ms entertaining such motion. . The motion for a resettlement was denied, and an order to that effect entered on the 6th of January, 1865. From this last .mentioned order the plaintiff appealed, and the same was modified by the general term on the 30th of December, 1865, as was also the order of November 12, 1864, by striking out \u201c 12th\u201d and inserting \u201csecond\u201d in its place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-5\">On the 7th of January, 1867, the defendant served a notice of appeal \u201c from the order of this court, made on the 6th day of January, 1865, as modified by the general term by order made the 30th day of December, 1865.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-6\">On the 7th of November, 1867, the .appeal coming on for argument, and it appearing that the appeal was from \u25a0the order of January 6, 1865, instead of the order of November 12, 1864, the case was ordered to stand over, to enable the defendants to apply to the special term for a correction of the notice of appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-7\">A motion was thereupon made at special term, founded upon an affidavit of the defendant\u2019s attorney \u201c that the notice of appeal contained the words 1 January 6, 1865,\u2019 by mistake, instead of the words and figures, \u2018 November 12, 1864; \u2019 that the said mistake arose from deponent reading said modifying order of December 30, 1865, as though it merely modified the order of January 6, instead of the order of November 12; whereas, both said orders were modified in one and the same folio, and by supposing that the order of January 6, was the order denying the motion for a new trial.\u201d That the defendants appealed in good faith from what said attorney believed to be the order for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The motion to correct the notice of appeal was denied, and .the defendants appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-5\"><em>G. W. Cotterill, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-6\"><em>John Graham, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b59-7\"><em>By the Court, </em>Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5i\">Ho opinion seems to have been written at the special term, but it is understood that the motion was denied on the ground that the justice conceived he had no power to allow the correction to be made, inasmuch as the notice of appeal sought to be amended, correctly referred to an order in the cause which, had been entered on the day mentioned in the notice; and that therefore, to amend the notice by inserting therein the date of another and different order, would be virtually allowing an appeal from the latter order after the time of appealing therefrom had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">I think the decision was correct. In the case of <em>Fry </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>in this court, (16 <em>How. Pr. </em>385,) the power of the court to allow an amendment of a notice of appeal, the effect of which would be, not merely to correct a mistake, but to enlarge the time for appealing in violation of the provisions of the Code, was fully discussed and all the cases examined. And it was agreed by all the judges that the \u25a0 amendment could not be allowed. I have no doubt the defendant\u2019s attorney intended to appeal from the order of Hovember 12; but unfortunately, his notice recited, the date of another and different order, which had actually been entered on the day of its date. To allow an amendment now would be in effect allowing an appeal long after the time for appealing had expired, which is expressly forbidden.by the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">I think the order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
