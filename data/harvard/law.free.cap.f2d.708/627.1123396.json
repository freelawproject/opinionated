Busbee, </em>471 F.Supp. 1326 (N.D.Ga.1979). The district court held that while the Hyde Amendment precluded federal funding of most abortion services, Title XIX of the Social Security Act nevertheless required states to fund all medically necessary abortions. GDMA accordingly funded abortion services for medicaid patients until January of 1981 when the district court dissolved its injunction in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Harris v. McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 100 S.Ct. 2671, 65 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980). In <em>Harris </em>the Court held that Title XIX does not obligate the states to fund abortion services for which federal financial assistance is precluded by the Hyde Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-28\">HHS subsequently refused to reimburse GDMA for the cost of complying with the district court\u2019s short-lived injunction. It \u201cdisallowed\u201d the $167,392 of GDMA\u2019s medicaid expenses attributable to abortion services, finding that the Hyde Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>precluded federal assistance. In conformity with the procedures governing \u201cdisallow-ances\u201d, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1316(d) (West Supp.1983); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.13 (1982), GDMA asked the Departmental Grant Appeals Board to reconsider HHS\u2019s decision. The Board upheld the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Because there is some uncertainty about whether this court or the district court has initial jurisdiction in the matter, GDMA filed petitions for review in both the district court and this court. GDMA, asserting its belief that the district court has initial jurisdiction, moves to stay proceedings in this court pending the outcome of the district court\u2019s review. HHS agrees with GDMA\u2019s belief that the district court has initial jurisdiction but has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction. For reasons of consistency<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and economy<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we first decide the jurisdictional issue. Concluding that we lack jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">This court\u2019s jurisdiction hinges on whether HHS\u2019s decision is properly characterized as a \u201cdisallowance\u201d or a finding of \u201cnoncompliance\u201d. While the courts of appeals have initial jurisdiction over a noncompliance determination, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1316(a), 1396c (1974 &amp; West Supp.1983), the statute does not provide for direct review in the courts of appeals in the case of disallowanc-es. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1316(d) (West Supp. 1983). In fact, whether Congress intended to vest district courts with jurisdiction to review disallowance determinations remains somewhat unsettled. <em>See </em>111 Cong.Rec. 3068 (1965) (remarks of Sen Javits),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State Department of Public Welfare v. Califano, </em>556 F.2d 326, 329 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.1977) (stating in dicta that the \u201cstatutory history ... indicates that the section\u2019s sponsors recommended against judicial review of dis-allowances\u201d). <em>Compare Medical Services Administration v. U.S., </em>590 F.2d 135 (5th Cir.1979) (declining to decide issue); <em>Massachusetts v. HHS, </em>698 F.2d 22 (1st Cir.1983) (same); <em>New Jersey v. HHS, </em>670 F.2d 1284, 1290 n. 11 (3d Cir.1982) (same) <em>with Illinois v. Schweiker, </em>707 F.2d 273 at 277-78 (7th Cir.1983) (district courts have jurisdiction to review disallowance); <em>Washington v. Schweiker, </em>slip op. (9th Cir.1981) (same); <em>County of Alameda v. Weinberger, </em>520 F.2d 344 (9th Cir.1975) (same); <em>Georgia v. Califa-no, </em>446 F.Supp. 404 (N.D.Ga.1977) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">A \u201cdisallowance\u201d, in archetypal form, involves technical audit dispute concerning specific and isolated payments. <em>See </em>H.Rep.No. 213, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 132 (1965) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1965, p. 1943 (\u201cdisallowances usually take the form of audit exceptions\u201d). <em>See also Medical Services Administration, supra </em>at 136; <em>Massachusetts, supra </em>at 26-27; <em>New Jersey v. HHS, </em>670 F.2d 1262, 1275 (3d Cir.1982) <em>(New Jersey I). </em>In contrast, the classic case of \u201cnoncompliance\u201d involves a determination that the state\u2019s overall rate methodology has been so changed that it no longer complies with federal requirements or that the state\u2019s administration of its plan violates federal requirements. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396c. Administrative determinations often do not fall neatly into one distinct category or the other. In such cases courts have resorted to a variety of different tests to aid them in distinguishing between disal-lowances and noncompliance determinations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our cases have drawn the distinc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>tion with reference to the character of the administrative determination, viewed in light of the policies underlying \u00a7 1316(a)\u2019s provision for direct review in the court of appeals. <em>See Medical Services Administration, supra; State Department of Public Welfare, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">HHS\u2019s finding here contains elements of both a disallowance and a noncompliance determination. As with a noncompliance determination, this dispute does not center on the accuracy of HHS\u2019s audit; the parties do not disagree on the amount GDMA spent on abortion services pursuant to the court order. Rather, the nature of the controversy is primarily legal, focusing on HHS\u2019s alleged obligation to reimburse states for payments made in complying with a district court order that is ultimately overturned. <em>See New Jersey I, supra </em>at 1273. Additionally, GDMA, in complying with the district court\u2019s order, can be viewed as amending its plan to provide reimbursement for abortion services. HHS\u2019s decision to deny reimbursement to GDMA can accordingly be characterized as a finding that GDMA\u2019s \u201camendment\u201d, insofar as it contemplated federal financial assistance, did not comply with federal law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">HHS\u2019s determination also possesses characteristics indicative of a disallowance. HHS, in processing GDMA\u2019s claim, has used disallowance procedures rather than the more formal noncompliance procedures.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Although the agency\u2019s treatment of the claim does not control this court\u2019s characterization of the dispute, <em>State Department of Public Works, </em>it is nevertheless relevant. <em>Massachusetts, </em>supra at 29-30.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, unlike the typical noncompliance determination, HHS\u2019s decision does not frustrate an ongoing desire of the state to implement a general reimbursement method or practice. Because GDMA does not seek to pay for abortion services now or in the future, the issue here involves \u201can isolated and highly focused inquiry\u201d into specific past payments and has no wide-ranging implications for future administration of the state plan. <em>Medical Services Administration, </em>590 F.2d at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Although the characteristics of HHS\u2019s determination do not alone compel a particular result, <em>cf. Medical Services Administration, </em>the purposes underlying \u00a7 1316(a)\u2019s provision for initial review in the court of appeals persuade us that the matter should be classified as disallowance. A finding of noncompliance, generally appropriate to remedy a broad, pervasive defect in the state\u2019s plan as a whole, see <em>New Jersey I, supra </em>at 1269, impairs the state\u2019s ability to implement an important aspect of its reimbursement plan. Further, HHS, in cases of noncompliance, may utilize the rather drastic sanction of halting the flow of all federal funds. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra. </em>Because the adverse consequences associated with a noncompliance determination might be severe, Congress eliminated one tier of judicial review, giving states a more expeditious opportunity to vindicate their asserted rights. As the Senate Report explains, the provisions for administrative and judicial review of noncompliance determinations were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">designed to assure that the States will not encounter <em>undue delays </em>in obtaining Federal determinations on acceptability of proposed State plan material under the public assistance programs ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1965) (emphasis added), <em>reprinted in </em>1965 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1943, 2090. Congress thought that expeditious judicial review would place \u201c \u2018the States on a more equal basis with the Federal Government in the administration of the public assistance program\u2019 and thereby reduce intergovernmental friction.\u201d <em>State Department of Public Works, </em>556 F.2d at 331 (quoting 111 Cong.Rec. 5048 (1965) (remarks of Rep. Dwyer)).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">Here the policies underlying \u00a7 1316(a) do not apply. There is no special need for speed. HHS does not seek a general cessation of federal funds and its action does not implicate the future design or administration of the state plan. GDMA\u2019s belief that \u201cjudicial review ... in District Court is an appropriate procedural mechanism to resolve its appeal\u201d, Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Stay Proceedings at 2, persuasively indicates that the state\u2019s interests can be adequately accommodated without treating the matter as a noncompliance determination subject to initial review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">We accordingly characterize HHS\u2019s decision as a disallowance and dismiss for want of jurisdiction. We need not decide the availability of review in the district court. <em>See Medical Services Administration, supra </em>at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s motion to stay is DENIED and respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">. It would be anomalous to act on the stay without first concluding that we have jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">. Proceedings in the district court would be needlessly wasted were this court to refrain from deciding the jurisdictional issue now only to conclude upon reviewing the district court\u2019s decision that the matter is properly treated as a \u201cnoncompliance\u201d determination initially reviewable in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\">. Senator Javits stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-12\">Some States and local officials believe that some form of judicial review should encompass all aspects of the public assistance programs, including matching issues or audit exceptions. However, the much greater concern is for review of decisions regarding plan-conformity issues. The Commission believes that to involve audit exceptions or issues other than those of plan conformity in the judicial review process would create many additional problems.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b698-13\">. The First, Third and Seventh Circuits have all devised different tests. The Seventh Circuit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>reasoning that a jurisdictional test must draw a \u201cclean line\u201d, has held that it will defer to the Secretary\u2019s treatment of the matter as a disal-lowance or noncompliance determination. <em>Illinois, supra </em>at 628. The First and Third Circuits have adopted what the Seventh Circuit described as the \u201cfunctional\u201d approach. The First Circuit, for example, employs a three factor test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">First, we consider whether the matter might have fit comfortably within the statutory language of \u00a7 1396c, as a determination of noncompliance, if the Secretary had chosen that route. Second, we ask whether it is of such a character, by reason of its generality and importance, as to point towards inclusion under the compliance rather than the disallowance rubric. And, last, we look to the Secretary\u2019s chosen procedures and label \u2014 not as definitive but as entitled to some respect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArN\"><em>Massachusetts, supra </em>at 27. The Third Circuit similarly bases its determination on an \u201cindependent evaluation of the underlying substance of the dispute.\u201d <em>New Jersey I, supra </em>at 1272.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\">. In <em>State Department of Public Welfare, </em>Texas filed a claim for approximately $92,000,000 with HEW under the Social Security Act. HEW denied the claim, processing it as a disal-lowance. The former Fifth Circuit rejected HEW\u2019s classification of the claim, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO6M\">After reviewing the Act, the statutory history, and the circumstances of the claim, we have determined that the purposes of the Act and the equities are best served by treating this case as a plan-conformity dispute under \u00a7 1316(a) ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">556 F.2d at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">In <em>Medical Services Administration, </em>the court did not need to resort to policy analysis because there the underlying character of the administrative determination was clear. The court concluded that \u201cbasically this case con-cems an audit dispute\u201d and characterized HEW\u2019s determination as a disallowance. 590 F.2d at 136.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b699-14\">. Read literally, the statute limits a finding of noncompliance to the situation where the state, in amending or administering its plans, violates one of the requirements articulated in 42 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1396. Under this definition of \u201cnoncompliance\u201d, HHS\u2019s arguable determination that GDMA\u2019s plan, as \u201camended\u201d by the court order, is inconsistent with the Hyde Amendment would not qualify as a finding of noncompliance. HHS\u2019s regulations, however, reject this literal definition of noncompliance, stating \u201c[a] question of noncompliance . . . may arise from ... the failure of the state in practice to comply with a Federal requirement .... \u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-15\">Because we conclude on other grounds that HHS\u2019s determination is properly categorized as a disallowance, we need not decide whether a finding of noncompliance may involve a federal requirement not stated in \u00a7 1396. <em>See Massachusetts, supra </em>at 28 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b699-16\">. Where the state objects to a noncompliance determination, the statute requires that the Secretary hold a reconsideration hearing. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1316(a)(2). <em>See also </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.4 (1982). As interpreted in the Secretary\u2019s regulations, the hearing is a relatively formal, adversarial proceeding. <em>See </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 213 (1982). The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for instance, govern discovery. The state has a right to counsel and may call and cross-examine witnesses. The record of the hearing constitutes the exclusive record for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-17\">In contrast, the statute does not entitle the state to a hearing on disallowances; it provides only that the state, upon request, shall receive a reconsideration. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1316(d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>(West Supp.1983). The procedures governing disallowance reconsiderations are considerably less formal than those applicable where the state challenges a noncompliance determination. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.13 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"aaq-dedup-0\">There are also remedial differences between disallowances and findings of noncompliance. In the case of a noncompliance determination the statute permits the Secretary to withhold <em>all </em>federal funds until she is satisfied that \u201cthere will no longer be any such failure to comply.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396c. A disallowance, on the other hand, authorizes the Secretary to withhold only the amount it has determined the state has claimed improperly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b700-13\">. Where the Secretary has processed the matter as a noncompliance determination, initial review in the court of appeals is more appropriate for two reasons. First, the more formal procedures surrounding noncompliance determinations mean that the reviewing court will have a more developed record. Second, the more drastic sanctions that can accompany a noncompliance determination heighten the need for expeditious judicial review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
