Our previous order denying the petition is withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-22\">Britt brought a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, challenging his dismissal from his teaching job. A magistrate recommended that appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss be granted. He concluded that Britt\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies precluded suit. The parties filed no objections to the recommendation and the district court dismissed the action. Appellees contend that Britt waived any right to appeal the court\u2019s decision below by failing to object to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-23\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (Supp. V 1981), a judge may designate a magistrate to submit proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition of a motion to dismiss. The statute provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT5\">Within ten days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>and recommendations as provided by-rules of court. A judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) (Supp. V 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The language of the statute does not indicate that failure to object to a magistrate\u2019s recommendation will be an absolute bar to appeal from the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Lorin Corp. v. Goto &amp; Co., </em>700 F.2d 1202, 1206 (8th Cir.1983); <em>Nettles v. Wainwright, </em>677 F.2d 404, 407 (5th Cir. 1982) (en banc) (Unit B); <em>United States v. Walters, </em>638 F.2d 947, 949-50 (6th Cir.1981). <em>Contra Park Motor Mart, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>616 F.2d 603, 604-05 (1st Cir.1980). It specifies only that a judge shall make a de novo determination of findings or recommendations to which objection has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">We find no indication elsewhere that failure to object should be treated as a waiver of the right to appeal. The legislative history of the section does not show Congressional intent that failure to object should absolutely bar appeal. <em>See Lorin, </em>700 F.2d at 1206. Proposed Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72, which will govern magistrates\u2019 recommendations, includes no provision that failure to object will constitute a waiver of appeal. 51 U.S.L.W. 4505 (May 3, 1983) . The rule was announced April 28, 1983, and will take effect August 1, 1983 unless action is taken by Congress before that date. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">In Congressional hearings on the Federal Magistrates Act, witnesses expressed fear that Congress would improperly delegate to magistrates duties reserved by the Constitution to Article III judges. <em>See Mathews v. Weber, </em>423 U.S. 261, 269, 96 S.Ct. 549, 553, 46 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976). The Act\u2019s sponsors made it clear that magistrates remain subject to the supervision of the district judges and that the authority for making final decisions remains at all times with the judge. <em>See id. </em>at 270, 96 S.Ct. at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Under \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) the authority and the responsibility to make an informed, final determination rests with the judge. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baddatz, </em>447 U.S. 667, 682, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 2415, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980). The delegation of duties to the magistrate does not violate Article III if the ultimate decision is made by the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 683, 100 S.Ct. at 2416.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">The court\u2019s power to \u201caccept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate\u201d exists whether objections have been filed or not. <em>Lorin, </em>700 F.2d at 1206. The district court must decide for itself whether the magistrate\u2019s report is correct. Without this judicial review, the magistrate\u2019s performance of the inherently judicial act of granting a motion to dismiss would be constitutionally suspect. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>641 F.2d 659, 663 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 918, 101 S.Ct. 3055, 69 L.Ed.2d 422 (1981); <em>Lorin, </em>700 F.2d at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">This court has held that a district court with responsibility to make an ultimate decision based on a magistrate\u2019s recommendation under \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A) should consider the legal issues involved. <em>Campbell v. United States District Court, </em>501 F.2d 196, 206 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 879, 95 S.Ct. 143, 42 L.Ed.2d 119 (1974). We also have held that, in a \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) proceeding, failure to object to a magistrate\u2019s findings of fact waives the right to contest those findings on appeal. <em>McCall v. Andrus, </em>628 F.2d 1185, 1187, 1189 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 996, 101 S.Ct. 1700, 68 L.Ed.2d 197 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">The Fifth and the Eighth Circuits have held that failure to file objections does not waive the right to appeal the district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Nettles, </em>677 F.2d at 405; <em>Lorin, </em>700 F.2d at 1207. We agree. Supervision by the district court means nothing if purely legal issues decided by the magistrate are not reviewed routinely-</p>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">We disagree with the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that a rule of absolute waiver of appeal is necessary to achieve Congress\u2019 goal of reducing the workload of district court judges. <em>See Walters, </em>638 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>949-50. Waiver of the right to judicial review of magistrates\u2019 findings of fact produces substantial saving of time and effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">It is significant that Congress did not include a waiver provision in the statute. We are not willing to conclude that the failure to file objections renders a magistrate\u2019s recommendation a final and unassailable judicial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The only substantive issue in this appeal was whether failure to exhaust administrative remedies precludes a \u00a7 1983 suit. This was the controlling legal issue below and must have been considered by the district court. The question was properly before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Appellee argues that Britt consented to dismissal by filing a \u201cNotice of Plaintiff that he will not Oppose Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss his Complaint [at a hearing] on March 14, 1980.\u201d Later Britt filed a memorandum of points and authorities in support of his civil rights claim, and moved for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The district court did not treat that notice as a consent to dismiss, and we shall not do so now. We interpret the notice as a waiver of oral argument on the motion to dismiss. That was its only effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
