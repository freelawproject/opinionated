We hold that it is not. Alternatively, we are asked to decide that the specific jurisdictional interpretation rendered by the agency here was unreasonable; we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">This case arises from the Interstate Commerce Commission\u2019s interpretation of the reach of one of its regulations concerning the motor transportation of household goods, 49 C.F.R. 1056.7(e) (1981), in light of its general statutory jurisdiction. The Commission was required to revise its regulations in this area as part of its implementation of the Household Goods Transportation Act of 1980, Pub.L. 96-454, \u00a7 6(b), 94 Stat. 2011, 2016 (hereinafter, \u201cHGTA\u201d). That act, <em>inter alia, </em>directed the Commission to revise its regulations such that the \u201cCommission shall not prohibit\u201d a carrier from basing its charges on a reweighing of a shipper\u2019s cargo. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11110(c). Under the pre-HGTA regulations, charges were to be based on the <em>lower </em>of the initial and subsequent weighing of a shipper\u2019s goods, 49 C.F.R. 1056.6(d) (1980). Pursuant to the new mandate of the HGTA, however, the Commission issued a regulation which provided that the charges are to be based on the <em>higher </em>of the two weights, 49 C.F.R. 1056.7(e) (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">The complication in this case arises from the fact that, before and after the enactment of the HGTA, other federal agencies, including the Department of Defense (DOD), have issued regulations parallel to the Commission\u2019s regulation of household goods transportation governing the provision to these agencies of the services of household goods carriers. In the case of DOD, these regulations mandate, in contrast to the post-HGTA Commission regulation, that charges are to be based on the <em>lower </em>of the initial and subsequent weigh-ings of cargo. Understandably, the petitioners, who together comprise the major American private household goods movers, sought to have DOD's contracting division accept tenders of service incorporating the Commission\u2019s reweigh rule permitting a higher charge after reweighing, rather than DOD\u2019s contrary rule. DOD rejected such tenders, but the petitioners\u2019 views were bolstered somewhat by the issuance of an \u201cinformal\u201d and non-binding opinion by the Commission\u2019s Office of Compliance to DOD indicating that the Commission\u2019s reweigh rule should apply to DOD household moving contracts. When DOD refused to abide by, or appeal, this non-binding Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>opinion, petitioners filed a complaint in district court, not involved here, seeking an authoritative judicial construction that the Commission\u2019s post-HGTA regulation should control DOD procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The Commission, on its own initiative, responded to this litigation-spawning controversy by issuing an \u201cInterpretive Statement\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> whose procedural pedigree and substantive validity are challenged here. That \u201cStatement\u201d by the Commission parted with the earlier position taken by its Office of Compliance and concluded that the HGTA did <em>not </em>provide the Commission with jurisdiction to force DOD to abide by the Commission\u2019s reweigh rule issued pursuant to the Act. The Statement consisted primarily of an assessment of the jurisdictional reach of the HGTA-authorized regulation in light of the language and legislative history of the HGTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The Commission began by noting that the statute by its terms provides that <em>\u201c[t]he Commission </em>shall not prohibit [household goods] carriers ... from basing their charges on the reweigh weights... . \u201d (emphasis added) and that the <em>Commission </em>is to \u201cissue regulations that provide [household goods] carriers ... with the maximum possible flexibility in weighing shipment.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11110(c). Accordingly, the Commission concluded, \u201cBy the terms of the statute, these directions apply only to the Commission. There is no indication that Congress intended to expand our existing jurisdiction or to repeal any procurement regulations of other federal agencies that do not parallel our own.\u201d The Commission further noted that Section 6(b)(3) of the HGTA acknowledged that Commission regulations were not presumptively to be applied against other agencies in that it stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\"><em>To the maximum extent feasible, </em>the provisions of this section, including the amendments made by this section, shall apply to rules and regulations pertaining to transportation of household goods for the United States Government issued by departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States (other than the Interstate Commerce Commission) ... to the same extent as such provisions apply to rules and regulations issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, (emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">The Commission then stated that this limited view of the reach of HTGA-authorized reweigh regulations was further confirmed by the legislative history of the Act which provided in part that any implementation of the Act\u2019s provisions by other agencies was to be accomplished only through \u201capplicable proceedings ... to be instituted and carried out by the respective entities, such as the Department of Defense, or any other department, agency or, instrumentality having regulations that pertain to the transportation of household goods for the United States Government.\u201d H.Rep. No. 96-1372, <em>Household Goods Transportation Act of 1980, </em>96th Cong.2d Sess. 12 (Sept. 23, 1980), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1980, pp. 4271, 4282. Considering this language and legislative history, the Commission concluded that \u201cCongress could not have intended that our revised regulations would supersede or implicitly repeal those of such other federal agencies.\u201d The Commission also noted that this interpretation was consistent with the limited nature of its jurisdiction over rates for all government traffic under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10721.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Petitioners now seek review of the Commission\u2019s \u201cInterpretive Statement,\u201d arguing first that it was unlawfully issued because it was in fact a legislative \u201crule\u201d whose issuance must be preceded by the general notice and comment procedures of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 553(b) and (c) and not an \u201cinterpretative rule\u201d specifically exempted from such notice and comment procedures under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3)(A). Alternatively, petitioners argue that, even if this \u201cStatement\u201d were construed as an \u201cinterpretative rule,\u201d it must be stricken as an incorrect reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>of the jurisdictional reach afforded to rules promulgated pursuant to the HGTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">We confront first petitioners\u2019 argument that the Commission\u2019s Statement is in fact a legislative rule. Petitioners invoke several traditional criteria of a legislative rule: whether Congress specifically delegated to the agency authority to adopt rules on the subject matter; whether the decision is binding upon other parties; and whether the rule operates retroactively. We find the first two factors, in combination, decisive.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The principal criterion for distinguishing between legislative and interpretative rules has been stated succinctly by a leading treatise writer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">A legislative rule is the product of an exercise of delegated legislative power to make law through rules. An interpretative rule is any rule an agency issues without exercising delegated legislative power to make law through rules.. .. [Vjalid legislative rules have about the same effect as valid statutes; they are binding on courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">K. Davis, 2 <em>Administrative Law Treatise, </em>\u00a7 7:8 at 36 (2d ed. 1979). This criterion merely restates the common understanding that legislative rules usually involve matters within agency expertise, which expertise notice and comment procedures are intended to sharpen; by contrast, public comment before the agency cannot be useful in matters outside the delegated policy expertise of the agency. While it is true that Congress, through the HGTA, delegated to the Commission the power to formulate rules permitting higher carrier rates upon reweigh, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11110(c), it does not follow that the Commission was also delegated the power to rule in a binding fashion on its statutory jurisdiction to apply HGTA-authorized rules. Indeed, such an analysis would be wholly circular, for where, as here, the Commission decides the issue of whether certain jurisdictional powers were in fact <em>delegated, </em>it begs the question to assert that this jurisdictional decision was rendered on the basis of a <em>delegated </em>power. Such an analysis would produce the disastrous result that an agency would always be presumed to have legally binding and essentially unreviewable power to determine its own jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">The case law does not support such an exotic proposition. Indeed, as the D.C.Circuit noted in <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Federal Power Commission, </em>506 F.2d 33, 37 n. 14 (1974), \u201cAn interpretative rule expresses the agency\u2019s view of what another rule, regulation, or statute means.... The agency\u2019s announced interpretation is usually followed until it is overruled by a court, but the scope of judicial review is broad because the interpretation of statutory language does not involve the agency\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Accord, </em>K. Davis, 2 <em>Administrative Law Treatise, </em>\u00a7 7:11 at 56 (2d ed. 1979). This definition describes precisely the Commission\u2019s \u201cInterpretive Statement\u201d of its jurisdiction as evinced by the HGTA and its legislative history: the Statement expresses the Commission\u2019s view of what a rule (i.e. 49 C.F.R. 1056.7(e) (1981)) and statute mean together, and the scope of review of that Statement is necessarily broad because the question of jurisdiction is plainly not a matter within the Commission\u2019s discretion or expertise. <em>See Office of Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>655 F.2d 1132, 1141 (D.C.Cir.1980). Although we are aware of no case which presented the issue of the proper classification of an agency\u2019s statement concerning its preemption of the parallel rules of other agencies, in light of the general principles discussed here, it is not surprising that the courts have repeatedly classified agency statements concerning other aspects of the reach of the agency\u2019s statutory mandate as non-binding \u201cinterpretative\u201d rules rather than \u201clegislative\u201d rules triggering elaborate notice and comment requirements. <em>See, e.g., Energy Consumers &amp; Producers Association, Inc. v. Department of Energy, </em>632 F.2d 129, 140 (Temp.Emer.Ct.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 832, 101 S.Ct. 102, 66 L.Ed.2d 38 (1980) (agency determination of which oil wells are exempted from reach of relevant statute and regulations is an \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>terpretative\u201d rule); <em>Kenny v. Hampton, 475 </em>F.2d 1323, 1326 n. 4 (D.C.Cir.1973) (Civil Service Commission determination that Civil Service Act amendment not intended to expand coverage to certain class of retirees held to be \u201cinterpretative\u201d rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Here, the Commission did no more than determine from legislative language and history that Congress did not give it the power to impose its reweigh rule on another agency with a parallel and conflicting regulation. The resulting statement was plainly interpretative, not legislative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Petitioners alternatively contend that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the Commission Statement at issue here was \u201cinterpretative,\u201d the Commission erroneously interpreted the HGTA as not authorizing the Commission to impose its reweigh rule on other agencies. While the proper interpretation of the HGTA is a legal issue subject to broad review, some weight is still to be accorded the agency\u2019s interpretation depending upon \u201cthe thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Here, the Commission based its interpretation on the language of the HGTA indicating that only the <em>Commission </em>was not to prohibit new charges on reweighing, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11110(c), and that its rules were to apply only \u201cto the maximum extent feasible\u201d to other government agencies, Section 6(b)(3). The Commission further noted legislative history directing that application of HGTA-spawned rules to other agencies was to be accomplished only through \u201capplicable proceedings ... to be instituted and carried out by the respective entities, such as the <em>Department of Defense....\u2019\u2019 </em>(emphasis added). Commission counsel has further relied on appeal upon the explicit qualification in \u00a7 11110(c) that HGTA-created regulations were only to cover goods transported \u201csubject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. ...\u201d (The Commission finally relied on its limited statutory jurisdiction in the area of rate-setting for government traffic.) In the Commission\u2019s reading, this specific cautionary language would be superfluous if Congress had intended HGTA-authorized regulations to create automatic preemptory jurisdiction over the household moving regulations of other agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">Petitioners do not answer these persuasive arguments directly, but instead challenge the importance of certain segments of the quoted language or cite other indications of putatively contrary intent. First, they argue, the language in Section 6(b)(3) of the HGTA which provides for extra-Commission application \u201c[t]o the maximum extent feasible\u201d is only \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cprocedural\u201d language overcome by the \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201csubstantive\u201d language of \u00a7 11110(c) directing that the Commission \u201cshall not prohibit\u201d new charges upon reweighing. However, the proffered distinctions are without merit, for, with respect to the question of the intended reach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>HGTA-authorized and ICC-created rule, the language contained in Section 6(b)(3) clearly establishes the threshold requirement for application of the <em>entire Act. </em>Thus, this language is not only substantive in every meaningful sense but indeed is also more specific than the general precatory command of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11110(c). The Commission\u2019s reading of this language is further supported by the relevant legislative history which describes the intended non-automatic process of an agency\u2019s application of HGTA rules; significantly, petitioners do not even address this highly revealing legislative prelude.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Petitioners\u2019 second challenge to the Commission\u2019s interpretation argues that since the legislative history of the HGTA noted several kinds of shippers <em>(e.g. </em>\u201cindividual shippers, commercial accounts, the United States Government, and ... certain other businesses\u201d) and the HGTA included a provision authorizing the Commission to issue regulations specifically protecting \u201cindividual shippers,\u201d the fact that the statutory progenitor of the reweigh rule at issue here, \u00a7 11110(c), uses only the general term \u201cshipper\u201d indicates that Congress meant to include all government traffic. However, this broad term is contained in a paragraph which plainly limits the reach of the regulation to moving transactions which are \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the Commission. To accept petitioners\u2019 construction would be to beg the prior jurisdictional question by ignoring the plain sense of the paragraph in which the term \u201cshipper\u201d is contained and by ignoring language of Section 6(b)(3) and the uncontroverted legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Finally, the petitioners. argue that the Commission erred in relying in its jurisdictional analysis on the Commission\u2019s limited authority over <em>rates </em>in connection with the household goods traffic of other agencies, as reweigh procedures do not concern such \u201crates.\u201d We need not reach this argument, however, as there is ample support for the Commission\u2019s jurisdictional conclusion in its examination of the HGTA, its legislative history, and the long-standing pattern of parallel regulation of the consequences of reweighing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Our independent assessment of the statutory materials presented convinces us that the Commission\u2019s \u201cInterpretive Statement\u201d was reasonable and correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the Commission\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\">. Interstate Commerce Commission, Ex. Parte No. M.C.-19 (Sub.-No. 36), <em>Interpretive Statement: Applicability of Revised Operational Household Goods Regulations To Government Traffic (June 14, 1982).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-9\">. Petitioners also argue that the Commission\u2019s denial of their Freedom of Information Act request, seeking internal Commission memoran-da explaining the \u201cInterpretive Statement,\u201d on the basis that such communications must be kept confidential in order to advance \u201ceffective agency decision-making\u201d evinces that the Statement was in fact a \u201crule.\u201d However, we see no semantic or common sense reason to assume that the use of the phrase \u201cdecision-making\u201d should be interpreted to mean legislative rule-making rather than the process of deciding to issue an interpretation of a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Petitioners also argue that the Commission\u2019s assertion in its Statement that \u201cwe do not be-heve our regulations can or <em>should\u201d </em>(emphasis added) apply to DOD contracting implies that the Statement rested on discretionary and fact-dependent judgments as well as statutory interpretation. This argument, however, strains too far, for the use of the word \u201cshould\u201d follows the introductory phrase \u201cIn the light of the language of the HGTA, as well as the relevant precedent ...\u201d and three pages of legal analysis in which no discretionary policy considerations are discussed; more likely, the word \u201cshould\u201d was used to communicate the pro-spectivity of the Statement rather than its soundness as a matter of transportation policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\">. Petitioners also have reminded us that the Commission\u2019s Statement was at odds with an earlier letter issued by its Office of Compliance. But prior inconsistency is only one factor in the review of the correctness of an agency\u2019s interpretation. See <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). We note further that the earlier letter was by its very terms \u201cinformal\u201d and non-binding, and that no clarification of it was sought. When the Commission finally, on its own initiative, formally addressed this somewhat complicated matter, it adduced extensive and persuasive statutory support for its position.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
