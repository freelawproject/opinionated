We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-18\">Congress first enacted the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, and later passed amendments contained in the Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments of 1977<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in an effort to improve working conditions and safety in the nation\u2019s mines. Congress established a compensation program to provide benefits to disabled miners and survivors of deceased miners if the miner was disabled or killed by coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, an occupational disease commonly known as \u201cblack lung,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in addition to imposing safety and health regulations on the coal industry with this legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-19\">The Act defines pneumoconiosis as \u201ca chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments arising out of coal mine employment.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(b) (amended 1977). The Act provides that the coal mine operator or its insurance carrier is financially responsible for all claims filed after December 31, 1973 unless an approved state workers\u2019 compensation program exists in the state in which the coal mine is located.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a), (b) (no state to date has adopted such a program).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-20\">In addition to the statutes previously discussed, Congress authorized the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ment of Labor to promulgate regulations to implement the protection afforded under the Act, including an expanded definition of pneumoconiosis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">\u201cFor the purposes of the act, \u2018pneumo-coniosis\u2019 means a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments, arising out of coal mine employment. This definition includes, but is not limited to, coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, anthraco-silicosis, anthracosisanthro-silicosis, massive pulmonary fibrosis, progressive massive fibrosis silicosis, or silicotuberculosis arising out of coal mine employment. For purposes of this definition, a disease \u2018arising out of coal mine employment\u2019 includes any chronic pulmonary disease resulting in respiratory or pulmonary impairment significantly related to, or aggravated by, dust exposure in coal mine employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.202.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Labor Department regulations also established a so-called \u201cinterim presumption,\u201d setting forth certain medical criteria which, if proven by a claimant, establish a rebuttable presumption of pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment. The \u201cinterim presumption\u201d set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203, provides that a miner who engaged in coal mine employment for at least ten years is presumed (subject to rebuttal) to be totally disabled by or to have died from work-related pneu-moconiosis if one of the following elements is proven: (1) a chest roentgenogram (X-ray), biopsy or autopsy establishes the existence of pneumoconiosis; (2) ventilatory studies establish the presence of sufficiently severe chronic respiratory or pulmonary disease; (3) blood gas studies demonstrate the existence of a sufficient impairment in the transfer of oxygen from the lung alveoli to the blood; (4) other medical evidence, including the documented opinion of a physician exercising reasoned medical judgment, establishes the presence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment; or (5) in instances where no medical evidence is available, the affidavit of a deceased miner\u2019s survivor or other persons with knowledge of the miner\u2019s physical condition demonstrate the presence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment. <em>Underhill v.

The United States Department of Labor, Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs Office, approved Lowis\u2019s claim and determined that Peabody Coal was responsible for payment of the benefits. Peabody Coal and Old Republic Insurance Company, Peabody Coal\u2019s insurer, denied liability and requested a hearing. Lowis was awarded benefits by an Administrative Law Judge after a hearing on April 15,1980 and the Benefits Review Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s liability determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Lowis was employed by the petitioner Peabody Coal Company at its coal mine in Pawnee, Illinois from December of 1966 through October of 1978. At the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge, Lo-wis described his coal mine employment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201cQ. During the twelve years that you worked for Peabody, would you tell me the different types of jobs that you had, different types of job classification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">A. Well, I was about three years a laborer, and I scooped on the belt. I run a ramp car, a buggy, and just odd jobs around in the runs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">Q. What else did you do? .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">A. Then after that I roof bolted for about a year, and the rest of the time, I put in as a repairman here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">Q. Now, the twelve years that you had with Peabody then at Mine # 10, would all of the jobs that you have just described to us been working underground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-13\">Q. Now, during the time that you worked for Peabody, this twelve years, and you have told us about the various types of jobs, would you describe the types of conditions that you worked in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-17\">A. Conditions I worked in, well, when I first started, we rocked just by hand, throwed the ribs, and you would have to throw rock dust on the ribs, be wet in the mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-18\">Q. Keep your voice up a little if you can, Howard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-19\">A. In the miner run, they used water on the miner, and the ribs would be wet, and we would have to throw that rock dust on the ribs and on the bottom. And we would have to throw, we scooped coal on a belt and then running the ramp car into the miner and a buggy, too, same way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-20\">Q. What were the conditions like under there, as far as dust, dirt, etc., like that, when you were working?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-21\">A. Well, sometimes they would be more than one scooping on a belt, and a lot of times, when they would throw a shovel full of coal on the belt, it would be dust a-flying, and it was kind of dusty scooping on the belt part of the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-22\">Q. During the \u2014 you told us you worked about eight years as a repairman here, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-23\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-24\">Q. Would that job involve working at or near the face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-25\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-26\">Q. How much, percentage wise, would you say of your work as a repairman here was spent near the face, where the miner was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-27\">A. Well, I would say about 50% of it, because, usually that is where the machines would break down, would be at the face, and that is where we would have to go to work on one.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Lowis further testified that toward the end of his career at the mine, he suffered from shortness of breath:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">\u201cwe have to walk in the runs where we worked on the machines and walking in, I couldn\u2019t make it, I would run out of air, I would have to stop and catch up with my breath.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Lowis retired from his employment with Peabody Coal at age 57 upon the advice of a physician because of respiratory problems and has been unemployed since retiring due to his respiratory problems. At the hearing Lowis stated that subsequent to his retirement he has continued to experience respiratory problems. Finally, Lowis testified, on both direct and cross-examination, that he had smoked an average of a pack of cigarettes per day for at least 30 years prior to retiring from Peabody Coal, and has continued this same daily smoking pattern since retiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Lowis also introduced the reports of three physicians in support of his claim for black lung benefits. Dr. James Foster,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> after examining a chest X-ray of January 1, 1979,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> found no evidence of pneumoconiosis, stating that the X-ray showed a small scar or tumor on Lowis\u2019s right lung and suggested that Lowis might be suffering from emphysema.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The X-ray film was also examined by Dr. Harold Spitz, a certified \u201cB\u201d reader,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> who also found no signs of pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">Dr. William Drake, director of the Pulmonary Function Laboratory at St. Francis Hospital in Litchfield, Illinois,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> on behalf of the Department of Labor, also examined the X-ray film of Lowis\u2019s lungs and concluded that it failed to demonstrate that Lowis was suffering from pneumoconiosis but rather, Lowis\u2019s condition more closely resembled emphysema. In addition to examining his chest X-ray, Dr. Drake performed a ventilatory study on Lowis. A ventilatory study determines a person\u2019s ability to move air in and out of their lungs, by measuring two separate criteria: (1) the forced expiratory volume (FEV), which is the maximum amount of air measured in liters that a particular individual can expel from his or her lungs in one second; and (2) the maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), which is the total volume of air, in liters, that an individual expels over a period of one minute during maximum repetitive respiratory effort. <em>See, </em>Lapp, A Lawyer\u2019s Medical Guide to Black Lung Litigation, 83 W.Va.L.Rev. 721 (1981). The ventilatory test performed by Dr. Drake disclosed that Lowis had an FEV of 1.19 (as compared with an estimated normal FEV of 3.07 for a person of Lowis\u2019s age, weight and height) and an MVV of 51.0 (compared with an estimated normal MVV of 136.4 for a person of Lowis\u2019s age, weight and height). The results of the ventilatory test performed by Dr. \u2022 Drake were sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>raise a presumption of pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Dr. Thomas A. Dew, Director of Pulmonary Medicine at St. Lukes Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, and a board certified specialist in the field of internal medicine and pulmonary diseases, conducted an extensive physical examination of Lowis on behalf of Peabody Coal. Dr. Dew\u2019s examination of Lowis, the most thorough performed in connection with Lowis\u2019s claim for benefits, consisted of testing his blood pressure, pulse, respiration, examining Lowis\u2019s ears, nose and throat, conducting a stethoscopic examination of his chest, reviewing the results of blood count and urinalysis tests, examining Lowis\u2019s chest X-ray and performing a venti-latory study and a blood gas study.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The ventilatory study conducted by Dr. Dew disclosed an FEV of 1.90 and an MVV of 57.0, qualifying under the Labor Department regulations to trigger the presumption of employment-caused pneumoconiosis contained in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(2). Dr. Dew also performed a blood gas study, which measures the lung\u2019s ability to transport oxygen from the lung\u2019s alveoli<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> into the blood. In a blood gas study, an arterial blood sample is tested for oxygen pressure (PO2) and carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2) measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). A reading lower than the normal PO2 of 97mm Hg and/or higher than the normal PC02 of 40mm Hg indicates an impaired ability to absorb oxygen into and/or expel carbon dioxide from the blood. <em>See, </em>Shapiro, Clinical Application of Blood Gases 20-23 (1973) <em>and </em>Smith and Newman, The Basics of Federal Black Lung Litigation, 83 W.Va.L.Rev. 763, 785 (1981). Dr. Dew\u2019s blood gas study of Lowis resulted in a P02 (oxygen pressure) reading of 66 and a PC02 (carbon dioxide pressure) reading of 43. In contrast to the results of the ventilatory studies conducted by Drs. Dew and Drake, the results of the blood gas study conducted by Dr. Dew were insufficient to raise the presumption of pneumoconiosis caused by coal mine employment contained in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(3).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Although the results of the blood gas study conducted by Dr. Dew were insufficient to trigger a presumption of employment-caused pneumoconiosis, the ALJ ruled that Lowis had established a presumption of employment-caused pneumoconiosis based on the results of the two ventilatory studies performed by Drs. Dew and Drake, coupled with Lowis\u2019s more than ten years of coal mine employment, under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(2).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The ALJ then turned to the evidence offered by Peabody Coal and Old Republic to rebut the interim presumption. In rebuttal, Peabody Coal and Old Republic introduced the deposition testimony of Dr. Dew, which recites in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">\u201cA. My conclusion about Mr. Howard Lowis was that he has moderately severe obstructive lung disease. His chest X-ray is interpreted as normal. Chest X-rays are poor interpretors of severe obstructive lung disease. He had no evidence of pneumoconiosis on his chest X-ray. I feel that he was totally disabled from mining on the basis of his severe obstructive lung disease. I could find no evidence that his severe obstructive lung disease was related to his coal mining with only a short exposure of 12 years, no dirty jobs during that 12 years, and the fact that his chest X-ray was completely normal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">Q. Now the job that he had, for the first two years, according to his statement taken, he was a laborer underground; and then the next two years he was a roof bolter which would require, him to come behind the mining machine and bolt up the roof; and then for the last eight years he was a mechanic, which is repairing of the equipment and it is down below with torches and welding and, of course, other repairs and welding. How is that in any way significant with that kind of history so far as your opinion and diagnosis is concerned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">A. His job as a roof bolter was probably the most exposure of among the jobs he had. He had two years in that job. His exposure is not large compared to most people who work in the mine. It was my feeling after examining Mr. Lo-wis that he had moderately severe obstructive lung disease on the basis of his cigarette inhalation, which was well supported by the changes in his pulmonary functions. His pulmonary functions were quite severe, deranged enough to leave him to be totally disabled. Yet at the same time his chest X-rays showed absolutely no evidence of even simple coal workers pneumoconiosis, so I think his symptoms are related to his cigarette abuse and not related to his occupation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">Q. Is there some way scientifically you can support that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">A. The best way scientifically is by definition. Coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis is defined by all the text books as occupational lung disease, Morton Seaton and other lung text books, in itself implies an abnormal chest X-ray. Simple coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis is known to have normally well preserved pulmonary functions and abnormal chest X-rays. So that the chest X-ray comes first from the dust inhalations well before one becomes beginning changes on a person\u2019s pulmonary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>function. Consequently, the man has severe pulmonary disarrangement by pulmonary functions but a normal chest X-ray. There is no way one can make the diagnosis this is related to simple coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis. <em>It has to be related to his cigarette smoking. The changes we see in his lung functions and on chest X-ray would not be unusual for someone who smoked this amount of cigarettes in his lifetime.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">No other evidence was introduced in an attempt to rebut the interim presumption and <em>no evidence was offered to challenge or contradict Dr. Dew\u2019s conclusion that Lo-wis\u2019s disability was caused by his smoking rather than his coal mine employment. </em>The ALJ found that Dr. Dew\u2019s deposition testimony failed to rebut the interim presumption which arose because of the ventilatory study results:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">\u201cUpon evaluation of his rebuttal evidence, I have concluded that it does not form a basis for refuting the inference that the claimant\u2019s total disability resulted from his exposure to coal mine dust because Doctor Dew could not state with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that claimant\u2019s respiratory impairment was caused by his cigarette smoking and because his conclusion appears to be based exclusively on chest X-rays.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEr\">Having concluded that the interim presumption had not been rebutted, the ALJ found Peabody Coal liable for Lowis\u2019s compensation claims. The Benefits Review Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In this appeal, Peabody Coal and Old Republic Insurance concede that the interim presumption was properly invoked and that Lowis\u2019s respiratory condition renders him totally disabled. However, the appellants contend that Lowis\u2019s respiratory condition arose from his cigarette smoking, not from his coal mine employment, and that the ALJ erred in finding that the interim presumption of pneumoconiosis caused by coal mine employment had not been rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The ALJ\u2019s finding that Peabody Coal failed to rebut the interim presumption was based on a determination that (1) \u201cDoctor Dew could not state with a reasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d that Lowis\u2019s disability was caused by cigarette smoking rather than coal mine employment; and (2) Dr. Dew\u2019s conclusion \u201cappears to be based exclusively on chest X-rays.\u201d The issue we consider is whether the ALJ\u2019s rejection of Peabody Coal\u2019s rebuttal evidence was supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law. <em>Underhill v. Peabody Coal Co., </em>687 F.2d 217, 222 (7th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">The ALJ relied on the Benefit Review Board\u2019s decision in <em>Blevins v. Peabody Coal Co., </em>9 BRBS 510, BRB No. 78-406 BLA (1978) to support his rejection of Dr. Dew\u2019s deposition testimony because it was not phrased in the magic terms of a \u201creasonable medical certainty.\u201d In <em>Blevins, </em>the Benefit Review Board stated that testimony of a physician offered to rebut an interim presumption of pneumoconiosis must be \u201cphrased in terms of a \u2018reasonable medical certainty\u2019 ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">This court rejected the \u201creasonable medical certainty\u201d standard in the recent case of <em>Underhill v. Peabody Coal Co., </em>687 F.2d 217 (7th Cir.1982). In <em>Underhill, </em>a former coal miner claiming black lung benefits triggered the presumption of employment-caused pneumoconiosis through introducing ventilatory function test results. To rebut the interim presumption, the coal mine operator in <em>Underhill </em>introduced the medical opinions of three physicians stating that the claimant\u2019s lung problems were not caused by coal mine employment, but rather by chronic bronchitis and emphysema, which the physicians believed were due to excessive and long-term smoking. The ALJ rejected this rebuttal evidence because, according to the AU, the medical opinions were \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and not phrased in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>terms of a \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty.\u201d This court disagreed, and held that the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d standard was improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">\u201cWe also agree ... that the \u2018reasonable degree of medical certainty\u2019 standard advanced by the ALJ was improper. The purpose of this evidentiary test is to prevent speculation by the trier of fact, see <em>Kirschner v. Broadhead, </em>671 F.2d 1034, 1039-40 (7th Cir.1982), but it applies with equal force to both plaintiffs\u2019 and defendants\u2019 experts. Under the DOL\u2019s [Department of Labor] regulations, however, claimants are permitted to invoke the pneumoconiosis presumption simply on the basis of \u2018the documented opinion of a physician simply exercising reasoned medical judgment.\u2019 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.-203(a)(4). Although Congress authorized the DOL to liberalize claims criteria, the DOL cannot establish a standard that treats the same proof differently depending on which side offers it. Put differently, if a doctor\u2019s opinion based on mere \u2018reasoned medical judgment\u2019 is sufficiently probative for the purposes of claimants, it must be sufficiently probative for the purposes of mine operators and their insurers as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">This court in <em>Underhill </em>went on to hold that a physician\u2019s opinion, expressed in clear and uncontradicted terms and based on a physical examination, a ventilatory study, chest X-rays and a review of the miner\u2019s employment history satisfies the \u201creasoned medical judgment\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Dr. Dew\u2019s examination of Lowis was the most thorough performed on Lowis in connection with his pneumoconiosis claim and consisted of tests of Lowis\u2019s pulse, blood pressure, respiration, examination of ears, nose and throat, a stethoscopic examination of his chest, blood count and urinalysis tests, as well as an examination of the chest X-ray film and a ventilatory study and a blood gas study. It is clear that the ALJ erred in rejecting Dr. Dew\u2019s deposition testimony on the grounds that it was not phrased in terms of a \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty.\u201d Like the medical opinion held sufficient to rebut the interim presumption in <em>Underhill, </em>Dr. Dew\u2019s medical opinion based on a review of Lowis\u2019s employment history and the most thorough examination performed in connection with Lowis\u2019s claim for black lung benefits was clear and uncontradicted. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s decision, dismissing Dr. Dew\u2019s clear and uncontradicted testimony merely because Dr. Dew did not use the magic phrase \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty,\u201d is directly contrary to this court\u2019s <em>Underhill </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">The ALJ also supported his rejection of Dr. Dew\u2019s medical opinion by stating that Dr. Dew\u2019s \u201cconclusion appears to be based exclusively on chest X-rays.\u201d Although negative X-ray results <em>alone </em>are not sufficient to rebut the presumption of employment-caused pneumoconiosis, <em>Underhill, </em>687 F.2d at 223, <em>Ansel v. Weinberger, </em>529 F.2d 304, 310 (6th Cir.1976), negative X-ray films are highly probative and must be given great weight in rebutting the presumption when corroborated by other medical evidence. <em>United States Steel Corp. v. Gray, </em>588 F.2d 1022, 1028 (5th Cir.1979). <em>Cf. Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., </em>428 U.S. 1, 32-33, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2900, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976), <em>Underhill, </em>687 F.2d at 223. It is clear from Dr. Dew\u2019s deposition testimony that, while he did take in account the chest X-ray films, he in fact did <em>not </em>rely <em>solely </em>on the claimant\u2019s chest X-ray films in reaching his conclusion. Rather, in addition to the chest X-ray films, Dr. Dew based his medical opinion on (1) the duration of Lowis\u2019s coal mine employment; (2) the type of jobs performed by Lowis; (3) the results of the ventilatory study and blood gas study; (4) Lowis\u2019s history of cigarette smoking; as well as (5) Dr. Dew\u2019s thorough physical examination of Lowis. In his deposition, Dr. Dew stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">\u201cA. My conclusion about Mr. Howard Lowis was that he has moderately severe obstructive lung disease. His chest X-ray is interpreted as normal. Chest X-rays are poor interpreters of severe obstruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>tive lung disease. He had no evidence of pneumoconiosis on his chest X-ray. I feel that he was totally disabled from mining on the basis of his severe obstructive lung disease. <em>I could find no evidence that his severe obstructive lung disease was related to his coal mining with only a short exposure of 12 years, no dirty jobs during that 12 years, and the fact that his chest X-ray was completely normal</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">Q. Now the job that he had, for the first two years, according to his statement taken, he was a laborer underground; and then the next two years he was a roof bolter which would require him to come behind the mining machine and bolt up the roof; and then for the last eight years he was a mechanic, which is repairing of the equipment and it is down below with torches and welding and, of course, other repairs and welding. How is that in any way significant with that kind of history so far as your opinion and diagnosis is concerned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">A. His job as a roof bolter was probably the most exposure of among the jobs he had. He had two years in that job. His exposure is not large compared to most people who work in the mine. It was my feeling after examining Mr. Lo-wis that he had moderately severe obstructive lung disease on the basis of his cigarette inhalation, which was well supported by the changes in his pulmonary functions. His pulmonary functions were quite severe, deranged enough to leave him to be totally disabled. Yet at the same time his chest X-rays showed absolutely no evidence of even simple coal workers pneumoconiosis, so I think his symptoms are related to his cigarette abuse and not related to his occupation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">Q. Is there some way scientifically you can support that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">A. The best way scientifically is by definition. Coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis is defined by all the text books as occupational lung disease, Morton Seaton and other lung text books, in itself implies an abnormal chest X-ray. Simple coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis is known to have normally well preserved pulmonary functions and abnormal chest X-rays. So that the chest X-ray comes first from the dust inhalations well before one becomes beginning changes on a person\u2019s pulmonary function. Consequently, the man has severe pulmonary disarrangement by pulmonary functions but a normal chest X-ray. There is no way one can make the diagnosis this is related to simple coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis. <em>It has to be related to his cigarette smoking. The changes we see in his lung functions and on chest X-ray would not be unusual for someone who smoked this amount of cigarettes in his lifetime.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Dr. Dew\u2019s deposition testimony demonstrated that his final conclusion and medical findings were based on a compilation of the results of <em>all </em>his medical tests, studies and evaluations, including but by no means limited to the chest X-ray films. The negative X-ray results were fully corroborated by Dr. Dew\u2019s medical opinion based on the subject\u2019s medical and work history, including the duration and types of jobs performed by Lowis in the mines, the results of the ventilatory study and the blood gas study, Lowis\u2019s history of cigarette smoking and Dr. Dew\u2019s thorough physical examination of Lowis. Nevertheless, the ALJ refused to consider the substance of Dr. Dew\u2019s testimony and focused solely on his references to the X-ray results. In ignoring the substance of Dr. Dew\u2019s testimony, the ALJ violated the mandate of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b) that <em>\u201call </em>relevant medical evidence shall be considered\u201d in determining whether the presumption of employment-caused pneumoconiosis had been rebutted. The ALJ simply may not reach his desired result by disregarding the reasoned medical opinion of a board certified specialist in internal medicine and pulmonary diseases, which is based on extensive examination and medical testing of the claimant; \u201can ALJ is not free to substitute his own expertise for that of a qualified physician. ...\u201d <em>Underhill, </em>687 F.2d at 222. As this court recently stated in the context of an AU\u2019s findings in an unfair labor practice hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\u201cHaving carefully examined the record below, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence. Viewed in its entirety, the testimony of the witnesses does not contain the kind of \u2018important discrepancies\u2019 sufficient to support a finding discrediting direct, uncontroverted testimony. <em>White Glove Building Maintenance, Inc. v. Brennan, </em>518 F.2d 1271, 1274 (9th Cir.1975). In several instances, the ALJ has read testimony out of context or has failed to take into account other evidence which conflicts with the conclusions drawn. This kind of selective analysis is prohibited under the standard set forth in <em>Universal Camera. </em>Moreover, it is particularly inappropriate in a case where the inferences drawn are contrary to direct, positive testimony. In order to support such inferences, the evidence must be internally contradictory or inherently improbable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><em>NLRB v. Cutting, Inc., </em>701 F.2d 659, 665 (7th Cir.1983). Likewise, the ALJ in this case performed a selective analysis of the rebuttal testimony, taking out of context Dr. Dew\u2019s references to the X-ray films in order to reach the desired result. In summary, we conclude that there was no valid legal basis for the ALJ\u2019s refusal to consider Dr. Dew\u2019s direct, uncontradicted testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The medical evidence introduced before the ALJ consistently demonstrated that Lowis did not suffer from pneumoconiosis caused by coal mine employment. Drs. Foster, Spitz, Drake and Dew all found no medical evidence that Lowis was suffering from employment-caused pneumoconiosis and Drs. Foster and Drake both concluded that Lowis was more likely suffering from emphysema, rather than employment-caused pneumoconiosis. Dr. Dew stated in unequivocal terms that, based on a thorough physical examination, Lowis\u2019s chest X-rays, Lowis\u2019s ventilatory test results, blood gas study results, his history of cigarette smoking and his employment history, Lowis\u2019s respiratory impairment was, in his medical opinion, clearly and unequivocally due to Lowis\u2019s cigarette smoking and not his coal-mine employment. Absent the support in the record of medical evidence to the contrary, we hold that the ALJ could not rationally conclude that Dr. Dew\u2019s deposition testimony failed to rebut the interim presumption established by the ventilatory studies. In summary, we hold that the ALJ\u2019s decision and the Benefit Review Board\u2019s affirmance thereof were not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s order is Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-13\">. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq. </em>as amended by 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-945 (1976, Supp. I 1977 and Supp. II 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-14\">. <em>See also </em>this court\u2019s discussion in <em>Underhill v.

Lapp, A Lawyer\u2019s Medical Guide to Black Lung Litigation, 83 W.Va.L.Rev. 721, 728 (1981) contains the following brief synopsis of the respective coal dust exposure of various job categories in coal mines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">\u201cAll men who work at a coal mine, whether underground or at the surface, are regarded as miners. The areas where the coal is cut is known as the coal face and it is the most dusty part of the mine. The men who operate the cutting machines and continuous miners and their helpers are thus exposed to the highest concentrations of coal mine dust. Shot firers and loading machine operators are only slightly less exposed since their work is also basically at the face. Roofbol-ters also work just behind the face and are thus similarly exposed, but they also may be exposed to silica from the rock strata above the coal seam. Shuttle car operators who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>convey the coal from the loading machine to the underground railway and the motorman and brakeman who operate the railway are exposed to smaller amounts of dust than face workers. The motorman and brakeman may, however, be additionally exposed to pulverized silica from sand that is placed on the tracks to obtain traction. Certain miners, whose base of operation is further back from the coal face, are intermittently exposed to coal dust. These include mechanics, electricians, and general laborers, whose tasks are to maintain the utilities, conveyor belts, tracks and the cage, and also to maintain the machinery and equipment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\">.
