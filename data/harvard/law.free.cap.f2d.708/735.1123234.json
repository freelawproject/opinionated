The appeals are brought by the Hopi Indian Tribe, the Navajo Medicine-men\u2019s Association and other Navajos, and Richard F. Wilson, et al. each of whom filed separate suits which were consolidated for trial by Judge Richey. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The Navajo and Hopi Indian tribes are federally recognized tribes of American Indians. The Hopi reservation and most of the Navajo reservation are located in northeastern Arizona and encompass a total area of 25,000 square miles. Approximately 9,000 Hopis and 160,000 Navajos reside on the reservations.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The dominant geological formation visible from the Hopi villages and much of the western Navajo reservation is the San Francisco Peaks. The Peaks, which rise to a height of 12,633 feet, have for centuries played a central role in the religions of the two tribes. The Navajos believe that the ^eaks are one of the four sacred mountains which mark the boundaries of their homeland. They believe the Peaks to be the home of specific deities and consider the Peaks to be the body of a spiritual being or god, with various peaks forming the head, shoulders, and knees of a body reclining and facing to the east, while the trees, plants, rocks, and earth form the skin. The Navajos pray directly to the Peaks and regard them as a living deity.. The Peaks are invoked in religious ceremonies to heal the Navajo people. The Navajos collect herbs from the Peaks for use in religious ceremonies, and perform ceremonies upon the Peaks. They believe that artificial development of the Peaks would impair the Peaks\u2019 healing power.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The Hopis believe that the Creator uses emissaries to assist in communicating with mankind. The emissaries are spiritual beings and are generally referred to by the Hopis as \u201cKachinas.\u201d The Hopis believe that for about six months each year, commencing in late July or early August and extending through mid-winter, the Kachi-nas reside at the Peaks. During the remaining six months of the year the Kachi-nas travel to the Hopi villages and participate in various religious ceremonies and practices. The Hopis believe that the Ka-chinas\u2019 activities on the Peaks create the rain and snow storms that sustain the villages. The Hopis have many shrines on the Peaks and collect herbs, plants and animals from the Peaks for use in religious ceremonies. The Hopis believe that use of the Peaks for commercial purposes would constitute a direct affront to the Kachinas and to the Creator.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">The San Francisco Peaks are within the Coconino National Forest and are managed by the Forest Service. A 777 acre portion of the Peaks, known as the \u201cSnow Bowl,\u201d has been used for downhill skiing since 1937 when the Forest Service build a road and ski lodge. The lodge was destroyed by fire in 1952 and was replaced in 1956. Ski lifts were built at the Snow Bowl in 1958 and 1962. Since 1962 the facilities have changed very little.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">In April 1977 the Forest Service transferred the permit to operate the Snow Bowl skiing facilities from Summit Properties, Inc. to the Northland Recreation Company. In July 1977 Northland submitted to the Forest Service a \u201cmaster plan\u201d for the future development of the Snow Bowl, which contemplated the construction of additional parking and ski slopes, new lodge facilities, and ski lifts. The Forest Service, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, conducted public workshops and solicited alternatives to Northland\u2019s plan. The Forest Service evaluated the proposed alternatives and identified six which were feasible and represented the spectrum of public opinion. These alternatives ranged from complete elimination of artificial structures in the Snow Bowl to full development as proposed by Northland. On June 23, 1978 the Forest Service filed a draft Environmental Impact Statement evaluating the six alternatives. Between June 23 and September 30, 1978 the Forest Service solicited public opinion on the draft Environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Impact Statement. Special efforts were made to solicit the views of the Hopis and Navajos.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">On February 27,1979 the Forest Supervisor of the Coconino National Forest issued his decision to permit moderate development of the Snow Bowl under a \u201cPreferred Alternative,\u201d which in fact was not one of the six alternatives previously identified. The Preferred Alternative envisions the clearing of 50 acres of forest for new ski runs, instead of the 120 acres requested by Northland. The Preferred Alternative also authorizes construction of a new day lodge, improvement, of restroom facilities, reconstruction of existing chair lifts, construction of three new lifts, and the paving and widening of the Snow Bowl road.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">At the request of various persons, including certain of the plaintiffs, the Regional Forester on February 7, 1980 overruled the Forest Supervisor and ordered maintenance of the status quo. The Chief Forester on December 81, 1980 reversed the Regional Forester and reinstated the Forest Supervisor\u2019s approval of the Preferred Alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">On March 2, 1981, the Navajo Medicine-men\u2019s Association filed suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia, naming as defendants John R. Block, Secretary of Agriculture; R. Max Peterson, Chief Forester of the Forest Service; the Forest Service; and the United States. The complaint sought a halt to further development of the Snow Bowl and the removal of existing ski facilities. This suit was consolidated with similar suits brought by the Hopi tribe and Jean and Richard Wilson, owners of a ranch located a mile and a half below the Snow Bowl.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The plaintiffs alleged that expansion of the Snow Bowl facilities would violate the Indians\u2019 First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, the fiduciary duties owed the Indians by the government, the Endangered Species Act, two statutes regulating private use of national forest land (16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 497, 551), the National Historic Preservation Act, the Multiple-Use Sustained Yield Act, the Wilderness Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Pursuant to expedited procedures agreed to by all the parties, numerous affidavits were submitted together with a Joint Stipulation of Material Facts. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. While these motions were pending the district court on May 27, 1981 permitted Northland to intervene as a defendant. After a hearing, Judge Richey on June 15, 1981 granted summary judgment to the defendants on all issues except the plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the National Historic Preservation Act. Finding that the Forest Service had failed to comply with certain requirements of that Act, Judge Richey remanded the cause to the Forest Service for further proceedings and stayed development until compliance. After the defendants reported back, Judge Richey on May 14, 1982 ruled that the Forest Service had achieved compliance and he entered final judgment for the defendants on all issues and vacated his stay. These appeals followed promptly and the defendants have agreed to delay development pending their disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">From our review of the record we are convinced that Judge Richey\u2019s conclusions of law are in accordance with precedent and not in error; Accordingly, we affirm the judgments. Our opinion considers in detail the claims raised by the plaintiffs under the following constitutional provisions and statutes: the Free Exercise Clause, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, the Establishment Clause, the Endangered Species Act, the Wilderness Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 497, 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">1. <em>Free Exercise of Religion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">Religious freedom is guaranteed by the First Amendment, which states: \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d The Navajo and Hopi plaintiffs contend that development of the Snow Bowl is inconsistent with their First Amendment right freely to hold and prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>tice their religious beliefs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Believing the San Francisco Peaks to be sacred, they feel that development of the Peaks would be a profane act, and an affront to the deities, and that, in consequence, the Peaks would lose their healing power and otherwise cease to benefit the tribes. They contend that development would seriously impair their ability to pray and conduct ceremonies upon the Peaks, and to gather from the Peaks the sacred objects, such as fir boughs and eaglets, which are necessary to their religious practices. As relief, the Navajos and Hopis seek a phased removal of all artificial structures on the Peaks, or, at the least, an injunction against further development of the Snow Bowl. Judge Richey, although he recognized the sincerity of the plaintiffs\u2019 beliefs, held that a First Amendment claim had not been stated. He found that the government had not denied the Indians access to the Peaks or impaired their ability to gather sacred objects and conduct ceremonies, and thus had not burdened their beliefs or religious practices. We agree with Judge Richey that the plaintiffs have not shown an impermissible burden on religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">To be protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, a belief or practice must be \u201crooted in religion.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Review Bd. of the Indiana Employment Sec. Div., </em>450 U.S. 707, 713, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 1429, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981). The parties have stipulated that the plaintiffs\u2019 beliefs are religious and are sincerely held, and the record contains abundant evidence supporting that stipulation. We therefore proceed directly to apply the Free Exercise Clause to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and the proof before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The Free Exercise Clause proscribes government action that burdens religious beliefs or practices, unless the challenged action serves a compelling governmental interest that cannot be achieved in a less restrictive manner. <em>See, e.g., Badoni v. Higginson, </em>638 F.2d 172, 176-77 (10th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 954, 101 S.Ct. 3099, 69 L.Ed.2d 965 (1981), <em>Barnett v. Rodgers, </em>410 F.2d 995, 1000 (D.C.Cir.1969). The initial burden of proof in free exercise cases is upon the plaintiff to demonstrate a burden upon religion. <em>See School Dist. of Abington v. Schempp, </em>374 U.S. 203, 223, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 1572, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963). Only if a burden is proven does it become necessary to consider whether the governmental interest served is compelling, or whether the government has adopted the least burdensome method of achieving its goal. In analyzing the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the ski resort expansion will burden their religions, we consider separately the effects of development upon their beliefs and upon their religious practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">The plaintiffs stress that development of the Snow Bowl for a ski resort is grossly inconsistent with their beliefs. The Hopis and the Navajos believe that they owe a duty to the deities to maintain the San Francisco Peaks in their natural state. They believe that breach of that duty will lead to serious adverse consequences for their peoples. Navajo and Hopi religious practitioners are deeply troubled by the development that has already occurred upon the Peaks, and expansion of the Snow Bowl will increase their disquiet.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>The First Amendment right to hold religious beliefs is absolute. <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 303, 60 S.Ct. 900, 903, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940). The Free Exercise Clause \u201ccategorically prohibits government from regulating, prohibiting, or rewarding religious beliefs as such.\u201d <em>McDaniel v. Paty, </em>435 U.S. 618, 626, 98 S.Ct. 1322, 1327, 55 L.Ed.2d 593 (1978). Notwithstanding the plaintiffs\u2019 concerns, it is clear that the government has not regulated, prohibited, or rewarded their religious beliefs as such, nor has it in any manner directly burdened the plaintiffs in their beliefs. The Free Exercise Clause, however, also proscribes certain <em>indirect </em>burdens on belief. Arguing that an impermissible indirect burden has been imposed, the plaintiffs direct our attention to <em>Sherbert v. Verner, </em>374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963) and <em>Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Sec. Div., </em>450 U.S. 707, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">In <em>Sherbert, </em>the plaintiff, a Seventh-Day Adventist, was discharged by her employer because she refused to work on Saturday, the Sabbath Day of her faith. The South Carolina Employment Security Commission refused the plaintiff\u2019s application for unemployment benefits, finding that her religious convictions did not constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d for refusing available work. The South Carolina Supreme Court upheld the Commission\u2019s determination. The Supreme Court reversed. The fact that no criminal sanctions compelled the plaintiff to violate her beliefs, said the Court, did not end the free exercise inquiry. Instead, held the Court, the government burdens the free exercise of religion when it conditions receipt of a government benefit, such as unemployment compensation, on conduct inconsistent with the recipient\u2019s religious beliefs. In <em>Thomas, </em>the plaintiff, a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, quit his job at a factory producing tank turrets because he believed armaments production to be inconsistent with his faith. The Indiana Supreme Court held that the plaintiff\u2019s decision to quit employment because of his religious convictions did not constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d and denied him unemployment benefits. The Supreme Court reversed, holding, as it did in <em>Sherbert, </em>that the government burdens free exercise when it forces an individual to choose between a government benefit and fidelity to religious belief. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-8\">Where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists. While the compulsion may be indirect, the infringement upon free exercise is nonetheless substantial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">450 U.S. at 717-18, 101 S.Ct. at 1431-1432.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\"><em>Sherbert </em>and <em>Thomas </em>are not factually analogous to the present ease. The government here has not conditioned any benefit upon conduct proscribed or mandated by the plaintiffs\u2019 beliefs. Acknowledging this factual distinction, the plaintiffs read <em>Sherbert </em>and <em>Thomas </em>broadly as condemning under the Free Exercise Clause governmental actions which strongly, if indirectly, encourage religious practitioners to modify their beliefs. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that governmental actions which \u201cdesecrate and destroy the spiritual character of a religion\u2019s most sacred shrine\u201d and which may thereby force practitioners \u201cto fundamentally modify their religious doctrine to conform to the changed circumstance\u201d create free exercise burdens under <em>Sherbert </em>and <em>Thomas. </em>We disagree. <em>Sherbert </em>and <em>Thomas </em>hold only that the government may not, by conditioning benefits, penalize adherence to religious belief. Many government actions may offend religious believers, and may cast doubt upon the veracity of religious beliefs, but unless such actions penalize faith, they do not burden religion. The Secretary of Agriculture has a statutory duty, <em>see, e.g., </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 471, 528 (1976) to manage the National Forests in the public interest, and he has determined that the public interest would best be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>served by expansion of the Snow Bowl ski area. In making that determination, the Secretary has not directly or indirectly penalized the plaintiffs for their beliefs. The construction approved by the Secretary is, indeed, inconsistent with the plaintiffs\u2019 beliefs, and will cause the plaintiffs spiritual disquiet, but such consequences do not state a free exercise claim under <em>Sherbert, Thomas, </em>or any other authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In sum, the plaintiffs have not shown that expansion of the Snow Bowl will burden their freedom to believe. A separate question, to which we now turn, is whether expansion will burden the plaintiffs in the practice of their religions.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The plaintiffs must have access to the San Francisco Peaks to practice their religions. Certain of the plaintiffs\u2019 ceremonies must be performed upon the Peaks and religious objects must be collected there. Because the plaintiffs\u2019 religions are, in this sense, site specific, development of the Peaks would severely impair the practice of the religions if it destroyed the natural conditions necessary for the performance of ceremonies and the collection of religious objects. The plaintiffs claim that the Preferred Alternative will impair their religious practices in precisely that manner. Few courts have considered whether the Free Exercise Clause prohibits the government from permitting land uses that impair specific religious practices. Of the cases which have considered this problem, we find <em>Sequoyah v. TVA, </em>620 F.2d 1159 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 953, 101 S.Ct. 357, 66 L.Ed.2d 216 (1980), to be particularly instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">In <em>Sequoyah, </em>a class action brought on behalf of practitioners of the Cherokee religion, the plaintiffs sought to halt construction of the Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River. The plaintiffs alleged that the dam, when completed, would flood the Cherokee \u201csacred homeland\u201d along the river, and would destroy \u201csacred sites, medicine gathering sites, holy places and cemeteries,\u201d and \u201cdisturb the sacred balance of the land.\u201d 620 F.2d at 1160. The Sixth Circuit affirmed a grant of summary judgment to the defendant, ruling that the plaintiffs, to establish a burden on free exercise, had to prove that the valley to be flooded was indispensable or central to their ceremonies and practices. The plaintiffs\u2019 proof was insufficient, held the court, as the evidence indicated that medicines obtainable in the valley could be obtained elsewhere, and that the flooding would not prevent the plaintiffs from engaging in any particular religious observances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Judge Richey relied upon the <em>Sequoyah </em>analysis in the present case, and held that the plaintiffs had failed to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>the indispensability of the Snow Bowl to the practice of their religions. The plaintiffs challenge Judge Richey\u2019s reliance upon <em>Sequoyah </em>on two grounds. They argue first that <em>Sherbert </em>and <em>Thomas, </em>and not <em>Sequoyah, </em>establish the standard applicable to their claim. They contend that governmental action which indirectly imposes a burden upon religious practice greater than the burdens involved in <em>Sherbert </em>and <em>Thomas </em>necessarily violates the First Amendment. Contending that the Snow Bowl ski area effectively prohibits the practice of their religions, the plaintiffs claim that their burden is greater than that of the practitioners in <em>Sherbert </em>and <em>Thomas, </em>who, the plaintiffs say, could have continued to practice their beliefs simply by choosing to forego government benefits. However, as we previously stated, <em>Sherbert </em>and <em>Thomas </em>considered only whether the government may legally condition benefits on a decision to forego or to adhere to religious belief or practice. Those cases did not purport to create a benchmark against which to test all indirect burden claims. Second, the plaintiffs argue that <em>Sequoyah </em>incorrectly interpreted the First Amendment. They argue that the First Amendment protects all religious practices, whether or not \u201ccentral,\u201d and that courts are not competent to rule upon the centrality of religious belief or practice. We agree that the First Amendment protection of religion \u201cdoes not turn on the theological importance of the disputed activity,\u201d <em>Unitarian Church West </em>v. <em>McConnell, </em>337 F.Supp. 1252, 1257 (E.D. Wis.1972), <em>affd., </em>474 F.2d 1351 (7th Cir. 1973), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>416 U.S. 932, 94 S.Ct. 1927, 40 L.Ed.2d 283 (1974) and that courts may not \u201cdictate which practices are or are not required in a particular religion.\u201d <em>Geller v. Secretary of Defense, </em>423 F.Supp. 16, 17 (D.D.C.1976). <em>See Thomas, </em>450 U.S. at 715-16, 101 S.Ct. at 1430-1431; <em>Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese v. Milivojevich, </em>426 U.S. 696, 708-20, 96 S.Ct. 2372, 2380-2385, 49 L.Ed.2d 151 (1976). These principles, however, are not contrary to <em>Sequoyah\u2019s </em>analysis. Far from requiring judicial evaluation of religious doctrine, <em>Sequoyah </em>focuses inquiry solely upon the importance of the geographic site in question to the practice of the plaintiffs\u2019 religion. If the plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that the government land at issue is indispensable to some religious practice, whether or not central to their religion, they have not justified a First Amendment claim. We agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number><em>Sequoyah\u2019s </em>resolution of the conflict between the government\u2019s property rights and duties of public management, and a plaintiff\u2019s constitutional right freely to practice his religion. We thus hold that plaintiffs seeking to restrict government land use in the name of religious freedom must, at a minimum, demonstrate that the government\u2019s proposed land use would impair a religious practice that could not be performed at any other site.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The plaintiffs argue that their proof establishes a denial of First Amendment rights even under the above standard. They rely principally upon the affidavits submitted by Hopi and Navajo religious practitioners, which establish that ceremonies conducted upon the Peaks are indispensable to the plaintiffs\u2019 religions; that ceremonial objects must be collected from the Peaks to be effective; that some ceremonial objects and medicinal herbs are collected from the Snow Bowl, and that expansion of the ski area could make those objects and herbs more difficult to find; that ceremonies and prayers have occasionally been conducted in the Snow Bowl, but that expansion of the ski area will destroy the natural conditions necessary for prayers and ceremonies to be effective; and that the mountain as a whole, and not just parts thereof, is considered sacred.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits, together with other evidence in the record, establish the indispensability of the Peaks to the practice of the plaintiffs\u2019 religions. The Forest Service, however, has not denied the plaintiffs access to the Peaks, but instead permits them free entry onto the Peaks and does not interfere with their ceremonies or the collection of ceremonial objects. At the same time, the evidence does not show the indispensability of that small portion of the Peaks encompassed by the Snow Bowl permit area. The plaintiffs have not proven that expansion of the ski area will prevent them from performing ceremonies or collecting objects that can be performed or collected in the Snow Bowl but nowhere else. The record evidence is, in fact, to the contrary. The Forest Service\u2019s Final Environmental Statement found, on the basis of comments submitted by Hopi and Navajo practitioners, that \u201creligious practices, including collecting plant materials, may occur in many locations on the sacred mountain.\u201d The government submitted affidavits from two experts on Hopi and Navajo religion. One expert stated that expansion of the Snow Bowl should have little \u201cdirect\u201d impact on the plaintiffs\u2019 religious practices; the other stated with respect to Hopi practices that \u201c(guarantee of access to the mountain should permit the continuation of all essential ritual practices,\u201d and with respect to Navajo practices that \u201c(n)o ceremonial items ... are found only in the permit area.\u201d It must be remembered that the Snow Bowl permit area comprises only 777 of the 75,000 acres of the Peaks, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>that prior construction on the Peaks has not prevented the plaintiffs from practicing their religions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Judge Richey found that \u201cthe Snow Bowl operation has been in existence for nearly fifty years and it appears that plaintiffs\u2019 religious practices and beliefs have managed to coexist with the diverse developments that have occurred there.\u201d (footnote omitted). The plaintiffs simply have not demonstrated that development will prevent them from engaging in any religious practices.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">As the plaintiffs have not shown that development will burden them in their religious beliefs or practices, we need not decide whether the ski area expansion is a compelling governmental interest, or whether the Preferred Alternative is the least restrictive means of achieving that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">2. <em>American Indian Religious Freedom Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The American Indian Religious Freedom Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1996 (Supp. IV 1980) (AIRFA), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-10\">On and after August 11,1978 it shall be the policy of the United States to protect and preserve for American Indians their inherent right of freedom to believe, express, and exercise the traditional religions of the American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, and Native Hawaiians, including but not limited to access to sites, use and possession of sacred objects, and the freedom to worship through ceremonials and traditional rites.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">The plaintiffs contend that AIRFA proscribes all federal land uses that conflict or interfere with traditional Indian religious beliefs or practices, unless such uses are justified by compelling governmental interests. They argue that the Snow Bowl ski resort expansion is not a compelling governmental interest, and is accordingly proscribed by AIRFA. Judge Richey refused to give AIRFA the broad reading urged by plaintiffs. He found that AIRFA requires federal agencies to evaluate their policies and procedures with the aim of protecting Indian religious freedom, to refrain from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>prohibiting access, possession and use of religious objects and the performance of religious ceremonies, and to consult with Indian organizations in regard to proposed actions, but that AIRFA does not require \u201cNative traditional religious considerations always [to] prevail to the exclusion of all else.\u201d We agree. Judge Richey\u2019s interpretation of AIRFA<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is fully supported by the legislative history, and the record supports his finding of Forest Service compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">AIRFA affirms the protection and preservation of traditional Indian religions as a policy of the United States, but the statutory language does not indicate the extent to which Congress intended that policy to override other land use considerations. We therefore look for guidance to the legislative history, and, in particular, to the substantially identical committee reports prepared by the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs and the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. These reports reveal that in AIRFA Congress addressed the unwarranted and often unintended intrusions upon Indian religious practices resulting from federal officials\u2019 ignorance and the inflexible enforcement of laws and regulations which, though intended to achieve valid secular goals, had directly affected Indian religious practices. The reports identify three areas of concern: (1) denial of access to religious sites; (2) restrictions on the possession of such substances as peyote; and (3) actual interference with religious events. The federal government, the reports note, had sometimes denied Indians access to religious sites on federal land; had failed to accommodate such federal statutes as the drug and endangered species laws to the Indians' religious needs, and had itself interfered, or permitted others to interfere, with religious observances. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 709, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 2-4; H.R.Rep. No. 1308, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 2-3, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1262, 1263-64. Thus, the House Report stated that the purpose of AIRFA is \u201cto insure that the policies and procedures of various Federal agencies, as they may impact upon the exercise of traditional Indian religious practices, are brought into compliance with the constitutional injunction that Congress shall make no laws abridging the free exercise of religion.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1308, <em>supra, </em>at 1, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">It is clear from the reports, and from the statutory preamble, that AIRFA requires federal agencies to learn about, and to avoid unnecessary interference with, traditional Indian religious practices. Agencies must evaluate their policies and procedures in light of the Act\u2019s purpose, and ordinarily should consult Indian leaders before approving a project likely to affect religious practices. AIRFA does not, however, declare the protection of Indian religions to be an overriding federal policy, or grant Indian religious practitioners a veto on agency action. \u201cThe clear intent of [AIRFA],\u201d the Senate report states, \u201cis to insure for traditional native religions the same rights of free exercise enjoyed by more powerful religions. However, it is in no way intended to provide Indian religions with a more favorable status than other religions, only to insure that the U.S. Government treats them equally.\u201d S.Rep. No. 709, <em>supra, </em>at 6. The comments made during debate by Representative Udall of Arizona, the chairman of the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee and the sponsor of the House bill, similarly indicate that AIRFA does not supersede the many laws under which federal lands are managed for the public good. Representative Udall stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-8\">Mr. Speaker, it is not the intent of my bill to wipe out laws passed for the benefit of the general public or to confer special religious rights on Indians.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-9\">Js :}!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-10\">Mr. Speaker, I have received a letter from Assistant Attorney General Patricia M. Wald which ... states that it is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Department s understanding that this resolution, in and of itself, does not change any existing State or Federal law. That, of course, is the committee\u2019s understanding and intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">124 Cong.Rec. 21,444 (1978).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">All this simple little resolution says to the Forest Service, to the Park Service, to the managers of public lands is that if there is a place where Indians traditionally congregate to hold one of their rites and ceremonies, let them come on unless there is some overriding reason why they should not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-8\">(The resolution) simply says to our managers of public lands that they ought to be encouraged to use these places. It has no teeth in it. It is the sense of the Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 21,445.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Thus AIRFA requires federal agencies to consider, but not necessarily to defer to, Indian religious values. It does not prohibit agencies from adopting all land uses that conflict with traditional Indian religious beliefs or practices. Instead, an agency undertaking a land use project will be in compliance with AIRFA if, in the decision-making process, it obtains and considers the views of Indian leaders, and if, in project implementation, it avoids unnecessary interference with Indian religious practices. This court\u2019s recent decision in <em>New Mexico Navajo Ranchers Assoc, v. ICC, </em>702 F.2d 227 (D.C.Cir.1983) (per curiam), indicates that agencies will not be permitted to ignore their AIRFA duties. There, this court remanded for further consideration the ICC\u2019s approval of a rail line to be built across northwestern New Mexico because the ICC had failed properly to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>evidence that the railroad permit-tee would not fulfill its promise to protect Navajo sacred sites along the right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">Finally, we find that the Forest Service complied with AIRFA in the present case. Before approving the Preferred Alternative the Forest Service held many meetings with Indian religious practitioners and conducted public hearings on the Hopi and Navajo reservations at which practitioners testified. The views there expressed were discussed at length in the Final Environmental Statement and were given due consideration in the evaluation of the alternative development schemes proposed for the Snow Bowl. Development of the Snow Bowl under the Preferred Alternative will not deny the plaintiffs access to the Peaks, nor will it prevent them from collecting religious objects. The Forest Service has not burdened the plaintiffs\u2019 religious practices in any manner prohibited by AIRFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">3. <em>Establishment Clause.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">Judge Richey held that to grant the plaintiffs the relief they request would violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. We think it unnecessary to reach that issue. As neither the Free Exercise Clause nor AIRFA entitles the plaintiffs to relief, we have no reason to consider whether relief is barred by a separate constitutional provision. We note, moreover, that where governmental action violates the Free Exercise Clause, the Establishment Clause ordinarily does not bar judicial relief. <em>See, e.g., Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 220-21 &amp; 234 n. 22, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1535-1536, &amp; 1542 n. 22, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972); <em>Sherbert v. Verner, </em>374 U.S. 398, 409, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1796, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-16\">4. <em>Endangered Species Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">The plaintiffs claim that the Forest Service violated section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536(a)(2) (Supp. IV. 1980), by failing to insure that the Preferred Alternative will not be likely to jeopardize the continued existence on the Peaks of a small yellow-flowered plant called <em>senecio franciscanus, </em>or the \u201cSan Francisco Peaks groundsel.\u201d <em>Senecio fran-ciscanus </em>exists only in an elongated area of approximately 2.6 square kilometers at the top of the Peaks. This elongated area extends into the Snow Bowl permit area. As an alpine plant, <em>senecio franciscanus </em>is particularly susceptible to damage from human activity. The plant\u2019s population, once re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>duced by human activity, would not recover for decades or even centuries. The approved development will extend into a small portion of the plant\u2019s habitat and will destroy a small number of plants. The greatest threat to the plant\u2019s continued existence, however, is posed not by construction, or by skiers, but by summer hikers who walk off-trail and trample the fragile plants. Expansion of the ski lifts will significantly increase the threat to the plant by allowing a greater number of hikers to reach its habitat.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">On June 16, 1976 the Secretary of the Interior proposed <em>senecio franciscanas </em>for formal listing as an endangered species under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533. Section 4 requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register a list of those species determined by him or by the Secretary of Commerce to be endangered or threatened within the meaning of the Act. The Endangered Species Act amendments of 1978 required the withdrawal of all listing proposals over two years old. A one year grace period was extended' to proposals already over two years old. On December 10, 1979 the Secretary withdrew the proposal to list <em>senecio franciscanas </em>because no action had been taken on the proposal since its submission. At the time the plaintiffs commenced this suit <em>senecio franciscanas </em>was neither listed nor proposed for listing.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act requires each federal agency, with the assistance of the Secretary, to insure that its actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species. Section 7(a)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-6\">Each Federal agency shall, in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency ... is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical ... In fulfilling the requirements of this paragraph each agency shall use the best scientific and commercial data available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">Section 7(a)(2) requires an agency, prior to project implementation, formally to consult the Secretary about any agency action that might affect a protected species. Section 7(b), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536(b), requires the Secretary to provide to an agency that consults him under section 7(a)(2) a written opinion indicating how the agency\u2019s proposed action would affect the protected species and identifying means of protecting the species. The Forest Service has not formally consulted the Secretary about <em>senecio franciscanas, </em>and it has not obtained the written opinion required by section 7(b). The plaintiffs\u2019 claim would therefore have merit if section 7(a)(2) in fact protected <em>senecio franciscanas. </em>We, however, agree with Judge Richey, who held that \u00a7 7(a)(2) applies only to species listed pursuant to section 4, and hence had no application to the unlisted <em>senecio franciscanas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">To support their argument that \u00a7 7(a)(2) protects all endangered or threatened species, whether or not listed, the plaintiffs make four principal points. First, they point out that \u00a7 7(a)(2) refers to <em>\u201cany </em>endangered species or threatened species,\u201d (emphasis supplied), and does not, unlike many other sections of Act, <em>see, e.g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7(a)(1), (c)(1), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1536(a)(1), (c)(1), specifically refer to species which are \u201clisted\u201d or \u201cproposed to be listed.\u201d Second, they note that \u00a7 7(a)(2)\u2019s reference to \u201cendangered ... or threatened species\u201d does not incorporate a listing requirement because the statutory definitions of \u201cendangered species\u201d and \u201cthreatened species\u201d do not mention listing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Third, they draw at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>tention to the difference between the 1973 and the 1978 versions of section 7. As enacted in 1973, section 7 in a single clause required federal agencies to carry out \u201cprograms for the conservation of <em>endangered species and threatened species listed pursuant to </em>section <em>1533\u201d </em>and to insure that agency actions did not jeopardize the continued existence \u201cof <em>such </em>endangered species and threatened species.\u201d (emphasis supplied). The 1978 amendments to the Endangered Species Act divided that clause into two sentences. In the first sentence Congress again required agencies to conduct programs for the preservation of \u201clisted\u201d species, and in the second sentence again required agencies to insure the continued existence of endangered and threatened species. However, the amended section 7, in contrast to the original, did not, in restricting agency action, directly or indirectly refer to \u201clisted\u201d species. Instead, the 1978 amendments changed the word \u201csuch\u201d in the original statute to \u201cany\u201d and required agencies to insure the existence of \u201cany endangered species or threatened species.\u201d Finally, the plaintiffs note that in 1979 both houses of Congress considered proposed amendments to the Act which, <em>inter alia, </em>would have added an explicit listing requirement to \u00a7 7(a)(2). <em>See </em>S. 1143, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 6(a) (1979), 125 Cong.Rec. S7557 (daily ed. June 13, 1979); H.R. 2218, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. (amendment of Rep. Breaux) \u00a7 5 (1979), 125 Cong. Rec. H9648 (daily ed. October 24, 1979). Although Congress did amend the Endangered Species Act in 1979, it did not amend \u00a7 7(a)(2) to include a specific listing requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The plaintiffs claim that their points prove that Congress intended the 1978 amendments to extend \u00a7 7 protection to unlisted species.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The legislative history, however, strongly indicates that Congress had no such intent. In its report on the 1978 amendments, the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-11\">The protections provided to animal and plant species threatened with extinction are activated by the listing of a species as \u201cendangered\u201d or \u201cthreatened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">H.R.Rep. No. 1625, 95th Cong., 2nd Sess. 5, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, 9453, 9455. The House report further states: \u201cThe mandate of section 7 applies once a species is listed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 9458. These statements, it is true, are contained in a section of the committee report that summarizes the operation of the 1973 Act, and thus are not direct evidence of Congress\u2019 intent regarding the 1978 amendments. That portion of the committee report which does discuss the effect of the 1978 amendments, <em>see Id. </em>at 19-25, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 9469-75, however, contains no indication that in amending section 7 Congress intended to broaden its coverage to protect species not protected by the 1973 Act. Instead, Congress principally intended in amending section 7 to define procedures that would facilitate agency compliance with the section and to establish a mechanism by which agencies could, in appropriate cases, be exempted from the section. Comments made in connection with the . 1979 amendments are also significant. The Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries states in its report on the 1979 amendments: \u201cThe mandate of section 7 applies once a species is listed or once \u2018critical habitat\u2019 is designated for any listed species.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 167, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 5, <em>reprinted in </em>1979 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>News 2557, 2561 (1979). The House Conference Report on the amendments states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajob\">The conferees note that the purpose of a listing proposal is to determine whether a species is endangered or threatened and should be listed as such. The protections of Section 7 should not apply until a species has been formally listed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdMk\">H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 697, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 13, <em>reprinted in </em>1979 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2572, 2577. We are aware that subsequent legislative history is not controlling evidence of the intent underlying previously enacted legislation. <em>See Consumer Product Safety Comm. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 118 n. 13, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2061 n. 13, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980). Nonetheless, we think that the 1979 committee and conference reports are entitled to significant weight in interpreting the effect of the 1978 amendment of section 7. Those reports were close in time to the 1978 amendments, and their interpretation of amended section 7 is consistent with the view apparent from the 1978 House report.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The structure of the Endangered Species Act confirms that \u00a7 7(a)(2) applies only to listed species. Of particular significance is the central role played by the Secretary of the Interior in the administration of the Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 4 requires the Secretary to determine by regulation which species are endangered or threatened, to publish a list of such species, and periodically to review the list for necessary changes. Section 5,16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1534, authorizes the Secretary to acquire land for the protection of listed species and other plants and wildlife. Section 6,16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1535, authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with the states to achieve the purposes of the Act. Section 7(b), as previously noted, requires the Secretary to advise agencies that consult him under \u00a7 7(a)(2) on means of protecting covered species. These provisions show that under the Act the Secretary has primary responsibility to research the status of different species, to list those species that are in need of protection, and to act for the preservation of listed species. Thus it would be anomalous to construe \u00a7 7(a)(2) as requiring each federal agency, regardless of its inexpertise in matters of environmental protection or wildlife conservation, to decide for itself whether any of the species its proposed action would affect is endangered or threatened. It is more logical to conclude that \u00a7 7(a)(2) requires an agency, in consultation with the Secretary, to assess the impact of proposed agency action upon a listed species and to develop plans for the species\u2019 protection.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">We also note that the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 7(a)(2) would make a nullity of \u00a7 7(a)(3), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536(a)(3), which requires each agency to consult the Secretary \u201con any agency action which is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any species proposed to be listed.\u201d Section 7(d), 16 U.S.C. 1536(d), prohibits an agency, pending the completion of a \u00a7 7(a)(2) consultation about a listed species, from making any \u201cirretrievable commitment of resources\u201d which would foreclose the formulation or implementation of any reasonable alternative for species protection that the Secretary might suggest under \u00a7 7(b). In contrast, \u00a7 7(a)(3), concerning proposed species, explicitly states that the consultation it requires does not include the \u00a7 7(d) limitation on the commitment of resources. The plaintiffs, however, would extend \u00a7 7(a)(2) protection, including the \u00a7 7(d) limitation, to all vulnerable species, whether or not listed or proposed for listing. They would thus extend to species not proposed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>listing greater protection than \u00a7 7(a)(3) grants to proposed species. The plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation would make irrelevant the protection afforded by \u00a7 7(a)(3) and would violate the basic rule of statutory construction that courts should, if possible, give effect to every word used by Congress. <em>See, e.g., Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., </em>442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 2331, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979); <em>Symons v. Chrysler Corp. Loan Guarantee Bd., </em>670 F.2d 238, 242 (D.C.Cir. 1981). For these reasons we conclude that to be protected under \u00a7 7(a)(2) a species must be listed under \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The plaintiffs claim that if listing is required under \u00a7 7(a)(2), we should treat <em>sen-ecio franciscanus </em>as if it were listed. They rely upon the Forest Service\u2019s recognition in the Final Environmental Statement that the Preferred Alternative threatens the plant, and upon the fact that the Fish and Wildlife Service, since at least 1976, has been aware of the plant\u2019s vulnerability. They contend that the Secretary\u2019s failure formally to list the plant since 1976 constitutes unreasonable delay and a violation of the statutory mandate \u201cto halt and reverse the trend towards species extinction, whatever the cost.\u201d <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 184, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2297, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978). We agree with Judge Richey that there is no evidence of such bad faith or unreasonable conduct on the part of the Secretary as would warrant an injunction against the United States ordering the listing of <em>senecio franciscanus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">On November 22, 1982, approximately one month after we heard argument, the Secretary, through the Fish and Wildlife Service, proposed <em>senecio franciscanus </em>for listing as a threatened species. 47 Fed.Reg. 52,483 (1982). Because <em>senecio franciscanus </em>is now proposed for listing, \u00a7 7(a)(3) (discussed above) requires the Forest Service to consult the Secretary about the possible impact of the Preferred Alternative upon the plant. We do not think it necessary to remand this case to the district court to insure Forest Service compliance with \u00a7 7(a)(3). Section 7(a)(3) does not incorporate the \u00a7 7(d) limitation on commitment of resources and thus does not prohibit development until consultation is completed. More important, we have no reason to believe that the Forest Service has not, or will not, comply with \u00a7 7(a)(3). The record indicates that appropriate measures can be taken to minimize the danger to <em>senecio franciscanus. </em>We are confident that the Forest Service will, in good faith, implement such measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">5. <em>Wilderness Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">On May 2, 1979 President Carter, on the advice of the Secretary of Agriculture, recommended to Congress that it designate as wilderness under the National Wilderness Preservation System Act of 1964,16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1131-36 (1976), some 14,-650 acres of the San Francisco Peaks. Congress has not yet acted upon that recommendation. The area recommended for wilderness designation abuts the Snow Bowl permit area on the north, south, and east, but includes no part of the permit area. A substantial part of the permit area is still undeveloped; in particular, a strip of land approximately 500 feet wide along the area\u2019s northern border, adjacent to the recommended wilderness area, remains heavily forested. Under the Preferred Alternative that strip of land will be partially developed for skiing. The plaintiffs contend that the Secretary of Agriculture, in approving development of pristine land adjacent to a recommended wilderness area, infringed Congress\u2019 exclusive authority to determine wilderness area boundaries. The plaintiffs base their claim upon \u00a7 3(b) of the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(b) (1976), and argue that the Secretary may not, by authorizing expansion of the ski area, impair Congress\u2019 discretion to include undeveloped portions of the Snow Bowl in the San Francisco Peaks wilderness area. As Judge Richey found, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Section 1132(b) authorizes the President to recommend for inclusion in designated wilderness areas lands contiguous to areas formerly designated as \u201cprimitive\u201d by the Secretary of Agriculture. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azr-dedup-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>The Secretary of Agriculture shall, within ten years after September 3, 1964, review, as to its suitability or nonsuitability for preservation as wilderness, each area in the national forests classified on September 3, 1964 by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Chief of the Forest Service as \u201cprimitive\u201d and report his findings to the President. The President shall advise the United States Senate and House of Representatives of his recommendations with respect to the designation as \u201cwilderness\u201d or other reclassification of each area on which review has been completed ... Each recommendation of the President for designation as \u201cwilderness\u201d shall become effective only if so provided by an Act of Congress ... Any [primitive] area may be increased in size by the President at the time he submits his recommendations to the Congress by not more than five thousand acres with no more than one thousand two hundred and eighty acres of such increase in any one compact unit; if it is proposed to increase the size of any such area by more than five thousand acres or by more than one thousand two hundred and eighty acres in any one compact unit the increase in size shall not become effective until acted upon by Congress. <em>Nothing herein contained shall limit the President in proposing, as part of his recommendations to Congress, the alteration of existing boundaries of primitive areas or recommending the addition of any contiguous area of national forest lands predominantly of wilderness value.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AozT\">(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">In <em>Parker v. United States, </em>448 F.2d 793, 797 (10th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 989, 92 S.Ct. 1252, 31 L.Ed.2d 455 (1972), the Tenth Circuit held that the italicized language reflects \u201cthe clear intent of Congress . .. that both the President and the Congress shall have a meaningful opportunity to add contiguous areas predominantly of wilderness value to existing primitive areas for final wilderness designation.\u201d A \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d can be preserved only if lands within the ambit of \u00a7 1132(b) remain undeveloped until such time as the President and Congress act. Thus in <em>Parker, </em>the Tenth Circuit affirmed a district court order enjoining the Secretary from authorizing lumbering of certain virgin land contiguous to a primitive area, where the President and Congress had not yet considered whether to designate the land in question as wilderness.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\"><em>Parker </em>indicates that \u00a7 1132(b) can restrict the Secretary\u2019s discretion to approve development of wilderness land contiguous to a designated primitive area. The defendants, however, contend that \u00a7 1132(b) does not apply to national forest land which is neither contained in nor contiguous to a primitive area, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim must therefore fail, as neither the Snow Bowl permit area nor any other part of the San Francisco Peaks has ever been designated primitive. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">The clear focus of the statutory language is upon the Secretary\u2019s duties with respect to primitive areas. A brief review of the statute\u2019s background confirms that the statute has no broader application. In 1929 the Secretary of Agriculture, by regulation, established procedures for the designation of primitive areas in national forests. The 1929 regulation was superseded in 1939 by new regulations which authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to designate wilderness areas in excess of 100,000 acres and the Chief of the Forest Service to designate wild areas of between 5,000 and 100,000 acres. The Secretary of Agriculture then reviewed the 73 primitive areas designated between 1929 and 1939 to determine which should be designated in whole or in part as wilderness or wild areas. By 1964, when Congress considered legislation to create a statutory scheme for the protection of wilderness lands, 18 tracts of national forest land had been designated as wilderness areas, 35 as wild areas, and 34 remained in their original classification as primitive areas. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1538, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. 7-8, <em>reprinted in </em>1964 U.S.Code, &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>AcLNews, 3615, 3616.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Congress concluded that the areas designated as wilderness or wild areas had been \u201cdefined with precision,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3617, and could be given statutory protection immediately. Accordingly, in \u00a7 3(a) of the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a), Congress designated as wilderness all areas within the national forests that the Secretary of Agriculture had classified at least 30 days before September 3, 1964 as wilderness or wild. Congress believed, however, that the primitive areas had not been \u201cdefined with precision,\u201d and that such areas \u201cshould not be considered for inclusion in the wilderness system until completion of a thorough review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, in \u00a7 3(b) of the Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(b), Congress ordered the Secretary of Agriculture to review each designated primitive area as to its suitability for inclusion in the wilderness system. It thus is clear from \u00a7 1132(b)\u2019s limited purpose that the statute applies only to primitive areas and lands contiguous thereto. Since the Snow Bowl permit area is neither contained in nor contiguous to any primitive area, the plaintiffs have no claim under \u00a7 1132(b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">6. <em>National Historic Preservation Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">In his June 15, 1981 opinion, Judge Richey found that the Forest Service had committed three violations of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 470 <em>et seq. </em>(1976), and implementing regulations. First, he found that the Forest Service had not, as required by 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 470f and Executive Order 11593,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> examined the project area to identify properties eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 470a. Second, he found that the Forest Service had not, as required by 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.4(b), consulted the Arizona State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) about the effect of the Preferred Alternative upon two National Register properties near the Snow Bowl \u2014 the Fern Mountain Ranch, owned by plaintiffs Jean and Richard Wilson, and the C. Hart Merriam Base Camp. Finally, he found that the Forest Service had not, as required by 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.-4(a)(1), consulted the SHPO about the eligibility of the San Francisco Peaks themselves for inclusion in the National Register. Judge Richey remanded the case to the Forest Service for compliance with NHPA, and stayed development pending compliance. Upon remand, the Forest Service conducted archaeological surveys of the permit area and consulted the SHPO. On September 22, 1981, the Chief Forester determined that the project area contained no properties either listed or eligible for listing on the National Register; that expansion of the ski area would not affect the historic qualities of the Merriam Base Camp or the Fern Mountain Ranch; and that the San Francisco Peaks themselves were not eligible for listing. The SHPO had concurred in these findings by letter dated September 11, 1981. After the plaintiffs failed to obtain administrative reversal of the Chief Forester\u2019s determination, the defendants returned to court to show compliance to Judge Richey. On May 14, 1982 Judge Ri-chey ruled that the Forest Service had com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>plied with NHPA in all respects. He granted the defendants final judgment on all counts and lifted the stay against development.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The plaintiffs claim that Judge Richey erred in finding compliance with NHPA. They contend that the Forest Service\u2019s efforts to identify eligible properties in the permit area were legally insufficient; that the Preferred Alternative will affect the historic qualities of the Fern Mountain Ranch;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that the San Francisco Peaks are eligible for listing. The plaintiffs\u2019 three contentions will be considered in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">16 U.S.C. \u00a7 470f and implementing regulations, <em>see </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.4(a), together with Executive Order 11593, require federal agencies approving land use projects to identify all properties within and about the project area that are eligible for listing in the National Register and that may be affected by the project. <em>See Romero-Barcelo v. Brown, </em>643 F.2d 835, 859 (1st Cir.1981), <em>reversed on other grounds, </em>456 U.S. 305,102 S.Ct. 1798, 72 L.Ed.2d 91 (1982). The specific area to be examined for eligible properties is the \u201carea of the undertaking\u2019s potential environmental impact,\u201d 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.4(a), which is defined as the \u201cgeographical area within which direct and indirect effects generated by the undertaking could reasonably be expected to occur.\u201d 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.3(o). The agency must consult the SHPO when determining the area of potential environmental impact and the scope of surveys needed to identify eligible properties within that area. 36 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 800.3(o), 800.4(a)(1), (2). The Forest Service and the SHPO agreed that the Preferred Alternative\u2019s area of potential environmental impact included the 777 acre permit area, the Snow Bowl road, and 30-foot strips of land on both sides of the road. Forest Service and Northern Arizona University archaeologists in July, 1981 conducted archaeological surveys in which they intensively examined 272 acres, or 35% of the total .permit area, including all 77 acres proposed for development under the Preferred Alternative. The surveys revealed no evidence of Navajo or Hopi use and in fact discovered only one archaeological site \u2014 the foundation of the old Snow Bowl ski lodge that burned in 1952. The Forest Service found the lodge foundation to be ineligible for listing, and the plaintiffs do not argue to the contrary. The SHPO agreed that the surveys satisfied the Forest Service\u2019s affirmative obligation to locate and identify eligible properties in the impact area. <em>See </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.4(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">The plaintiffs argue that the Forest Service breached its NHPA duty to identify <em>all </em>eligible properties by failing to survey 100% of the impact area. They contend that the Forest Service\u2019s partial surveys may have left some eligible properties undetected. We think that the partial surveys were sufficient. The regulations do not expressly require agencies in all cases completely to survey impact areas, and in fact recognize that the need for surveys will vary from case to case. <em>See </em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 800.4(a)(1), (2). We believe that a complete survey is not required where both the partial survey, and all other evidence, indicate that a complete survey would be fruitless. Here, the defendants\u2019 surveys discovered neither eligible properties nor any evidence to suggest that' such properties might be present in areas not surveyed. The existing literature on the San Francisco Peaks gave the Forest Service no indication of historical or archaeological sites in the impact area. Additionally, the high altitude and steep slopes of the San Francisco Peaks made the impact area an unlikely site for past human habitation and hence an unlikely place in which to find eligible properties. Under these circumstances a complete survey was not required. We find support for our conclusion in the First Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Romero-Barcelo, supra, </em>where the Navy conducted a partial archaeological survey of the island of Vieques off the Puerto Rican coast in connection with training operations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>there to be conducted. The Navy\u2019s survey identified numerous eligible properties and suggested the probable existence of other archaeological sites not specifically located. The First Circuit held that \u00a7 470f and Executive Order 11593 required the Navy to conduct further surveys to locate the sites thought to be present. Significantly, however, the court stated that its decision did not require the Navy \u201cto undertake a 100% survey of Vieques,\u201d or to survey parts of the island where the initial survey established \u201carcheological sterility.\u201d 643 F.2d at 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">As a second ground for reversal, the plaintiffs argue that the Forest Service erred in finding that the Preferred Alternative will have no effect upon the historic qualities of the Fern Mountain Ranch. Section 800.4(b) of 36 C.F.R. requires each agency, in consultation with the SHPO, to determine for each listed or eligible property within the potential environmental impact area, whether the agency project will affect the historical, archaeological, or other characteristic of the property that qualified it for inclusion in the National Register. The agency is to determine whether an effect is present according to the criteria of 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.3. If the agency determines that the project will have no effect, the project may proceed. 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.-4(b)(1). If, however, the agency determines merely that the project will have no <em>adverse </em>effect, the agency\u2019s determination must be submitted to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation for review and comment, 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.4(c), and if the agency determines that there will be an adverse effect, the agency must formally consult the Council. 36 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 800.4(d), 800.6(b). The plaintiffs argue that Judge Richey erred in failing to require formal consultation under \u00a7 800.6(b). We conclude, however, that Judge Richey properly upheld the Forest Service\u2019s finding of \u201cno effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The Fern Mountain Ranch is located on the western slopes of the San Francisco Peaks, approximately one and one-half miles to the north of the Snow Bowl. The Ranch provides an excellent view of the Peaks\u2019 wooded slopes, and of the permit area. Development under the Preferred Alternative will somewhat impair the Ranch\u2019s rustic setting since the new ski lifts and slopes will be readily visible from the Ranch. The plaintiffs argue that alteration of the Ranch\u2019s natural setting would constitute an \u201cadverse effect\u201d under the regulations. They rely upon 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.3(b), which defines \u201cadverse effect\u201d as including, <em>inter alia, </em>an \u201calteration of the property\u2019s surrounding environment,\u201d or the \u201c(introduction of visual ... or atmospheric elements that are out of character with the property.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 argument fails to recognize that the \u00a7 800.3 criteria are to be applied with reference only to those characteristics of the property that qualified it for National Register listing. <em>See </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.4(b). The Ranch\u2019s natural setting is not one of the characteristics that qualified it for listing. Instead, the Nomination Form for the Ranch\u2019s listing indicates that the Ranch is historically significant for three reasons: (1) its original nineteenth-century buildings are still standing and in use; (2) it played an important role, as a rest stop, in the development of the Grand Canyon as a tourist attraction; and (3) it was the first ranch in Arizona to raise Arabian horses. Clearly, the Preferred Alternative will not affect the Ranch\u2019s three relevant characteristics and its effect upon the view from the Ranch is, under the circumstances, immaterial. The plaintiffs also argue that the Preferred Alternative will adversely effect the Ranch because the increased tourist traffic at the Show Bowl will, they say, increase the dangers of trespassing, vandalism, and arson at the Ranch. The Forest Service, however, determined that increased use of the Snow Bowl would not endanger the Ranch. The Forest Service\u2019s determination of this factual issue is adequately supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">The plaintiffs also argue that the Forest Service violated NHPA by finding that the San Francisco Peaks themselves were not eligible for listing. The plaintiffs rely upon the fact that several other mountains and properties which are historically significant principally because of their association with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Indian religion or culture have been listed. Those properties, however, may or may not have possessed the particular attributes of the San Francisco Peaks. The determination in each case of a property\u2019s eligibility is the responsibility of the agency and of the SHPO, <em>see </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 800.4(a)(3), and in the absence of an abuse of discretion, their application of the regulations to the facts must be sustained. We agree with Judge Richey that the plaintiffs have not shown an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Lastly, the plaintiffs argue that the Forest Service should have requested a final determination of the Peaks\u2019 eligibility from the Secretary of the Interior. Section 800.-4(a)(3) of 36 C.F.R. states that when a \u201cquestion\u201d exists as to a property\u2019s eligibility, the Secretary shall be requested to make a final determination. Section 63.2(c) of 36 C.F.R. states that a \u201cquestion\u201d exists \u201cwhen the agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer disagree or when the agency determines that a question exists.\u201d Here, the Forest Service and the SHPO agreed that the Peaks were not eligible, and the Forest Service did not otherwise determine that a question existed. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that a question existed because the Forest Service and the SHPO relied upon different reasoning in reaching their identical conclusions has no merit. Section 800.-4(a)(3), as clarified by \u00a7 63.2(c), is obviously intended not to require the agency and the SHPO to reason alike, but only to resolve disputes between the two, and to provide a means by which the Secretary can have the final say on properties of uncertain status.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">7. <em>Land Use Permits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">In 1977 the Forest Service issued two permits to Northland for use of the Snow Bowl permit area, which on May 18, 1982 were amended to reflect the development approved under the Preferred Alternative. One of the amended permits, covering 24 acres, is a term permit valid until May 1, 1997. The Forest Service granted this permit under the Act of March 4, 1915, as amended, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 497 (1976), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-7\">The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized, under such regulations as he may make and upon such terms and conditions as he may deem proper, (a) to permit the use and occupancy of suitable areas of land within the national forests, not exceeding eighty acres and for periods not exceeding thirty years, for the purpose of constructing or maintaining hotels, resorts, and any other structures or facilities necessary or desirable for recreation, public convenience, or safety; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ae9-dedup-0\">Northland will build the ski lodge and all other permanent facilities upon the land covered by the term permit. The other permit, an annual or revocable permit covering the remaining 753 acres of the permit area, was issued by the Forest Service under the authority of the Act of June 4,1897, as amended, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 551 (1976), which authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to \u201cmake such rules and regulations ... as will insure the objects of such reservations, namely, to regulate their occupancy and use and to preserve the forests thereon from destruction.\u201d The land covered by the revocable permit will be used only for ski slopes.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">The plaintiffs challenge the validity of the \u201cdual permit\u201d system employed by the Forest Service. They contend that 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 497, which authorizes permit areas no larger than 80 acres, constitutes the sole authority under which the Secretary may grant permits for the private recreational development of national forest lands. They accordingly claim that the Forest Service exceeded its authority in issuing a revocable permit under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 551 and in granting permits covering 777 acres to a single developer. We agree with Judge Richey that \u00a7 497 does not limit the Secretary\u2019s authority under \u00a7 551 and that Congress has sanctioned the use of dual permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">In 1905 Congress transferred the management of the national forests from the Secretary of the Interior to the Secretary of Agriculture. Act Feb. 1, 1905, c. 288, \u00a7 1, 33 Stat. 628. As early as May 31, 1905 the Attorney General informed the Secretary of Agriculture that the Act of 1897, as amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>ed, authorized him to grant revocable permits for the private, commercial use of national forest land. 25 Op.Atty.Gen. 470 (1905). The Secretary of Agriculture thereafter routinely granted revocable permits for many purposes, including summer houses and camping grounds, under the 1897 Act. In 1911 the Supreme Court upheld the authority of the Secretary to grant revocable grazing permits under the Act. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grimaud, </em>220 U.S. 506, 31 S.Ct. 480, 55 L.Ed. 563 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">In 1915 Congress enacted legislation, now \u00a7 497, which, in contrast to the Act of 1897, expressly authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to grant private permits to national forest land. The 1915 Act authorized the Secretary to grant term permits to areas not larger than five acres for periods not exceeding 30 years. The plaintiffs claim that the 1915 Congress intended to repeal whatever permit authority the Secretary possessed under the 1897 Act. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument has no support in the legislative history, which instead suggests that Congress acted not to repeal the Secretary\u2019s existing powers, but to enable him, for the first time, to grant long-term permits. The Congress recognized that the permanent structures necessary for recreational use of the national forests would not be built unless private parties could obtain secure tenure. Congressman Hawley, the sponsor of the House bill, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-6\">At present the people have an unlimited right to go upon the public land in the national forests. They can go there and build a temporary camp, put up a tent or a little camp of some kind. They are given now by the Secretary of Agriculture permission to construct temporary structures. But it does not enable them to put up any important building, or to justify any considerable expenditure. But if they could get permission for a period of years they can afford to put up a better building(.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOAk\">52 Cong.Rec. 1787 (1915). Significantly, the Congress had before it a letter from the Secretary of Agriculture which discussed the Secretary\u2019s practice of granting revocable permits under the 1897 Act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-9\">There is at the present time some hesitancy on the part of persons who want to use national-forest land upon which to construct summer residences, hotels, stores, and other structures involving a large expenditure, because of <em>the indefinite tenure of the permits to them which the present law provides for. </em>At the present time, however, <em>there are several thousand such permits in use, </em>upon which structures have been erected. In justice to those who desire to construct more substantial improvements, it is believed that the present law should be amended to give persons a better right than the <em>revocable permit now authorized.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_2\">(emphasis supplied). We must therefore presume that when Congress acted in 1915 it had knowledge of the Secretary\u2019s practice under the 1897 Act. Accordingly, the absence in the Act and in the legislative history of any language expressly repudiating the Secretary\u2019s practice is strong evidence that Congress did not intend the 1915 Act to affect the Secretary\u2019s power to issue revocable permits. Certainly the plaintiffs have shown no reason to depart from the settled rule disfavoring repeal by implication. <em>See Watt v. Alaska, </em>451 U.S. 259, 267, 101 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 68 L.Ed.2d 80 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">We conclude, therefore, that the 1915 Act neither limited the Secretary\u2019s power to issue revocable permits to areas larger than five acres nor prohibited him from issuing revocable and term permits simultaneously. Our conclusion is reinforced by Congress\u2019 awareness of, but failure to repudiate, the continuing practice of the Forest Service after 1915 to issue revocable permits under the 1897 Act. The Forest Service, following the 1915 Act, believed that the purposes of the Act could not be achieved unless it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>had authority to issue term permits to areas larger than five acres. Congress in the 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s considered several bills that would have expanded the Forest Service\u2019s authority to grant term permits, but enacted none of them. These bills are nonetheless significant because the reports they generated gave Congress clear notice that the Forest Service was continuing to issue revocable permits for recreational uses, and further, was issuing dual permits. For example, the Senate report on S. 773 (72nd Cong., 1st Sess. (1932)), contains a letter from the Secretary of Agriculture to the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-4\">The general laws relating to the national forests do not authorize the issuance of permits <em>other than terminable at the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture. </em>One act, that of March 4,1915 .. . authorizes the issuance of permits for not to exceed 30 years and for areas of not to exceed 5 acres ... Experience has proved that 5 acres is insufficient to permit of the proper development of the most modern types of outdoor camps, hotels, resorts, sanitoria, etc., which, in addition to the principal structures, usually require the related use of lands for the various necessary utilities, recreational services, etc., now regarded as essential to such services. <em>At present these are provided by the issuance of supplemental terminable permits, </em>which inject an undesirable element of uncertainty of tenure and add to routine requirements of administration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">S.Rep. No. 754, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1932) (emphasis supplied). Similarly, in connection with H.R. 1809 (80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1948)), the Acting Secretary of Agriculture sent the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture a letter, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-8\">Of course, the large majority of ... permitted uses [in the national forests] are of relatively short duration or entail only small capital investments. In such circumstances <em>the type of terminable permit, renewable from year to year, which this Department is authorized to issue without limitation as to character of use or area, </em>is adequate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">H.R.Rep. No. 805, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1948) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 1337, 1338 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">In 1956 Congress finally amended the 1915 Act to grant the Secretary broader power to issue term permits. The amendment increased the acreage limitation in \u00a7 497 from five acres to 80 because effective recreational development of the national forests had been stymied by the five-acre limitation on term permits. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 2792, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1956 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3634. The committee reports, far from repudiating the Secretary\u2019s practice <em>of </em>issuing revocable permits, expressly approved the practice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajov\">The Department of Agriculture now has adequate authority to issue revocable permits for <em>all </em>purposes under the act of June 4, 1897 (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 551).

No. 2792, <em>supra, </em>at 2, 1956 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 3635.

Under these circumstances the Secretary\u2019s authority to issue revocable permits under \u00a7 551, whether or not exercised in connection with dual permits, cannot be doubted.

FCC, </em>443 F.2d 638, 646-47 (1970), \u201ca consistent administrative interpretation of a statute, shown clearly to have been brought to the attention of Congress and not changed by it, is almost conclusive evidence that the interpretation has congressional approval.\u201d (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">In <em>Sierra Club v.

Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972), the Ninth Circuit approved the practice of issuing dual permits to ski resort operators<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and, in language highly instructive here, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alm-dedup-0\">The fact that the record discloses that there are now a total of at least eighty-four recreational developments on national forest lands in which there is such a combination of the term permit and the revocable permit is convincing proof of their legality. Many of these developments are ski developments making use of the maximum acres of the term permit plus revocable permits for additional acreage in amounts in some cases in excess of 6,000 acres ... It seems apparent, as was obvious to both [the 1956] Senate and House Committees, that the eighty-acre long-term permit was a necessity to obtain proper financing for substantial permanent improvements, while developments of less magnitude and permanency, such as trails, slopes, corrals, could be placed upon lands held under revocable permits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">(footnote omitted). The Forest Service has continued, following the decision in <em>Sierra Club, </em>to grant dual permits to ski resort operators. There are presently about 200 ski developments in the national forests and most of them employ dual permits.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">The case of <em>Wilderness Society </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>479 F.2d 842 (D.C.Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 917, 93 S.Ct. 1550, 36 L.Ed.2d 309 (1973), cited by the plaintiffs, does not support their argument. In <em>Wilderness Society, </em>the plaintiffs challenged the issuance of rights-of-way and special land use permits by the Secretary of the Interior to a consortium of oil companies for the construction of the Alaska pipeline. The permits covered land greater in width than the express limitation contained in \u00a7 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 185. This court found that \u00a7 28 constituted the Secretary\u2019s sole authority to issue permits for the use of federal land for oil pipelines, and held that the Secretary had exceeded his authority in failing to adhere to the width limitations. The plaintiffs also contended that the permits issued by the Secretary violated \u00a7 497. The court found it unnecessary to decide that claim, and declined to comment on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Sierra Club. </em>The court did, however, note that \u00a7 497 had \u201cno provision comparable to that in Section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act expressly stating that no rights-of-way for the uses in question shall be granted except under the provisions, conditions and limitations of the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>ute.\u201d 479 F.2d at 870. That distinction between the language of \u00a7 497 and of \u00a7 28, together with the legislative history recounted above, indicate clearly enough that \u00a7 497, unlike \u00a7 28, cannot be read as an exclusive grant of authority as to the uses in question.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Finally, the plaintiffs claim that even if the Secretary had authority under \u00a7\u00a7 497 and 551 to issue dual permits to Northland, the 753-acre permit issued under \u00a7 551 is invalid because not actually revocable. We see no merit in this claim. The Forest Service\u2019s continuing power to revoke the \u00a7 551 permit is apparent from the permit\u2019s terms, which state that the permit will terminate on May 1, 1997 unless previously terminated \u201cupon breach of any of the conditions herein or at <em>the discretion of the regional forester or the Chief, Forest Service.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The plaintiffs argue that the permit is not truly revocable because the Forest Service\u2019s own regulations require a rational basis for the revocation of such permits, <em>see </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 251.-60(b) (1982), and subject revocations to administrative review. 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 211.19 (1982). The plaintiffs have not, however, cited any authority holding that a permit, to be \u201crevocable,\u201d must be revocable at the mere arbitrary will of the issuing authority, and we decline to read such a requirement into the authorizing statute. <em>Cf. Sierra Club, supra, </em>433 F.2d at 35. The plaintiffs also argue that the permit is not revocable because the Forest Service is unlikely to revoke it before the term permit expires. The short answer is that the Forest Service has power to revoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">We also agree with Judge Richey\u2019s disposition of the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-5\">. Judge Richey properly ruled that Jean and Richard Wilson, who are not Indians, did not have standing to assert the Navajo and Hopi religious claims. See, <em>e.g., Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 114, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2874, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976). We have, however, considered the Wilsons\u2019 briefs on the religious claims as briefs of <em>amicus curiae.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b810-6\">. The plaintiffs claim that further development of the Snow Bowl could have a serious and adverse impact upon their tribes\u2019 cultures and social organization. Abbott Sekaquaptewa, then-chairman of the Hopi tribe, stated in \u201cNarrative Direct Testimony\u201d submitted to the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-10\">It is my opinion that in the long run if the expansion is permitted, we will not be able successfully to teach our people that this is a sacred place. If the ski resort remains or is expanded, our people will not accept the view that this is the sacred Home of the Kachinas. The basis of our existence as a society will become a mere fairy tale to our people. If our people no longer possess this long-held belief and way of life, which will inevitably occur with the continued presence of the ski resort ... a direct and negative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>impact upon our religious practices [will result]. The destruction of these practices will also destroy our present way of life and culture.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b812-5\">. <em>Pillar of Fire v. Denver Urban Renewal Authority, </em>181 Colo. 411, 509 P.2d 1250 (1973), is not to the contrary. In <em>Pillar of Fire, </em>the plaintiff church sought to enjoin the condemnation by an urban renewal project of its first permanent church building. The plaintiff alleged that its members revered the building for its historical and symbolic meaning in the birth of their sect. The Colorado Supreme Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to a court hearing at which its interests could be weighed against those of the renewal authority. \u201c(R)eligious faith and tradition,\u201d said the court, \u201ccan invest certain structures and land sites with significance which deserves First Amendment protection.\u201d 181 Colo, at 419, 509 P.2d at 1254. A governmental taking of privately-owned religious property, however, involves different considerations than does' a claimed First Amendment right to restrict the government\u2019s use of its own land.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b812-6\">. Four cases in addition to <em>Sequoyah </em>have considered free exercise claims seeking to restrict development of government land. In <em>Badoni v. Higginson, </em>638 F.2d 172 (10th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 954, 101 S.Ct. 3099, 69 L.Ed.2d 695 (1981), Navajo religious practitioners believed that the Rainbow natural bridge, a great arch of sandstone located in the Rainbow Bridge National Monument in Utah, was sacred. They complained that a government reservoir which had partially inundated the bridge had covered some of their gods and prayer sites, and that the noisy tourists who visited the bridge desecrated the site and made ceremonies impractical. As relief, the plaintiffs requested the court to order the government to lower the reservoir, to issue regulations controlling tourist behavior, and on appropriate notice, to close the monument to tourists so that ceremonies could be conducted. The Tenth Circuit affirmed a district court decision denying relief. The Tenth Circuit held that the government had a compelling interest in filling the reservoir that outweighed any First Amendment right the plaintiffs might assert, and that closing the Monument, or restricting tourist behavior, to accommodate the plaintiffs\u2019 beliefs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>would violate the Establishment Clause. Ruling as it did, the Tenth Circuit never considered in detail whether the Free Exercise Clause can create a right to restrict government land use. The decision in <em>Badoni </em>therefore offers little guidance here. In <em>Crow </em>v. <em>Gullet, </em>541 F.Supp. 785 (D.S.D.1982), a class action on behalf of the Lakota and Tsistsistas nations, and Lakota and Tsistsistas religious practitioners, the plaintiffs objected to certain construction projects and park regulations at the Bear Butte State Park in South Dakota. The plaintiffs alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Bear Butte was a significant site in their religions that would be desecrated by the access roads, parking lot, and viewing platforms that the state had built or was planning to build. The district court denied relief, holding that \u201cthe free exercise clause places a duty upon a state to keep from prohibiting religious acts, not to provide the means or the environment for carrying them out.\u201d 541 F.Supp. at 791. It is uncertain, however, whether the court believed that the Free Exercise Clause can <em>never </em>restrict government land use, since the court specifically noted that the plaintiffs had \u201cfailed to establish that particular religious practices were damaged by the construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Inupiat Community of Arctic Slope v. United States, </em>548 F.Supp. 182, 188-89 (D.Alaska 1982), the Inupiat people of Alaska brought suit to quiet title to portions of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in which the United States had issued oil leases. The plaintiffs claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that development would burden their right freely to practice their religion. The court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, finding that the plaintiffs had failed to show impairment of their religious practices, that the government had a compelling interest in developing energy resources, and that the Establishment Clause in any event barred relief. Finally, in <em>Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assoc, v. Peterson, </em>552 F.Supp. 951 (N.D.Cal. 1982), the plaintiffs, claiming that their religious activities would be disrupted, sought to enjoin the Forest Service from approving construction of a road upon land sacred to several Northwest Indian tribes. The court held for the defendants, and stated that the First Amendment does not obligate the government \u201cto control or limit public access to public lands in order to facilitate\u201d religious practices. 552 F.Supp. at 954.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b814-6\">. We do not hold that such proof necessarily would establish a burden on free exercise. Instead, we hold only that the First Amendment requires, at a minimum, proof that the religious practice could not be performed at any site other than that to be developed. Because we agree with Judge Richey that the plaintiffs have not satisfied this minimum burden of proof, we need not consider what, if any, additional factors are necessary to establish a free exercise burden. At the same time, we decline to follow those cases which have placed primary reliance upon the government\u2019s property interest and which have held, apparently, that the Free Exercise Clause can never supersede the government\u2019s ownership rights and duties of public management. See <em>Crow v. Gullet, </em>541 F.Supp. 785, 791 (D.S.D.1982); <em>Northwest Indian Protective Cemetery Assoc. v. Peterson, </em>552 F.Supp. 951, 954 (N.D.Cal.1982). The government must manage its land in accord-anee with the constitution, <em>Badoni v. Higginson, </em>638 F.2d 172, 176 (10th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 954, 101 S.Ct. 3099, 69 L.Ed.2d 695 (1981); <em>Sequoyah v. TVA, </em>620 F.2d 1159, 1164 (6th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 953, 101 S.Ct. 357, 66 L.Ed.2d 216 (1980), which nowhere suggests that the Free Exercise Clause is inapplicable to government land. This is not to say that the government\u2019s property rights, and its duty to manage its land for the public benefit, have no bearing upon the free exercise analysis. In holding that government land uses can never burden the right to freedom of belief, and can burden the right to freedom of practice only if site-specific religious practices are significantly impaired, we pay due regard to the government\u2019s rights and duties in its land. However, we see no basis for completely exempting government land use from the Free Exercise Clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b815-8\">. Among the structures currently on the Peaks are natural gas, telephone, and electric transmission lines, water tanks for stock, unpaved roads, and the present Snow Bowl ski resort. Cinder extraction and mining have been conducted on the Peaks for at least the past 30 years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b815-9\">. The plaintiffs urge that Judge Richey erred in granting the defendants summary judgment because material issues of fact were in dispute. They argue that when Judge Richey granted summary judgment the parties still disputed the effect development would have upon the plaintiffs\u2019 religions. We conclude, however, that in light of the case\u2019s procedural posture judgment was properly granted. On May 20, 1981, the parties filed with the district court a Joint Stipulation of Material Acts (supplemented on June 1, 1981). Although the stipulated facts did not dispose of one crucial factual issue \u2014 the indispensability of the permit area to the practice of the plaintiffs\u2019 religions \u2014 they did establish many of the principal facts underlying the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The parties supplemented the stipulated facts with numerous affidavits concerning the religious significance of the Snow Bowl. The parties filed with their affidavits cross-motions for summary judgment which were argued before Judge Richey. When Judge Richey asked counsel for the Hopis whether the plaintiffs had \u201cany reservations about the Court deciding this on the merits by virtue of stipulation and the affidavits,\u201d he replied, \u201cNot at all, Your Honor.\u201d We thus find that the plaintiffs agreed to the disposition of this claim on the written record. As the Ninth Circuit stated in <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>231 F.2d 881, 883-84 (9th Cir.1956):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-13\">Now, while summary judgment cannot be granted where there are questions of fact to be disposed of, even by consent of all concerned, there is no reason why parties cannot agree to try a case upon affidavits, admissions and agreed documents. In effect, that is what was done here. No objection whatever was made at the time of submission that there were questions of fact which could not be decided upon the evidence before the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-14\"><em>Accord, Starsky v. Williams, </em>512 F.2d 109, 111\u201413 (9th Cir.1975). Upon his review of the written record, Judge Richey found that the plaintiffs had not \u201cshown that the permit area of the San Francisco Peaks is central or indispensable to their religion.\u201d This finding is not clearly erroneous and, indeed, is not significantly refuted by any evidence in the record. We must emphasize that evidence that all of San Francisco Peaks, including the Snow Bowl, is sacred, does not establish the indispensability of the permit area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b816-5\">. Judge Richey\u2019s decision marked the first judicial interpretation of AIRFA. Courts in only two other circuits have since construed AIRFA, and both followed Judge Richey\u2019s interpretation. <em>Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assoc. v. Peterson, </em>552 F.Supp. 951, 954 (N.D.Cal.1982); <em>Crow v.

The plaintiffs\u2019 final point \u2014 Congress\u2019 failure in 1979 to amend \u00a7 7(a)(2) to refer specifically to listed or proposed species \u2014 adds little to their argument. Congress in 1979 clearly believed that \u00a7 7(a)(2) applied only to listed species. <em>See </em>the discussion <em>infra. </em>Thus the proposed amendments to \u00a7 7(a)(2) were intended not to <em>add </em>a listing requirement, but to extend \u00a7 7 protection, for the first time, to species only <em>proposed </em>for listing. Although Congress did not amend \u00a7 7(a)(2) in this respect, it did protect proposed species by adding \u00a7 7(a)(3) to the Act. <em>See </em>H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 697, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 13, <em>reprinted in </em>1979 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2557, 2572, 2576.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b820-5\">.

The plaintiffs claim that individual federal agencies are qualified to decide whether the species their actions will affect are endangered or threatened. They rely upon that provision of \u00a7 7(a)(2) which states: \u201cIn fulfilling the requirements of this paragraph each agency shall use the best scientific and commercial data available.\u201d That language, the plaintiffs argue, requires agencies to use the best available data to determine species status. We think it clear, however, that the quoted language serves only partially to define the nature of an agency\u2019s duties once a listed species has brought \u00a7 7(a)(2) into play.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\">.

As Judge Richey noted, the permit area contains a ski lodge and ski runs and has been partially cleared of trees. The fact that portions of the permit area remain undeveloped cannot change the fact that the area is not <em>\u201cpredominantly </em>of wildemess value.\u201d We therefore would reject the plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1132(b) claim even were the statute otherwise applicable.

H.R. 1809, as originally proposed, would have authorized the Secretary to grant term permits to areas not larger than 80 acres for periods not exceeding 30 years in all of the national forests. The House Committee on Agriculture amended the bill to apply only to Alaskan national forests, because it believed that broadening the Secretary\u2019s powers as to other national forests might have undesirable results. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 805, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1948). The bill passed as amended. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 497a (1976). The plaintiffs argue that the amendment to H.R. 1809 reflects Congress\u2019 intent not to allow the Secretary to issue permits to large areas in the lower 48 states. The better interpretation, however, is that Congress was not yet ready to authorize the Secretary to grant <em>term </em>permits to areas larger than 5 acres. The legislative history of H.R. 1809 nowhere disapproves of the Secretary\u2019s practice of issuing dual permits and revocable permits to areas larger than 5 acres.

Although the Ninth Circuit found that the plaintiffs had shown little or no likelihood of success, it did not make a final determination of the validity of dual permits. That issue therefore technically remains open in the Ninth Circuit. <em>See Sierra Club v.
