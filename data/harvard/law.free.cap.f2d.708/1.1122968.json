The Local and the individual defendants appeal, raising several jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>tional questions and also attacking the award on the merits. We agree with the jurisdictional argument of the <em>individual </em>defendants and vacate the judgment against them. As to all other matters, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">This case began in 1975 in the midst of a labor dispute between Bonanno, several other linen companies and the defendants. The companies brought suit in state court, alleging that the Local and some of its members had engaged in \u201cnumerous illegal acts of violence\u201d and \u201cthreats of violence toward both Plaintiffs\u2019 property and employees, and toward third parties trying to do business with Plaintiffs.\u201d They sought an injunction and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">A few days after the suit was filed, all of the defendants petitioned for its removal to the Massachusetts federal district court. In their petition, the defendants stated that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in part alleged a violation of a federal law, the Labor-Management Relations Act (LMRA, or Taft-Hartley Act) \u00a7 303, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 187, which grants relief to those harmed by an illegal secondary boycott. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The companies did not oppose the removal. Rather, they asked for a federal injunction. They obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting further violence. <em>See Charles D. Bonanno Linen Serv., Inc. v. McCarthy, </em>532 F.2d 189 (1st Cir.1976). In April 1976, all of the companies but Bonan-no voluntarily dismissed their claims. The case then lay dormant until 1979, when Bonanno announced its intention to proceed with its damage claim, once the National Labor Relations Board resolved a related unfair labor practice charge. <em>See NLRB v. Charles D. Bonanno Linen Serv., Inc., </em>630 F.2d 25 (1st Cir.1980), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>454 U.S. 404, 102 S.Ct. 720, 70 L.Ed.2d 656 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">In April 1980, the Local moved to remand the case to the state court, claiming lack of federal jurisdiction. The district court denied the motion in September. One year later, the individual defendants made a similar motion, which was quickly denied. Trial began on September 24,1981. It focused almost exclusively on the state claims. In fact, the district court found for defendants on the federal secondary boycott claim, but it found for the plaintiffs on the state tort claims against both the Local and three individual members. The court ordered the defendants, who were held jointly and severally liable, to reimburse Bonanno for its expenses in protecting its employees, to pay the medical expenses of an injured employee, and to pay the cost of certain other repairs. The court also awarded prejudgment interest from the date the original action was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">a. We turn first to a jurisdictional problem which this court itself raised at oral argument. We noted that this case was removed on the ground that Bonanno asserted a claim arising under federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441. We also pointed to the case law requiring that the elements of the federal claim appear on the face of the state court complaint, without reference to other documents, such as the removal petition or the answer. <em>E.g., Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Texaco, Inc., </em>415 U.S. 125, 127-28, 94 S.Ct. 1002, 1003-1004, 39 L.Ed.2d 209 (1974); <em>Gully v. First National Bank, </em>299 U.S. 109, 113, 57 S.Ct. 96, 98, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936); <em>Brough v. United Steelworkers of America, </em>437 F.2d 748, 749 (1st Cir.1971). And we asked where, on the face of the state complaint, we could find the necessary \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d allegations, namely that both the secondary boycott\u2019s ultimate target (Bonanno) and its innocent targets were in an \u201cindustry affecting [interstate] commerce.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(b)(4), 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">Given the factual likelihood that in most cases what affects the innocent target will affect the ultimate target, and given Congress\u2019 intent in the Taft-Hartley Act to exercise its constitutionally-granted commerce power broadly, <em>Groneman v. International Bhd. of Elec. Workers, </em>177 F.2d 995, 997 (10th Cir.1949); <em>cf. NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughiin Steel Corp., </em>301 U.S. 1, 57 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>615, 81 L.Ed. 893 (1937), an allegation that <em>Bonanno </em>is \u201cin an industry affecting [interstate] commerce\u201d is sufficient. We are willing, for removal purposes, to presume this to be an adequate allegation of the rest. <em>See Herbert Burman, Inc. v. Local 3, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, </em>214 F.Supp. 353 (S.D.N.Y.1963). <em>Cf. Tucci v. International Union of Operating Engineers, </em>316 F.Supp. 1127 (W.D.Pa.1970). <em>See also Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, </em>379 U.S. 241 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">We reach this result without holding, as some courts have done, that one may look outside the state complaint to the removal petition for matters related to parties\u2019 \u201cstatus\u201d (such as this type of jurisdictional \u201ccommerce\u201d nexus). <em>E.g., Hayes v. National Con-Serv, Inc., </em>523 F.Supp. 1034, 1037 (D.Md.1981); <em>Ulichny v. General Electric Co., </em>309 F.Supp. 437, 440 (N.D.N.Y.1970); <em>Geo. D. Roper Corp. v. Local Union No. 16, </em>279 F.Supp. 717 (S.D.Ohio 1968); <em>Fay v. American Cystoscope Makers, Inc., </em>98 F.Supp. 278, 280 (S.D.N.Y.1951); see Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 3722 at 561-64, \u00a7 3734 at 736 (1976). <em>But see La Chemise LaCoste v. Alligator Co., </em>506 F.2d 339, 344-45 (3d Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 937, 95 S.Ct. 1666, 44 L.Ed.2d 94 (1975). Nor need we take \u201cjudicial notice\u201d of the uncontested fact (as mentioned in the removal petition) that interstate commerce is here involved. <em>Cf. Lang v. American Motors Corp., </em>254 F.Supp. 892 (E.D.Wis.1966) (\u201cjudicial notice\u201d that American Motors is in an industry affecting commerce). We need only engage in a little statutory logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The state complaint alleges that the parties held \u201cfour meetings with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.\u201d This federal service is available by statute only \u201cin any industry affecting [interstate] commerce\u201d where the dispute \u201cthreatens to cause a substantial interruption of commerce.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 173(b). Thus, the necessary jurisdictional impact is ascertainable from the face of the complaint (without looking to the removal petition), even though the words \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d do not themselves appear in the complaint. <em>See Hospital Building Co. </em>v. <em>Trustees of Rex Hospital, </em>425 U.S. 738, 96 S.Ct. 1848, 48 L.Ed.2d 338 (1976) (complaint alleging impact on out-of-state purchases, revenues, and payments sufficient to establish jurisdiction). We see no reason to require more than this technical response to this technical jurisdictional matter. <em>Cf. Sheeran v. General Electric Co., </em>593 F.2d 93, 96 (9th Cir.) (employee\u2019s complaint did not refer to the collective bargaining agreement, but did refer to a pension contract which was an integral part of that agreement), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 868, 100 S.Ct. 143, 62 L.Ed.2d 93 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">b. The Local argues that the plaintiff\u2019s assertion of a federal claim was inadequate for another reason, namely that the state complaint failed to set out the substantive elements of a Taft-Hartley \u00a7 303 violation. The district court disagreed with the Local, and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">The issue is whether the state complaint set out a \u201csubstantial\u201d Taft-Hartley claim. If so, the federal court had discretionary power to hear a pendent state claim linked to the federal claim by a \u201ccommon nucleus of operative fact,\u201d <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1138, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). The Supreme Court has made clear that \u201csubstantial\u201d in this context means no more than not \u201cso insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions ... or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy .... \u201d <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 543, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 1382, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974); <em>Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, </em>414 U.S. 661, 666, 94 S.Ct. 772, 776, 39 L.Ed.2d 73 (1974); <em>accord, Levering &amp; Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, </em>289 U.S. 103, 105-06, 53 S.Ct. 549, 550, 77 L.Ed. 1062 (1933). The language of the state complaint \u2014 to which we look to determine the court\u2019s power, <em>Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. at 727, 86 S.Ct. at 1139 \u2014 meets this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">The Taft-Hartley Act provides for a federal cause of action against labor organizations which engage in activity prohibited by \u00a7 8(b)(4), which makes it illegal</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>to threaten, coerce, or restrain any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce, where ... an object thereof is ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">(B) forcing or requiring any person to cease .. . doing business with any other person ... <em>Provided, </em>that nothing contained in this clause (B) shall be construed to make unlawful, where not otherwise unlawful, any primary strike or primary picketing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\"><em>Provided, </em>that nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to make unlawful a refusal by any person to enter upon the premises of any employer ... if the employees of such employer are engaged in a strike ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4)(ii). In enacting this language, Congress sought to prevent all \u201clabor efforts to draw in neutral employers through pressure calculated to induce them to cease doing business with the primary employer.\u201d <em>National Woodwork Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. NLRB, </em>386 U.S. 612, 624, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 1258, 18 L.Ed.2d 357 (1967); <em>see Local 761, Int\u2019l Union of Elec. Workers v. NLRB, </em>366 U.S. 667, 673-74, 81 S.Ct. 1285, 1289-90, 6 L.Ed.2d 592 (1961). And, in interpreting the Act, the Supreme Court has written that a union may not, for example,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfZ\">exercise coercive pressure upon [complainant\u2019s] customers, ... in order to cause them to withhold or withdraw patronage from complainant through fear of loss or damage to themselves should they deal with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-8\"><em>National Woodwork Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. NLRB, </em>386 U.S. at 621-22, 87 S.Ct. at 1256 (quoting <em>Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, </em>254 U.S. 443, 466, 41 S.Ct. 172, 176, 65 L.Ed. 349 (1921)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s state complaint, in relevant part, fits within the Act\u2019s prohibitions. It alleges that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">(f) The valve of an oil truck was cracked open while parked at the Roxbury place of business of the Plaintiff, Standard, thereby causing approximately eight hundred gallons of heavy fuel oil to spill onto said Plaintiff\u2019s premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">(h) Various third parties doing business with Plaintiffs have been threatened with physical violence by pickets identified as ... members of Local 25.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">And the complaint concludes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1B\">By reason of .. . the acts of violence and threats of violence directed toward Plaintiffs\u2019 property and employees and against third parties doing business with Plaintiffs, Defendants have wilfully and intentionally attempted ... (b) to interfere with the shipment and/or receipt of goods by Plaintiffs. As a result of the foregoing . .. certain suppliers of the Plaintiffs have refused to deliver supplies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">These allegations amount to a claim that the defendants tried to \u201cthreaten, coerce or restrain\u201d third parties, to induce them \u201cto cease doing business with\u201d the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">The Union points to the provisos in \u00a7 8(b)(4). The first states that \u00a7 8(b)(4) does not \u201cmake unlawful, where not otherwise unlawful, any primary strike or primary picketing.\u201d The second specifies that lawful picketing is not made unlawful when third persons choose to honor the picket lines. The mere existence of picketing, however, does not automatically render all union activity lawful. <em>See United Steelworkers v. NLRB, </em>376 U.S. 492, 84 S.Ct. 899, 11 L.Ed.2d 863 (1964); <em>International Union of Elec. Workers v. NLRB, supra; NLRB v. International Rice Milling Co., </em>341 U.S. 665, 71 S.Ct. 961, 95 L.Ed. 1277 (1951). Where <em>an object </em>of the union\u2019s activity is to coerce third persons, it can fall within the prohibitions of \u00a7 8(b)(4), depending on the precise nature of the picketing and the intent of the pickets. <em>See, e.g., NLRB v. Enterprise Ass\u2019n of Pipefitters, Local 638, </em>429 U.S. 507, 510 (1977); <em>NLRB v. Denver Building Council, </em>341 U.S. 675, 689 (1951); <em>United Scenic Artists, Local 829 v. NLRB, </em>655 F.2d 1267, 1269-70 (D.C.Cir.1981); <em>Texas Distributors, Inc. v. Local Union No. 100, </em>598 F.2d 393, 400 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Iodice v. Calabrese, </em>512 F.2d 383, 388 (2d Cir.1975). Here, Bonanno has alleged that the Union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>intended </em>to <em>coerce </em>third persons into ceasing to do business with it, and it has alleged damage to the property of third persons. The determination of whether certain activity is primary or secondary can often be made only after exploration of the facts. <em>See International Union of Elec. Workers v. NLRB, </em>366 U.S. at 673-74, 81 S.Ct. at 1289-90. Interpreting the pleadings liberally, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(f), we believe they allege conduct which could fall within the prohibitions of \u00a7 8(b)(4). <em>See, e.g., NLRB v. Ser-vette, </em>377 U.S. 46, 52-54 (1964). We note that appellants themselves believed as much when they asked for removal over seven years (and many judicial proceedings) ago. All this is only to say that Bonanno stated a claim, not that it could prove a violation of the Act (indeed, it failed to do so). But, since Bonanno alleged facts sufficient to present a federal question, the district court had the <em>power </em>to hear the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The Local\u2019s arguments are, for the most part, relevant not to the issue of judicial \u201cpower,\u201d but to the question of district court \u201cdiscretion.\u201d <em>See United Mineworkers </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. at 726, 86 S.Ct. at 1139; <em>Ortiz v. United States, </em>595 F.2d 65, 68-69 (1st Cir.1979). Thus, the fact that Bonanno did not pursue the Taft-Hartley claim vigorously in federal court \u2014 it conducted little discovery, and apparently presented no evidence at trial \u2014 weighs in favor of dismissal of the pendent state claim. The exercise of discretion to hear the state claim, however, is governed by \u201cconsiderations of judicial economy, convenience, and fairness to litigants.\u201d <em>Mayor of Philadelphia v. Educational Equality League, </em>415 U.S. 605, 627, 94 S.Ct. 1323, 1336, 39 L.Ed.2d 630 (1974); <em>United Mineworkers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. at 726, 86 S.Ct. at 1139. And, there are forceful considerations of this sort that cut the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">For one thing, it was the <em>Local itself </em>that removed the action from state to federal court in the first place. As the Sixth Circuit remarked in a similar context,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">Not only did the union not contest the jurisdiction of the District Court, <em>the case was removed from the state court upon the union\u2019s motion. </em>Given the expenditure of judicial time and energy on this case, and given the common nucleus of operative fact, we cannot say that the exercise of pendent jurisdiction by the District Court was an abuse of its discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-10\"><em>Kayser-Roth Corp. v. Textile Workers Union of America, </em>479 F.2d 524, 526 (6th Cir.) (emphasis in original), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 976, 94 S.Ct. 292, 38 L.Ed.2d 219 (1973); <em>accord, Federal Prescription Service, Inc. v. Amalgamated Meat Cutters, </em>527 F.2d 269, 274 (8th Cir.1975). Similarly here, when the Union moved for a remand, the case had been pending in federal court for five years and had already been appealed to this court once. For another thing, there is no indication that the plaintiffs lacked good faith in making their initial Taft-Hartley allegations. Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in refusing to remand. <em>See Rosado v. Wy-man, </em>397 U.S. 397, 403-05, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 1213-14, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">We turn to a more difficult jurisdictional question raised by the individual defendants \u2014 the \u201cpendent parties.\u201d Bonanno does not assert any <em>federal </em>claim against these parties. Bonanno\u2019s state claim against them was removed from the state court, along with the federal and state claims against the Local, on the theory that the state claim against the individuals was \u201cpendent\u201d to the federal claim against the Local. <em>See Aldinger v. Howard, </em>427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 49 L.Ed.2d 276 (1976). The individuals now claim that the federal court lacked jurisdiction to hear Bonanno\u2019s state claim against them. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">The jurisdictional defect is not one of constitutional power. The grant of judicial power contained in Article III, Section 2, is related to the nature of the <em>case, </em>not the nature of each individual <em>claim </em>(\u201cThe judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, .... \u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqO\">[I]f, considered without regard to their federal or state character, a plaintiff\u2019s claims are such that he would ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding, then, assuming substantiality of the federal issues, there is <em>power </em>in federal courts to hear the whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\"><em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. at 725, 86 S.Ct. at 1138 (emphasis in original). The claims against the individuals here are so closely related to both federal and state claims against the Local that we are willing to assume, constitutionally speaking, that \u201cone judicial proceeding\u201d would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Nonetheless, Article III also provides that the judicial power \u201cshall be vested ... in such inferior courts as the <em>Congress </em>may ... establish.\u201d Thus, we must ask whether Congress has vested in the federal courts the power to hear Bonanno\u2019s claims against the individual defendants. <em>Aldinger v. Howard, supra. </em>We find it has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">In <em>Aldinger </em>the Supreme Court developed a rule of statutory construction aimed at deciding whether Congress, in a jurisdictional statute, intended to open the federal courts to particular state law claims against particular \u201cpendent parties.\u201d The Court held that we should look at the pendent parties, and ask, \u201cDid Congress intend this type of party to be the subject of this type of federal action?\u201d If not, it is likely that Congress \u201cexpressly or by implication negated\u201d jurisdiction to hear closely related state law claims against that \u201cpendent party\u201d as well. 427 U.S. at 18, 96 S.Ct. at 2422; <em>see Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Ote-ro, </em>598 F.2d 627, 631 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">The <em>Aldinger </em>plaintiff brought a federal civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in federal court against county officials and the county. She asserted federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, a special statute giving federal district courts \u201coriginal jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law to be commenced ... to redress\u201d a \u00a7 1983 violation. She also brought related state claims against all of the defendants. At that time (prior to <em>Monell v. Dept. of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978)), the courts believed that counties were not \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983, and so the district court dismissed the federal claim against the county. It then dismissed the <em>state </em>law claim against the county as well, on the theory that the federal court lacked the power to make the county a \u201cpendent party\u201d for purposes of hearing the state claims against it. The Supreme Court affirmed, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-13\">[p]arties such as counties, whom Congress <em>excluded </em>from liability in \u00a7 1983, and therefore by reference in the grant of jurisdiction under \u00a7 1343(3), can argue with a great deal of force that the scope of that \u201ccivil action\u201d over which the district courts have been given statutory jurisdiction should not be so broadly read as to bring them <em>back </em>within that power merely because the facts also give rise to an ordinary civil action against them under state law. In short, as against a plaintiff\u2019s claim of <em>additional </em>power over a \u201cpendent party,\" the reach of the statute conferring jurisdiction should be construed in light of the scope of the cause of action as to which the federal judicial power <em>has </em>been extended by Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2T\">427 U.S. at 17, 96 S.Ct. at 2421.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\"><em>Aldinger </em>would seem to require dismissal of the state claims against the individual pendent parties here, for the jurisdictional picture is very similar. The parties have relied upon \u00a7 303 of the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 187, which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-15\">(a) It shall be unlawful ... for any labor organization to engage in any activity or conduct defined as an unfair labor practice in Section 158(b)(4) of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-16\">(b) Whoever shall be injured in his business or property by reason [of] any violation of subsection (a) of this section may sue therefor in any district court of the United States ..., or in any other court having jurisdiction of the parties ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-17\">The district court noted that the language of the jurisdictional subsection (b), through its reference to subsection (a), applies only to suits against labor organizations, not to suits against individuals. But, it concluded that \u201cnothing in the statute suggests that Congress intended otherwise to limit a federal district court\u2019s power to decide closely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>related claims by the same plaintiff against parties who are not labor organizations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The legislative history of \u00a7 303, however, reveals the contrary, namely a clear legislative intent to immunize individuals. <em>Cf. Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Reis, </em>451 U.S. 401, 101 S.Ct. 1836, 68 L.Ed.2d 248 (1981). When Senator Taft originally introduced the Taft-Hartley Amendments in the Senate, \u00a7 303 contained language that applied to individuals as well as unions. Other Senators strongly objected, pointing out that, as drafted, \u00a7 303 might resurrect the <em>Danbury Hatters </em>case, where individual union members were held liable for union activities. 93 Cong.Rec. 4839, <em>quoted in Complete Auto Transit, </em>451 U.S. at 413, 101 S.Ct. at 1843. In response to these fears of \u201cmass suits against employees,\u201d 93 Cong. Rec. 4839 (remarks of Senator Morse), <em>quoted in Complete Auto Transit, </em>451 U.S. at 413, 101 S.Ct. at 1843, Senator Taft deleted the \u201cindividual liability\u201d language and substituted the current language, so that \u201cthe action will be open only [to suits] against labor organizations,\u201d and not against individuals. 93 Cong.Rec. 4841 (remarks of Senator Taft), <em>quoted in Complete Auto Transit, </em>451 U.S. at 414, 101 S.Ct. at 1843-44. In finally enacting the law, Congress adopted the new Senate language, expressly declining to accept House language that would have made the individuals also liable. <em>Complete Auto Transit, </em>451 U.S. at 414-15, 101 S.Ct. at 1843-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">There is thus more, not less, reason here than in <em>Aldinger </em>to find that Congress \u201cby implication\u201d has \u201cnegated\u201d pendent party jurisdiction over this related state law claim. In <em>Aldinger </em>the language of the jurisdictional statute (\u00a7 1343(3)) was broader than \u00a7 303(b); the \u201cexcluded\u201d pendent claim was less clearly outside the language of the jurisdictional statute, <em>cf. Monell v. Dept. of Social Services, supra, </em>(holding that local governments <em>are </em>\u201cpersons\u201d subject to \u00a7 1983 liability); and the legislative history less clearly showed an intent to exclude. In sum, given <em>Aldinger, </em>\u00a7 303(b) cannot be interpreted to allow federal court jurisdiction over claims against individuals who are parties only to a related state claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">We are aware of no other basis for jurisdiction. The Local has not itself sued the individuals for reimbursement, so they are not third party defendants, and no issue of ancillary jurisdiction arises. (And, in light of <em>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger, </em>437 U.S. 365, 98 S.Ct. 2396, 57 L.Ed.2d 274 (1978), Bonanno probably could not sue the individuals directly even if they were third party defendants.) Bonanno has alleged neither diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, nor \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. In any event, we assume that the Supreme Court intends us to read \u00a7 1331 in light of the pendent party limitations inferable from \u00a7 303(b), for otherwise <em>Aldinger </em>would seem meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\"><em>Aldinger </em>is not quite sufficient to dispose of the matter, however, for unlike <em>Aldinger, </em>this case involves <em>removal. </em>Thus, we must ask whether the removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, provides a basis for jurisdiction which otherwise would be lacking. The relevant portions of that statute read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">(b) Any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded on a claim or right arising under the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States shall be removable without regard to the citizenship or residence of the parties....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">(c) Whenever a separate and independent claim or cause of action, which would be removable if sued upon alone, is joined with one or more otherwise non-removable claims or causes of action, the entire case may be removed and the district court may determine all issues therein, or, in its discretion, may remand all matters not otherwise within its original jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Subsection (b) allows removal only of a case which plaintiff might have brought in federal court directly; thus, it provides no additional basis for jurisdiction. Subsection (c), however, allows a federal court to take jurisdiction of \u201cseparate and independent\u201d causes of action that it might not otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>have statutory authority to hear. <em>See, e.g., American Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Finn, </em>341 U.S. 6, 71 S.Ct. 534, 95 L.Ed. 702 (1951); <em>Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>303 F.2d 57 (1st Cir.1962); <em>H.A. Lott, Inc. v. Hoisting &amp; Portable Engineers Local No. 450, </em>222 F.Supp. 993 (S.D.Tex. 1963). The question is whether that subsection helps Bonanno, and the answer is that it does not. Under the test of American <em>Fire &amp; Casualty v. Finn, supra, </em>the state claim against the individuals is not \u201cseparate and independent\u201d from the other claims in the case; it is too closely related to those claims to satisfy <em>Finn\u2019s </em>requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">To understand this conclusion, we must begin with the commentators\u2019 suggestions that \u00a7 1441(c) as a matter of logic <em>ought </em>to help Bonanno in a case like this one. Both Moore\u2019s treatise, and that of Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, suggest that when a defendant removes an \u201carising under\u201d case, any state claims involved are either sufficiently closely related to the federal claims to be considered \u201cpendent\u201d (and thus removable under \u00a7 1441(b)), or they are sufficiently unrelated to be considered \u201cseparate and independent\u201d (and thus removable under \u00a7 1441(c)). 1A J. Moore, <em>Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 0.163[4.5] at 271 (2d ed. 1982); Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3724 at 649 (1976). In either event, the federal court has the <em>statutory power </em>to hear them, though, of course, in its discretion it can remand them to state court. What sense does it make, after all, to have a <em>tertium quid </em>of certain state claims \u2014 those too distant to be pendent, too close to be \u201cseparate and independent\u201d\u2014 that alone, in an \u201carising under\u201d ease, the federal court would have no statutory power to hear? However, the history of \u00a7 1441(c), taken together with <em>Aldinger, </em>suggests that this middle category of cases does exist, and that this case falls within that category.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">At first reading, \u00a7 1441(c) seems bizarre, at least as applied to \u201carising under\u201d cases. It says that the more unrelated a state claim is to a federal claim, the more likely it is that removal is appropriate. But, this anomaly arises from history and, in particular, from the fact that \u00a7 1441(c) was written with <em>diversity </em>cases in mind. Before 1875, a plaintiff seeking to sue both an out-of-state defendant and an in-state defendant in federal court could not do so; there was no federal diversity jurisdiction because of a lack of <em>complete </em>diversity. <em>See Strawbridge v. Curtiss, </em>7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 267, 2 L.Ed. 435 (1806). If he sued them in state court, however, federal jurisdictional law then allowed the out-of-state defendant to remove his portion of the case to federal court, provided that the claim against him was \u201cseparable\u201d from the claim against the in-state defendant. <em>See </em>the Separable Controversy Act of 1866,14 Stat. 306 (1866). The theory was that the defendant should not lose the protection of diversity jurisdiction merely because the plaintiff chose to join him with an in-state defendant. <em>Barney v. Latham, </em>103 U.S. 205, 210, 26 L.Ed. 514 (1881).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">In 1875, Congress passed a statute which became the former 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 71. It read</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8i\">And when in any suit mentioned in this section there shall be a controversy which is wholly between citizens of different States, and which can be fully determined as between them, then either one or more of the defendants actually interested in such controversy may remove said suit into the district court of the United States for the proper district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">This statute applied only in <em>diversity </em>cases. As interpreted by the courts this statute allowed a defendant to remove a case \u2014 indeed the <em>entire </em>case with its several defendants \u2014 where there was a \u201cseparable controversy.\u201d <em>Barney v. Latham, supra. </em>In other words, where there was a \u201cseparable controversy,\u201d the out-of-state defendant could remove, and the in-state defendant could tag along. The courts also made other complicated distinctions, interpreting the statute liberally to allow removal in a wide variety of cases. <em>See, e.g., </em>Cohen, <em>Problems in the Removal of a \u201cSeparate and Independent Claim or Cause of Action,\u201d </em>46 Minn.L. Rev. 1 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>As part of the 1948 Revision of the Judicial Code, Congress replaced this statute with \u00a7 1441(c). The Revisers tried to simplify the test for removal. <em>See </em>Revisions of Titles 18 and 28 of the United States Code: Hearings on H.R. 2055 Before Subcommittee No. 1 of the House Judiciary Committee, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 29 (1947) (statement of J. Moore). And, they intended to <em>limit </em>the range of cases that diversity defendants could remove. They did this, in part, by replacing the \u201cseparable controversy\u201d test with the words \u201cseparate and independent claim or cause of action.\u201d Insofar as diversity cases were concerned, this formula <em>did </em>make fewer cases removable. <em>See </em>1A J. Moore, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 0.163[4.-1]; Cohen, <em>supra, </em>at 18-19. Because of the \u201ccomplete diversity\u201d requirement, if an out-of-state defendant (linked to an in-state defendant) could not satisfy the \u201cseparate and independent\u201d test, the case could not be removed. <em>American Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Finn, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The 1948 Revisers, however, also omitted the diversity language of \u00a7 1441(c)\u2019s predecessors; the section thereby applied to \u201carising under\u201d cases as well. And, as applied to those cases, the new stricter test did <em>not </em>stop cases from being removed. Since there is no equivalent in an \u201carising under\u201d case to the \u201ccomplete diversity\u201d requirement, \u201carising under\u201d actions can be removed from state court whether or not other state claims or defendants are attached. Thus, the only effect of \u00a7 1441(c) is sometimes to <em>expand </em>the scope of removal by allowing the \u201cseparate and independent\u201d state claim defendant to tag along. There is no indication that the revisers foresaw this result, <em>see </em>Cohen, <em>supra, </em>at 31-32, and commentators have questioned its constitutionality, <em>e.g., </em>Lewin, <em>The Federal Courts\u2019 Hospitable Back Door, </em>66 Harv.L. Rev. 423 (1953); Cohen, <em>supra, </em>at 26; Ireland, <em>Entire Case Removal Under 1441(c), </em>11 Indiana L.Rev. 555, 571 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">By understanding \u00a7 1441(c)\u2019s history \u2014 its focus on the diversity case and its goal of restricting removal \u2014 one can understand the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>American Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Finn, supra. Finn </em>was a diversity case, and the Supreme Court there interpreted the words \u201cseparate and independent claim or cause of action\u201d strictly, as the statute\u2019s framers intended, to limit removal. 341 U.S. at 12, 71 S.Ct. at 539. Thus, the Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASt\">where there is a single wrong to plaintiff, for which relief is sought, arising from an interlocked series of transactions, there is no separate and independent claim or cause of action under \u00a7 1441(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">341 U.S. at 14, 71 S.Ct. at 540. <em>See New England Concrete Pipe Corp. v. D/C Systems of New England, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 867 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">In the present case, the state claim against the individuals was based upon \u201can interlocked series of transactions,\u201d some of which were used to infer the federal claim. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged injuries arising out of a single, protracted strike, in which mass picketing and violence affected both Bonanno and third persons. Judging from the complaint, some of the individual instances of picketing and violence affected third parties within the scope of the Taft-Hartley Act. The \u201cTaft-Hartley\u201d instances comprise a portion of the \u201cstate law\u201d instances; and all instances are connected and intertwined. The \u201cclaim or cause of action\u201d against the individuals thus fails to meet the \u201cseparate and independent\u201d test of <em>Finn, see </em>341 U.S. at 16, 71 S.Ct. at 541, for both claims \u201csubstantially derive from the same facts.\u201d <em>New England Concrete Pipe Corp. v. D/C Systems of New England, </em>658 F.2d at 874 n. 12. <em>Cf. McMahon Chevrolet, Inc. v. Davis, </em>392 F.Supp. 322, 324 (S.D.Tex.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">In sum, <em>Aldinger </em>closes the door to these \u201cpendent party\u201d claims, and \u00a7 1441(c) fails to reopen it. We have what the commentators consider an anomalous \u201cmiddle\u201d category of parties left behind in state court. But we see no serious harm arising out of this interpretation of the law. To interpret the words \u201cseparate and independent\u201d more liberally here would depart from <em>Finn, </em>suggest a different interpretation of these same words in \u201carising under\u201d cases, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>thereby proliferate standards in an area already too complex. Any anomaly arising out of the much-criticized \u00a7 1441(c) can be resolved through legislation. The American Law Institute has suggested statutory revisions, including one which would require the district court to remand all claims not within its pendent jurisdiction, effectively eliminating the use of \u00a7 1441(c) in federal question cases of this sort. <em>See ALI Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts, </em>29, 212-13 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Since this court lacks jurisdiction over the claims against the individual defendants, the district court\u2019s decision on this point must be reversed. The proper statutory basis for removal of the claims against the Local is \u00a7 1441(b), which, given <em>Aldinger, </em>does not allow the pendent parties here to tag along.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We note one final, related jurisdictional matter in respect to \u00a7 1441(b). That section allows removal of \u201cany <em>civil action\u201d </em>of which the district courts have original jurisdiction. The previous version of the statute referred to \u201cany <em>suit </em>of a civil nature,\u201d <em>Alabama Great So. Ry. Co. v. American Cotton Co., </em>229 F. 11, 15 (5th Cir.1916), and each cause of action was considered a separate suit. <em>Tillman v. Russo-Asiatic Bank, </em>51 F.2d 1023 (2d Cir.1931), <em>cert. denied, </em>285 U.S. 539, 52 S.Ct. 312, 76 L.Ed. 932 (1932). One commentator has argued that the term \u201ccivil action\u201d means the <em>whole </em>state proceeding, so that if <em>some </em>claims or parties are not removable, <em>none </em>are. Lew-in, <em>supra, </em>at 426. However, this is inconsistent with the well-established rule that the removal statute embraces the same \u201cclass of cases\u201d as does the original jurisdiction statute. <em>Tennessee v. Union &amp; Planters Bank, </em>152 U.S. 454, 14 S.Ct. 654, 38 L.Ed. 511 (1894); <em>see Brough v. United Steelworkers of America, </em>437 F.2d 748 (1st Cir.1971). Moreover, before 1948, the \u201caris ing under\u201d defendant was allowed to remove his \u201csuit,\u201d leaving other defendants behind, if necessary. <em>See, e.g., The Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, </em>115 U.S. 1, 22-23, 5 S.Ct. 1113, 1123-24, 29 L.Ed. 319 (1885); <em>Galveston, Harrisburg &amp; San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Hall, </em>70 F.2d 608 (5th Cir.1934). The Reviser nowhere suggested an intent to change this result. Rather, the Reviser\u2019s Note indicates that the change in terminology was meant to be cosmetic; Moore concludes that no change in substance was intended. 1A J. Moore, <em>supra, </em>at \u00b6 157[4-1]. We conclude that it is proper here for the Local to remove Bonanno\u2019s \u201carising under\u201d and pendent claims against it to federal court, even if the other state claim defendants must be left behind.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The claims against the individual defendants must be remanded to the state court from which they came. <em>American Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Finn, </em>341 U.S. at 18-19, 71 S.Ct. at 542-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">We can deal with the Local\u2019s remaining contentions more briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">1. The Local attacks the district court\u2019s decision as contrary to Norris-LaGuardia Act \u00a7 6, which forbids holding it responsible for the tortious acts of its \u201cofficers, members, or agents, except upon clear proof of actual participation in, or actual authorization of, such acts, or of ratification of such acts after actual knowledge thereof.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 106. <em>See United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. at 737, 86 S.Ct. at 1144; <em>United Bhd. of Carpenters v. United States, </em>330 U.S. 395, 403, 67 S.Ct. 775, 779, 91 L.Ed. 973 (1947). Here, however, the district court could find that the \u201cclear proof\u201d standard was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">There is sufficient evidence that the union\u2019s representative, Salter, participated in the threats and acts of violence. When the plaintiffs first requested an injunction, Salter promised the court he would control the pickets, and no injunction was issued. He then failed to deliver on this promise, and the court entered a restraining order. The district court reasonably found that Salter\u2019s failure was \u201cdeliberate.\u201d He had the power and authority to control the violence, but he never removed any picket from the line, nor did he ask the Local to impose any fines. (Other evidence indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>that the Local\u2019s president knew of the allegations of violence as well.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The Local argues that Section 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act requires a showing that <em>top </em>union officials approved the violence. But both the Supreme Court and other lower courts have based liability on the actions of officials comparable in rank to Salter. <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. at 738, 86 S.Ct. at 1145 (\u201cthe U.M.W. representative\u201d); <em>Kayser-Roth Corp. v. Textile Workers of America, </em>479 F.2d 524, 527 (6th Cir.) (the \u201cstrike supervisors\u201d), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>414 U.S. 976, 94 S.Ct. 292, 38 L.Ed.2d 219 (1973); <em>see Ritchie v. United Mine Workers, </em>410 F.2d 827 (6th Cir.1969) (examining circumstantial evidence of involvement by union members). The Local adds that there is no evidence that it approved of <em>illegal </em>action. But, the Supreme Court has held that the union need do no more than authorize an agent\u2019s general activity. For example, \u201c[t]he grant of authority to an officer of'a union to negotiate agreements with employers ... may well be sufficient to make the union liable.\u201d <em>United Bhd. of Carpenters v. United States, </em>330 U.S. at 410, 67 S.Ct. at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In sum, on the facts present here the district court could reasonably find \u201cknowing tolerance\u201d by the union, <em>Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. at 739, 86 S.Ct. at 1145-46, if not actual authorization, see <em>Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. at 738, 86 S.Ct. at 1145; <em>Kayser-Roth, </em>479 F.2d at 526-27, and it could, therefore, hold the Local liable for the acts of its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">2. The Local argues that Bonanno should not have been allowed to recover the costs of protective services for 1976. It claims, first, that Bonanno\u2019s fear of violence in 1976 was unreasonable. The record, however, shows many instances of violence before 1976, and at least eight instances during that year; it provides adequate support for the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The Local adds that any danger was Bo-nanno\u2019s fault, for Bonanno refused to ratify the bargaining agreement that all other linen companies accepted in April, 1976. Whether or not Bonanno was within its legal rights in refusing to ratify, however, striker violence is not justified. <em>NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., </em>306 U.S. 240, 59 S.Ct. 490, 83 L.Ed. 627 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Finally, the Union claims that Bonanno cannot recover for the expense of putting armed guards on its delivery trucks, for Massachusetts law prohibits \u201clicensees\u201d from \u201cfurnishpng] armed guards upon the highways for persons involved in labor disputes.\u201d Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 147, \u00a7 30(8). In Massachusetts, however, a \u201cviolation of law is a bar to recovery ... only in instances where it is a contributing cause to the injury.\u201d <em>Janusis v. Long, </em>284 Mass. 403, 410, 188 N.E. 228 (1933); see Wallace <em>v. Patey, </em>335 Mass. 220, 222, 139 N.E.2d 407 (1957). Assuming a \u201cviolation of law\u201d for the sake of argument, we still see no relation between the \u201cillegality\u201d and the expense. Bonanno had to pay for the guards, not their weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">3. The Union claims that the district court erred in awarding prejudgment interest (under Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 231, \u00a7 6B) for damages which accrued after the action was filed, citing <em>Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. v. Crampton, </em>377 Mass. 159, 182 n. 21, 385 N.E.2d 1349, 1362 n. 21 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">Subsequent Supreme Judicial Court cases, however, have made clear that the court is to \u201cadd interest on the entire amount of the verdict.\u201d <em>Griffin v. General Motors Corp., </em>380 Mass. 362, 403 N.E.2d 402, 406 (1980); <em>Carey v. General Motors Corp., </em>377 Mass. 736, 387 N.E.2d 583, 588-89 (1979).
