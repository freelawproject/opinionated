Carlson alleges her discharge from Miller Brewing Company was the result of sex and age discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>The district court denied Carlson\u2019s motion to compel discovery of statistical information and granted summary judgment for the employer. Because a genuine issue of fact was presented concerning the reason for Carlson\u2019s discharge, we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand the case for a trial. We remand the motion to compel discovery for reconsideration by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Donald A. Sweat, the executor of Carlson\u2019s will, has been substituted as a party in this appeal because of Carlson\u2019s death while this appeal was pending. The motion for substitution was unopposed. Because the parties have not addressed the matter, we assume without deciding that this action survives the death of the plaintiff. <em>See Kilgo v. Bowman Transportation, Inc., </em>87 F.R.D. 26, 28 (N.D.Ga.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the question is whether there is any genuine issue of material fact. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We must view the evidence in the light most favorable to Carlson, the party opposing the motion for summary judgment. <em>Impossible Electronics Techniques, Inc. v. Wackenhut Protective Systems, Inc., </em>669 F.2d 1026 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Barbara Carlson, a woman over 40 who was qualified for her position as an industrial relations representative at the Miller Brewing Company, was discharged. Two males under 40 were added to the staff as industrial relations representatives. As defendant recognizes, this establishes a prima facie case of sex and age discrimination. Miller Brewing Company articulated a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for Carlson\u2019s discharge, claiming it was because she stated she had taped the exit interview of another Miller employee. According to the company, this incident undermined her credibility and that of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Carlson claims that the reason asserted for her dismissal was merely a pretext for impermissible age and sex discrimination. An employee may demonstrate pretext \u201ceither directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1095, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). Carlson presented evidence that her supervisor, Richard Wilson, was motivated by discriminatory intent, and evidence that the stated reason for her dismissal was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"Airz\">Carlson presented affidavit and deposition testimony concerning Wilson\u2019s discriminatory intent. (1) Wilson had told Carlson she did not fit his \u201cmanagement style\u201d and that women have a difficult time in labor relations. (2) When Carlson observed that she had not seen any women as industrial relations managers, Mr. Wilson replied, \u201cWe take care of that during the appraisal.\u201d (3) When Carlson asked Wilson if some of her heavy workload could be shared with others, he responded, \u201cthat is a typical female remark.\u201d (4) He assigned the brewery\u2019s uniform program to her because she was a woman. (5) As time for production at the brewery approached and more employees were hired, Mr. Wilson specifically informed Ms. Carlson that he was going to hire two <em>male </em>industrial relations representatives. Two males under age 40 were soon hired. (6) Wilson, under age 40, referred to some of Carlson\u2019s work experience as \u201cancient history\u201d and told her that working is difficult \u201cafter the years add up.\u201d (7) Mr. Wilson referred to a Miller officer approximately Carlson\u2019s age as a \u201csenile old man.\u201d (8) He also told Ms. Carlson that \u201cold people serve no useful purpose.\u201d (9) When Ms. Carlson was ill and required hospitalization soon after her arrival in Albany Mr. Wilson told her that he did not think she would be physically fit to return to work at her age.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">Attempting to discount the employer\u2019s stated reason for her dismissal, Carlson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>alleges that her supervisor gave differing accounts of the precise reason for her dismissal. She presented testimony from various Miller employees to support her claim that the supervisor\u2019s criticisms of her were not factually supported. Regarding the \u201ctaping incident,\u201d she explained her reason for her statement that she had taped the interview. Carlson claims there is no evidence that she was warned, suspended, reprimanded, or relieved of any duties during the seven weeks following the incident because of damage to her credibility or that of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Through this evidence, Carlson has presented a question of fact as to whether the stated reason for her dismissal from Miller Brewing Company was a pretext for discrimination. The Supreme Court has stated that intent is the ultimate issue of fact to be determined in an employment discrimination suit. <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 288-89, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1790, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982). The employer\u2019s intent is clearly disputed in this case, and summary judgment was therefore inappropriate. <em>See Hayden v. First National Bank, </em>595 F.2d 994, 997 (5th Cir.1979) (\u201c[wjhen dealing with employment discrimination cases, which usually necessarily involve examining motive and intent . .. granting of summary judgment is especially questionable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">We intimate no view as to the ultimate outcome of this case, but simply hold that the factual dispute concerning the employer\u2019s intent must be submitted to the trier of fact. That Wilson was biased against women and older persons would not necessarily translate into intent or pretextual reasons for firing. The overall evidence, however, is conflicting enough to require a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The district court stated that Carlson could not prevail unless she could show \u201cthat she would not have been fired but for her age or sex.\u201d Carlson had no evidence that males or persons under 40 would have been treated differently. Circumstantial evidence that males or younger persons were treated differently, however, was not the only way for Carlson to present a question of fact as to pretext. <em>See Williams v. General Motors Corp., </em>656 F.2d 120, 130 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (noting that evidence of employer\u2019s intent to discriminate on the basis of age could be direct evidence, such as a paper with the notation \u201cLay-Off \u2014 Too Old\u201d beside a plaintiff\u2019s name, or circumstantial evidence such as statistics or evidence of employer subterfuge), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 943, 102 S.Ct. 1621, 71 L.Ed.2d 855 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">This case is not similar to <em>Anderson v. Savage Laboratories, Inc., </em>675 F.2d 1221 (11th Cir.1982), in which the employer introduced evidence that it had uniformly discharged a number of persons for violating the same \u201cwork rule\u201d without regard to age. Miller has introduced no evidence that anyone else has been discharged for the same asserted reason. Whether Carlson\u2019s alleged \u201cbreach of professionalism\u201d was actually the reason for her discharge is a question for the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">\n<em>Motion to Compel Discovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">Carlson sought statistical information regarding the sex and age of persons employed by Miller Brewing Company as industrial relations representatives and managers for a period of approximately seven years. She also requested copies of the company\u2019s EEO-1 reports for the same period. Carlson appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to compel discovery of this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">The defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in this case was filed on October 13, 1981. Plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel discovery was filed November 2, 1981 and denied by the district court on January 7, 1982. The court gave no specific reason for the denial, but stated: \u201cIt is the Court\u2019s view that in the present posture of this litigation the Plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel should not be granted.\u201d It appears the denial of Carlson\u2019s motion to compel discovery of statistical evidence was based, at least to some extent, on the trial court\u2019s perception of the issues discussed above. On remand, the district court should recon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>sider the motion to compel discovery. Although we are reluctant to order discovery of particular information by reversing the denial of the motion, recognizing the broad discretion of the trial judge in discovery matters, we note that liberal discovery rules are applied in Title VII litigation. Statistical information concerning an employer\u2019s general policy and practice concerning minority employment may be relevant to a showing of pretext, even in a case alleging an individual instance of discrimination rather than a \u201cpattern and practice\u201d of discrimination. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 805, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1826, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Burns v. Thiokol Chemical Corp., </em>483 F.2d 300, 306 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
