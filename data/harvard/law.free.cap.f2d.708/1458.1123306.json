Williams, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1518-26\">NELSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1518-27\">Defendant-appellant Ssangyong Construction Co. (Ssangyong) appeals the district court\u2019s interlocutory order staying the action and sending to arbitration certain issues raised in a complaint filed by plaintiff-appellee Mediterranean Enterprises, Inc. (MEI). Ssangyong contends that the district court improperly interpreted the scope of the arbitration clause in a contract between the parties. We affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1518-28\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1518-29\">MEI, a California corporation, provides engineering services for modular housing projects in developing countries. In May, 1978, MEI was invited by the Saudi Arabian Royal Commission to bid on certain construction projects in Saudi Arabia. In connection with this invitation, MEI contacted Ssangyong, a Korean contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1461\">*1461</page-number>On September 9, 1978, in Los Angeles, MEI and Ssangyong signed a \u201cPreliminary Agreement for Formation of a Joint Venture\u201d (Agreement). The arbitration clause in the Agreement provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1519-5\">Any disputes arising hereunder or following the formation of joint venture shall be settled through binding arbitration pursuant to the Korean-U.S. Arbitration Agreement, with arbitration to take place in Seoul, Korea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1519-6\">Subsequently, MEI and Ssangyong entered into an Agency Agreement dated October 21, 1978, with Trac Enterprises, providing that Trac would serve as the agent of the joint venture in Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1519-7\">The contemplated MEI \u2014 Ssangyong joint venture was never actually formed. In its complaint, MEI alleges that Ssangyong used the Agreement merely to gain access to the Saudi projects, and wrongfully commenced the projects in association with Trac (named as a defendant below) rather than with MEI. Ssangyong claims that no breach occurred, and that its non-performance of the Agreement was due to its inability to obtain certain Korean government approvals required by paragraph 20 of the Agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1519-8\">On November 5, 1980, MEI commenced this action in district court. The complaint contains six counts against Ssangyong: breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty (counts 1, 2 and 4), inducing and conspiracy to induce breach of contract [the Trac Agency Agreement] (count 7), quantum meruit (count 8), and conversion (count 9).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1519-9\">On November 9, 1981, the district court rejected MEI\u2019s contention that Ssangyong had fraudulently inserted the words \u201carising hereunder or\u201d in the arbitration clause, and ordered Ssangyong to prepare findings of fact and conclusions of law on all of the issues relating to its motion to stay the proceedings pending arbitration. Ssan-gyong submitted its proposed findings and conclusions, which the court signed shortly thereafter. On December 1, 1981, the court held a hearing on the scope of the arbitration clause and took the matter under submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1519-12\">On July 19, 1982, the court entered its order amending one earlier conclusion of law, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1519-13\">The issues raised by Counts 1, 2 and 4 of Mediterranean Enterprises, Inc.\u2019s Complaint against Ssangyong Construction Co., Ltd. are found to be arbitrable and are ordered to arbitration between said parties pursuant to paragraph 16 of the Preliminary Agreement of September 9, 1978 between Mediterranean Enterprises, Inc. and Ssangyong Construction Co., Ltd.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1519-14\">The order also provides that \u201cthe action is stayed pending receipt by this court of the results of the arbitration between [MEI] and [Ssangyong].\u201d It is from this order that Ssangyong appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1519-15\">ISSUES PRESENTED</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1519-16\">I. Does this court have jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s interlocutory order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1519-17\">II. What is the scope of the arbitration clause?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1519-18\">III. Did the district court abuse its discretion in staying the action pending arbitration?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1519-19\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A66\">I. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1519-20\">This court has jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s order. As a general rule, the \u201cgrant or denial of a stay of an action pending arbitration ... is not a \u2018final decision\u2019 appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d <em>Danford </em>v. <em>Schwabacher, </em>488 F.2d 454, 455 (9th Cir.1973). However, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (1976), this court has jurisdiction over appeals from \u201c[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts ... granting, continuing, modifying, refusing, or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1462\">*1462</page-number>modify injunctions ... . \u201d Utilizing this section, this circuit has explained that under certain circumstances, an interlocutory stay order may be reviewed by the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Brannon v. Warn Bros., Inc., </em>508 F.2d 115, 118-19 (9th Cir.1974); <em>see also ATSA of California, Inc. </em>v. <em>Continental Insurance Co., </em>702 F.2d 172, 174 &amp; n. 2 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-4\">An appeal from a stay order lies if two conditions are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1520-5\">(a) The action in which the motion for a stay was made could have been maintained as an action at law before the merger of law and equity, and (b) the stay was sought to permit prior determination of an equitable defense or counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1520-6\"><em>Danford, </em>488 F.2d at 455, <em>quoted in Bran-non, </em>508 F.2d at 118. Both prongs of the test are satisfied here. <em>See Wren v. Sletten Construction Co., </em>654 F.2d 529, 532-33 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-7\">The second prong is satisfied because reliance upon an arbitration agreement to avoid immediate litigation is an equitable defense. <em>See, e.g., Schanferoke Coal &amp; Supply Corp. v. Westchester Service Corp., </em>293 U.S. 449, 452, 55 S.Ct. 313, 314-15, 79 L.Ed. 583, 586-87 (1935); <em>Wren, </em>654 F.2d at 533; <em>Danford, </em>488 F.2d at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-8\">To determine whether the first prong of the test is satisfied, we must examine MEI\u2019s complaint to determine whether it would have been considered legal or equitable prior to the merger of the two forms of action. <em>See Brannon, </em>508 F.2d at 118-19; <em>Danford, </em>488 F.2d at 456. When the complaint is arguably a combination of legal and equitable claims, this circuit has applied a \u201cdominant purpose\u201d test, which provides that when the complaint is \u201cwholly or basically and predominantly an action at law,\u201d it is considered legal for the purpose of satisfying the test\u2019s first prong. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Pacific Maritime Ass\u2019n, </em>332 F.2d 266, 267 (9th Cir.) (dictum), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 882, 85 S.Ct. 144, 13 L.Ed.2d 88 (1964), <em>quoted in Brannon, </em>508 F.2d at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-11\">In this case, the first prong is satisfied because MEI\u2019s complaint is predominantly an action at law. MEI seeks money damages in each of its six counts against Ssan-gyong, and while count 8, quantum meruit, is an equitable claim, MEI\u2019s other counts can be classified as legal. Counts 1, 2, and 7, which allege breach of contract and inducing breach of contract, are actions at law. <em>See Wren, </em>654 F.2d at 533; <em>Bear v. Hayden, Stone, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 734, 735 (9th Cir.1975). Count 4, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, has been considered an action at law when, as in this case, money damages are sought. <em>Cf. Austin v. Wilcoxson, </em>149 Cal. 24, 26-27, 84 P. 417, 418-22 (1906); <em>Ripling </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>112 Cal.App.2d 399, 403-07, 247 P.2d 117, 119 (1952) (actions alleging impropriety by trustees). Count 9, conversion, was also historically classified as a legal action. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bitter Root Development Co., </em>200 U.S. 451, 471-72, 26 S.Ct. 318, 324-25, 50 L.Ed. 550, 560-61 (1906); <em>see also </em>1 T. Street, <em>Federal Equity Practice </em>26-29 (1909).</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-12\">II. <em>Interpretation of the Arbitration Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1520-13\">A. <em>Standard of review and applicable law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1520-14\">A determination of the arbitrability of a dispute, like the interpretation of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1463\">*1463</page-number>contractual provision, is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See In re Bubble Up Delaware, Inc., </em>684 F.2d 1259, 1264 (9th Cir.1982) (de <em>novo </em>standard for contractual interpretation); <em>Drake Bakeries, Inc. v. Local 50, American Bakery &amp; Confectionery Workers International, </em>370 U.S. 254, 256, 82 S.Ct. 1346, 1348, 8 L.Ed.2d 474, 476-77 (1962) (issue of arbitrability a \u201cquestion for the courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-4\">The district court\u2019s order followed Ssangyong\u2019s motion to stay brought pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4, a section of the Federal Arbitration Act (Act), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 <em>et seq. </em>(1976). The district court correctly found that \u201cthe written arbitration provision is part of a \u2018contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce\u2019 within the meaning of [9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1976) ].\u201d An action brought under the Act is properly characterized as arising under the body of federal law regulating interstate commerce. <em>See generally Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Manufacturing Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967); <em>Grand Bahama Petroleum Co. v. Asiatic Petroleum Corp., </em>550 F.2d 1320 (2d Cir.1977). Federal law therefore applies to our determination of the scope of this arbitration agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>ATSA of California, Inc. v. Continental Insurance Co., </em>702 F.2d 172, 174-75 (9th Cir. 1983); <em>Tullis </em>v. <em>Kohlmeyer &amp; Co., </em>551 F.2d 632, 638 n. 8 (5th Cir.1977); <em>Zell v. JacobyBender, Inc., </em>542 F.2d 34, 37 (7th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-5\">B. <em>Policy considerations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1521-6\">The parties cite strong policies in support of their respective positions. Ssangyong argues that federal policy favors the enforcement of arbitration agreements, especially in international business transactions, citing <em>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., </em>417 U.S. 506, 516-17, 94 S.Ct. 2449, 2455-56, 41 L.Ed.2d 270, 279-80 (1974). MEI does not dispute the existence of such a federal policy, but counters by arguing that \u201carbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed to submit,\u201d quoting <em>United Steel Workers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 582, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 1353, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409, 1417 (1960). Both statements are sound, and are not at all unreconcilable. Ultimately, the issue of arbitrability \u201cis to be determined by the contract entered into by the parties.\u201d <em>Drake Bakeries, </em>370 U.S. at 256, 82 S.Ct. at 1348, 8 L.Ed.2d at 476; <em>accord West Coast Telephone Co. v. Local Union No. </em>77, <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, </em>431 F.2d 1219, 1221 (9th Cir.1970). The task before this court remains one of contractual interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-10\">C. <em>Scope of \u201carising hereunder\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1521-11\">Ssangyong argues that the arbitration clause \u201cwas designed to cover \u2018any\u2019 disputes between the parties.\u201d MEI argues that the phrase \u201carising hereunder\u201d means \u201carising under the contract itself\u201d and was not intended to cover \u201cmatters or claims independent of the contract or collateral thereto.\u201d Neither side points to, and additional research has not uncovered, cases in this circuit which define \u201carising hereunder\u201d in the context of an arbitration agreement. However, we are persuaded by a line of cases from the Second Circuit that MEI\u2019s interpretation is the more reasonable one.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1464\">*1464</page-number>We interpret \u201carising hereunder\u201d as synonymous with \u201carising under the Agreement.\u201d The phrase \u201carising under\u201d has been called \u201crelatively narrow as arbitration clauses go.\u201d <em>Sinva, Inc. v. Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>253 F.Supp. 359, 364 (S.D.N.Y.1966). In <em>In re Kinoshita &amp; Co., </em>287 F.2d 951, 953 (2d Cir. 1961), Judge Medina concluded that when an arbitration clause \u201crefers to disputes or controversies \u2018under\u2019 or \u2018arising out of\u2019 the contract,\" arbitration is restricted to \u201cdisputes and controversies relating to the interpretation of the contract and matters of performance.\u201d Judge Medina reasoned that the phrase \u201carising under\u201d is narrower in scope than the phrase \u201carising out of or relating to,\u201d the standard language recommended by the American Arbitration Association. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1522-4\">In a recent case, a district court amplified Judge Medina\u2019s reasoning. In <em>Michele Amoruso e Figli v. Fisheries Development Corp., </em>499 F.Supp. 1074, 1080 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), the court discussed the Supreme Court's interpretation of an arbitration clause, noting that \u201carising out of or relating to this agreement\u201d had been labelled a \u201cbroad arbitration clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Prima Paint Corp. </em>v. <em>Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 398, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 1803, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270, 1274 (1967)). The court went on to say that in the case before it, \u201cthe clause is limited to differences or disputes \u2018arising out of this Agreement\u2019; notably, it omits reference to disputes \u2018relating to\u2019 the agreements. The omission is significant in the Second Circuit.\u201d <em>Michele Amoruso e Figli, </em>499 F.Supp. at 1080.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-5\">The omission should be significant in this circuit as well. The standard clause suggested in the U.S. \u2014 Korean Commercial Arbitration Agreement contains the phrase, \u201cout of or in relation to or in connection with this contract, or for the breach thereof.\u201d We have no difficulty finding that \u201carising hereunder\u201d is intended to cover a much narrower scope of disputes, <em>i.e., </em>only those relating to the interpretation and performance of the contract itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-11\">D. <em>Arbitrability of claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1522-12\">In light of our interpretation of the arbitration clause in the Agreement, we must next decide whether the district court properly sent \u201cthe issues raised by\u201d counts 1, 2 and 4 to arbitration. This entails examining MEI\u2019s complaint to determine the extent to which the counts against Ssangyong refer to disputes or controversies relating to the interpretation and performance of the contract itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-13\">Counts 1, 2 and 4, alleging breach of the Agreement and breach of the fiduciary duty created by the Agreement, clearly fall within the scope of the arbitration clause and are thus proper subjects for arbitration. However, counts 7, 8 and 9 appear to raise issues that are either primarily or wholly outside the scope of the arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-14\">Count 7 alleges that Ssangyong induced and conspired to induce breach of the Trac Agency Agreement, a separate and distinct contract. Ssangyong\u2019s alleged conduct appears to relate only peripherally to the MEI-Ssangyong Agreement, and could have been accomplished even if the Agreement did not exist. Count 7 therefore alleges activity and raises issues which are predominantly unrelated to the central conflict over the interpretation and performance of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-15\">Count 8 sets forth a claim in quantum meruit, which by its own terms rests on the theory that services were performed and accepted pursuant to an implied contract or \u201cquasi-contract.\u201d An action does not lie on an implied contract where there exists between the parties a valid express contract which covers the identical subject matter. <em>Swanson v. Levy, </em>509 F.2d 859, 861 (9th Cir.1975). Thus, by definition, count 8 does not directly relate to the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>pretation and performance of the Agreement itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-4\">Count 9 alleges that Ssangyong converted to its own use and benefit certain prequalification documents delivered by MEI. The Agreement provides only that each of the parties would bear his own costs at the prequalification stage. MEI\u2019s claim that Ssangyong misappropriated these documents appears to raise issues largely distinct from the central conflict over the interpretation and performance of the Agreement itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-5\">By sending \u201cthe issues raised by\u201d counts 1, 2 and 4 to arbitration, the district court authorized the arbitrator, in accordance with the expressed intention of the parties, to decide those issues relating to the interpretation and performance of the Agreement. Counts 1, 2 and 4 appear to be completely arbitrable. By deciding those issues necessary to resolve counts 1,2 and 4, the arbitrator might well decide issues which bear in some way on the court\u2019s ultimate disposition of counts 7, 8 and 9. Nothing in the district court\u2019s order, or in this opinion, would bar such a result. The arbitrator\u2019s award, if it clearly exceeds the scope of his authority by deciding a matter not -within the ambit of the arbitration clause, will not be given effect by the court. <em>See Los Angeles Paper Bag Co. v. Printing Specialities and Paper Products Union, </em>345 F.2d 757, 760 (9th Cir.1965); <em>Lundgren v. Freeman, </em>307 F.2d 104, 109-10 (9th Cir. 1962). <em>See also Davis </em>v. <em>Chevy Chase Financial Ltd., </em>667 F.2d 160, 165 (D.C.Cir. 1981). After the district court receives the results of the arbitration, it should proceed to adjudicate those issues which fall outside the scope of the arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-6\">III. <em>Propriety of the Stay Pending Arbitration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1523-7\">We should overturn a trial court\u2019s stay of an action only when we believe the court has abused its discretion. <em>See Filtrol Corp. v. Kelleher, </em>467 F.2d 242, 244 (9th Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1110, 93 S.Ct. 914, 34 L.Ed.2d 691 (1973). The trial court possesses the inherent power to control its own docket and calendar. <em>Landis v. North American Co., </em>299 U.S. 248, 254-55, 57 S.Ct. 163, 165-66, 81 L.Ed. 153, 158-59 (1936); <em>accord Leyva </em>v. <em>Certified Grocers of California, Ltd., </em>593 F.2d 857, 864 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 827, 100 S.Ct. 51, 62 L.Ed.2d 34 (1979). As this circuit recently stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1523-9\">[a] trial court may, with propriety, find it is efficient for its own docket and the fairest course for the parties to enter a stay of an action before it, pending resolution of independent proceedings which bear upon the case. This rule applies whether the separate proceedings are judicial, administrative, or arbitral in character, and does not require that the issues in such proceedings are necessarily controlling of the action before the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1523-10\"><em>Leyva, </em>593 F.2d at 863-64 (citing <em>Kerotest Manufacturing Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equipment Co., </em>342 U.S. 180, 72 S.Ct. 219, 96 L.Ed. 200 (1952)). We believe that under the circumstances presented in this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion by staying the action pending receipt of the results of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-12\">We find the district court\u2019s order staying the action and sending to arbitration certain issues raised by MEI\u2019s complaint proper in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-13\">Accordingly, the order is</p>\n<p id=\"AArF\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1519-10\">. On February 16, 1981, Ssangyong filed a Request for Arbitration in Korea with the Korean Commercial Arbitration Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1519-22\">. Counts 3, 5 and 6 of the complaint, which involve only defendants Trac Enterprises and its president, are not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1520-9\">. These cases interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule, which analogizes certain stay orders to injunctions appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (1976). <em>Enelow v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>293 U.S. 379, 55 S.Ct. 310, 79 L.Ed. 440 (1935); <em>Ettelson v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>317 U.S. 188, 63 S.Ct. 163, 87 L.Ed. 176 (1942). <em>See also Baltimore Contractors v. Bodinger, </em>348 U.S. 176, 184, 75 S.Ct. 249, 254, 99 L.Ed. 233, 240 (1955) (explaining that the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule applies only to \u201ca stay through equitable principles of a common-law action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-15\">The rule has been justifiably criticized as \u201cextremely difficult to apply\u201d in cases where the complaint contains a mixture of legal and equitable claims.

This circuit has called the rule \u201cpeculiar,\u201d and has labelled it \u201ca remnant from the jurisprudential attic.\u201d <em>Danford, </em>488 F.2d at 455-56. Despite its arcane nature, the rule has not yet been discarded by the Supreme Court and remains the law of this circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1521-7\">. Neither party disputes the application of federal law to this appeal, even though paragraph 21 of the Agreement provides that the contract shall be construed according to California law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1521-8\">. The cases cited by Ssangyong in support of its broad interpretation are unpersuasive. Most cited cases involve arbitration clauses which were drafted in broader terms and intended to cover a broader spectrum of disputes than the clause involved here. See, <em>e.g., Griffin v. Semperit of America, Inc., </em>414 F.Supp. 1384, 1387 (S.D.Tex. 1978) (clause read, \u201c[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement\u201d); <em>Acevedo Maldonado v. PPG Indus., Inc., </em>514 F.2d 614, 616 (1st Cir.1975) (same); <em>Altshul Stern &amp; Co., Inc. v. Mitsui </em>Bussan Kaisha, <em>Ltd., </em>385 F.2d 158, 159 (2d Cir. 1967) (clause read, \u201cany dispute ... arising out of or relating to this contract or the breach thereof\u2019). Most of the cases cited by Ssangyong also involve disputes more clearly arising under the contract than those involved here. See, <em>e.g., Haig Berberian, Inc. v. Cannery Warehousemen, </em>535 F.2d 496, 499 (9th Cir. 1976) (holding arbitrable a claim which itself purported to be based on an interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1464\">*1464</page-number>the contract); <em>Georgia Power Co. v. Cimarron Coal Corp., </em>526 F.2d 101, 106 (6th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 952, 96 S.Ct. 1727, 48 L.Ed.2d 195 (1976) (holding that, under an arbitration clause which read, \u201cany controversy . . . arising under this Agreement,\u201d no \u201cprovision of the contract [was] wholly outside of the arbitration provision\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
