We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-26\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-27\">This ease involves alleged deficiencies in the petitioner\u2019s federal income tax for the taxable years ending March 31, 1974, and March 31, 1975. During those years the petitioner was a not-for-profit corporation that was not exempt from federal taxation. Its membership was limited to current sala<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>ried employees and retired employees of Armour-Dial, Inc. (Armour), a corporation that manufactures various consumer products. The petitioner\u2019s purpose, as stated in its Certificate of Incorporation and ByLaws, was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1346-4\">To promote a better social relationship among the salaried and steady time employees [of Armour], and to promote athletics, recreational activities, and such other enterprises as will create a more friendly relationship and harmony in the organization and will by the exchange of thoughts and ideas, be of mutual benefit to all concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">To that end the petitioner sponsored approximately ten major recreational, entertainment, and social functions for its members during each of the years in question. These functions were paid for with funds from two sources: (1) membership initiation fees and dues; and (2) gross profits from a retail store operated by the petitioner at which it sold reject soap, detergent, and other products purchased from Armour, usually at factory cost or less.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1346-6\">Although Armour had no ownership interest in the petitioner, it supported and, to a certain extent, controlled the petitioner\u2019s activities. For example, Armour permitted the petitioner to use its bulletin boards; it assisted the petitioner in matters such as delivery of the products, mail, and copying; it permitted the petitioner to conduct business on company time; and it imposed restrictions on the store\u2019s operation, requiring products to be unwrapped before sale, prohibiting advertising, and directing the club to take certain products. Armour also collected membership dues for the. petitioner by making deductions from individual members\u2019 payroll checks. Armour fully intended the petitioner to use all of its income to finance membership \u201cfunctions\u201d and would not have permitted the petitioner to operate otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-10\">Armour maintained its relationship with the petitioner for at least two reasons. First, Armour viewed membership in the petitioner as a benefit to its employees,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and believed that the petitioner\u2019s functions were beneficial to its own business activities by inducing lower employee turnover and promoting harmonious employee relationships. Second, Armour benefited from the petitioner\u2019s retail store to the extent the store provided a means for Armour to dispose of its reject products under circumstances that would prevent the products from entering into regular distribution channels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-11\">During the tax years in question the petitioner deducted from its income all expenditures for membership activities, most of which were attributable to the costs of its \u201cfunctions,\u201d even though the bulk of the income was generated by its retail activities. The Commissioner disallowed these deductions to the extent they exceeded the income derived from the petitioner\u2019s membership fees and dues, and determined deficiencies for the respective tax years. The petitioner filed for a redetermination. The United States Tax Court entered a decision for the Commissioner, reasoning that the petitioner was a \u201cmembership organization,\u201d \u201cnot exempt from taxation,\u201d \u201coperated primarily to furnish services or goods to its members,\u201d and, under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 277(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> entitled to deductions for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>tax year \u201conly to the extent of income derived during such year from members or transactions with members.\u201d <em>Armour-Dial Men\u2019s Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>77 T.C. 1 (1981). The petitioner appeals from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-6\">In this appeal the petitioner challenges the Tax Court\u2019s finding that the petitioner \u201coperated primarily to furnish services or goods to members.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As that finding was a factual one, <em>see Associated Master Barbers &amp; Beauticians v. Commissioner, </em>69 T.C. 53, 74 (1977), this Court will not set it aside unless it was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>See Nickerson </em>v. <em>COR, </em>700 F.2d 402, 405 (7th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-7\">The Tax Court, evaluating the petitioner\u2019s operations under an \u201cobjective test,\u201d based its finding on the following factors: (1) \u201cthe focus of petitioner\u2019s activities consisted of sponsoring approximately ten major social functions a year\u201d; (2) the \u201cexpenditures for these events were approximately 13 to 14 times greater than the amounts of membership income\u201d; and (3) the petitioner\u2019s retail sales \u201cfunctioned chiefly as a means of enabling petitioner\u2019s members to attend the various functions it sponsored at a reduced or no cost.\u201d The petitioner argues that the court\u2019s determination was incorrect in that the relationship between itself and Armour demonstrated that its \u201cprimary purpose\u201d was actually to benefit Armour, and thus \u201cby definition\u201d the petitioner could not be said to have \u201coperated primarily to furnish services or goods to members.\u201d We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-8\">The plain language of Section 277 indicates that the proper inquiry in a case such as this is how a membership organization \u201coperates.\u201d See <em>Matter of Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific R.R. Co., </em>673 F.2d 169, 172 (7th Cir.1982) (citing <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 201, 96 S. Ct. 1375, 1385, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976)) (\u201cWhere the statutory language is \u2018sufficiently clear in its context,\u2019 we need look no further in interpreting the statute.\u201d). The Tax Court made that inquiry and determined that the petitioner operated to provide social, recreational, and entertainment functions for its members at a reduced cost or no cost. That is precisely the type of activity that Section 277 was meant to affect. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 552, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 74, <em>reprinted in </em>1969 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2027, 2103 (\u201cThe purpose [of Section 277] is to prevent membership organizations from escaping tax on business ... income by using this income to serve its members at less than cost and then deducting the book \u2018loss.\u2019\u201d); <em>Associated Master Barbers &amp; Beauticians v. Commissioner, </em>69 T. C. at 72 (further legislative history collected). The fact that an underlying \u201cpurpose\u201d of the petitioner\u2019s existence (admittedly one fostered by Armour) was to make its members happy and thus more effective in their work does not alter the focus of the organization\u2019s operation, which was to sponsor the \u201cfunctions.\u201d Nor is there any serious argument that the petitioner, though indirectly providing a benefit to Armour by providing a secure retail outlet, was \u201coperated primarily\u201d to that end. The Tax Court\u2019s finding that the petitioner \u201coperated primarily to furnish services or goods to members\u201d was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1346-7\">. The petitioner\u2019s relevant income and expenditures for the respective tax years were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1346-8\">Income 1974 1975</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMaH\">Initiation fees and dues $ 3,518.05 $ 4,087.25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"abs-dedup-0\">Gross profits from retail sales 65,413.23 85,638.10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_7\">Expenditures</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY1\">Membership 43,318.61 53,076.14 \u201cfunctions\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1346-12\">. Armour distributed a brochure through its personnel department so that new salaried employees could become aware of club membership as a \u201cfringe benefit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1346-13\">. Section 277(a) provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-14\">In the case of a social club or other membership organization which is operated primarily to furnish services or goods to members and which is not exempt from taxation, deductions for the taxable year attributable to furnishing services, insurance, goods, or other items of value to members shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>allowed only to the extent of income derived during such year from members or transactions with members....</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1347-10\">. In a closing footnote in its brief (p. 16, n. 2) the petitioner also argues that this case must be reversed because Section 277(a) permits deductions \u201cto the extent of income derived ... from ... transactions with members,\u201d and the Tax Court ignored that fact that many of the petitioner\u2019s retail sales were to its own members. The petitioner did not raise this argument in the Tax Court. Thus it is not properly before us in this appeal. <em>See, e.g., Phillips v. Hunter Trails Community Ass\u2019n, </em>685 F.2d 184, 191 (7th Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
