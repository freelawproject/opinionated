The Court vacated our earlier opinion and asked us to consider whether the Texas Constitution offered the petitioner, Charles Edwin Bullard, relief on grounds independent of the United States Constitution. The petitioner has now asked us to dismiss his federal habeas petition with prejudice and vacate the district court\u2019s decision granting him habeas relief, so that he may return to state court to seek relief under the state constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since both parties to this litigation now agree that the district court\u2019s opinion should be vacated, we conclude that the petitioner\u2019s request must be granted because there is no longer a live case or controversy before this court. Because the circumstances of this dismissal are unique, we take this opportunity to explain how we have arrived at this pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-17\">Bullard was tried and convicted in state court of theft of property over the value of two hundred dollars. Because he had allegedly committed two prior felonies, the trial court enhanced his punishment to life imprisonment. <em>See </em>Tex.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.42 (Vernon 1974). The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that the state\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove that Bullard was the defendant who had been convicted of one of the prior convictions alleged in the indictment, <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>State, </em>533 S.W.2d 812 (Tex.Cr.App.1976), but the court permitted the reimposition of the life sentence at a second enhancement proceeding. <em>Bullard v. State, </em>548 S.W.2d 13 (Tex.Cr.App.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-18\">After determining that Bullard had exhausted his state remedies, the federal district court, 502 F.Supp. 887, granted him habeas corpus relief on the ground that the second enhancement proceeding violated the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s application of the double jeopardy clause to the capital sentencing procedure in <em>Bullington v. Missouri, </em>451 U.S. 430, 101 S.Ct. 1852, 68 L.Ed.2d 270 (1981),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we affirmed the district court\u2019s decision and held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>the double jeopardy clause bars a second enhancement proceeding when the evidence at the first enhancement proceeding was insufficient to establish that the defendant committed one or more of the prior offenses \u2018 necessary for enhancement, and that this principle must be retroactively applied to Bullard's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\"><em>Bullard v. Estelle, </em>665 F.2d 1347, 1349 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">On March 23, 1982, the state petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari; the petition was granted on June 6, 1982. <em>Estelle v. Bullard, </em>457 U.S. 1116, 102 S.Ct. 2927, 73 L.Ed.2d 1328 (1982). Meanwhile, the Texas courts changed their views on whether, consistent with the double jeopardy clauses of both the United States and Texas Constitutions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a second enhancement proceeding could be brought when the evidence produced at the first enhancement proceeding was insufficient. On April 21,1982, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals agreed with our decision in <em>Bullard v. Estelle, supra, </em>and held that \u201cas a matter of federal constitutional law,\u201d if the state \u201cfails to sufficiently prove all facts necessary to find an enhancement paragraph \u2018true,\u2019 the State may not, at a new hearing in that cause have a second opportunity to prove the original allegations.\u201d <em>Cooper v. State, </em>631 S.W.2d 508, 514 (Tex.Cr.App.1982) (en banc). The <em>Cooper </em>court expressly overruled its holding to the contrary in <em>Bullard v. State. </em>After the Supreme Court had granted certiorari in <em>Bullard, </em>the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, relying on <em>Cooper, supra, </em>held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agv-dedup-0\">under either the Federal Constitution or the Texas Constitution the State of Texas is precluded from relitigating an issue of fact at a second trial or at a second punishment hearing where it failed to properly litigate that factual issue at the first trial or at the first punishment hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-12\"><em>Ex Parte Augusta, </em>639 S.W.2d 481, 485 (Tex.Cr.App.1982) (en banc).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-13\">At this point, Bullard decided that he would be better off in state court. He filed a motion in the Supreme Court to dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted on the ground that \u201cbut for the pendency of this petition for writ of certio-rari, Respondent would be entitled to immediate relief under the Texas Constitution, Article I, Section 14 and 19.\u201d On January 17, 1983, the Supreme Court vacated our opinion and remanded the case for further consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-14\">The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for consideration of whether the Texas constitution, as interpreted by the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas in <em>Ex Parte Augusta, </em>639 S.W.2d 481 (1982), offers respondent relief on grounds independent of the United States Constitution so as to ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>der inappropriate a decision on federal constitutional grounds. <em>City of Mesquite v. Aladdin\u2019s Castle, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 283, 102 S.Ct. 1070, 71 L.Ed.2d 152 (1982); <em>Mills v. Rogers, </em>457 U.S. 291, 102 S.Ct. 2442, 73 L.Ed.2d 16 (1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\"><em>Estelle v. </em>Bullard,-U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 776, 776-77, 74 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bul-lard then asked us to vacate the district court\u2019s decision and to dismiss with prejudice his application for federal habeas relief so that he could \u201cseek appropriate relief under the Texas Constitution.\u201d Since both parties now \u201caffirmatively desire the same result, no justiciable case is presented,\u201d and we must dismiss the case for lack of a case or controversy. 13 C.

Estelle, supra. </em>In <em>Carter v. Estelle, </em>677 F.2d 427, 452 n. 24 (5th Cir.), <em>modified, </em>691 F.2d 777 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 1508, 75 L.Ed.2d 937 (1983), we reaffirmed our holding that <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978), and <em>Greene v. Massey, </em>437 U.S. 19, 98 S.Ct. 2151, 57 L.Ed.2d 15 (1978), apply retroactively. In <em>French v.

We do not interpret the action of the Supreme Court in vacating our opinion in <em>Bullard </em>for the reason set forth in the Court\u2019s order, <em>see </em>text <em>infra, </em>as undermining the validity of our decisions in <em>Carter </em>and <em>French. See </em>note 5, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">. In <em>Mills, supra, </em>the state law questions were presumably before the federal court as claims pendent to the exercise of federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and in <em>Aladdin\u2019s Castle, supra, </em>the court had diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, over the state law claims. <em>Aladdin\u2019s Castle, Inc. v. City of Mesquite, </em>630 F.2d 1029, 1035-36 &amp; n. 12 (5th Cir.1980). In contrast to cases brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1332, relief on state law grounds is not available to a petitioner in federal habeas proceedings. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); <em>Engle v.
