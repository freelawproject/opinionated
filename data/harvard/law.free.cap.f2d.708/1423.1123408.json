(\u201cCGP\u201d) to purchase from the Burns &amp; Russell Company (\u201cB &amp; R\u201d) all the ingredients needed to make finished masonry blocks constitutes an unlawful tying arrangement in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury found that an unlawful tying arrangement existed and awarded damages to CGP for losses stemming from the tying arrangement. Because we conclude that no tying arrangement exists in this case, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-20\">B &amp; R is a small Baltimore company which makes glazed masonry blocks. One of its employees, John Sergovic, a polymer chemist, with others, invented a patented process for baking a tinted, glazed face on a masonry block and developed the secret compounds used in that process. B &amp; R owns three registered trademarks: (1) \u201cSpectra-Glaze,\u201d which identifies the secret compound used in making glazed masonry blocks; (2) \u201cSpectra-Glaze,\" which identifies the finished masonry block; and (3) \u201cS-G Sand,\u201d which is the filler used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>making the \u201cSpectra-Glaze\u201d facing. B &amp; R also owns U.S. Letters Patent Nos. 3,328,-231 and 4,031,289, which explain how to glaze a masonry block with a smooth, stain-resistant facing and how to make the finished product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-4\">The main ingredients used to make the facing of a Spectra-Glaze block<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are Spectra-Glaze Compound,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> S-G Sand,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> S-G Colors,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and fire retardant. These materials have been improved, tested, and refined over a period of years to develop a facing for masonry blocks that is resistant to staining, cracking, and discoloration. These blocks are available in 48 standard colors, come in a number of different scores, designs, and textures, and can be used to construct interior or exterior walls.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-5\">On March 7,1958, CGP signed two agreements with B &amp; R allowing it to manufacture and sell the Spectra-Glaze line of masonry blocks. The first, a patent license agreement, allowed CGP to use any patent owned by B &amp; R for a two percent royalty. The term of the patent license agreement was for the life of the patents, and it did not require CGP to do or buy anything. The second agreement, the trademark license, authorized CGP to sell glazed blocks under the trademark Spectra-Glaze, but only if the blocks were glazed with Spectra-Glaze Compound. Under the trademark license, CGP agreed to purchase all its requirements needed to make the Spectra-Glaze facing from B &amp; R. The term of the trademark agreement was 20 years, and after the first year, CGP could terminate it on 60 days\u2019 notice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1483-12\">Under these agreements, B &amp; R furnished CGP formulas for combining the ingredients used in making Spectra-Glaze facing. B &amp; R also furnished technical manuals and extensive technical assistance to CGP when problems arose or technical advice was needed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> B &amp; R also provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>marketing assistance and had an \u201cAdvisory Committee\u201d to decide on how to advertise the Spectra-Glaze line. B &amp; R provided CGP with sales and management support, including regular bulletins of market conditions and sales prospects, advertising material, sales aids, and sales training seminars. B &amp; R commissioned independent laboratory tests to determine the quality of its product. With the exception of advertising, these services and others were provided to CGP at no charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-4\">From the outset, CGP\u2019s business was unsuccessful, in part because of the adverse effect of California building codes, business slumps, and strikes in the construction industry.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On March 7, 1978, CGP requested and was granted an extension of the trademark license. B &amp; R attempted to help CGP by furnishing it new materials on consignment. Indeed, the defendant avers that the plaintiff remained in business only because the defendant was willing to act as its banker. On May 31, 1979, CGP notified B &amp; R that it would terminate its contract because of technical and sales difficulties. CGP went out of business in June 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-5\">During the 20-plus years of the parties\u2019 relationship, CGP had never advised B &amp; R that it did not want to buy from B &amp; R, or that CGP wanted to buy from someone else, or that CGP wanted any change in the relationship. Instead, on March 7, 1978, when the 20-year term of the trademark license expired, CGP requested that the license be extended for two additional years with an evergreen provision for additional two-year periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-10\">CGP brought a suit against B &amp; R alleging that the agreements between CGP and B &amp; R constituted an illegal tying arrangement. CGP\u2019s contention at trial was that B &amp; R unlawfully tied the sale of its Spectra-Glaze trademark for glazed, masonry blocks to the sale of the materials required to make Spectra-Glaze facing. CGP alleged that B &amp; R overcharged CGP for these materials.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> B &amp; R counterclaimed for money due on patent royalties, a promissory note, and an open book account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-11\">CGP and B &amp; R agreed that CGP owed $12,866.36 on the promissory note and $18,-750 on the patent royalties claim, and the jury was instructed to return a verdict in these amounts on these claims. The jury found that $4,444.28 was due on the open book account and awarded CGP $51,787.27 on its claim for overcharge damages. The court added interest of $4,745.93 to the amount of unpaid patent royalties. After trebling the damages and offsetting the amounts owed to B &amp; R, the district court awarded $114,575.24 to CGP. The district court denied B &amp; R\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-12\">The defendant appeals on the ground that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, and that there is no substantial evidence to support a reasonable jury\u2019s finding that there was an unlawful tying arrangement which caused damage to CGP. B &amp; R contends also that if a tying arrange<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>ment existed, it was lawful and justifiable. Finally, B &amp; R contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the award for damages. CGP argues that these issues involved factual determinations appropriate for jury resolution and that the jury properly found the existence of an illegal tie-in.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-4\">In deciding whether to reverse the district court\u2019s refusal to grant B &amp; R\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v., this court must determine whether the evidence when viewed most favorably to the party against whom the motion is directed cannot support a verdict in that party\u2019s favor. <em>See Traver v. Meshriy, </em>627 F.2d 934, 939-40 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Quichocho v. Kelvinator Corp., </em>546 F.2d 812, 813 (9th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-6\">Tying arrangements traditionally have been treated as per se illegal under Section 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 14 (1976). <em>See Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., </em>394 U.S. 495, 498-99, 89 S.Ct. 1252, 1258-1259, 22 L.Ed.2d 495, 502-03 (1969) (Fortner I).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A tying arrangement exists when a seller conditions a buyer\u2019s purchase of a desired product (tying product) on the buyer\u2019s agreement to purchase another product (tied product). <em>Northern Pac. Ry. v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S.Ct. 514, 518, 2 L.Ed.2d 545, 550 (1958). To prevail on a tying claim, a plaintiff must show that the scheme involves two separate products and conditions the purchase of the tying product on the purchase of the tied product; that the seller possesses sufficient economic power in the tying market to restrain competition in the tied product market; and that a \u201cnot insubstantial\u201d amount of commerce is affected by the tie-in. <em>Fortner I, </em>394 U.S. at 499, 89 S.Ct. 1252, 1258, 22 L.Ed.2d 495, 502 (1969). <em>Hirsh v. Martindale-Hubbell, Inc., </em>674 F.2d 1343, 1346-47 (9th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 305, 74 L.Ed.2d 285 (1982); <em>Siegel v. Chicken Delight, Inc., </em>448 F.2d 43 (9th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 955, 92 S.Ct. 1172, 31 L.Ed.2d 232 (1972). This court has said that plaintiffs must show \u201csome modicum of coercion\u201d to establish a tie-in. <em>Moore v. James H. Matthews &amp; Co., </em>550 F.2d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-12\">In a tie-in case the first issue to be determined is whether two separate products exist that are tied together. The two products allegedly tied in this case are the Spectra-Glaze trademark and the ingredients used to make Spectra-Glaze blocks. CGP contends that the jury properly determined that the Spectra-Glaze trademark was the tying product B &amp; R used to force CGP to buy Spectra-Glaze Compound and other ingredients from B &amp; R.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> B &amp; R <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>argues that, as a matter of law, the Spectra-Glaze trademark was not a separate tying product from the ingredients and the finished masonry block which the trademark identifies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-4\">This Court recently has considered the issue whether a trademark can be a separate tying product from the products it represents.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Krehl v. Baskin-Robbins lee Cream Co., </em>664 F.2d 1348 (9th Cir.1982), decided after the judgment was rendered in the district court in the instant case, we found that the determination \u201cwhether a trademark may appropriately be regarded as a separate product requires an inquiry into the relationship between the trademark and the products allegedly tied to its sale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1353. The <em>Krehl </em>Court distinguished between two kinds of franchising systems, the business format system and the distribution system, to determine if a trademark is a separate, tying product. The distinction is used to determine whether a producer\u2019s offerings are in response to independently structured consumer demand or are molded merely to force purchasers to buy component parts that they do not necessarily want. <em>See Klamath-Lake Pharmaceutical Association v. Klamath Medical Service Bureau, </em>701 F.2d 1276, 1289 &amp; fn. 14 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-8\">The <em>Krehl </em>Court explained that a business format franchise system is usually created merely to conduct business under a common trade name:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1486-9\">The franchise outlet itself is generally responsible for the production and preparation of the system\u2019s end product. The franchisor merely provides the trademark and, in some cases, supplies used in operating the franchised outlet and producing the system\u2019s products. Under such a system, there is generally only a remote connection between the trademark and the products the franchisees are compelled to purchase. This is true because consumers have no reason to associate with the trademark, those component goods used either in the operation of the franchised store or in the manufacture of the end product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1486-10\">664 F.2d at 1353. In the business format system, consumers seek only the general services of franchisees, and franchisees can satisfy consumer demand by using \u201ccommonplace\u201d items and applying the franchisor\u2019s general methods. In the business format context, the trademark is separate from the component goods because consumer demand can be satisfied with component goods not associated with the trademark.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number><em>See Klamath-Lake Pharm., </em>701 F.2d at 1289 n. 14; <em>Krehl, </em>664 F.2d at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-4\">When a distribution system franchise is involved, however, the considerations change:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1487-5\">Under the distribution type system, the franchised outlets serve merely as conduits through which the trademarked goods of the franchisor flow to the ultimate consumer. These goods are generally manufactured by the franchisor or, as in the present case, by its licensees according to detailed specifications. In this context, the trademark serves a different function. Instead of identifying a business format, the trademark in a distribution franchise system serves merely as a representation of the end product marketed by the system.... Because the prohibition of tying arrangements is designed to strike solely at the use of a dominant <em>desired </em>product to compel the purchase of a second undesired commodity. .., the tie-in doctrine can have no application where the trademark serves only to identify the alleged tied product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a1f-dedup-0\"><em>Krehl, </em>664 F.2d at 1354 (footnotes and citations omitted). In a distributor franchise, consumers are drawn to the franchise because its trademark indicates the availability of the franchisor\u2019s quality component products, and consumers could not effectuate their market choices if a franchisor was unable to force the franchisee to buy component products from the franchisor.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Klamath-Lake Pharm., </em>701 F.2d at 1290 n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-6\">B &amp; R contends that its arrangement with CGP is clearly a distribution franchise system and that its trademark indicates the presence of B &amp; R\u2019s quality components in the end product of the franchising system. We agree. The evidence at trial showed that the \u201cSpectra-Glaze\u201d brand block trademark always identified a product made with Spectra-Glaze Compound and B &amp; R\u2019s other ingredients, that these ingredients originated from B &amp; R, and that consumers purchased these goods with the understanding that they were made with the B &amp; R quality components. \u201cSpectra-Glaze\u201d brochures emphasized that Spectra-Glaze blocks were made of Spectra-Glaze components, and numerous major purchasers of Spectra-Glaze would not buy the product unless B &amp; R certified that Spectra-Glaze brand ingredients were used in its formulation. Builders using Spectra-Glaze blocks depend on purchasing blocks that met the specifications and qualities for which B &amp; R had tested Spectra-Glaze, and they were drawn to the franchisee\u2019s product because the Spectra-Glaze trademark indicates the availability of B &amp; R\u2019s quality component products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-9\">Other considerations support B <em>&amp; </em>R\u2019s contention that its franchising arrangements are of the distribution type. B &amp; R did not force CGP to buy component goods that were not essential to maintaining the quality of its end product. For example, franchisees could purchase concrete blocks from any available source. The only goods that CGP had to buy from B &amp; R involved B &amp; R\u2019s trade secrets and \u201cwere of a special design uniquely suited to the franchised business.\u201d <em>Krehl, </em>664 F.2d at 1352. In addition, B &amp; R never has sold the trademark separate from the final product and component products upon which it appears. These facts show that the function of the Spectra-Glaze trademark is to identify the presence of a glazed masonry block made up of the specially-formulated, thoroughly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>tested, high quality component parts rather than to indicate a product manufactured in conformity to a franchisor\u2019s quality standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-4\">We conclude that the desirability of the trademark and the quality of B &amp; R\u2019s components represented by the trademark are inextricably interrelated in the consumer\u2019s mind in a manner that precludes finding that the trademark is a separate item for tie-in purposes. B &amp; R\u2019s franchising system is designed to distribute to consumers the high quality, glazed masonry block that users of this product have come to expect. The structure of B &amp; R\u2019s franchising system does not indicate any attempt to exact tribute from CGP in an anti-competitive manner. The Spectra-Glaze trademark serves to show the source of the goods purchased, and the goodwill of the trademark attaches to the products made for or by B &amp; R. Thus, we conclude that the nexus between the Spectra-Glaze trademark and the allegedly tied products is so close that they must be considered one product. <em>See Ham-ro v. Shell Oil Co., </em>674 F.2d 784, 788 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-5\">We hold that the district court erred in not granting B &amp; R\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Viewing the entire evidence in the light most favorable to CGP, we conclude that no tying arrangement exists because there was no showing that the Spectra-Glaze trademark and the various ingredients used to make Spectra-Glaze were separate products capable of being tied. We reverse the judgment in favor of CGP and remand the case to the district court to enter judgment in favor of B &amp; R on the tying claim.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1482-13\">. Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part, \u201cEvery contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (1976).

The Spectra-Glaze block is a concrete block onto which a glazed finish has been baked. This process is explained in the Joint Pretrial Statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1483-7\">11. The type of coated, glazed masonry unit referred to in the defendant\u2019s patents is manufactured by applying a slurry to a concrete block and passing the block through an oven, which causes the coating to solidify. In formulating the slurry and determining the manufacturing process, the object is to obtain an end product in which there is bonded to the block an attractive, smooth surface, tinted to a desired color, which is easy to clean, withstands various staining agents, chemicals and temperature changes, and meets various other specifications including limits on smoke generation and flame spread. The manufacturing process involved is inflexible and unforgiving, and the ingredients employed in the slurry are critical if a proper end product is to be achieved.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1483-8\">.

The rationale for proscribing tie-ins is that they deny competitors free access to the tied product market, \u201cnot because the party imposing the tying requirements has a better product or a lower price but because of his power or leverage in another market.\u201d <em>Fortner I, </em>394 U.S. at 498-99, 89 S.Ct. at 1256, 22 L.Ed.2d at 502. Tie-ins also harm buyers by forcing them to forego their free choice between competing products. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 89 S.Ct. at 1256-1257, 22 L.Ed.2d at 502. Many commentators, however, have criticized the application of the per se illegal label to tie-ins, especially in the franchising context.

CGP argues that the tying product in this case was not just the trademark, but the trademark and the patent. The district court disagreed and instructed the jury that the only possible tying product was the trademark. The district court properly determined that the patent was not the tying product. The patent agreement was separate from the trademark agreement, and in fact, B &amp; R had a licensee that operated under the patent without the trademark. The patent agreement required CGP to buy nothing; the trademark agreement required CGP to buy ingredients from the defendant. The trademark agreement could also be terminated on 60 days notice without affecting CGP\u2019s rights under the patent agreement.

The franchise arrangement in <em>Siegel v. Chicken Delight, Inc., </em>448 F.2d 43 (9th Cir. 1971), is an example of the business format system. In exchange for the use of its trademark, Chicken Delight required its franchisees to purchase a specified number of cookers and fryers and to purchase certain packaging supplies and mixes exclusively from Chicken Delight at above market prices. The Court examined this franchising system and determined that its purpose was not to distribute the trademarked goods of the franchisor, but to conduct a certain business under a common trademark or trade name. In these circumstances, the trademark simply reflects the goodwill and quality standards of the enterprise which it identifies. The quality standards and business system of Chicken Delight, rather than the source of the component products, resulted in the goodwill that attached to the Chicken Delight trademark. The <em>Chicken Delight </em>Court properly concluded that the remote connection between the trademark and the commonplace articles the franchisees were required to purchase warranted treating the trademark as a separate tying product.

Franchisees argued that Baskin-Robbins\u2019s policy of conditioning the grant of a franchise on the purchase of ice cream exclusively from Baskin-Robbins constituted an unlawful tying agreement between the Baskin-Robbins trademark and the ice cream. The Court found that Baskin-Robbins franchisees serve merely as conduits through which the trademarked goods flow to the consumer and classified the franchise system as a distribution-type system. In this context, the trademark represents the end product made up of quality Baskin-Robbins\u2019s ingredients rather than a particular business format, and the Court held that the trademark and the product were intertwined in a way that precluded them from being treated as separate products. <em>See Hirsh v. Martindale-Hubbell, Inc., </em>674 F.2d 1343 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Hamro v. Shell Oil Co., </em>674 F.2d 784 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1488-7\">.
