Henry, </em>447 U.S. 264, 100 S.Ct. 2183, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980). The district court denied a petition for federal habeas corpus based upon the sixth amendment claim. We agree with the district court that the facts of this case are distinguishable in critical respects from those in <em>Henry </em>and that they lie beyond the sixth amendment protections defined and applied in that ease. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">On June 2, 1979, Thomas was arrested and charged with the murder of his girlfriend\u2019s mother, Rosa Annette Stout, who during the preceding evening had been strangled with a shoelace and run over with a car. Thomas was incarcerated in the Goochland County Jail, where he became acquainted in late August with Charles Gregory, who was serving a three-year sentence, with two years and three months suspended, for auto theft. During the following several weeks, Thomas made a series of statements, some in response to questions posed by Gregory and others in the course of general conversation, that incriminated him in the murder of Mrs. Stout. For example, when Gregory observed that he had heard that the victim of the crime for which Thomas had been charged had been strangled, raped and run over with a car, Thomas replied, \u201cI did not rape her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">In early or mid-November, when Gregory was in court on a sentencing matter, he encountered Leslie Parrish, an investigator for the sheriff\u2019s office. When Gregory asked about the disposition of Thomas\u2019s case, Parrish informed Gregory that the Thomas trial had been postponed. Gregory observed, \u201cI know he\u2019s guilty ... just from the things he\u2019s said,\u201d and then related several of Thomas\u2019s earlier, self-incriminating statements. Both Gregory and Parrish later testified that Gregory did not agree to furnish the Commonwealth with additional information, and Gregory further testified that he declined Parrish\u2019s invitation to talk to the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Approximately a week later, when Gregory again was required to appear in court on his own behalf, he met with Thomas Snead, a state police investigator who had been informed by Parrish that Gregory possessed information helpful to the Commonwealth\u2019s case against Thomas. At this meeting, Gregory showed Snead a single sheet of paper on which Gregory had handwritten a list of Thomas\u2019s damaging admissions. Snead testified that he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aab\">instructed [Gregory] not to go back to the jail and ask any questions, but if [Gregory] did hear of anything else to let [him] know .... But specifically [Gregory] was instructed ... not to ask [Thomas] any questions ... but to be alert to anything [Thomas] might say.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">Snead further testified that he told Gregory that no promises could be made for his help, that Gregory was neither offered, nor asked for, anything from Snead, and that the gist of the conversation was \u201cif you [Gregory] want to give us the information that\u2019s fine, if not, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">When Gregory returned to the Goochland jail, he again had the opportunity to converse with the petitioner, who made over twelve additional self-incriminating statements to Gregory. Included in this series of statements to Gregory were several direct admissions of guilt. Illustrative of the nature of petitioner\u2019s statements are two replies to observations made by Gregory: \u201cYeah, I killed her and I bet I will get off scott free [sic],\u201d and \u201cI killed somebody and I ain\u2019t carrying any dead woman on my back.\u201d Gregory continued recording Thom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>as\u2019s comments on scraps of paper until he was released on parole in December of 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">At Thomas\u2019s trial, the Commonwealth sought to have Gregory testify as to the approximately 25 self-incriminating statements made by Thomas. The state trial judge held a hearing to determine if the Commonwealth had, through Gregory, elicited the damaging evidence from Thomas in violation of his sixth amendment right to counsel, as that protection had been interpreted by this court in <em>Henry v. United States</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At this hearing Gregory explained that his motivation for collecting information from Thomas, as well as from other prisoners, was curiosity, and that he did not decide until three days after his release from prison to cooperate with the Commonwealth. Officers Snead and Parrish corroborated Thomas\u2019s testimony, and the trial judge found that Gregory was \u201ca self-initiated informant, moved by conscious [sic],\u201d that he was not a \u201cgovernment agent,\u201d and that the Commonwealth had therefore not violated the principle established in <em>Henry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Gregory then testified before the jury, which found Thomas guilty of the first degree murder of Rosa Annette Stout on February 18, 1980. Arguing that the Commonwealth had unconstitutionally interfered with his right to counsel, Thomas appealed his conviction to the Virginia Supreme Court, which dismissed his Petition for Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Thomas then sought federal habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied the relief on the basis that the Commonwealth\u2019s actions did not run afoul of the principle announced in <em>Henry, </em>because Gregory was not under the control of the Commonwealth and had made no agreement to cooperate with them in their investigation or prosecution of Thomas. Moreover, the court found as fact \u2014 against petitioner\u2019s allegation \u2014 that the Commonwealth had not placed Gregory near Thomas in the Goochland jail and concluded from all this that no agent of the Commonwealth had \u201cset a scheme in motion\u201d to deprive Thomas of his right to counsel. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">In <em>Henry, </em>the Court held that the government violated an incarcerated defendant\u2019s right to counsel by intentionally placing a paid, undercover government informant in close proximity to the defendant and instructing the informant \u201cnot to initiate\u201d any conversations with the defendant but \u201cto be alert\u201d to any statements he might make regarding the crime for which he was charged. In holding that the government had \u201cdeliberately elicited\u201d incriminating statements from the defendant in violation of the proscription of <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964), the Court relied on three factors: that the inmate witness was a paid informant acting on instructions from the government, that the informant was ostensibly no more than a fellow inmate of the defendant, and that the defendant was in custody and under indictment at the time he incriminated himself. <em>Henry, </em>447 U.S. at 270, 100 S.Ct. at 2186.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-13\">The petitioner argues that the same considerations that guided the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Henry, </em>except for the fact that Gregory was an unpaid informant while the inmate witness in <em>Henry </em>worked for a fee, are present in this case as well. Indeed, as the Commonwealth concedes, the similarities between the two cases are quite close and readily apparent. Like the inmate witness in <em>Henry, </em>Gregory gathered much of his information after having received practically identical \u201cinstructions\u201d from the government, and appeared to be no more than a fellow inmate of the defendant who, at the time he incriminated himself, was in custody and under indictment. And we agree with petitioner that whether the Commonwealth violated Thomas\u2019s right to counsel cannot, on this record, turn solely on the fact that Gregory was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>not <em>monetarily </em>rewarded for his efforts. <em>See United States v. Sampol, </em>686 F.2d 621, 638 (D.C.Cir.1980) (reward of staying free on probation).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">But there are also critical differences in the two situations. They relate essentially to the nature of the relationship between the state and the inmate witness, hence to the question whether the actions of the inmate witnesses in the two cases can properly be attributed to the state.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In <em>Henry, </em>the Court considered it critical that the informant,- previously in the government\u2019s paid employ in similar missions, was specifically contacted by the government and given his charge respecting the procurement of possibly incriminating information from Henry. Also important to the <em>Henry </em>Court was the fact that the informant\u2019s mission was on a \u201ccontingent-fee\u201d basis, <em>Henry, </em>447 U.S. at 270,100 S.Ct. at 2187, thereby demonstrating a formal \u201cprearrangement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 273, 100 S.Ct. at 2188, between state and informant (as well as encouraging an active rather than merely passive role for the latter in eliciting inculpatory information). From these circumstances the Court in <em>Henry </em>was able to characterize the informant as a \u201cGovernment agent expressly commissioned to secure evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 273, 100 S.Ct. at 2188, from the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">By contrast, as determined by the state trial judge, whose factual findings are entitled to a presumption of correctness when, as here, none of the enumerated exceptions to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) exists, <em>see Sumner v. Mata, </em>455 U.S. 591, 102 S.Ct. 1303, 71 L.Ed.2d 480 (1982), the inmate witness Gregory in the present case was a \u201cself-initiated informant\u201d who was \u201cmotivated by conscience\u201d in initiating the contact and carrying through his proffer of assistance. And the district court further determined, looking solely to the state court record,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Gregory was at no time subject to the control of the Commonwealth, had made no prior \u201carrangement\u201d with the Commonwealth to procure information from or testify against the accused, and had \u201cnothing to gain\u201d from his actions vis-a-vis the accused, having been promised no reward, nor having any reason created by the Commonwealth to anticipate any. <em>Cf. United States </em>v. <em>Sampol, </em>636 F.2d 621 (D.C. Cir.1980) (continued freedom on probation contingent upon service as informant). Indeed, it is apparently not disputed that, as Gregory testified, he in fact served his entire sentence for auto theft.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>So far as this record discloses, for whatever reason Gregory acted \u2014 whether \u201cconscience,\u201d as the state court found, or \u201ccuriosity,\u201d as he testified, or even conceivably from an unencouraged hope to curry favor, <em>see United States v. Malik, </em>680 F.2d 1162, 1164-65 (7th Cir.1982) \u2014 he could not properly be characterized, as could the informant in <em>Henry, </em>as \u201ca Government agent expressly commissioned to secure evidence.\u201d <em>Henry, </em>447 U.S. at 273, 100 S.Ct. at 2188. For this reason we do not believe that \u2014 as both this court and the Supreme Court could and did conclude in the <em>Henry </em>situation \u2014 the conduct of this inmate witness in procuring evidence is fairly \u201cattributable to the Government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 100 S.Ct. at 2187.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">For sixth amendment protections to be violated through \u201csurreptitious interrogations,\u201d <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 206, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 1203, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964), of accused persons by private citizen informers, there must have been a \u201cdeliberate[] elicitfation]\u201d of evidence by government through the medium of the informer, <em>id. </em>Whether there may ever be \u201cdeliberate elicitation\u201d on the part of government when its informer, though \u201cplanted,\u201d is wholly passive, is a question now expressly left open by the Supreme Court, <em>see Henry, </em>447 U.S. at 271 n. 9,100 S.Ct. at 2187 n. 9.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But where the citizen himself actively, though surreptitiously, elicits disclosures, the only question is whether at the critical time he was also a creature \u2014 an agent<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 of the state. If so, his deliberate elicitation of evidence is necessarily attributable to the state as would be that of a state official.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">The point at which agency \u2014 hence proper attribution \u2014 for this purpose arises out of a government-citizen relationship is not subject to any bright-line test. But we think a general benchmark can be derived from <em>Henry, </em>where the agency question did figure in the Court\u2019s factual analysis. <em>See supra </em>note 2. <em>See also United States v. Malik, </em>680 F.2d 1162 (7th Cir.1982); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>States v. Van Scoy, </em>654 F.2d 257 (3d Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>454 U.S. 1126, 102 S.Ct. 977, 71 L.Ed.2d 114 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">As we read <em>Henry, </em>the relationship between state and informer in that case must approach or reach the outer limits of the relationship required to \u201cattribute\u201d to the state the private citizen\u2019s conduct as \u201csurreptitious interrogator.\u201d <em>See Henry, </em>447 U.S. at 270, 100 S.Ct. at 2187 (inmate witness acting \u201cunder instructions as a paid informant\u201d). Certainly well beyond those limits must be the myriad situations in which a casual prior encounter \u2014 by whomever initiated \u2014 between prison inmate and state official results in a simple admonition by the latter, with no express or implicit <em>quid pro quo </em>undergirding it, to \u201ckeep your ears\u201d open or \u201clisten but don\u2019t ask\u201d or the like. We need not attempt to define exactly where on the spectrum of situations the actual limits of sixth amendment protections lie to hold narrowly, as we do, that the relationship here lies much nearer the latter pattern, and beyond the limits generally implied in <em>Henry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We decline to find in the inmate-police encounter here the requisite degree of \u201cprearrangement\u201d or \u201congoing cooperation\u201d between state and witness required to implicate the state and thereby to invoke sixth amendment protections. <em>See United States v. Calder, </em>641 F.2d 76, 78-79 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 912, 101 S.Ct. 1984, 68 L.Ed.2d 302 (1981). To do so would be in practical effect to establish the principle that any voluntary proffer of inmate informer assistance not met with silence or actually repudiated by state officials would make inadmissible any inculpatory disclosures arguably induced by the circumstances of confinement that are subsequently made by an accused in conversations with the inmate. <em>See Henry, </em>447 U.S. at 273-74, 100 S.Ct. at 2188. We do not believe that <em>Henry </em>implied this, nor that the sixth amendment\u2019s protection of the right to effective assistance of counsel was intended to reach so far.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\">. The trial judge had available to him only our opinion in <em>Henry v. United States, </em>590 F.2d 544 (4th Cir.1978), before its affirmance in <em>United States v. Henry, </em>447 U.S. 264, 100 S.Ct. 2183, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-6\">. In none of the three principal decisions of the Supreme Court that define the reach of sixth .amendment protections against government\u2019s \u201cdeliberate elicitation\u201d' of incriminating evidence from accused persons unaccompanied by <em>counsel</em>\u2014Massiah <em>v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964); <em>Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977); and <em>United States v. Henry, </em>447 U.S. 264, 100 S.Ct. 2183, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980) \u2014 has the \u201cagency\u201d of the person directly eliciting the evidence been the focal point of inquiry. But in each the necessity of such a relationship has been assumed. In <em>Massiah, </em>the direct eliciter was a \u201cturncoat codefendant\u201d under the immediate control of a federal officer, see <em>Henry, </em>447 U.S. at 279, 100 S.Ct. at 2191 (Blackmun, J., dissenting), and <em>de facto </em>\u201cagency\u201d of the private citizen in those circumstances was simply assumed. In <em>Brewer, </em>the direct \u201celiciter\u201d was a police officer, an official \u201cagent.\u201d Only in <em>Henry </em>was the \u201cagency\u201d of the direct eliciter \u2014 a private citizen as in <em>Massiah </em>\u2014potentially an arguable question. The <em>Henry </em>Court considered the matter of sufficient moment to require attention, but essentially assumed the existence of agency from the undisputed facts of prior employment on similar missions and a specific fee \u201carrangement\u201d for the mission at hand. <em>See Henry, </em>447 U.S. at 270, 100 S.Ct. at 2187.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-10\">. The district court\u2019s factual findings derive ample support from the state court record and are therefore neither erroneous under our independent reading of the record, <em>see Taylor v.

Principal points of difference between the majority, the concurring, and the two dissenting positions in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Henry </em>decision precisely concern the proper application of Massiah\u2019s \u201cdeliberate elicitation\u201d standard in the planted inmate informer context. Specifically, the main point of division would seem to be on the necessity that the informer be an active, though surreptitious, interrogator as opposed to a merely passive listening-post. The <em>Henry </em>majority was persuaded that on the facts of record, sufficiently active direct elicitation was involved to make it unnecessary to decide whether \u201cdeliberate\u201d governmental use of a passive human or mechanical \u201clistener\u201d could ever constitute \u201cdeliberate elicitation.\u201d <em>See Henry, </em>447 U.S. at 271-74, 100 S.Ct. at 2187-88 (emphasizing that \u201cconversations\u201d and not mere passive listening took place; that conversation was \u201cstimulated\u201d by prison context and susceptibility of inmates to \u201cploys of undercover .. . agents\u201d). Justice Powell, concurring, was concerned that the holding be expressly limited to such instances of active elicitation, and opined that neither the use of passive listening devices nor of passive human informers could constitute \u201cdeliberate elicitation\u201d by Government. <em>See id. </em>at 276, 100 S.Ct. at 2191 (Powell, J., concurring). Justice Black-mun, dissenting, thought that \u201cdeliberate elicitation\u201d in this context could only apply to actions of government officials \u201cundertaken with the specific intent to evoke an inculpatory disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, 100 S.Ct. at 2189 (Black-mun, J., dissenting). On the facts of the case, principally that the police officer who \u201cinstructed\u201d the informer expressly directed that he not actively elicit information, Justice Black-mun thought the <em>Massiah </em>standard of deliberate elicitation had not been met. Justice Rehnquist, dissenting, thought first that <em>Massiah </em>should no longer in general be applied to this general form of surreptitious interrogation. Beyond this, he thought the facts did not support a finding of deliberate elicitation under <em>Massiah, </em>properly interpreted. In particular, the mere initiation of conversation by a fellow inmate should not constitute the \u201cdeliberate elicitation\u201d of any incriminatory disclosures that ensue. <em>Id. </em>at 302, 100 S.Ct. at 2203 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b216-13\">.
