After holding that the INS District Directors had not abused their discretion in denying Yiu Sing Chun and Jee-Chiu Shan, two young men from the People\u2019s Republic of China, asylum status under the Refugee Act of 1980, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1101(a)(42)(A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Joseph M. McLaughlin, Judge, 550 F.Supp. 90, held that they were not entitled to an exclusion hearing because they were stowaways and, as such, denied procedural rights by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1323(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reverse the second holding and remand to the agency for a hearing at which Chun and Shan will be entitled to renew their request for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The facts may be briefly stated. Yiu Sing Chun and Jee-Chiu Shan illegally left the People\u2019s Republic of China by swimming from Canton to Hong Kong and then stowed away on the \u201cAmerican Lark\u201d bound for Oakland, California, and New York. When they were discovered after the vessel was underway, or as they state, when they presented themselves to the crew, they identified themselves as refugees seeking political asylum. The Captain placed them in detention and notified INS. When the ship arrived in California, each filed a Form 1-589 applying for asylum. A Chinese-speaking employee of the shipping line, who neither was a lawyer nor spoke English well, helped Chun and Shan corn-p\u00edete the forms. Chun\u2019s form indicated that he would face a jail sentence because of his illegal departure and that he had been \u201cpersecuted\u201d at school after speaking out \u201cagainst the working class condition during political class discussion, and compare [sic] them with the Western Free world\u201d; it also noted that his father was a businessman, a social class \u201cgenerally oppressed and sneered upon.\u201d Shan\u2019s 1-589 claimed he could not tolerate the Communist society, and that having spoken out against the Communist system he had been sent \u201cto the farms for hard labor\u201d; and that since his grandparents were property owners, \u201cwe belong to a social class that is generally oppressed and sneered upon.\u201d The INS San Francisco District Director, in accordance with the asylum application regulations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> referred the applications to the Asylum Division, Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, Department of State (BHRHA), which took the view that the applicants \u201chad not established a well-founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.\u201d The BHRHA gave the following reason for its conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>The applicant has not been persecuted in the past in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). PRC officials have adopted a rather permissive attitude toward emigration, legal and illegal. The typical penalty imposed for violations of Article 176, Section 6 of Chinese Criminal Law (illegal departure) is fifteen days detention. The maximum penalty, in serious cases, is one year which, in the unlikely event it were imposed, would constitute prosecution and not persecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The District Director denied the requests for asylum. His written decision of July 20, 1982, noted no allegations in the application form of prior persecution of the men or their families, and no credible testimony of a well-founded fear of persecution in the interviews by an immigration officer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He concluded that neither Chun nor Shan qualified as a \u201crefugee\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), note 2 <em>supra, </em>and found them statutorily ineligible for asylum. Further, because they did not apply for refugee status at the office of the American Consulate General in Hong Kong, he found them unworthy of a favorable exercise of the Attorney General\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">While their applications were considered the petitioners were confined on the \u201cAmerican Lark,\u201d en route to New York by way of Panama and Savannah, Georgia, where Chun and Shan were served with the San Francisco District Director\u2019s decision. Two days after the New York arrival, with the assistance of counsel, both Chun and Shan filed new applications for asylum and supporting documents which are perhaps inconsistent in two or three particulars with the first application, but which elaborate extensively their reasons for leaving the People\u2019s Republic and what they fear would happen to them if they returned.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioners were taken off the \u201cAmerican Lark\u201d and placed in the Immigration Detention Facility in Brooklyn. INS forwarded the updated applications to the BHRHA for a second advisory opinion, but did not conduct a second interview. The State Department recommendation merely reiterated the recommendation made to the INS District Director in San Francisco. We note that the petitioners, contrary to applicable regulations,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> apparently had no opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>rebut at a hearing the points made by the BHRHA. The District Director in New York, adopting the State Department\u2019s recommendation, denied the second applications for asylum without elaboration and ordered the petitioners excluded. Upon receipt of notice of the New York District Director\u2019s decision, Chun and Shan filed habeas corpus petitions challenging INS procedures in the adjudication of their asylum applications, as well as the INS denial of temporary parole status.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">After Judge McLaughlin upheld the INS Director\u2019s discretionary denial of asylum and parole, Chun and Shan brought a contempt motion to require the INS to provide an exclusion hearing at which the men could renew their applications for asylum before a Special Inquiry Officer, to whom we shall refer as an immigration judge. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1(1). Judge McLaughlin concluded that the jurisdiction of the immigration judge was statutorily circumscribed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1323(d)\u2019s explicit denial of exclusion hearings to stowaways, and that the hearing requirement of the asylum regulations did not apply to stowaways.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We granted a stay of removal and repatriation to the People\u2019s Republic of China pending our decision in the appeal from both of Judge McLaughlin\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">The Refugee Act of 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102 (1980), was a response to the urgent needs of those subject to persecution in their homelands. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 101(a). We have characterized the Act as \u201cthe end product of an evolutionary process in the law of asylum.\u201d <em>Stevic v. Sava, </em>678 F.2d 401, 404 (2d Cir.1982), <em>cert. granted, </em>-U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 1249, 75 L.Ed.2d 479 (U.S.1983). In <em>Stevic </em>we traced the origins of the Refugee Act in pre-1968 asylum law, <em>id. </em>at 404-05, the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, <em>id. </em>at 405-06, and asylum law from 1968 to 1980, <em>id. </em>at 406-07, and the Refugee Act of 1980 itself, <em>id. </em>at 407-08. So far as is pertinent we will assume familiarity with the <em>Stevie </em>opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Of concern to us here is Congress\u2019s direction to the Attorney General to establish \u201ca new uniform asylum procedure\u201d that would be consistent with treaty obligations. H.Conf.Rep. No. 781, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 20 (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News. 160, 161. Thus, the Act required the Attorney General to \u201cestablish a procedure for an alien physically present in the United States or at a land border or port of entry, irrespective of such alien\u2019s status, to apply for asylum.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 1. The question before us is whether, under the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s regulations delineating \u201ca procedure ... to apply for asylum,\u201d the petitioners, arriving at a port of entry as stowaways, are entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge on the issue whether they are refugees within the meaning of the Act, and therefore entitled to asylum.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>The asylum procedure adopted by the Attorney General pursuant to the directive of the Refugee Act of 1980 is set forth, in 8 C.F.R. Part 208. There are five steps in the asylum procedure: preparation and filing of the application for asylum,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> examination in person by an immigration officer or judge,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> an advisory opinion from BHRHA,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a written decision of the District Director, which may not be appealed,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and renewal of the denied asylum request before an immigration judge in exclusion or deportation proceedings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> With just the foregoing in mind it would be plain that because the refugee asylum procedure applies, in the words of the statute, \u201cirrespective of such alien\u2019s status,\u201d and because the regulations promulgated by the Attorney General under the Act do not differentiate a stowaway from any other \u201capplicant for admission,\u201d petitioners are to be \u201cplaced under exclusion proceedings\u201d where they may renew their requests for asylum before an immigration judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">But the Government argues that, unlike other excludable aliens under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a), stowaways are not entitled to procedures provided other excludable aliens.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Government cites 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1323(d), which provides in part that \u201cthe provisions of section 1225 ... for detention of aliens for examination before special inquiry officers<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the right of appeal provided for in section 1226<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> ... shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>apply to aliens who arrive as stowaways.\u201d The effect of \u00a7 1323(d), the Government says, is not only to make a District Director\u2019s order of exclusion against a stowaway final, but also to make a District Director\u2019s denial of asylum to a stowaway final, as held under pre-1980 Act law. <em>See, e.g., Kordic v. Esperdy, </em>386 F.2d 232 (2d Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>392 U.S. 935, 88 S.Ct. 2301, 20 L.Ed.2d 1393 (1968). Although the INS concedes that the Refugee Act of 1980 requires the Director to establish uniform procedures for asylum applications \u201cirrespective of [an] alien\u2019s status,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a), it argues that the Act requires only that the actual application form and the procedure associated with a District Director\u2019s determination need be uniform. And although the INS regulations themselves do not distinguish between stowaways and other aliens in providing that an exclusion proceeding follows denial of an asylum request, 8 C.F.R. 208.8(f)(3), and that an asylum request may be renewed before an immigration judge in that proceeding, 8 C.F.R. 208.9, INS asks us to read into these regulations a qualifier: aliens whose asylum applications are denied may reassert their asylum claim in an exclusion hearing <em>only if they are entitled to such a hearing under other provisions of the Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">We are thus required to answer the Government\u2019s argument that, although a plain reading of the asylum application procedures grants Chun and Shan a hearing before an immigration judge, another statute removes that right because they are alien stowaways. The Government emphasizes and we are well aware of the presumption that a new, general statute does not generally effect an implicit repeal of an earlier, specific statute. <em>United States v. United Continental Tuna Corp., </em>425 U.S. 164, 169, 96 S.Ct. 1319, 1323, 47 L.Ed.2d 653 (1976). Rather, our duty is to give harmonious operation and effect to all statutory provisions if possible, absent some explicit indication of legislative intent derived from either the words of the statute or its legislative history. <em>See, e.g., Watt v. Alaska, </em>451 U.S. 259, 267, 101 S.Ct. 1673, 1677, 68 L.Ed.2d 80 (1981); <em>Morton v. Mancari, </em>417 U.S. 535, 549-51, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 2482-83, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974). We disagree with the Government\u2019s contention that \u00a7 1323(d) mandates that stowaways seeking asylum are entitled only to a District Director\u2019s determination on the asylum issue. We believe that the Refugee Act of 1980 and \u00a7 1323(d) can be harmonized by reading the refugee regulations \u2014 particularly 8 C.F.R. 208.9(f)(3) \u2014 to require a hearing before an immigration judge limited to the asylum issue for stowaways seeking admission as refugees.' We think that this result is not inconsistent with \u00a7 1323(d), and that it best accommodates congressional intent that the \u201cAttorney General ... establish a uniform procedure for passing upon an asylum application\u201d under the Refugee Act. S.Rep. No. 256, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 16, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 141, 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Despite the fact that Chun and Shan are stowaways, their procedural rights as asylum <em>applicants </em>derive from the Refugee Act of 1980. Section 1323(d) is a specific provision detailing the treatment afforded alien stowaways. This provision must be read in light of \u00a7 1182 which defines \u201cgeneral classes\u201d of \u201c[ejxcludable aliens.\u201d Although \u00a7 1182(a)(18) lists \u201c[a]liens who are stowaways\u201d as an excludable class, \u00a7 1182(a) contains a proviso stating that its definitions are applicable \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this chapter.\u201d The Refugee Act limits the effect of \u00a7 1323(d) by \u201cotherwise providpng]\u201d that aliens applying for asylum may do so \u201cirrespective of ... status.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a). Whatever procedural limitations \u00a7 1323(d) might impose in the absence of \u00a7 1158, we hold that these limitations are not applicable in the asylum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>context to the extent and only to the extent that an asylum determination is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">As we have noted above, INS regulations promulgated under the Refugee Act do not distinguish between stowaways and other aliens in providing for an exclusion hearing after the District Director has denied an asylum application, 8 C.F.R. 208.9, 208(f)(3), nor, read as a whole, does the agency\u2019s asylum procedure make any distinction among applicants for asylum.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nor do internal INS procedures (\u201cOperations Instructions\u201d) qualify in any way the generalization that an \u201calien shall be informed of his/her right to renew the asylum request ... in subsequent exclusion or deportation proceedings.\u201d INS O.I. 208.14, <em>reprinted in </em>4 C. Gordon &amp; H. Rosenfeld, Immigration Law and Procedure 23-156.20 (rev. ed. 1982). Indeed, in explaining the need for statutory and regulatory changes to prevent use of the \u201casylum process, with its attendant delays, as a convenient method to prolong an excludable or deportable alien\u2019s stay in the United States,\u201d an Acting Commissioner of the INS stated that \u201c[p]resent law and regulations permit a claim of asylum to be raised before a Service district director, and again before an immigration judge in the context of a deportation or exclusion hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We think it fair to infer what the regulations now require from the proposed changes. The Acting Commissioner\u2019s own example of the Mariel Boatlift refugees \u2014 many of whom were certainly stowaways \u2014 indicates that stowaways, like all other aliens, enjoy full procedural rights in applying for asylum.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">This agency guidance on the issue of aliens\u2019 procedural rights seems to support our interpretation of the regulations. An agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations, and the statute under which they are promulgated, is of course entitled to substantial deference. <em>See, e.g., Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 565, 100 S.Ct. 790, 796, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980). The INS makes a policy argument against our interpretation, however, that we do not lightly cast aside. Specifically, the INS maintains that because the regulations establish a procedure for applying for a refugee visa at a United States embassy in a foreign country, 8 C.F.R. Part 207, and applicants who are denied such visas are entitled to no further hearing, <em>see Van Shih Hsieh v. Kiley, </em>569 F.2d 1179, 1181 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 828, 99 S.Ct. 102, 58 L.Ed.2d 121 (1978), stowaways who bypass our embassy should not be afforded any different or greater procedural protection. To do so, it is said, would encourage people to stow away rather than to follow established procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Whether the intricacies of American immigration law would be known or have any effect on a prospective refugee is speculative. In any event, Congress itself distinguished aliens present in the United States or \u201cat a land border or port of entry\u201d and other refugees. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a), 1157(c).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The policy argument urged by INS highlights a bit of a logical anomaly, but we view it as simply another example of different patterns woven into the same legislative tapestry. In short, we are distracted by it, but not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">We conclude that the Refugee Act of 1980\u2019s asylum procedures and \u00a7 1323(d) can be reconciled by allowing stowaways a hearing limited to the asylum claim, followed by whatever other procedural rights other asylum applicants are afforded. Because the hearing we require will be limited solely to the issue of asylum eligibility, we preserve the basic thrust of \u00a7 1323(d)\u2019s command that stowaways are not entitled to exclusion hearings. As stowaways, the petitioners are entitled to nothing more; as asylum seekers at our border, they are entitled to nothing less. The name the proceeding goes by is immaterial. The Government, of course, argues that the approach we take here works a repeal of \u00a7 1323(d). We think that our holding enables \u00a7 1323(d) to be read in harmony with the Refugee Act, thus maintaining \u201cstrict observance of our international obligations concerning those who genuinely flee persecution in their homeland.\u201d Exec. Order No. 12324, 3 C.F.R. 180, 182 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">Nothing that we have said, of course, goes to the substantive question whether petitioners are in fact entitled to be treated as asylees. Resolution of this question requires the development of a factual record, for Congress, in accordance with treaty law, has instructed the INS to deny asylum in certain circumstances, including a determination that an alien applicant is not a refugee within the meaning of the Act.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> And of course the Attorney General <em>shall not </em>deport or return alien refugees, as a matter of statutory law, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h)(1), as well as of treaty law, United Nations Protocol, <em>supra, </em>art. 33(f).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Congress\u2019s limitation on the Attorney General\u2019s discretion requires careful fact-finding. Were the substantive question before us, the issue on appeal would be whether there was substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the INS decision, <em>McMullen v. INS, </em>658 F.2d 1312, 1316 (9th Cir.1981); <em>see also Stevic v. Sava, </em>678 F.2d at 404, and whether the INS decision was based on the requirements of statute and treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">Finally, our construction of the statute and the regulations is aided to some extent, if not guided, by what we perceive to be the dictates of procedural due process. We say this full well knowing that the alien seeking initial admission is requesting a privilege and has very limited rights regarding his application. <em>Fiallo v. Bell, </em>430 U.S. 787, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>792, 97 S.Ct. 1473, 1477, 52 L.Ed.2d 50 (1977). But a refugee who has a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d in his homeland has a protectable interest recognized by both treaty<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and statute,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and his interest in not being returned may well enjoy some due process protection not available to an alien claiming only admission. Because the severity of harm to the erroneously excluded asylee outweighs the administrative burden of providing an asylum hearing, if the regulations did not do so already the INS arguably would be required to provide a hearing before an immigration judge to determine whether applicants for asylum are, in fact, refugees within the meaning of the Act.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Reversed and remanded for further administrative proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-17\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (Supp. V 1981) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"acu-dedup-0\">The Attorney General shall establish a procedure for an alien physically present in the United States or at a land border or port of entry, irrespective of such alien\u2019s status, to apply for asylum, and the alien may be grant-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b927-29\">.
