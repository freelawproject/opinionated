We hold that the district court exceeded the bounds of its discretion in denying attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988, and therefore do not reach the question whether fees should have been awarded under \u00a7 794a(b). Accordingly, we REVERSE and REMAND with instructions to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under the guidelines set forth in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">Raul Espino was involved in an automobile accident when he was only 11 months old that left him a quadraplegic. As a result of his injuries, which included damage to the sympathetic nervous system, his body cannot adequately dissipate or conserve heat. This inability to regulate body temperature requires that Raul be kept in a stable temperature-controlled environment of 68\u00b0-78\u00b0 F.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">When he reached school age, Raul was enrolled in a kindergarten at the Moody School for the Handicapped in Brownsville, Texas. Because the school was fully air-conditioned, Raul encountered few problems caused by extremes in temperature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">When it came time for Raul to go off to first grade, the Admission, Review and Dismissal Committee [ARD] of the Brownsville Independent School District [BISD] met to conduct its annual review of Raul\u2019s educational placement. Because of its determination that the facilities at Moody were insufficient to meet Raul\u2019s social and intellectual needs, the ARD recommended that he be \u201cmainstreamed,\u201d i.e. placed in a regular, air-conditioned first grade classroom within the BISD and educated with non-handicapped children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-13\">At the time this decision was made, however, there were no air-conditioned regular classrooms in the BISD system at the elementary level. On Raul\u2019s first day in school, he and his mother discovered that he was not going to be placed in an air-conditioned classroom. Instead, the BISD, headed by named defendant herein, Superintendent Raul Besteiro, had constructed a portable five foot plexiglass box with a window air-conditioning unit and placed it in Raul\u2019s first grade classroom for his use. Neither Raul\u2019s parents nor the ARD had been informed of this solution to Raul\u2019s problems. The solution was primarily conceived of by Superintendent Besteiro, who reasoned that air-conditioning a single classroom for Raul would open up a \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d of complaints by the teachers and parents of children in other classrooms that were not air-conditioned. Superintendent Besteiro was also concerned that by air-conditioning a classroom for Raul, he would be violating Bulletin 871 which sets out guidelines for administering the Texas Special Education Program. Although the Bulletin allows the use of special education funds for a particular handicapped child, it does not refer to expenditures of these funds on nonhandicapped peers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-14\">Raul was enrolled and spent up to 75% of his class time in the plastic cubicle during the warm spring and fall months of his first year in school. Initially, the cubicle had no sound system, and Raul had difficulty hearing his teacher until a one-way radio receiver was installed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-15\">In November 1980, Raul\u2019s parents filed an administrative complaint challenging BISD\u2019s decision to place Raul in the air-conditioned plastic cubicle. A due process hearing held before an officer of the Texas Education Agency on December 2, 1980 resulted in a decision in BISD\u2019s favor which was adopted by the Texas Commission of Education on February 4, 1981. Having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>exhausted his administrative appeals, Raul filed suit against Superintendent Besteiro and the Trustees of the BISD on July 24, 1981, alleging violations of his rights under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794 (West Supp.1982);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, 20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1401 <em>et seq. </em>(West 1978 &amp; West Supp.1982) [EAHCA];<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West 1981);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment; Tex.Educ.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.104 (Vernon Supp.1982), and Tex.Hum.Res.Code Ann. \u00a7 121.001 (Vernon 1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">The federal causes of action alleged that by isolating Raul in a plexiglass cubicle, the BISD had violated his right to be free from discrimination on the basis of handicap, his right to a free, appropriate public education in the least restrictive setting, and his right to due process and equal protection of the law. The complaint sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-13\">Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court granted Raul\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that Raul had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his claim under the EAHCA, and enjoined the BISD from refusing to provide Raul an air-conditioned environment in which he could fully interact with his nonhandicapped peers. The court\u2019s order also enjoined the BISD from requiring Raul to attend class in an air-conditioned cubicle or any other segregated environment. The BISD then worked out an arrangement whereby Raul would be educated in an air-conditioned classroom in a local, private school. The court found this arrangement to be in compliance with its earlier order, and on January 7, 1982 entered final judgment in this case <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>Raul subsequently filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988 and 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794a(b) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The BISD did not file an objection to this motion. On January 29, 1982, without a hearing, the court denied the motion, stating only that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-5\">The Court has considered Plaintiff\u2019s Motion and, noting that the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees in this case is within the Court\u2019s discretion, and further noting that the position taken by Defendants herein was in good faith compliance with a reasonable interpretation of the law, is of the opinion that said motion be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aym-dedup-0\">Raul appeals that decision to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">ANALYSIS:</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">Under the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d each party to a suit is generally required to pay its own attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1616, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975). Congress, however, has enacted a number of statutory exceptions to this rule. <em>Alyeska, </em>95 S.Ct. at 1623. One such exception is the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Pees Awards Act of 1976, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988 (West 1981), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-8\">In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title, title IX of Public Law 92-318, or title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKv-\">\n<em>Special Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJg\">In enacting \u00a7 1988, Congress stated that \u201ca party seeking to enforce the rights protected by the statutes covered by [this Act], if successful, \u2018should ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u2019 <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402 [88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263] (1968).\u201d S.Rep. No. 94-1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5908, 5912. This \u201cNewman rule\u201d has consistently been applied by this Court to prevailing plaintiffs seeking attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988. <em>Riddell v. National Democratic Party, </em>624 F.2d 539, 543 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Gates v. Collier, </em>616 F.2d 1268, 1275 (5th Cir.1980), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>636 F.2d 942 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Universal Amusement Co., Inc. v. Hofheinz, </em>616 F.2d 202, 204-05 (5th Cir.1980), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>646 F.2d 996 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Morrow v. Dillard, </em>580 F.2d 1284, 1300 (5th Cir.1978), <em>vacated sub nom. on other grounds, Morrow v. Finch, </em>642 F.2d 823 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees, we are limited to determining whether the court abused its discretion. The discretion to deny \u00a7 1988 fees is, however, extremely narrow. <em>Ellwest Stereo Theatre, Inc. v. Jackson, </em>653 F.2d 954, 955 (5th Cir.1981). Absent special circumstances that would render such an award unjust, a prevailing plaintiff should be awarded \u00a7 1988 fees <em>\u201cas a matter of course.\u201d Gates, </em>616 F.2d at 1275 (emphasis added). However, the special circumstances exception to the general rule requiring the award of fees is an extremely limited one. <em>Ellwest, </em>653 F.2d at 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-11\">Here, aside from a naked assertion of discretionary authority, the only reason given by the district court for its denial of \u00a7 1988 fees was that \u201cthe position taken by Defendants herein was in good faith compliance with a reasonable interpretation of the law.\u201d Good faith is not a special circumstance sufficient to justify the denial of fees under \u00a7 1988. <em>Ellwest, </em>653 F.2d at 955; Aware <em>Woman Clinic v. City of Cocoa Beach, </em>629 F.2d 1146, 1148-49 (5th Cir. 1980). Indeed, in <em>Riddell, </em>we rejected the same argument now made by Superintendent Besteiro:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-12\">State Officials cannot show special circumstances sufficient to prevent an award of fees merely because the officials enforced [a] statute in good faith compliance with their official duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-13\"><em>Riddell, </em>624 F.2d at 545. See also <em>Brown v. Culpepper, </em>559 F.2d 274, 278 (5th Cir.1977) (\u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s conduct, be it negligent or intentional, in good faith or bad, is irrele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>vant to an award of attorney\u2019s fees [under \u00a7 1988].\u201d) We hold that the district court abused its discretion in relying upon defendant\u2019s good faith as a special circumstance justifying the denial of \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">\n<em>Prevailing Party</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">Attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded a prevailing plaintiff under \u00a7 1988 as a matter of course. <em>Gates, </em>616 F.2d at 1275. In determining whether a plaintiff has \u201cprevailed,\u201d we must ask whether, \u201cas a realistic matter, the plaintiff ... has gained anything from this suit that [he] could not have obtained without litigation.\u201d <em>Coen v. Harrison County School Board, </em>638 F.2d 24, 26-27 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 938, 102 S.Ct. 1427, 71 L.Ed.2d 647 (1982). Here Raul obtained injunctions which resulted in his placement in an air-conditioned classroom. This is precisely what he sought to achieve by bringing his suit. That he was unable to obtain this placement by any other means is shown by the failure of his negotiations with the BISD, and subsequent administrative appeals, to achieve the desired result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">Superintendent Besteiro, however, contends that Raul did not prevail because he did not obtain all the relief he sought in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">Even where litigation does not culminate in a final order or judgment for plaintiff, we have allowed attorney\u2019s fees as long as plaintiff prevailed on the central issue in the case. <em>Iranian Students Association v. Edwards, </em>604 F.2d 352, 353 (5th Cir.1979) (suit led to TRO and consent agreement); <em>Criterion Club of Albany v. Board of Commissioners, </em>594 F.2d 118 (5th Cir.1979) (suit a factor in legislative reapportionment). Congress has stated that \u00a7 1988 fees \u201care especially appropriate where a party has prevailed on an important matter in the course of litigation, even when he ultimately does not prevail on all issues.\u201d S.Rep. No. 94-1011, <em>supra </em>at 5, <em>reprinted in </em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, <em>supra </em>at 5912. <em>Accord, Hanrahan v. Hampton, </em>446 U.S. 754, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 1989, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980); <em>Barrett v. Thomas, </em>649 F.2d 1193, 1201 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 925, 102 S.Ct. 1969, 72 L.Ed.2d 440 (1982). The Supreme Court has interpreted this language to mean that \u201cCongress intended to permit ... the award of counsel fees only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims. For only in that event has there been a determination of the \u2018substantial rights of the parties,\u2019 which Congress determined was a necessary foundation for departing from the usual rule in this country that each party is to bear the expense of his own attorney.\u201d <em>Hanrahan, </em>100 S.Ct. at 1989, quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-1558 at 8. In the present case, Raul did not obtain the compensatory and punitive damages sought. However, by obtaining the two injunctions issued by the district court, Raul did prevail on the merits of at least some of his claims. The final judgment subsequently entered by the court formalized BISD\u2019s arrangement with a local private school whereby Raul would be placed in an air-conditioned classroom. The court found that this solution was in compliance with its order. Where defendants make an accommodation that complies with an order representing a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, plaintiff is a prevailing party for purposes of section 1988 attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Taylor v. Sterrett, </em>640 F.2d 663, 669 (5th Cir.1981). We therefore hold that Raul was a prevailing plaintiff for purposes of \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">\n<em>Section 1988 or EAHCA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">The district court\u2019s order, requiring the BISD to place Raul in an air-conditioned classroom, was premised on the court\u2019s determination that Raul had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his claim under the EAHCA. The BISD\u2019s subsequent accommodation was made in compliance with this same order; the final judgment formalizing this accommodation was therefore also premised on a violation of the EAHCA. The EAHCA makes no provision for attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Hymes v. Harnett County Board of Education, </em>664 F.2d 410 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>In accordance with \u201cthe longstanding judicial policy of avoiding unnecessary decision of important constitutional issues,\u201d <em>Maher </em>v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2577, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980), the district court never reached Raul\u2019s constitutional claim under \u00a7 1983. Nor did the court address the alleged violations of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. We are thus squarely faced with the question whether, in an action containing claims under both the EAHCA and \u00a7 1983, a court may, by choosing to ground its order on the EAH-CA, deprive a plaintiff of attorney\u2019s fees to which he would have been entitled had the court based its decision on \u00a7 1983. Under the analytical framework set out above, this translates into the refined question whether a plaintiff who obtains under the EAHCA the same relief he sought under \u00a7 1983, is entitled to \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">\n<em>Pendent Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">Examination of the House Report accompanying \u00a7 1988 reveals that Congress anticipated the problem facing us, and provided a solution to it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-7\">To the extent a plaintiff joins a claim under one of the statutes enumerated in [the Fees Act] with a claim that does not allow attorney fees, that plaintiff, if it prevails on the non-fee claim, is entitled to a determination on the other claim for the purpose of awarding counsel fees. <em>Morales v. Haines, </em>486 F.2d 880 (7th Cir. 1973). In some instances, however, the claim with fees may involve a constitutional question which the courts are reluctant to resolve if the non-constitutional claim is dispositive. <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528 [94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577] (1974). In such cases, if the claim for which fees may be awarded meets the \u201csubstantiality\u201d test, <em>see Hagans v. Lavine, supra; United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715 [86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218] (1966), attorney\u2019s fees may be allowed even though the court declines to enter judgment for the plaintiff on that claim, so long as the plaintiff prevails on the non-fee claim arising out of a \u201ccommon nucleus of operative fact.\u201d <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, supra </em>at 725 [86 S.Ct. at 1138],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-10\">H.R.Rep. No. 94-1558, p. 4 n. 7 (1976). This language was quoted with approval in <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2576 n. 15, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980), where the Court said: \u201cWe agree with the courts below that Congress was acting within its enforcement power in allowing the award of fees in a case in which the plaintiff prevails on a wholly statutory, non-civil-rights claim pendent to a substantial claim.\u201d <em>Maher, </em>100 S.Ct. at 2576.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-11\">The second paradigm<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> set out in the House Report is directly applicable to our case. In basing its decision on the EAHCA the court below followed the judicially-created policy of avoiding the unnecessary decision of constitutional issues, and never reached Raul\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>See Maher, </em>100 S.Ct. at 2577; <em>Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941); <em>Ashwander v. TVA, </em>297 U.S. 288, 346, 56 S.Ct. 466, 482, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936); <em>Siler v. Louisville &amp; Nashville RR, </em>213 U.S. 175, 29 S.Ct. 451, 53 L.Ed. 753 (1909).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-12\">The House Report\u2019s provision for attorney\u2019s fees in this type of case speaks only of a broad category of \u201cnon-fee claims.\u201d Although the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction arose in the context of pendent state law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>claims, see, <em>e.g., United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966), courts have relied on this doctrine to award \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiffs prevailing on non-fee federal statutory claims as well, including the EAHCA. <em>Monahan v. Nebraska, </em>687 F.2d 1164, 1172 (8th Cir.1982), <em>cert. </em>denied,U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 1252, 75 L.Ed.2d 481 (1983) (plaintiff prevailed on EAHCA claim; court awarded \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees.); <em>Robert M. v. Benton, </em>671 F.2d 1104, 1104-05 (8th Cir.1982) (plaintiff prevailed on EAHCA claim; court awarded \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees). <em>But see Smith v. Cumberland School Committee, </em>703 F.2d 4 (1st Cir. 1983).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">In <em>Smith v. Cumberland School Committee, </em>the First Circuit rejected the pendent claim theory, and denied \u00a7 1988 fees to a plaintiff who prevailed on his EAHCA claim. Noting that the EAHCA is a comprehensive statutory and administrative scheme which lacks an attorney\u2019s fee provision, the Court concluded that permitting a plaintiff to recover \u00a7 1988 fees where he had prevailed solely on his EAHCA claim would thwart Congress\u2019 intention that successful EAHCA plaintiffs not recover fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-11\">Although Congress may not have intended that plaintiffs recover attorney\u2019s fees on claims brought solely under the EAHCA,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it does not follow that Congress also intended to deprive plaintiffs of \u00a7 1988 fees on their \u00a7 1983 claims where both the EAHCA and \u00a7 1983 are pleaded, and a court, solely to avoid deciding a constitutional issue, chooses to ground its relief on the EAHCA. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 94-1558 <em>supra. </em>Were this Congress\u2019 intent, the EAHCA would have to be a preemptive statute barring claims under any other statute in those cases in which it afforded a remedy. However, in <em>Tatro v. Texas, </em>703 F.2d 823 (5th Cir.1983), this Court found that defendants had violated both the EAHCA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794 (West Supp.1982). We could not have done so if the EAHCA in fact preempted actions under all other applicable statutes. The prior district court opinion in <em>Tatro </em>also held that as long as plaintiff exhausted his administrative remedies, suit under the EAHCA did not foreclose a \u00a7 1983 suit. <em>Tatro </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>516 F.Supp. 968 (N.D.Tex. 1981). <em>See also S-1 v. Turlington, </em>635 F.2d 342 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1030, 102 S.Ct. 566, 70 L.Ed.2d 473 (1981) (both the EAHCA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 applied.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>The <em>Smith </em>Court concluded that the EAHCA\u2019s comprehensive nature and lack of an attorney\u2019s fees provision precluded \u00a7 1988 fees in a \u00a7 1983 suit brought to remedy a violation of the EAHCA itself. We need not reach this issue here, but even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the Court\u2019s conclusion is correct, it does not follow that \u00a7 1988 fees are barred where the \u00a7 1983 claim is brought not to remedy a violation of the EAHCA, but to redress a violation of a constitutional right secured under \u00a7 1983. In <em>Carlson v. Green, </em>446 U.S. 14, 100 S.Ct. 1468, 64 L.Ed.2d 15 (1980), the Supreme Court held that a <em>Bivens </em>-type private right of action to recover damages against a federal official for a constitutional violation existed in the absence of a statute conferring such a right, except in two situations. \u201cThe first is when defendants demonstrate \u2018special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.\u2019 (Citations omitted)... The second is when defendants show that Congress has provided an alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be a <em>substitute </em>for recovery directly under the Constitution and viewed as equally effective.\u201d (Citations omitted) (emphasis in original). <em>Carlson, </em>100 S.Ct. at 1471.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">We believe that these considerations apply with even greater force where the private right of action is not implied, but is expressly guaranteed by a statute like \u00a7 1983. Cf. <em>Brewer v. Blackwell, </em>692 F.2d 387, 399 n. 16 (5th Cir.1982). We also attach no importance to the fact that the constitutional deprivation in our case is by a state, rather than a federal, official. Defendants in this case have demonstrated no special factors counselling hesitation. More important, Congress has never explicitly declared that the EAHCA is a substitute for recovery directly under the Constitution, or under \u00a7 1983. Section 1983 had been in existence for over a century when Congress enacted the EAHCA, and none can argue that Congress was unfamiliar with its provisions. Had Congress wished the EAHCA to supplant \u00a7 1983 for those of its violations simultaneously giving rise to constitutional claims for which \u00a7 1983 provided a remedy, it had only to say so. The EAHCA has been amended since the enactment of the Civil Rights Awards Act of 1976, amending section 1988. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pub.L. 95-561, 92 Stat. 2364, Nov. 1, 1978; Pub.L. 96-270, 94 Stat. 498, June 14, 1980. Had Congress wished to preclude the award of attorney\u2019s fees in actions brought under \u00a7 1983 to remedy constitutional violations arising out of acts forming the basis for a claim under the EAHCA as well, it could have done so. That it did not is, we think, sufficient evidence of its intent to allow \u00a7 1983 actions in situations like this one, in which \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees are awarded as a matter of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">We reject the First Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Smith, </em>and adopt instead the approach followed by the Eighth Circuit in <em>Monahan v. Nebraska, </em>687 F.2d 1164, 1172 (8th Cir.1982), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 1252, 75 L.Ed.2d 481 (1983). In <em>Monahan, </em>as in our case, plaintiff prevailed on his EAHCA claim, but the court never reached his \u00a7 1983 constitutional claim. In awarding plaintiff \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees, the Eighth Circuit held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-10\">It does not matter that the constitutional, or \u00a7 1983, ground was not actually reached, and that the complainant prevailed, to the extent that he did at all, on his EAHCA ground. Where a non-fee claim is joined with a non-frivolous claim under a statute providing for the award of fees, and the plaintiff prevails with respect to his non-fee claim, thus making it unnecessary for the Court to reach the \u00a7 1983 claim, an award of fees is nevertheless appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1067-11\"><em>Monahan, </em>687 F.2d at 1172. We agree, adding only that an award of \u00a7 1988 fees is appropriate only where the fee claim (here \u00a7 1983) is substantial, <em>Hagans v. Levine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974), and the non-fee claim on which plaintiff prevails arises out of a nucleus of operative fact common with that of the fee claim. <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>The substantiality test merely requires that the issue raised in the fee claim not be \u201cwholly insubstantial,\u201d \u201cobviously frivolous,\u201d \u201cplainly insubstantial\u201d or \u201cobviously without merit.\u201d <em>Hagans, </em>415 U.S. at 537, 94 S.Ct. at 1379. The fee claim therefore need only be sufficiently substantial to support federal jurisdiction. <em>Maher, </em>100 S.Ct. at 2573. Raul\u2019s confinement in a five foot plastic cubicle clearly supports a substantial claim under the fourteenth amendment, which is sufficient to support federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">In order to arise out of a common nucleus of operative fact, the fee and non-fee claims must be so interrelated that plaintiffs \u201cwould ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. at 725, 86 S.Ct. at 1138. Here, the treatment challenged separately under the EAHCA and \u00a7 1983 is exactly the same; there is every reason to expect that Raul would try both in one proceeding, as he has in fact done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">Since the claims in this case meet the tests of <em>Hagans </em>and <em>Gibbs, </em>we conclude that Raul is entitled to \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Williams v. Thomas, </em>692 F.2d 1032 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">\n<em>Policy Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">Where the parties to a suit under \u00a7 1983 and other statutes settle before a final judgment issues, plaintiff is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 as a matter of course as long as he prevailed on the central issue in his case. <em>Maher, </em>100 S.Ct. at 2575; <em>Gates, </em>616 F.2d at 1275; S.Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976). Had plaintiff in the present case obtained by consent what he ultimately won through litigation, he would have prevailed on the central issue in his case, and collected \u00a7 1988 fees. A plaintiff prevails by settlement \u201cunder\u201d any statute pleaded that affords the relief actually obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">Were we to hold, on the facts of this case, that Raul is not entitled to \u00a7 1988 fees because the district court did not explicitly ground its relief on \u00a7 1983, we would in effect be creating a powerful disincentive to settlement in close cases. Where defendants know that a court is more likely to award relief on the basis of a non-fee statute whose application avoids difficult constitutional questions, they will have little incentive to settle their differences with plaintiffs, knowing as they do that a settlement is very likely to cost them substantial attorney\u2019s fees. Federal dockets are already sufficiently crowded without our creating a disincentive to settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">Permitting a court to deny \u00a7 1988 fees by granting relief on the basis of a non-fee statute would also undermine Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 1988 to create an incentive for plaintiffs to vindicate violations of their constitutional rights by bringing \u00a7 1983 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\">Last, the Supreme Court has recognized that since \u00a7 1988 frequently adds substantial attorney\u2019s fees to a judgment, it has the desirable subsidiary effect of deterring violations of rights secured by \u00a7 1983. <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 257 n. 11, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1049 n. 11, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978). This effect would also be undermined by the denial of attorney\u2019s fees in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-12\">For these reasons, we REVERSE the denial of \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees and REMAND this case to the district court with instructions to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with the criteria set forth in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974). The award should include an allowance for fees and costs incurred in contesting this award in the district court and on this appeal. <em>Riddell, </em>624 F.2d at 547. On remand, the district court should also determine whether Raul is entitled to reasonable \u2022 attorney\u2019s fees for counsel\u2019s efforts in the administrative proceedings. <em>New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey, </em>447 U.S. 54, 100 S.Ct. 2024, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1061-9\">.

As the Senate Report accompanying \u00a7 1988 contains nothing which contradicts the expressed intention of the House to award \u00a7 1988 fees where plaintiff prevails on a pendent non-fee claim, we follow Congress\u2019 intent as expressed in the House Report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1065-13\">.

This is not our case. Raul\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim alleged that the BISD, acting under color of law, deprived him of a liberty interest guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment. Raul was therefore not automatically entitled to a determination of his \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">. <em>See Gary B. v.

This award was dependent on the special facts of that case. We do not mean to imply in <em>Feenstra </em>that \u00a7 1988 fees are appropriate whenever \u00a7 1983 could have been pleaded, but was not, and therefore do not here reach the issue whether \u00a7 1988 fees might be available where only the EAHCA was pleaded, or even where the EAHCA was pleaded directly under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1066-13\">. In <em>Anderson v.

In <em>Anderson, </em>however, plaintiff sought \u00a7 1988 fees in an action brought directly under \u00a7 1983 to remedy an alleged violation of the EAHCA. Even if the <em>Anderson </em>Court properly denied attorney\u2019s fees in that situation, an issue we need not address, the logic of that decision does not extend to our case, where the \u00a7 1983 action was brought independent of the EAHCA violation to redress a violation of Raul\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
