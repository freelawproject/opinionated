The injunction required Local 498 and Local 17 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union to refrain from all picketing for a period of thirty days. It thereafter forbade picketing for the purpose of pressuring One Stop to recognize either local as the collective bargaining representative of its employees pending formal disposition of the store\u2019s unfair labor practice complaints before the National Labor Relations Board. Local 498 challenges that part of the injunction ordering a hiatus in all picketing. We reverse and remand to allow the district court to specify the grounds upon which it ordered the injunction or, in the alternative, to modify the relief it granted. The court may conduct further fact-finding if necessary. Following that proceeding, which should be concluded at the earliest possible date, the cause will be resubmitted to this panel for review and final disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-15\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">The Shop\u2019N Save Supermarket in Grass Valley, California, had collective bargaining agreements with two locals of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. The store\u2019s grocery clerks were members of Local 17 and its meat department employees belonged to Local 498. Shop\u2019N Save ceased operation on November 24,1982, and dismissed all of its employees. Robert Sexton and Fred Claypool purchased Shop\u2019N Save and hired a new labor force to staff the store. The thirty-two new employees did not include fourteen grocery clerks and three meat department employees formerly employed by Shop\u2019N Save and represented by the locals. The store reopened on December 2, 1982, as One Stop Supermarket.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-17\">On One Stop\u2019s first day of operation representatives of Local 17 visited the store and questioned Sexton and Claypool to determine whether they intended to honor the Shop\u2019N Save contract. Sexton responded that since Shop\u2019N Save had closed, he did not believe the agreement\u2019s successorship clause bound the new owners. Before leaving, Frank Neth, Executive Officer of Local 17, stated that if One Stop did not assume the contract, his union would organize the store. A similar meeting took place between Sexton and Alfred Rasmussen, Secretary Treasurer of Local 498, on December 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-18\">Picketers first appeared in front of the Grass Valley store on December 10. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>carried signs which bore the following legend:</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">ONE STOP SUPERMARKET</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">UNFAIR TO ORGANIZED LABOR</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">LOCAL UNION # 17</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">SANCTIONED BY CENTRAL LABOR COUNCIL</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">AFL-CIO</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The pickets included members of Local 17 and Local 498. The district court found that at all times during the picketing which followed, the two locals were acting in concert to achieve a single recognitional objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">On January 10, One Stop registered an unfair labor practice complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that Local 17 had violated Section 8(b)(7)(C) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(7)(C),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by engaging in rec-ognitional picketing for more than thirty days without having filed a petition for a representation election. Local 17 entered into a settlement agreement with the Regional Director in which it agreed to halt any further recognitional picketing of One Stop and to refrain from all picketing for the fifteen-day period between January 23 and February 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">On January 20, One Stop received a telegram from Rasmussen asserting that Local 498 did not believe that the store paid its meatcutters area-standard wages and benefits. One Stop responded through its attorney, explaining that it paid its only meat-cutter, co-owner Robert Sexton, in excess of the area standard. The next day One Stop filed a second complaint with the Board alleging that Local 498 was engaging in unfair labor practices. In a January 22 telegram Local 498 expanded its claim that One Stop paid substandard wages and benefits to include all meat department employees. On the date Local 17\u2019s picketing was scheduled to cease, the same individuals who had previously demonstrated with Local 17 signs carried placards stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b539-17\">PLEASE</p>\n<p id=\"b539-18\">WE ASK YOU</p>\n<p id=\"b539-19\">NOT TO PATRONIZE</p>\n<p id=\"b539-20\">ONE STOP</p>\n<p id=\"b539-21\">MARKET</p>\n<p id=\"b539-22\">THIS MEAT DEPARTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"ays-dedup-0\">DOES NOT COMPLY WITH</p>\n<p id=\"AYBB\">PREVAILING WAGES AND BENEFITS</p>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">BUTCHERS UNION, UFCW, AFL-CIO</p>\n<p id=\"b539-23\">Upon investigation, the Board\u2019s Regional Director determined that there was reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>able cause to believe that One Stop\u2019s charges against both unions were true and petitioned the district court for an injunction. The court\u2019s order enjoining the picketing issued at a hearing held February 23. As of that date, One Stop\u2019s Grass Valley location had been picketed for all but eight of the days that it had been open for business. The store could not obtain fresh fish or frozen foods and its meat deliveries were reduced by forty percent. Several suppliers of brand name processed foods also refused to make deliveries. In total, an average of sixty to seventy percent of One Stop\u2019s deliveries was interrupted during the picketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Pursuant to Section 10(1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board who has reason to-believe that a union has engaged in conduct proscribed by section 8(b)(7) may petition the district court for an injunction pending final adjudication of the matter before the Board. Local 498 does not assert any error in the district court\u2019s finding that it was reasonable for Regional Director Miller to believe that the charges against it were true. Nor does it challenge the propriety of the preliminary injunction against picketing for recognitional purposes. The sole issue it raises on appeal is whether the district court could properly order a hiatus in all picketing for thirty days. Local 498 contends that section 10(1) grants the court jurisdiction to enjoin only illegal picketing and may not be invoked to bar picketing for a permissible purpose. In the alternative the Local argues that even if the statute confers such power upon the district court, the order in this case violated its first amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The Board asserts that jurisdiction to order a hiatus in all picketing is conferred by the broad language of section 10(1), which permits the district court to remedy illegal recognitional picketing by ordering such injunctive relief \u201cas it deems just and proper, notwithstanding any other provision of law.\u201d The legislative history of section 10(l), which was added to the Act in 1947, indicates that Congress perceived the need for interim relief during the administrative hearing process in order to prevent substantial injury to employers before the Board could obtain judicial enforcement of its decisions following final adjudication. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 27, <em>reprinted in </em>1 NLRB, Legislative History of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947, at 433 (1948); <em>see also Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Carpet Layers Local 419, </em>397 U.S. 655, 658 &amp; n. 5, 90 S.Ct. 1299, 1301 &amp; n. 5, 25 L.Ed.2d 637 (1970) (per curiam); <em>Hendrix v. International Union of Operating Engineers Local 571, </em>592 F.2d 437, 441-42 (8th Cir. 1979); <em>Compton v. National Maritime Union, </em>533 F.2d 1270, 1276 (1st Cir.1976). However, by providing an effective remedy against the practices of organized labor it deemed unfair, Congress did not intend to override its policy favoring lawful picketing implicit in the Norris-LaGuardia Act\u2019s strict limitation on federal jurisdiction to issue injunctions in cases arising out of \u201clabor disputes.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-115. See <em>Hendrix, </em>592 F.2d at 445-46; <em>McLeod v. Business Machine &amp; Office Appliance Me</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>chanics Conference Board Local 459, </em>300 F.2d 237, 239-240 (2d Cir.1962). We hold that a district court has jurisdiction to order a hiatus in all picketing under \u00a7 10(l) only when presumptively legitimate picketing would perpetuate the effects of prior illegal activity. Relief under these limited circumstances furthers the purpose of section 10(7) to \u201crestore or preserve the status quo pending litigation,\u201d S.Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong. 1st Sess. 27, <em>reprinted in </em>1 NLRB, Legislative History of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947, at 433, while circumscribing a union\u2019s right to picket only to the extent made necessary by its impermissible conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">At the hearing before the district court, the Board requested a hiatus in all picketing in order to allow the employers, the employees, and the public to distinguish the picketing for an unlawful recognitional purpose from a new round of legal picketing. The Board claimed that without such a break, further picketing would serve as a signal to employees of suppliers to continue to refuse to provide services to One Stop. The Board also contended that the thirty-day hiatus was necessary to counteract the weakening effect of the unlawful picketing. There is evidence in the record that One Stop had been so weakened by the recognitional picketing that if new, legitimate picketing were permitted without allowing a period for normal operation, the store would be forced to close. While the district court could have ordered a hiatus on either of these grounds, it made no findings of fact specifically directed toward its decision to halt all picketing for thirty days. Mere allegations that the thirty-day hiatus was necessary to preclude continued picketing from having a signal effect or to restore the status quo by counteracting the hardship created by the unlawful picketing are an insufficient basis for injunctive relief. However, if on remand the district court should again conclude that a limitation on Local 498\u2019s right to protest is warranted, it must carefully tailor its injunction in order to permit the maximum amount of legitimate activity while erasing the illegal recognitional conduct and its deleterious impact. <em>Cf. Potter </em>v. <em>Houston Gulf Coast Building Trades Council, </em>482 F.2d 837, 841 (5th Cir.1973) (citing <em>Youngdahl v. Rainfair, Inc., </em>355 U.S. 131, 78 S.Ct. 206, 2 L.Ed.2d 151 (1957)) (secondary boycott).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">An injunction which prohibits only that activity which would perpetuate the effects of illegal picketing will not abridge Local 498\u2019s first amendment rights. Though peaceful picketing for a lawful purpose is an activity safeguarded by the first amendment, <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Claiborne Hardware Co., </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 3409, 3424, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982); <em>Thornhill v. Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 60 S.Ct. 736, 84 L.Ed. 1093 (1940), it is subject to regulation since picketing involves elements of conduct as well as the communication of ideas. <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 695 v. Vogt, Inc., </em>354 U.S. 284, 77 S.Ct. 1166, 1 L.Ed.2d 1347 (1957). The act of patrolling, which is not constitutionally protected, is often a more forceful deterrent to individuals about to enter a business establishment than the ideas expressed on a picket line. <em>NLRB v. Retail Store Employees Union Local 1001, </em>447 U.S. 607, 619, 100 S.Ct. 2372, 2379, 65 L.Ed.2d 377 (1980) (Stevens, J., concurring); <em>Bakery Drivers Local 802 v. Wohl, </em>315 U.S. 769, 776-77, 62 S.Ct. 816, 819-20, 86 L.Ed. 1178 (1942) (Douglas, J., concurring). Because of the government\u2019s strong interest in regulating the economic relationship between labor and management, Congress may constitutionally enact measures which impact on the speech element of picketing. <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s Association v. Allied International, Inc., </em>456 U.S. 212, 226-27, 102 S.Ct. 1656, 1664-65, 72 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982); <em>Retail Store Employees Union, </em>447 U.S. at 617-18, 100 S.Ct. at 2378-79 (Blackmun, J., concurring). Courts of Appeals have uniformly upheld the section 8(b)(7) restriction against picketing for recognitional purposes as a legitimate exercise of that authority to promote labor democracy and the orderly settlement of representational controversies by allowing employers and employees the opportunity to choose freely through elections whether they wish to unionize. <em>See NLRB </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 265, </em>604 F.2d 1091, 1099-1100 (8th Cir.1979); <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 344 v. NLRB, </em>568 F.2d 12, 21 (7th Cir.1977); <em>NLRB v. Lawrence Typographical Union No. 570, </em>376 F.2d 643, 654 (10th Cir.1967); <em>NLRB v. Local 3, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, </em>339 F.2d 600, 601 (2d Cir. 1964) (per curiam); <em>Dayton Typographical Union No. 57 v. NLRB, </em>326 F.2d 634, 646-49 (D.C.Cir.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Informational picketing is an effective means of broadcasting a message. However, when this mixture of speech and conduct immediately follows recognitional picketing, an injunction authorized by the language of section 10(l) would be constitutional \u201cif it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968); see <em>United States v. </em>Grace,-U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 1702, 1706-07, 75 L.Ed.2d 736 (1983). An injunction limiting the right to demonstrate in the wake of recognitional picketing and serving the same important interests as section 8(b)(7) can satisfy this test. Such an order, when directed at the perpetuation of the effects of prior illegal activity, promotes the purposes of Congress without regard to the content of the ideas expressed. If the relief is cast in the least restrictive terms possible, then the injunction will strike the proper balance between the first amendment freedoms of labor and an employer\u2019s statutory right to redress. In some cases a temporary ban on all picketing may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-12\">.
