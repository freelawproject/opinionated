The present appeal joins the issue of impermissible judicial and prosecutorial comments upon Hearn\u2019s failure to testify in his trial for criminal sexual conduct and the preliminary issue of construing a summary affirmance by the Michigan appellate courts when both the merits of the conviction and the petitioner\u2019s failure to object at trial to improper comments were presented to the state tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">The events of the underlying incident, as developed at trial primarily through the testimony of Berta Payne (Payne), a white woman who was then 23 years of age, are generally not in dispute. During the early evening of April 23, 1977, Hearn, a black male in his fifties, was with his son in an area of the apartment building where both the appellee and Payne resided. Payne approached Hearn, whom she had casually met on at least two previous occasions, and put her arm around his waist. She received an open invitation from Hearn to visit his apartment for a drink.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">Approximately one hour later, carrying her small dog, Payne was observed walking with Hearn toward his apartment while engaging in what appeared to be a friendly conversation. Payne testified that once inside the apartment Hearn mixed her a highball, played recorded music and sexually assaulted her. She further testified that when the appellee finally concluded the assault and she had dressed, she was given a tour of Hearn\u2019s apartment and-was thereafter escorted by Hearn to the elevator. That night she related the incident to a boyfriend stating that she had been \u201cknocked down\u201d, without, however, indicating that any sexual acts had been performed. The next day she told an employer that Hearn had assaulted her in the elevator. Finally, two days after the incident, Payne reported the assault to police but again did not allude to any sexual contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-6\">In his defense, Hearn, who did not testify in his own behalf, joined the issue of Payne\u2019s credibility. To that end, during Payne\u2019s cross-examination, the defense introduced into evidence five photographs of Payne sitting in Hearn\u2019s apartment on the night involved. The photos depicted an outwardly relaxed Payne seated in the proximity of a door to the hallway, with a highball in her hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-8\">During his opening statement, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-9\">By its very nature we have a case, you have a trial, you got two stories. You have got to have two stories. One may go unspoken, but there\u2019s two stories. It becomes very, very important to judge the credibility of each witness as they testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1132-10\">At the conclusion of the trial, when clearly Hearn had not testified but had vigorously contested Payne\u2019s testimony through other witnesses, counsel\u2019s questioning, and the photographs, the prosecutor returned to the credibility of Payne\u2019s \u201cstory\u201d in light of Hearn\u2019s personal silence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-11\">These facts are uncontroverted. No dispute. No testimony here that says that someone did this or that, and then someone tells you something else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-12\">s(c Sfc S\u00a1S S}S Sji Sk</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-13\">Look at Berta Payne. Everything she said happened in that room is substantiated by those pictures. They are not in contradiction. The glass, the dog, the chair, the clothes, everything she said happened is right there, not saying that something else didn\u2019t happen later. Berta Payne and everything she said about that is totally uncontroverted except for one fact; the fact that the Defendant said, \u201cHey, nothing happened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-14\">All right, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Nothing happened. Berta Payne has met a man twice in her life. That is uncontroverted, in fact it\u2019s agreed to ... Berta Payne, what she said to you is uncontroverted as to what happened in that room.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1132-15\">The trial judge included the following language in his final instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATb\">It is the theory and claim of the prosecution that Berta Payne was criminally sexually assaulted on April 23, 1977, at Apartment 604 at the Viewpointe Apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>ments in the City of Grand Rapids, County of Kent and State of Michigan, that the Defendant Hearn assaulted Complainant, Berta Payne, on April 23rd as testified to by Berta Payne over these last two days of trial; <em>that the testimony of Berta Payne is uncontroverted as to what occurred in the apartment in question on the evening of April 23rd.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEAc\">Hearn\u2019s defense attorney failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments either during opening statement or closing argument, nor did he enter an objection to the Court\u2019s instruction to the jury. Hearn was convicted. On appeal in the Michigan courts, however, Hearn challenged the prosecutor\u2019s remarks as highly prejudicial. The state appellate tribunal, addressing an alternative State motion to affirm the conviction or dismiss the appeal, entered an order affirming the conviction. The Michigan Supreme Court thereupon refused further appellate review. In the federal habeas proceeding, the district judge initially resolved a perceived \u201cambiguity\u201d as to the basis of the state appellate decision by applying a \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d test before reaching the merits of the writ. <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982). The instant appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\">In Michigan, the rule is uncontroverted that a criminal defendant\u2019s failure to enter a timely objection to allegedly improper remarks by the prosecutor may be relied upon by an appellate court to preclude consideration of the merits on review. <em>People v. Hall, </em>396 Mich. 650, 242 N.W.2d 377 (1976). However, Michigan appellate panels \u201chave long asserted the right to consider manifest and serious errors although objection was not made [at trial] by the party who appeals.\u201d <em>People v. Holmes, </em>292 Mich. 212, 215, 290 N.W. 384 (1940). <em>Accord, People v. Bladel, </em>413 Mich. 864, 317 N.W.2d 855 (1982). Therefore, while it is clear that Hearn did not object at trial to those comments now assertedly the basis for the writ, it is also clear that Michigan courts could have elected to address the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim notwithstanding the absence of a contemporaneous objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-6\">The record discloses that Hearn did appeal the merits of the issue arising as a result of impermissible comments of the prosecutor to the Michigan appeals court. The State, in response, urged affirmance of the conviction upon the <em>alternative </em>bases of failure of the defense to enter a timely objection, and lack of substantive merit. On August 2, 1978, the Michigan Court of Appeals issued the following order, here set forth in its entirety:</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-7\">People of The State of Michigan, <em>Plaintiff-Appellee, </em>v. Albert Prentice Hearn, <em>Defendant-Appellant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A237\">No. 78-1389 L.C. No. 77-21490-FY</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-12\">In this cause the defendant-appellant has filed a brief on the merits in support of his appeal, and the plaintiff-appellee having filed a motion to affirm pursuant to GCR 1963, 817.5(3), and a brief in support of the motion and a brief on appeal and an answer in opposition having been filed, and due consideration having been had by the Court,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-13\">It Is So Ordered that the motion to affirm be, and the same is hereby Granted, for the reason that the questions sought to be reviewed are so unsubstantial as to need no argument or formal submission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1133-14\">The district court, without deciding whether the above order was based upon procedural or substantive issues, concluded that the petitioner had satisfied the cause and prejudice test which permitted a federal court to address the merits even if the state dismissal had been granted for procedural reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-15\">As previously noted, the Michigan appeals court specifically characterized its action as a judgment to \u201caffirm pursuant to GCR 1963, 817.5(3).\u201d That statute provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the State may move the court of appeals to <em>affirm </em>or, alternatively, to <em>dismiss </em>a criminal appeal for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-16\">(2) A motion to dismiss an appeal may be made by appellee on the ground that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>(a) The appeal is not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1134-4\">(b) the appeal was not taken or pursued in conformity with the Rules, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1134-5\">(c) the question or questions sought to be reviewed were not timely or properly raised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1134-6\">(3) A motion to affirm the order or judgment sought to be reviewed may be made by the appellee on the ground that it is manifest that the question or questions sought to be reviewed on which the decision of the cause or matter depends, are so unsubstantial as to need no argument or formal submission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1134-7\">Although the State here moved alternatively for affirmance or dismissal, the Michigan court (1) specifically granted \u201cthe motion to affirm\u201d; (2) specifically cited to GCR 1963, 817.5(3), which is the section of the statute that addresses the procedure for affirming a judgment upon the merits; and (3) specifically stated \u201cthe reason\u201d for its decision in language taken directly from that section of the statute addressing the substantive merits of the appeal. <em>Compare </em>(Opinion) \u201cfor the reason that the questions sought to be reviewed are so unsubstantial as to need no argument or formal submission\u201d; <em>and </em>(statute) \u201con the ground that * * * the question or questions sought to be reviewed * * * are so unsubstantial as to need no argument or formal submission\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-8\">Accordingly, there is no ambiguity as to the basis of this state court decision. It follows that the absence of ambiguity renders superfluous the necessity of presuming that the state court had acted upon a procedural basis. <em>See e.g. Martinez v. Harris </em>675 F.2d 51 (2d Cir.1982). It further eliminates the need for a cause and prejudice analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-9\">Without questioning the holding of <em>Harris, </em>it is self-evident that its application is confined to state decisions which are, as a matter of fact, ambiguous. A proper respect for the integrity of state court decisions, which underlies the federal habeas statute, requires federal courts to discern and accept the foundation for state decisions when that foundation is apparent in the state judgment. In the present case, the merits of the petition are properly at bar solely because they were considered by the Michigan appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-11\">The standard for evaluating allegedly improper prosecutorial comments has been extensively formulated in two recent <em>en banc </em>opinions of this Court. In <em>Butler v. Rose, </em>686 F.2d 1163 (6th Cir.1982) <em>(en banc), </em>Judge Lively identified the test as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avx-dedup-0\">Whether the language used was manifestly intended to be or was of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify. This test was derived from the <em>pre-Griffin [v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106] decisions in <em>Knowles v. United States, </em>224 F.2d 168, 170 (10th Cir.1955), and <em>Morrison v. United States, </em>6 F.2d 809, 811 (8th Cir.1925). This test has been applied both in direct appeals and habeas corpus actions. See, e.g., <em>United States ex rel. D\u2019Ambrosio v. Fay, </em>349 F.2d 957, 961 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 921, 86 S.Ct. 301, 15 L.Ed.2d 235 (1965) (habeas corpus); <em>United States v. Wells, </em>431 F.2d 434, 435 (6th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 997, 91 S.Ct. 475, 27 L.Ed.2d 448 (1971) (direct appeal). Every court of appeals has adopted the test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1134-12\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1134-13\">[Moreover, it is incorrect to argue that] a statement by a prosecutor that defendant has put on no proof or no witnesses, or that the state\u2019s evidence is uncontra-dicted, is always impermissible where the defendant is the only person who could have contradicted evidence introduced by the prosecution. To hold that such statements should be automatically treated as unconstitutional comments on the failure of the defendant to testify would be contrary to the teachings of <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>[438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973] <em>supra, </em>where the result turned on circumstances of the trial. As this court, speaking through Judge Jones, recently wrote:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>Whether the jury \u201cnecessarily construes\u201d a prosecutor\u2019s remark as a comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify requires a probing analysis of the context of the comment, and the likely effect of the district court\u2019s curative instruction, if any. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>651 F.2d 1188, 1197 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 875, 102 S.Ct. 351, 70 L.Ed.2d 183 (1981). <em>See also Cunningham v. Perini, </em>655 F.2d 98, 100 (6th Cir.1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">686 F.2d at 1170-71 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-6\">Judge Kennedy further defined the scope of inquiry for reviewing claims of impermissible comments in <em>Angel v. Overberg, </em>682 F.2d 605 (6th Cir.1982) <em>(en banc):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1135-7\">The proper legal standard we are to utilize in evaluating alleged misconduct by a state prosecutor is relatively clear. The prosecutor is ordinarily entitled to wide latitude in rebuttal argument and may fairly respond to arguments made by defense counsel. <em>Donnelly v. DeChristofo-ro, </em>416 U.S. 637, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974). Before habeas relief is granted, the prosecutor\u2019s statements must be so egregious as to render the trial fundamentally unfair. <em>Id. </em>This determination is to be made by evaluating the totality of the circumstances surrounding each individual case. <em>Hayton </em>v. <em>Egeler, </em>555 F.2d 599, 604 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 973, 98 S.Ct. 527, 54 L.Ed.2d 463 (1977). Our Court has identified the factors we are to consider in weighing the extent of prosecutorial misconduct in habeas cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATr_\">In every case, we consider the degree to which the remarks complained of have a tendency to mislead the jury and to prejudice the accused; whether they are isolated or extensive; whether they were deliberately or accidentally placed before the jury, and the strength of the competent proof to establish the guilt of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1135-8\"><em>United States v. Leon, </em>534 F.2d 667, 679 (6th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 607-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-10\">In summarizing these decisions, the following four factors emerge, bearing in mind that a characterization of evidence as \u201cuncontradicted\u201d is not <em>per se </em>unconstitutional, <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Rose, supra:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-12\">1) Were the comments \u201cmanifestly intended\u201d to reflect on the accused\u2019s silence <em>or </em>of such a character that the jury would \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d take them as such;</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-13\">2) Were the remarks isolated or extensive;</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-14\">3) Was the evidence of guilt otherwise overwhelming;</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-15\">4) What curative instructions were given, and when.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-16\">The initial examination mandated by the foregoing decisions is directed to the \u201cmanifest intent\u201d of the comments. Essentially, the State contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were merely intended to respond to the defense claim to the jury that Payne\u2019s testimony would be \u201cdisputed.\u201d The record does disclose that such a promise was tendered by defense counsel during his opening statement, but the context of that remark does not support the State\u2019s exegesis that Hearn could be expected to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-17\">In fact, Hearn\u2019s attorney enumerated for the jury that Payne\u2019s testimony would be \u201cdisputed\u201d specifically by witnesses who observed Payne and Hearn together in the hallway, through counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the prosecutrix, and through the photos which \u201cwill tell you about what happened there [in Hearn\u2019s apartment].\u201d Significantly, the defendant\u2019s own testimony was <em>not </em>preferred as one of the sources from which the jury could expect Payne\u2019s allegations to be disputed. This case is thus not analogous to <em>Butler </em>wherein the prosecutor was held to be simply responding to the defendant\u2019s ultimate silence at trial in light of a previous explicit defense promise of testimony. Accordingly, it is evident that the prosecutor clearly intended to join the issue of comment upon Hearn\u2019s silence or, at least, that his comments would \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d be interpreted by the jury as directed to the defendant\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>The second factor directs an inquiry into the scope of the remarks. The prosecutor\u2019s commentary on the defendant\u2019s silence was injected into the proceeding during his opening statement and was deliberately emphasized during closing argument. The remarks were further reiterated by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">The third consideration addresses the weight of the evidence against the defendant. A fair reading of the facts does not compel a conclusion that Hearn was unquestionably guilty. The testimony of Payne was, in many respects, inconsistent; other witnesses strongly suggested that Payne knew Hearn and willingly went to his apartment after embracing him in the hall; and the photos of Payne also suggest that she was, at least for some period of time, a willing visitor. Considering the entirety of the evidence presented, it may at least be concluded for purposes of this analysis that it was not overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">The final factor in evaluating the allegedly prejudicial comments of the prosecutor is the presence or absence of curative instructions, and the timeliness of any such remedy. In the case at bar, no immediate cautionary instruction was given. Moreover, although the trial judge did charge the jury generally on a defendant\u2019s privilege not to testify, the judge also informed the jury during his summation of the State\u2019s theory of the case \u201cthat the testimony of Berta Payne is uncontroverted as to what occurred in the apartment in question on the evening of April 23rd.\u201d This judicial repetition of the State\u2019s argument that Payne\u2019s testimony was \u201cuncontroverted\u201d may well have attributed great weight to that line of analysis for the jury; it certainly did not convey judicial disapproval.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">Accordingly, on these facts, the improper prosecutorial comments simply cannot be conclusively established as harmless error, and therefore support the granting of the writ as ordered by the district judge. Wherefore, the decision below, except that portion respecting the \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d test, is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
