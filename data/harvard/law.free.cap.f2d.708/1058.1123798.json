Swygert, Senior Circuit Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1117-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">This is another of the many cases involving disability based upon back problems and arthritis; this in a now 57-year old female. She had previously worked as a sales clerk and department manager and when the store closed, she began collecting unemployment benefits. She contends in this application that she became disabled prior to the date of the closing of the store \u2014 but she certified to the Ohio\u2019s Bureau of Worker\u2019s compensation that she was available for work for a period of 13 weeks thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">None of the judges on the panel had any doubt that she had some genuine problems. The question, of course, which was resolved against her by the Administrative Law Judge, the Appeals Council and the District Court was whether or not these problems were disabling to the point of preventing her from doing substantial work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-12\">Appellant presented evidence from at least five doctors who considered her disabled. On the other hand, the government relies upon reports by three doctors and a distinctly adverse opinion of the Administrative Law Judge in its contention that there is substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s adverse holding. We quote hereafter the dispositive paragraph of the ALJ\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-16\">The evidence shows that the claimant has degenerative disc disease and arthritis. She had right renal calculus and a bladder neck contracture in 1978 but this no longer causes her any problems. She is capable of doing numerous tasks around the house despite the fact that she complains of being unable to remain in one position more than approximately 12 minutes. Although she claims that she was unable to work in 1977, she filed for unemployment in 1978 exhibiting the fact that she felt that she was capable of working at that time. Her complaints of severe pain, as has been previously indicated, are not credible. It appears that she retains the residual functional capacity to lift up to 20 pounds, with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds, as well as a significant capacity to sit (she sat throughout the hearing which lasted IV2 hours without any apparent discomfort), stand and walk. Therefore, she has the residual functional capacity to return to her position as a sales clerk. She must, therefore, be determined not to be disabled within the meaning of the Act, as amended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-17\">Our review of the medical evidence in this case demonstrates that the case has been decided upon substantially conflicting medical opinions. The majority of our panel would not have resolved this conflict as did the ALJ, if we were empowered to find the facts in this case. Our question, however, is whether or not there is substantial evidence to support the adverse decision reached by the Secretary and we find it impossible on this record to say there is no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>The judgment of the District Court affirming the Secretary is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1118-4\">SWYGERT, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"adr-dedup-0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">I respectfully dissent. After a thorough review of the transcript and medical reports, I can only conclude that the Secretary improperly disregarded nearly all of the medical evidence, took Kinsella\u2019s statements about her daily activities out of context, made findings concerning the drugs prescribed for Kinsella which are not supported by the record, and ignored her testimony concerning the pain she suffered during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">There is no question, and the Secretary concedes, that Kinsella suffers from arthritis and degenerative disc disease. The only issue here is whether the pain caused by these diseases is so substantial that Kinsella does not retain the requisite residual functional capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">The Secretary found that Kinsella retains a significant capability to sit, stand, walk, lift twenty pounds in weight, and frequently carry ten pound objects. The only medical evidence to support this finding are the reports of two non-examining physicians. These reports stand in sharp contrast to the medical evidence offered by every physician who examined Kinsella. Dr. Tramer, the Secretary\u2019s own consulting physician, concluded that \u201c[a]n ongoing status of a high degree of functional limitation is to be anticipated. Walking, sitting, bending, squatting, carrying of any significant degree are not within the capabilities of Mrs. Kinsel-la.\u201d Dr. Collins, who examined-Kinsella one time, concluded that Kinsella should partake in mild daily exercises and that she avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous exertion. He observed that his examination suggested no neurologic defect but that Kinsella\u2019s pain was probably secondary to diffuse osteoarthritis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These examining physicians agreed with the conclusions of every treating physician. Dr. Irwin found that Kinsella remained in pain after surgery on her back. Dr. Pazirandeh instructed Kinsella not to bend, stand, or sit for prolonged periods. Dr. Nemunaitis observed that Kinsella\u2019s ability to rise from a squatting position was limited by pain and that she could not work because of the degenerated disc.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the evidence of examining and treating physicians is entitled to substantially greater weight than the evidence of non-examining physicians, <em>Hephner </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>574 F.2d 359, 362 (6th Cir.1978); <em>Miracle v. Celebrezze, </em>351 F.2d 361, 373 (6th Cir.1965); <em>see also Allen v. Weinberger, </em>552 F.2d 781, 786 (7th Cir. 1977); <em>Martin v. Secretary HEW, </em>492 F.2d 905, 908 (4th Cir.1974); <em>Landess v. Wein-berger, </em>490 F.2d 1187, 1190 (8th Cir.1974), the Secretary\u2019s finding is based upon an improper weighing of the medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-11\">The Secretary based his determination upon the claimant\u2019s testimony as to her daily activities, finding that \u201cKinsella is capable of doing numerous tasks around the house despite the fact that she complains of being unable to remain in one position more than approximately twelve minutes.\u201d The relevant testimony is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-12\">Q. [by Administrative Law Judge] You can\u2019t use your hands for\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-13\">A. [by Kinsella] Well, I can use them, but with difficulty. And, in the morning, I find dressing difficult. That\u2019s why I have to allow myself maybe 2, 3 hours to sort of get the kinks out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-14\">sj: *}c <em>% M </em>\u2022}: sfc</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-15\">Q.

I don\u2019t make like potatoes because there\u2019s too much involvement to peel it. And, if I have something it would be like frozen potatoes, or I would put a roast in, and then the family would, as they go along, slice it. It\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-19\">Q. Do you shop for groceries?</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-20\">A. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-21\">Q. Who does?</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-22\">A. My husband and my daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-23\">Q. Give me a typical day from the time you get up in the morning until the time you retire. What time do you get up and what do you do after that?</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-24\">A. Well, I get up about 5:00 because by then I need a pain pill, and I have a bowl of cereal, and I take a pain pill. And then, I lie down on the couch for about a V2 hour, and then I, I generally then go down in the basement, and my daughter is up by then, and we go downstairs, and I throw in a load of wash, and while that load is being washed, I take a shower and my daughter helps me \u2019cause I have trouble with my back. And then, when that wash is dry, she puts in the \u2014 I put it in the dryer and then I go upstairs and I watch Dave Patterson for a little while on the couch, sitting down. And then, if I\u2019m going to have dinner, you know, whatever, whatever I\u2019m going to have, like if I\u2019m going to have a beef roast, I\u2019ll put that in the oven then, or my patties \u2014I\u2019ll make what I\u2019m going to have in the morning. And then, I\u2019ll make the beds maybe about 1:00 o\u2019clock. And, in the meantime, I\u2019m sitting down all the, off and on. And, I hate to say it, but that\u2019s about my life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-26\">Q. All right. What do you do in the afternoons?</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-27\">A. Well, maybe I\u2019ll go out in the yard and just kind of walk around and look at my son\u2019s garden a little bit, and come in. Maybe by then the roast will be ready. I\u2019ll take it out and\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-28\">Q. What time do you have supper?</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-29\">A. Well, we eat about 3:00.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-30\">Q.

When do they work?</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-33\">A. My son, my 20-year-old son works the night shift too for, with the government. And, my daughter goes to work about 12:30, and she comes home about 9:00. So, when she comes home, whatever is left \u2014 like meat and potatoes, she \u2014 they really, they kind of do for themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-34\">Q. Okay. What time do you retire? Well, what do you do after supper?</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-35\">A. I usually lay down on the couch and fall asleep. And then I get up and I pack or I sort of get together what my husband and my son are going to have for their lunch, at least put out what they\u2019re going to have. They pack their lunches, but I get out the fruit and things. And maybe I\u2019ll get a call on the phone or something.</p>\n<p id=\"A0_\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-36\">Q.

We have a schoolyard right across the street from us, which I used to take him and he played in that all the time, and now I tell him, \"I\u2019ll stand by the curb, and you run over there, and I\u2019ll watch you while you go over.\u201d Which, I like being with him; I\u2019d rather be over there with him, but I, I know I can\u2019t do the walking and running after him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-39\">This testimony was supported by Kinsel-la\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-40\">Q.

Well, in minutes or \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to describe it. Not very far. Like, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>the house, for instance, she\u2019ll, she\u2019ll be up for maybe 10 minutes, 12, then she\u2019ll sit down. And, she\u2019ll sit down for maybe 10 minutes, 15 minutes, get up. It seems to be a constant up and down.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\">Q. You mean she never sits more than 10 minutes or stand more than 10 minutes?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">A. Maybe a little more. Fifteen, something like that, But, very close to that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">Q. Does she watch television programs?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">A. She\u2019ll sit down to watch them, but not very long.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">Q. How long?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">A. Maybe 10 minutes or so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">Q.

I don\u2019t think she has one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-14\">Q. Now, does she drive?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-15\">A. She can drive; she doesn\u2019t drive much.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-16\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-17\">Q. ... [d]oes your wife fix your meals for you?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-18\">A.

Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-23\">Q. All right. Who shops for groceries?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-24\">A. I do most of the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-25\">Q. Have you always done that?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-26\">A. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-27\">Q. When, when did you start?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-28\">A. She used to do the shopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-29\">Q. She used to do the shopping? When did you start doing the shopping?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-30\">A. Oh, I\u2019d say within the last 3 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-31\">Q. Why?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-32\">A. Because she didn\u2019t seem to be able to get up. She always had some pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-33\">Q. Now, while she was working, who was doing the shopping?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-34\">A. While she was working, she was shopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-35\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-36\">Q. You don\u2019t know how often she takes medication, do you?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-37\">A. Like weekends, I know that she wakes up at least a couple of times during the night, and she has to go get medication. This I know.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-38\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-39\">Q. [by Kinsella\u2019s attorney] In regard to the household, what jobs or chores or activities around the house did she formerly do, say, prior to her back operation, that she doesn\u2019t do, or isn\u2019t able to do now?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-40\">A. Well, she used to cook regular meals for everybody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-41\">Q. Does she do that now?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-42\">A. Oh, no, no.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-43\">Q. Has she since that time?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-44\">A. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-45\">Q. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-46\">A. And, she used to do the regular work. The vacuuming, and the laundry and everything by herself. She was, she was a very hard worker. She\u2019d come home and she would do all of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-47\">Q. Okay. Now, who \u2014 for instance, who does the vacuuming?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-48\">A. Well, between me and, and my daughter, we usually do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-49\">Q. Okay. And, how about scrubbing the floors?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-50\">A. I do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-51\">Q. Washing the windows?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-52\">A. I do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-53\">Q. Taking out the trash?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-54\">A. I do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-55\">Q. Have you noticed any difference in your wife\u2019s ability, her ability to relate to you or to other members of the family since her back operation? For instance, short-tempered or anything of that sort?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-56\">A. Yeah. She\u2019s, she\u2019s become quite short-tempered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>Q. And, is that, can you trace that directly to about that period of time when she had this back operation, or sometime after-wards, or before that?</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">A. I noticed this when, as the pain seems to get worse, she seems to become more aggravated about things, anything\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">Q. Did she formerly, did she formerly ... watch TV or read? ... Read. Books, magazines\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">A. Oh, read? Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh yeah. She used to read. She\u2019d like movie magazines and she watched television shows. She\u2019s\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">Q.

Is \u2014 does she read anything now?</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-12\">A. I don\u2019t think she, she would read more than one article in a, in a paper or\u2014 not even an article in a magazine. She doesn\u2019t seem to sit that long. She\u2019ll pick something up and put it down within a few minutes, and she\u2019ll be\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-13\">Q. Does she seem to be interested in current events, what\u2019s going on in the world today, this type of thing?</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-14\">A. We discuss it, and that\u2019s about all. She\u2019ll hear it on a radio that\u2019s in the\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-15\">Q. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-16\">A. \u2014she has in the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-17\">Q. At length.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-18\">A. No, no. It\u2019s just short \u2014 no long discussions anymore.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-19\">Q. Did you formerly \u2014 was your communication between the two of you pretty good formerly? I mean\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-20\">A. Oh, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-21\">Q. \u2014did you talk a lot?</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-22\">A. Oh, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-23\">Q. Has that changed?</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-24\">A. Oh, yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-25\">Q. In what way?</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-26\">A. Well, it\u2019s \u2014 she just doesn\u2019t \u2014 she seems to go from one thing to another in short spurts now. It\u2019s nothing at any length.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-27\">Q. Did she formerly use to drive the car pretty regularly or fairly frequently?</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-28\">A. Oh, yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-29\">Q. Now \u2014 who does the driving now?</p>\n<p id=\"az-dedup-0\">A. Well, I do most of the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-30\">These excerpts reveal that the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that Kinsella is capable of doing numerous tasks around the house is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-31\">The Secretary based his determination upon the \u201cfact\u201d that the use of medication would indicate no more than moderate pain. The evidence before the Secretary was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-32\">Q. [by Administrative Law Judge] All right. Do you have your medicines with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-33\">A. [by Kinsella] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-34\">Q. May I see them? And, how often do you take the Tolectin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-35\">A. Three times a day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-36\">Q. And, how long have you been taking them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-37\">A. Well, I, I\u2019ve been taking them since January. No,- no. It wasn\u2019t January. Probably February he started me on that \u2014 he did. But, I had taken it with other doctors before. But, this is in a stronger dosage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-38\">Q. All right, Now, this Tolectin has a notation on there that the prescription was filled on February, on April 29th, 1980, and you are not supposed to start taking them until 2 weeks after that date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-39\">A. Because he, Dr. Jimenez had put me on steroids, and when I went to visit him, I was to take Imipramine for one week, and then the next week, I was to take Tendorel, and when I was through with those 2 medicines, I would then take the Tolectin, and he didn\u2019t want me mixing them because apparently, these steroids, they don\u2019t want to mix stuff with those.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayu-dedup-0\">Q. Now, how often do you take the Per-codan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>A. I\u2019ve taken Percodan at times as much as 8 times a day. I\u2019ve taken it \u2014 generally, I try to keep it down to 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-5\">Q. How often do you take the Valium?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a9c-dedup-0\">A. Oh, not every night. Maybe 2 nights a week, I take it. I only take it at night when I go to bed. That was the only time I\u2019ve ever taken it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-6\">Q. Do you take this regularly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-7\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-8\">Q. Are you still under the care of Dr. Conan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-10\">Q. How often do you see him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-11\">A. I\u2019ve been seeing him maybe every other week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-12\">Q. What do you see him for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-13\">A. I have a great deal of bladder infections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-14\">Q. He\u2019s treating you for bladder problems?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-15\">A. Yeah. He\u2019s a urologist; he\u2019s a specialist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-16\">Q. Now, how come he, he gives you Valium? Do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-17\">A. Because when I started having these problems, he thought that would calm me down, Dr. Conan did. And, seeing as I had these prescriptions left, Dr. Jimenez said use it up, and then I will give you a refill. He wouldn\u2019t want to give me another refill unless I would throw them out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-18\">Q. Well, what, what do you take the Percodan for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-19\">A. Pain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-20\">Q. Pain where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-21\">A. In the back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-22\">Q. How come Dr. Conan prescribes it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"acs-dedup-0\">A. \u2019Cause he is very aware of the pain that I\u2019ve been having. He\u2019s seen me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9qE\">Q. Doesn\u2019t Dr. Jimenez agree with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ae_-dedup-0\">A. Yes, he knows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-23\">Q. And, how long have you been taking Percodan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-24\">A. This is \u201980. Well, probably since, probably since June of, June or July of 1979.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1123-25\">Dr. Tramer, the Secretary\u2019s consulting physician, reported that \u201c[hjopefully under the program which is being instituted, there will be a lesser need for Percodan which is a narcotic.\u2019\u2019 Again, there is no evidence, much less substantial evidence, to support the Secretary\u2019s finding that the medication indicated no more than moderate pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-27\">The Secretary based his decision on Kin-sella\u2019s appearance at the hearing and that her complaints of pain were not credible. This is how Kinsella described the pain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"arm-dedup-2\">Q. [by Administrative Law Judge] Okay. Now do you have any difficulty walking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-28\">A. [by Kinsella] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-29\">Q. Can you describe that difficulty? What happens?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-30\">A. When I walk, it feels as though it\u2019s going to, as though my leg is going to spasm behind the knee, and I don\u2019t know \u2014it\u2019s a funny way to describe this, but I feel if I walk like I have a diaper on \u2014 I have less trouble walking, as though if I throw my body, it doesn\u2019t seem to put as much pressure on the back and, and the pain in the back doesn\u2019t bother me as much if I walk kind of like, hop along, kind of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-31\">Q. Do you have any difficulty standing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajbg\">A. Oh, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-32\">Q. What problems do you have in standing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-33\">A. Well, it feels like a knife is cutting right into, into the, into the back of my back and into my spine, and the longer I stand, the worse it gets until I have to sort of stoop over and take the pressure off, sort of, off the, that leg and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcY_\">Q. How long can you stand before that happens?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-34\">A. Well, if I stand, by the time I\u2019m standing 10 minutes, I, I feel that I\u2019ve got problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-35\">Q. Do you have difficulty sitting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-36\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-37\">Q. What problems do you have sitting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"akj-dedup-0\">A. Well, it feels like there\u2019s something pressing on something all the time. It works into the hip \u2014 it\u2019s like a muscle tightening, and you sort of have to move your position around to sort of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>Q. But, you don\u2019t have pain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-4\">A. It\u2019s a pain, but it\u2019s a dead kind of pain. The standing is a real sharp pain where you could\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-5\">Q. Do you have any difficulty using your hands?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-6\">A. Yeah, yeah. I have arthritis bad in this hand, and this \u2014 sometimes this hand is so bad I can\u2019t even pick up things; I can\u2019t button things; I have difficulty putting on\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-7\">Although Kinsella complained repeatedly during the hearing about the pain she was then suffering, the Secretary found that \u201cshe sat through the hearing which lasted IV2 hours without any apparent discomfort.\u201d Every treating physician found Kin-sella\u2019s complaints of pain credible enough to require treatment. Her expressions of pain were supported by objective medical evidence. Testimony of a claimant concerning subjective pain and inability to perform even light work is entitled to great weight, particularly where it is supported by competent medical evidence. <em>Dobrowolsky v. Cal-ifano, </em>606 F.2d 403, 409 (3d Cir.1979). <em>See also Lewis v. Weinberger, </em>541 F.2d 417, 421 (4th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-8\">The only apparent basis for the Secretary\u2019s credibility finding is that \u201c [although she claims that she was unable to work in 1977, she filed for unemployment compensation in 1978 exhibiting the fact that she felt she was capable of working at that time.\u201d Of course, the mere receipt of unemployment insurance benefits does not prove ability to work. <em>Lackey v. Celebrezze, </em>349 F.2d 76, 79 (4th Cir.1965); <em>Flores v. HEW, </em>465 F.Supp. 317, 322-24 (S.D.N.Y.1978). Moreover, in the context of all the evidence, it was unreasonable to infer that the application for such benefits diminished the credibility of Kinsella\u2019s complaints of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-9\">It is true the credibility determinations rest exclusively with the Secretary. <em>Myers v. Richardson, </em>471 F.2d 1265, 1267 (6th Cir. 1972). But, viewing the record as a whole, <em>Allen v. Califano, </em>613 F.2d 139, 145 (6th Cir.1980), when such a credibility determination is based upon so slender a reed, and is contradicted by the overwhelming medical and testimonial evidence indicating disabling pain, the Secretary\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-11\">I believe we should not allow this manifestly unjust decision to stand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">. Dr. Collin\u2019s finding that the claimant had a good range with no pain or swelling in the major joints is not inconsistent with the other medical evidence because the pain Kinsella complained of was not in the major joints, but emanating from her back.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">. The district court\u2019s interpretation of Dr. Nem-unaitis\u2019s report is clearly erroneous. After discussing the results of his examination and reporting disc changes, muscle spasm, and dysfunctional pain, Dr. Nemunaitis said: \u201cShe was treated conservatively with medication on a monthly basis from January through May of 1980 and continues to be symptomatic with minimal mechanical stress.\u201d The only fair reading of this statement is that Kinsella suffers dysfunctional pain when subjected to minimal mechanical stress.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
