Shultz, and Paul B. Baker (defendants). The jury rendered a special verdict in the amount of $50,000 in favor of Phil Rasmussen against the three defendants. Although there was a slight ambiguity in the verdict, the trial judge entered a judgment in that amount against the defendants. In the special verdict, however, the jury determined that Neil Rasmussen and Herman Zobrist were not entitled to damages and judgment was entered accordingly. In No. 82-1055, the defendants appeal from the judgment in favor of Phil Rasmussen, while in No. 82-1104, Neil Rasmussen and Herman Zobrist appeal from the judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-16\">Both appeals arise from the same business transaction, the organization of Coal-X, Ltd./\u201976 (Coal-X \u201976), a Utah limited partnership formed to raise venture capital for a coal mining operation in West Virginia. Coal-X, Inc. is the general partner in Coal-X \u201976. At the time relevant here, the summer of 1976, Emmet Shultz was the president and a director of Coal-X, Inc., while Paul Baker was a vice-president and a director of that entity. While employed by the Huntsman Coal Company, Shultz, with the assistance of independent geologists, evaluated a certain coal property in West Virginia. Based on those evaluations, the Huntsman Coal Company entered into a sublease which granted it the right to develop the coal on that property. The company prepared a private placement memorandum and certain projections in anticipation of selling limited partnership interests to finance the development of the property. Later, for disputed reasons, Huntsman Coal Company abandoned the project and sold its entire interest in the project, including the private offering materials, to Shultz for $5,000. Shultz subsequently left Huntsman Coal Company and prepared to develop the coal property through Coal-X \u201976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1514\">*1514</page-number>Pursuant to section 4(2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Securities Act of 1933, and rule 146<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> promulgated thereunder, interests in Coal-X \u201976 were marketed through a private placement offering. Accordingly, interests in Coal-X \u201976 could be offered only to a limited number of investors, all of whom either possessed \u201csuch knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that [they were] capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment\u201d or were persons \u201cwho [were] able to bear the economic risk of the investment\u201d. Rule 146(d)(1), 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.146 (1981) (removed at 47 Fed. Reg. 11261 (1982)). Herman Zobrist, Neil Rasmussen, and Phil Rasmussen were among the investors contacted by the defendants to purchase interests in Coal-X \u201976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-4\">Shultz and Baker, and their representatives, met with Zobrist and the Rasmussens several times over a period of about thirty to forty-five days before any interests were sold. At those meetings, the defendants described the investment as a good opportunity and provided oral and written projections which presented the potential benefits of the investment. Although there was conflict in the evidence, the jury apparently determined that Baker represented to Phil Rasmussen that the investment \u201ccouldn\u2019t miss\u201d and was a \u201csure thing\u201d. When Phil Rasmussen challenged those assertions, the defendants assured him that there were \u201cno risks\u201d in the investment and that they would guarantee with their stock that the investment would work out as projected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-5\">Either prior to the time the Rasmussens and Zobrist purchased their interests in Coal-X \u201976, or shortly thereafter, the defendants provided each of those investors with a Private Placement Memorandum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The memorandum clearly and specifically stated the risks involved in the investment, including the lack of a firm output contract, the speculative nature of coal mining, the fluctuation of metallurgical coal prices in response to fluctuations in steel production, and competition from larger, more experienced coal mining companies. Prior to the time of their purchases, Zobrist and the Rasmussens each signed an \u201cApplication Form and Subscription Agreement\u201d which included a statement that the investor recognized that the investment was subject to the risks set forth in the Private Placement Memorandum. Phil Rasmussen also completed and signed an \u201cInvestment Questionnaire\u201d wherein he responded affirmatively to questions inquiring whether he had read the memorandum and whether he understood the nature of the investment and the risks involved. It is undisputed, nevertheless, that Zobrist and the Rasmussens in fact did not read the Private Placement Memorandum prior to investing in Coal-X \u201976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-10\">Herman Zobrist and Phil Rasmussen each purchased two units in Coal-X \u201976 at $35,000 per unit and Neil Rasmussen purchased one unit. Pursuant to Utah law, each investor was afforded an opportunity to rescind his purchase but declined to do so. Due to permitting problems and unusually severe weather, Coal-X \u201976 did not commence commercial production until 1977. After production began, labor strikes impeded the development of the venture and declining steel production depressed the price offered for metallurgical coal. Consequently, Coal-X \u201976 lost between $800,000 and $900,-000 between 1977 and 1979, which in turn reduced the value of a limited partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number>interest in Coal-X \u201976. Gulf Energy, a parent of Coal-X, Inc., loaned over $800,000 to Coal-X \u201976 to keep the mine in operation. The mine remains in operation today and has produced at levels exceeding what was originally projected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-5\">In 1979, however, the Rasmussens and Zobrist became convinced that the investment had missed, and filed this action, claiming damages as a result of violations of section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Phil Rasmussen claimed that the defendants\u2019 assertions and guarantees that the investment involved no risk were misrepresentations of material facts in violation of rule 10b-5. In addition, the Rasmussens and Zobrist asserted that the defendants violated rule 10b-5 by failing to disclose material facts. The jury, in a special verdict, found that each of the defendants knowingly violated rule 10b-5 by misrepresenting material facts to Phil Rasmussen, that he justifiably relied on those misrepresentations, and that as a result, he suffered $50,000 in damages. With respect to Neil Rasmussen and Herman Zo-brist, however, the jury found that while the defendants violated rule 10b-5 by knowingly failing to disclose material facts to those investors, the investors had not justifiably relied on those failures to disclose. Thus, the jury found that Neil Rasmussen and Zobrist were not entitled to any damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-14\">On appeal, the primary contention of the defendants is that, as a matter of law, Phil Rasmussen\u2019s reliance on the misrepresentations that the investments involved no risk could not be \u201cjustifiable\u201d when those representations were contradicted by the warnings in the Private Placement Memorandum, which he failed to read. The defendants also contend that there was not evidence to support the damage award of $50,-000, that the damage award was based on an ambiguous special jury verdict, and that the trial court\u2019s instruction on scienter was erroneous.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The cross-appellants, Neil Rasmussen and Zobrist, contend that because the defendants failed to disclose material facts, reliance should have been presumed. In addition, Zobrist and both the Rasmus-sens argue that the trial court erred in not granting them a rescissional measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-17\">We will first examine the contention of the defendants that Phil Rasmussen did not \u201cjustifiably rely\u201d on the misrepresentations as to the risk involved in the invest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>ments. In a misrepresentation case under rule 10b-5, a plaintiff generally must establish that in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, the defendant, with scien-ter, made a false representation of a material fact upon which the plaintiff justifiably relied to his or her detriment. <em>See Holdsworth v. </em>Strong, 545 F.2d 687, 694 (10th Cir.1976), (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 955, 97 S.Ct. 1600, 51 L.Ed.2d 805 (1977). In the instant case, the jury found that the defendants did make the \u201cno risk\u201d representations, that Phil Rasmussen relied on those misrepresentations, and that such reliance was justifiable. The defendants argue that since Phil Rasmussen was a sophisticated businessman with prior investment experience, his reliance on the no risk representations without reading the Private Placement Memorandum, which expressly warned of risks, was not justifiable as a matter of law. Phil Rasmussen responds that the jury examined the defendants\u2019 entire course of conduct in finding that his reliance was justifiable. If the effect of such conduct can be mitigated by \u201cboiler plate\u201d recitations of risk in a prospectus, he contends, the prospectus will become a shield behind which promoters can safely hide while boldly making fraudulent misstatements to investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-5\">In essence, both parties request that this court examine the prospectus and the conduct of the parties independent of one another and seek to focus our attention on the elements which support their respective contentions. To determine whether reliance was justifiable, however, we must examine all of the elements of the transaction. Justifiable reliance is not a theory of contributory negligence; rather, it is a limitation on a rule 10b-5 action which insures that there is a causal connection between the misrepresentation and the plaintiff\u2019s harm. <em>Holdsworth v. Strong, supra </em>at 694-95. Only when the plaintiff\u2019s conduct rises to a level of culpable conduct comparable to that of the defendant\u2019s will reliance be unjustifiable. <em>Id. </em>at 693. In this circuit, such conduct must amount to at least reckless behavior. <em>See Hackbart v. Holmes, </em>675 F. 2d 1114, 1117 (10th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-8\">Courts have examined a number of factors in determining whether reliance on misrepresentations is justifiable in a particular fact situation. In <em>Holdsworth v. Strong, </em>for example, the plaintiff was an attorney and accountant who had access to the relevant corporate books and records. On the basis of misrepresentations by a close business and personal friend, the plaintiff sold his stock in the corporation without first examining the corporate books and records. Three judges of an equally divided court concluded that under those circumstances, the plaintiff\u2019s reliance was justifiable, despite his sophistication and failure to investigate, because the defendant had carefully cultivated the plaintiff\u2019s trust and confidence over a long period of time, and then used that trust to encourage the sale. <em>Id. </em>at 696-97. It must be noted, however, that the judges also concluded that an examination of the corporate books and records would not have revealed the falsity of the defendant\u2019s representations. <em>Id. </em>at 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-9\">Similarly, a review of the cases from other circuits indicates that the following are all relevant factors in determining whether reliance was justifiable: (1) the sophistication and expertise of the plaintiff in financial and securities matters; (2) the existence of long standing business or personal relationships; (3) access to the relevant information; (4) the existence of a fiduciary relationship; (5) concealment of the fraud; (6) the opportunity to detect the fraud; (7) whether the plaintiff initiated the stock transaction or sought to expedite the transaction; and (8) the generality or specificity of the misrepresentations. <em>See G. A. Thompson &amp; Co., Inc. v. Partridge, </em>636 F.2d 945, 955 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Nye v. Blyth Eastman Dillon &amp; Co., Inc., </em>588 F.2d 1189, 1197 (8th Cir.1978); <em>Straub v. Vaisman &amp; Co., </em>540 F.2d 591, 598 (3d Cir.1976); <em>Hughes v. Dempsey-Tegeler &amp; Co., Inc., </em>534 F.2d 156, 176-77 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 896, 97 S.Ct. 259, 50 L.Ed.2d 180 (1976). No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1517\">*1517</page-number>single factor is determinative; all relevant factors must be considered and balanced to determine whether reliance was justified. <em>See, e.g., Holdsworth v. Strong, supra </em>at 696-97; <em>Nye v. Blyth Eastman Dillon &amp; Co., Inc., supra </em>at 1197; <em>Straub v. Vaisman &amp; Co., supra </em>at 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-5\">This court has not articulated a standard by which it can be determined whether in light of the circumstances the reliance was justifiable. At a minimum, though, \u201ca plaintiff may not reasonably or justifiably rely on a misrepresentation where its falsity is palpable.\u201d <em>Holdsworth v. Strong, </em>545 F.2d at 694. The trial court here instructed the jury that the test to be applied was whether the plaintiff\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5Fd\">reliance was justified; that he did not intentionally close his eyes and refuse to investigate, concerning the circumstances, in disregard of a risk known to him, or so obvious that he must be taken to have been aware of it, and so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1575-6\">[Joint App., Vol. I, p. 288]. This standard is followed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, <em>Gower v. Cohn, </em>643 F.2d 1146, 1156 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Dupuy v. Dupuy, </em>551 F.2d 1005, 1020 (5th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 312, 54 L.Ed.2d 197 (1977), and we consider it appropriate to apply in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-8\">In considering the factors and applying the test to determine whether Phil Rasmussen\u2019s reliance was justified, however, we are confronted with an unusual factual situation. While in other cases the plaintiff failed to investigate information to which he had access, <em>Holdsworth v. Strong, supra </em>at 692, or to read information which the defendants provided, <em>Nye v. Blyth Eastman Dillon &amp; Co., supra </em>at 1197, we have found no relevant cases wherein the plaintiff failed to read a prospectus or equivalent document which disclosed information in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is our view that while the full and fair disclosure of information in the Private Placement Memorandum is a relevant factor which favors the defendants here, such disclosure is not determinative, even though Phil Rasmussen was a sophisticated and knowledgeable investor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-13\">We observe, however, that had Phil Rasmussen read the Private Placement Memorandum, he undeniably would have been notified of the risks of the investment. Indeed, prominently displayed on the first page of the Private Placement Memorandum was the following warning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-14\">THESE SECURITIES INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. See \u201cRisk and Special Factors\u201d and \u201cWho Should Invest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1575-15\">The section entitled \u201cWho Should Invest\u201d began on page 8 of the memorandum and included several monitions, beginning with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-16\">Investment in the Units offered hereby may be considered to involve a high degree of risk, and is suitable only for investors of substantial net worth who are willing to purchase an investment which cannot be easily liquidated and may not provide immediate cash returns. There is no public or other market likely to develop for the Units and their transferability is restricted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1575-17\">In the four pages under the heading of \u201cRisks and Special Factors\u201d, the risks associated with coal mining and the limited partnership form were succinctly presented. In addition, early in the memorandum the following warning appeared: \u201cNo person has been authorized to give any information or to make any representations not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1518\">*1518</page-number>tained in this Memorandum ... and, if given or made, such information or representations must not be relied upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-4\">Of course, we do not imply that the defendants can disclaim responsibility for their misrepres\u00e9ntations simply by disclosing the risks in the memorandum and therein warning investors not to rely on representations not contained within the memorandum. Had Phil Rasmussen read the memorandum, though, there would be a substantial question whether his reliance on the original misrepresentations of no risk, absent further inquiry, would be justifiable. Since the memorandum expressly .contradicted the representations, he would have to show compelling reasons for passively accepting the contradictions. In the sense of proving justifiable reliance, Phil Rasmussen is consequently in a better position than he would have been had he read the memorandum and yet relied on the original misrepresentations. While we are not certain that this result would encourage investors to throw caution and prospectuses to the wind, we see no reason to reward investors who do so. <em>See Straub </em>v. <em>Vaisman &amp; Co., Inc., </em>540 F.2d at 597-98. Thus, it is our view that knowledge of information contained in a prospectus or an equivalent document authorized by statute or regulation, should be imputed to investors who fail to read such documents. We thus hold that Phil Rasmussen must be charged with constructive knowledge of the risks and warnings contained in the Private Placement Memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-5\">Charging Phil Rasmussen with constructive knowledge does no more than place him in a position equal to that of a cautious investor. We are imputing knowledge of information only to the extent to which such information actually was disclosed. That is, we do not charge him with information that a knowledgeable investor would infer from the printed words or numbers; we impute knowledge of the printed words or numbers only. Nor does such constructive knowledge alter the standard of justifiable reliance. The only consequence of imputing knowledge of the contents of the Private Placement Memorandum to Phil Rasmussen is that when the various factors are considered in evaluating justifiable reliance, his conduct must be examined as if he were aware of the warnings contained in the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-8\">Under the circumstances of this case, when we impute to Phil Rasmussen knowledge of the warnings contained in the Private Placement Memorandum, it becomes clear that, as a matter of law, his reliance on the misrepresentations was not justified. We reach this conclusion after a consideration of the above noted factors. It is true that Phil Rasmussen previously participated in investments with Baker, but there was no evidence of any long standing business or personal relationship that, in light of the patent contradiction between Baker\u2019s representations and the express warnings disclosed in the Private Placement Memorandum, would justify Rasmussen\u2019s reliance on Baker\u2019s representations without further inquiry. Not only did the defendants not conceal their fraud from Rasmussen, they provided him with information and warnings which exposed the representations as false. It was not necessary for Rasmussen to delve into voluminous books and records, or to decipher balance sheets and financial statements; the warning on the first page of the memorandum contradicted the representations of no risk, and there were four full pages devoted to concise, informative descriptions of the risks inherent in coal mining and partnerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-9\">In short, there is simply no evidence which provides a valid reason for. Rasmussen\u2019s reliance on the general misrepresentations as to risk when he is considered to have knowledge of the specific warnings contained in the memorandum. We do not say that such reliance might not be justified under different factual circumstances. We simply conclude that, in this case, when knowledge of the disclosed risks is imputed to Phil Rasmussen, it is evident that he acted recklessly by intentionally closing his eyes to and failing to investigate the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1519\">*1519</page-number>tradiction between the misrepresentations and the information in the memorandum. As a matter of law, Phil Rasmussen could not rely on the misrepresentations without further inquiry. The fact that he may be able to prove a breach of contract under state law on the guarantee does not alter our conclusion that Rasmussen\u2019s reckless conduct bars recovery under rule 10b-5. <em>Broad v. Rockwell International Corp., </em>614 F.2d 418, 438-39 (5th Cir.1980), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>642 F.2d 929 (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 965, 102 S.Ct. 506, 70 L.Ed.2d 380 (1981). <em>See also Santa Fe Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>430 U.S. 462, 478, 97 S.Ct. 1292, 1303, 51 L.Ed.2d 480 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-6\">The cross-appellants, Neil Rasmussen and Herman Zobrist, contend that the defendants wilfully and knowingly failed to disclose material information.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Zobrist and Neil Rasmussen contend that the information was material as a matter of law. Consequently, they argue, under <em>Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 128, 92 S.Ct. 1456, 31 L.Ed.2d 741 (1972), reliance should be presumed. We do not dispute the cross-appellant\u2019s contentions; indeed, the trial court correctly instructed the jury on these matters and the jury expressly found that the information was material. Pursuant to another instruction, however, the jury also found that Neil Rasmussen and Zobrist did not prove \u201creliance\u201d. The cross-appellants challenge the jury\u2019s conclusion by vaguely arguing that the trial court\u2019s \u201creliance\u201d instruction can be read to suggest that the cross-appellants had to prove actual reliance. The cross-appellants do not specify any defect in the instruction, nor can we discern any.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-8\">After describing reliance and justifiable reliance in terms of a case of misrepresentation, the trial court instructed the jury on the element of reliance in a case of omission or failure to disclose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1577-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof is different with regard to the element of reliance when there is an intentional omission of a material fact, which makes a statement made misleading. With regard to such a claimed material omission, the burden of proof on the issue of reliance is different. If there had been an intentional omission of material fact, it would be difficult for the plaintiffs to prove that they relied on something they did not know and the law infers that the plaintiffs would have relied upon facts which are shown to be material and are intentionally withheld. Accordingly, <em>if </em>you <em>find from a preponderance of the evidence that there were material facts intentionally not disclosed to the plaintiffs in connection with the transactions in question, then the defendants and not the plaintiffs have the burden to demonstrate that even if the material facts had been disclosed, the plaintiffs\u2019 investment decision would not have been different.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKok\">[Jt.App.Vol. I at p. 288] (Emphasis added). We hold that this instruction properly informed the jury of the allocation of the burden of proof on the reliance issue in a case of failure to disclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-10\">In accordance with <em>Aifiliated Ute, </em>the instruction informed the jury that reliance could be inferred from a showing of materiality. The inference of reliance, however, is not conclusive. Most courts, as did the trial court here, simply shift the burden of proof of non-reliance to the defendant. <em>See Shores v. Sklar, </em>647 F.2d at 468.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1520\">*1520</page-number>court correctly instructed the jury that the defendant meets this burden when he establishes that the plaintiff\u2019s investment decision would not have been different even had the defendant disclosed the omitted material facts. <em>Id. </em>It is clear that the jury dutifully followed the trial court\u2019s instruction and found that although the omitted facts were material, the defendants proved that even if the information were disclosed the cross-appellants would not have acted differently. Inasmuch as the cross-appellants did not read the Private Placement Memorandum, there was substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-5\">In light of our disposition in this case, we need not consider the remaining contentions of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-6\">The judgment in No. 82-1055 is reversed and the judgment in 82-1104 is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1572-6\">.

However, I must respectfully dissent from the opinion as to No. 82-1055. The majority opinion, while purporting not to overrule our opinion in <em>Holdsworth v. </em>Strong, 545 F.2d 687 (10th Cir.1976) (en banc), <em>cert. </em>denied, 430 U.S. 955, 97 S.Ct. 1600, 51 L.Ed.2d 805 (1977), in fact cannot be reconciled with that precedent. Moreover, the majority\u2019s resolution of this issue defeats the main purpose of the securities law to protect from fraud and misrepresentation, unsoundly striking the balance in favor of the wrongdoers by penalizing a plaintiff for his neglect or recklessness in not discovering the defendants\u2019 intentional wrongs. All this is done without questioning the jury\u2019s well supported findings on the defendants\u2019 knowing misrepresentations or omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-17\">The majority opinion (pp. 1516-1517) agrees with the trial judge\u2019s statement in his charge to the jury of the test for justifiable reliance, and I likewise accept that test. The majority also correctly notes that <em>Holdsworth </em>held that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in Rule 10b-5 cases will bar recovery only when it \u201crises to a level of culpable conduct <em>comparable to that of the defendant </em>.... \u201d <em>(Ante </em>at 1516; emphasis added.) To me, however, the majority opinion\u2019s application of this rule is illogical. It observes that a defendant\u2019s liability must be based on misbehavior rising (or sinking) at least to the level of recklessness. The opinion labels plaintiff Phil Rasmussen\u2019s behavior \u201creckless\u201d and hence denies recovery. What is wanting is recognition of the fact that in light of the jury\u2019s unquestioned findings here, the defendants\u2019 conduct cannot be sanitized so as to say it was merely comparable to the plaintiff\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-18\">The jury specifically found otherwise and there is ample evidence in the record supporting the jury\u2019s finding that the defendants were guilty of material misrepresentations or omissions. The jury found that each of the defendants made untrue statements or omissions of material facts or otherwise attempted to defraud the plaintiffs, and that these acts were done \u201cknowingly.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, the jury found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1521\">*1521</page-number>plaintiff Phil Rasmussen \u201cjustifiably and reasonably relied\u201d thereon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority opinion (pp. 1517-1518) rejects the jury finding of justifiable reliance not by a process of showing a lack of credible testimony by plaintiff on knowing misrepresentations and omissions by the defendants; indeed the majority plainly base their reversal on the proposition that <em>\u201cthe defendants did not conceal their fraud </em>from Rasmussen, they provided him with information and warnings which exposed the representations as false.\u201d <em>(Ante </em>at 1518; emphasis added.) The jury\u2019s findings are overturned only by imputing to the plaintiff constructive knowledge of the Private Placement Memorandum. Thus the knowing misrepresentations or omissions are accepted as proven. The case then comes down to whether the important policies of the securities law and the regulation are served by imposing a loss on the plaintiff by imputing knowledge to him of the printed exculpatory statements and by exonerating the defendants who were found guilty of \u201cknowing\u201d wrongful conduct. <em>(See </em>concluding paragraph of note 1, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1579-5\"><em>Holdsworth </em>presented the occasion for this court to reevaluate the requirement of due diligence by the plaintiff in Rule 10b-5 actions in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976), that proof of defendant\u2019s scienter, an intent to defraud or deceive, is a necessary predicate to establish liability. In rejecting the argument for liability based on mere negligence, the Court there said the language of \u00a7 10(b) \u201cclearly connotes intentional misconduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 210, 96 S.Ct. at 1389 \u2014 the standard carefully followed by the trial judge in his charge here. <em>(See </em>note 1, <em>supra.) </em>The <em>Holdsworth </em>opinion concluded that if the plaintiff were required to prove both the defendant\u2019s scien-ter and his own due diligence, the remedy would be undesirably restricted. <em>Holds-worth </em>decided that \u201c[i]f contributory fault of plaintiff is to cancel out wanton or intentional fraud, it ought to be gross conduct somewhat comparable to that of defendant.\u201d 545 F.2d at 693. The opinion went on to note that at common law a plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was <em>not </em>a defense to intentional fraud. <em>Holdsworth </em>is thus in harmony with the antecedents to our present federal securities law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-10\">I am convinced that the resolution in <em>Holdsworth </em>of the competing policy consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1522\">*1522</page-number>erations was correct in light of <em>Ernst v. Ernst </em>and the common law underpinning of the securities law protections. One of the principal policies behind the Acts is to protect investors against fraud and, through the imposition of specified civil liabilities, to promote ethical standards of honesty and fair dealing. <em>Ernst </em>v. <em>Ernst, supra, </em>425 U.S. at 195, 96 S.Ct. at 1382; <em>Dupuy </em>v. <em>Dupuy, </em>551 F.2d 1005, 1019 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 312, 54 L.Ed.2d 197. The majority here is understandably concerned about aiding a plaintiff who has failed to read material furnished him concerning the investment. There are two responses to that concern.. First, the policy of prevention of fraud is' the core of the securities laws and must not be overlooked simply because other conflicting policies are also implicated. Indeed, not only in the area of securities but generally the policy of deterring intentional misconduct outweighs that of deterring negligent or reckless conduct. Precisely for this reason <em>Holdsworth </em>has been influential when other courts have reexamined these issues. <em>See, e.g., Dupuy v. Dupuy, supra, </em>551 F.2d at 1018.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he federal policy of deterring intentional misconduct in securities dealings outweighs the policy of deterring negligent behavior by investors.\u201d <em>Dupuy v. Dupuy, supra, </em>551 F.2d at 1019. Secondly, the jury here found for the plaintiff under a charge that clearly required the plaintiff to prove that he justifiably relied on the misrepresentations, \u201cthat he did not intentionally close his eyes and refuse to investigate, concerning the circumstances in disregard of a risk known to him, or so. obvious that he must be taken to have been aware of it, and so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow.\u201d (I J.A. 288).</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-4\">To satisfy the requirement of showing that defendants were guilty of intentional misconduct here, there was evidence before the jury of an extended period of discussions for 30 days or more by the defendants, repeatedly extolling the investments. For example, in comparing the Coal-X issue to other investment opportunities that Phil Rasmussen had been offered by Baker and his company, Baker said that the Coal-X venture was \u201cone of their best, probably the best.\u201d (II J.A. 374, 377). Rasmussen also testified that he raised all his doubts and questions in discussions with defendants on two occasions and that defendants repeatedly assured him that the deal was as good as it was presented to be, if not better. (II J.A. 375-77). Rasmussen testified that the project was described as \u201ca sure thing,\u201d a deal on which \u201cyou can\u2019t miss,\u201d and that the presentations made the offer appear \u201cso good that there was just no way that I should let it go by me.\u201d (II J.A. 374, 376). When the plaintiff said he would have to borrow the <em>money, </em>the defendants said they would \u201cguarantee\u201d the investment. (II J.A. 376-78). In fact, one of defendants\u2019 salesmen, Mr. Bleazard, testified that defendant Baker had said to Phil and Neil Rasmussen that they \u201cshould get in on this. It is a good deal. I have enough stock so that you don\u2019t have to worry about losing your money.\u201d (II J.A. 418).</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-7\">Using the projected profit figures supplied by the defendants, Phil Rasmussen figured that within eighteen months the cash flow would be sufficient for him to repay the money he borrowed to purchase the securities. (II J.A. 378). He further testified that, \u201cI was promised and guaranteed by Mr. Baker that would be a reality and I could do that.\u201d <em>(Id.). </em>And there was evidence that defendant Baker made only the slightest effort to encourage plaintiff Phil Rasmussen to read the prospectus. Plaintiff testified as follows (II J.A. 381):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aie-dedup-0\">I asked him, I said, \u201cAm I supposed to read this?\u201d And he said, \u201cwell, yes, you should.\u201d I said, \u201cThat is an all-night reading and I don\u2019t think I have the time or expertise.\u201d I said, \u201cTell me what I really ought to know about it.\u201d He said, <em>\u201cWell, I have really told you in the projections,\u201d and so forth.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1523\">*1523</page-number>Q. What about risks? Did he point out that document discusses risks involved in this venture?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1581-4\">A. No, he didn\u2019t point that out. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1581-5\">The projections referred to were two or three pages that painted a \u201crosy picture\u201d of the tax advantages and return that the defendants told Phil Rasmussen he could expect to receive from his investment. (II J.A. 373-74). Thus there was ample evidence before the jury to support its critical findings against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-6\">The cases relied on by the majority do not actually concern a plaintiff\u2019s recklessness. These cases, <em>Broad </em>and <em>Santa Fe Industries,' </em>do hold that not all misdeeds are actionable under Rule 10b-5. They are cited to support the proposition that although the defendants may have breached a promise to guarantee plaintiff\u2019s investment, such would be the basis for a state law claim only, not a 10b-5 claim. I cannot agree that these cases support setting aside the verdict and judgment here. First, the \u201cguarantee\u201d allegedly made here is, unlike the conduct at issue in <em>Broad </em>and in <em>Santa Fe Industries, </em>squarely within the range of fraudulent conduct addressed by Rule 10b-5. And second, the \u201cguarantee\u201d expressed is relevant to the issue of the reasonableness of the plaintiff\u2019s reliance here and was a proper part of the proof supporting the 10b-5 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-7\">In sum, the majority denies recovery to the plaintiff who was found to have justifiably relied on the defendants\u2019 knowingly made misrepresentations or omissions. The evidence supporting these findings is not challenged. The defendants are instead exonerated by a theory of constructive knowledge imputed to the plaintiff of the defendants\u2019 exculpatory boilerplate. Fashioning such a rule favoring those found guilty of knowing misconduct frustrates the important policy of the securities law and the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-9\">I concur in No. 82-1104. For the reasons stated I must respectfully dissent in No. 82-1055.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1578-12\">.

Rather, \u201cknowingly\u201d requires that the defendants acted with a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate or defraud; that they stated material facts which they knew to be false; or stated untrue facts with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity; or knew of the existence of material facts which were not disclosed although they knew that knowledge of those facts would be necessary to make their other statements not misleading.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0m\">I J.A. 287 (Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1579-11\">.
