We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">On September 27, 1980, Fischl applied in writing to O.E. Harring, Inc., a New Orleans automobile dealership, for credit covering $12,000 of the $15,000 purchase price of a 1980 BMW automobile. A Harring salesman referred Fischl\u2019s credit application to GMAC, communicating the information by telephone. After transcribing this information on an application form, GMAC employees contacted Credit Bureau Services, a local credit reporting service, and obtained a consumer report on Fischl.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Both the application and the consumer report reflected that Fischl, a 27 year-old single homeowner, made mortgage payments of $564.80 per month. Although he held two sales jobs and earned a total monthly income of approximately $4,000, the credit report erroneously referred to one position as past employment. Credit references listed on the application were VISA, MasterCharge, Diner\u2019s Club and General Electric Credit Corporation. The credit report disclosed that Fischl had achieved an A-l credit rating on current accounts with two area retailers, the New Orleans Public Service, First Homestead, and VISA or MasterCharge. An account in good standing with Sears, Roebuck and Company was mistakenly described in the report as a credit inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">After reviewing the application and report, Robert Bell, GMAC\u2019s credit supervisor, determined that Fischl\u2019s credit background was deficient in terms of duration and extent; specifically, there were no sustained monthly payments of an amount comparable to that required to finance the purchase of the BMW.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on these factors, Bell decided that credit at the level requested should not be extended, a decision approved by Lester Robinson, Bell\u2019s immediate superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">On October 3, 1980, Fischl received a form letter from GMAC advising that his application had been rejected and noting, as the reason therefor, that \u201ccredit references are insufficient.\u201d The portion of the form letter designed to disclose the creditor\u2019s use of information from outside sources was marked \u201cdisclosure inapplicable.\u201d That same day, Fischl secured a copy of his credit report from Credit Bureau Services which reflected GMAC\u2019s inquiry. In subsequent telephone conversations with Bell and Robinson, both of which he initiated, Fischl learned that GMAC had received a consumer report from a credit reporting service. During these conversations, more specific reasons for the denial of credit were advanced and the name and address of the credit bureau were given. Shortly thereafter, Fischl secured a $12,000 loan from an area bank at a lower rate of interest than that offered by GMAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">\n<em>Equal Credit Opportunity Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">The district court found that GMAC\u2019s adverse determination letter adequately informed Fischl of the basis for rejection of his credit application and, because the reason assigned therein was similar to one proposed in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s (Board) model checklist, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.-9(b)(2), that the creditor was insulated from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>liability under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691e(e). Fischl contends that the district court erred in holding that GMAC provided him with the specific reasons for credit denial mandated by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1691(b)(2) and (3) and Regulation B, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.9. He argues that the reason cited in GMAC\u2019s adverse determination letter, \u201ccredit references are insufficient,\u201d does not afford notice of the actual grounds for the denial, to-wit, the brevity of his credit history and the exces-siveness of the amount he wished to finance when measured against the size of his current credit obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Originally enacted in 1974 to prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, the ECOA was amended in 1976 to require creditors to furnish written notice of the specific reasons for adverse action taken against a consumer. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1691(d)(2) and (3)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Verbal notice is appropriate only if the creditor processed less than 150 credit applications during the preceding calendar year. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(d)(5). Perhaps the most significant of the 1976 amendments to the ECOA, these provisions were designed to fulfill the twin goals of consumer protection and education. As explained in the Senate report accompanying the 1976 amendments to the ECOA, Congress viewed the strict notice requirement as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-14\">a strong and necessary adjunct to the antidiscrimination purpose of the legislation, for only if creditors know they must explain their decisions will they effectively be discouraged from discriminatory practices. Yet this requirement fulfills a broader need: rejected credit applicants will now be able to learn where and how their credit status is deficient and this information should have a pervasive and valuable educational benefit. Instead of being told only that they do not meet a particular creditor\u2019s standards, consumers particularly should benefit from knowing, for example, that the reason for the denial is their short residence in the area, or their recent change of employment, or their already over-extended financial situation. In those cases where the creditor may have acted on misinformation or inadequate information, the statement of reasons gives the applicant a chance to rectify the mistake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>S.Rep. No. 94-589, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 403, 406.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Exercising the implementing authority conferred, by Congress, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691b, the Board substantially revised Regulation B to effectuate the 1976 amendments. Under \u00a7 202.9(a)(2)(i) of the revised regulation, a creditor electing to provide a statement of reasons for denial or termination of credit in accordance with \u00a7 1691(d)(2)(A) must apprise the applicant in writing of the specific reasons for its adverse action. Section 202.9(b)(2) reiterates the specificity requirement set forth in \u00a7 1691(d)(3), dictates the inclusion of the \u201cprincipal\u201d reasons for adverse action, and advises creditors that completion of the model form contained therein assures compliance with \u00a7 202.-9(a)(2)(i). In its most recent interpretation of \u00a7 202.9 of Regulation B, effective April 1, 1983, the Board opined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH9\">as a general principle the provisions of Regulation B [relating to disclosure of reasons for adverse action] apply equally to both judgmental and credit scoring systems of credit evaluation. The reasons for adverse action disclosed under \u00a7 202.9(a)(2) and (b)(2) must relate to factors actually scored or considered by the creditor. The creditor must disclose the specific reason or reasons for adverse action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.901(a). With respect to the proper use of the sample form outlined in \u00a7 202.9(b)(2), the Board emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">The sample form is illustrative and may not be appropriate for all creditors. It was designed to disclose those factors which creditors most commonly consider. Some of the reasons listed on the form could be misleading when compared to the factors actually scored. In such cases, it is improper to complete the form by simply checking the closest identifiable factor listed. For example, a creditor that considers only bank references (and disregards finance company references altogether) should disclose \u201cinsufficient bank references\u201d (not \u201cinsufficient credit references\u201d). Similarly, a creditor that considers bank references and other credit references as separate factors should treat the two factors separately in disclosing reasons. The creditor should either add those other factors to the form or check \u201cother\u201d and include the appropriate explanation. In providing reasons for adverse action, creditors need not describe how or why a factor adversely affected an applicant. For example, the notice may say \u201clength of residence\u201d rather than \u201ctoo short a period of residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.901(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">After considering the notice transmitted in light of the congressional language and purpose of \u00a7 1691(d), together with the Board\u2019s rational interpretation thereof, <em>see Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 100 S.Ct. 790, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980); <em>Whitfield v. Termplan, Inc., </em>651 F.2d 383 (5th Cir.1981), we find that GMAC\u2019s perfunctory reliance on the Board\u2019s sample checklist was manifestly inappropriate. While it resembles the category of \u201cinsufficient credit references\u201d deemed acceptable by the Board, \u00a7 202.-9(b)(2), the reason for refusal of credit noted by GMAC, \u201ccredit references are insufficient,\u201d arguably communicates a different meaning. The Board\u2019s statement connotes quantitative inadequacy; that of GMAC implies some qualitative deficiency in Fischl\u2019s credit status. GMAC\u2019s statement does not signal the nature of that deficiency and, since the name and address of the credit bureau was not supplied, did not provide the mandated opportunity for the applicant to correct erroneous information.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that GMAC\u2019s phrase \u201ccredit references are insufficient\u201d conveys substantially the same message as its regulatory counterpart, the notice provided in this case fails to satisfy the informative purposes of the ECOA. Upon receipt of GMAC\u2019s adverse determination letter, Fischl found himself in the dilemma described by one commentator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">The \u201cinsufficient credit references\u201d reason has been severely criticized by rejected applicants because it fails to tell them how they can meet the creditor\u2019s requirements. The statement only raises the question of what \u201csufficient\u201d is, and without further explanation, an applicant is left to speculate as to what will meet the creditor\u2019s standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Taylor, Meeting the Equal Opportunity Act\u2019s Specificity Requirement: Judgmental and Statistical Scoring Systems, 29 Buffalo L.Rev. 73, 90 (1980). <em>See generally </em>Reizen-stein, A Fresh Look at the ECOA, 14 Akron L.Rev. 215 (1980). The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department, both charged with administrative enforcement responsibilities under the ECOA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1691c and 1691e(h), have strictly construed \u00a7 1691(d)(3)\u2019s command in relation to several of the suggested reasons propounded in the Board\u2019s sample checklist. R. Clontz, Equal Credit Opportunity Manual at 5-24 (1983 Supp.). Use of such generic descriptive terms as \u201cinsufficient credit references\u201d or \u201cinsufficient credit file\u201d are not sanctioned by these governmental entities absent an explanation by the creditor of the manner in which the credit reference or file was insufficient. <em>Id. See, e.g., United States of America v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>[1980 Transfer Binder] Consumer Credit Guide (CCH) \u00b6 97,732 (D.D.C. May 29, 1979) (consent judgment obtained by Justice Department, enjoining Wards from using as the reason for adverse action such terms as \u201cinsufficient credit references\u201d without stating specifically in what respect the credit references were insufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Given that a combination of factors contributed to GMAC\u2019s adverse credit determination, the reason articulated was misleading, or at best excessively vague. <em>See Carroll v. Exxon Co., U.S.A., </em>434 F.Supp. 557 (E.D.La.1977). A GMAC employee acknowledged at trial that \u201cmany things can come under the definition of 'credit references are insufficient\u2019.\u201d Being unaware of the creditor\u2019s minimum standards of creditworthiness, Fischl was unable to translate this reason into concrete criteria. He could neither improve his credit application, correct any misinformation in his credit record, or guard against discrimination, thus thwarting both the educational and protective objectives of the ECOA. GMAC\u2019s subsequent oral clarification of the factors which actually motivated its adverse decision did not remedy this omission. 15 U.S.C. 1691(d)(2)(A). Consistent with the Board\u2019s recent admonition that the protection of \u00a7 1691e(e) may not be invoked where factors delineated in the sample checklist are misleading by comparison to those actually weighed, or do not coincide with those in fact relied upon, <em>see </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.901(f), we conclude that GMAC\u2019s conduct fell squarely within that proscribed by \u00a7 1691(d) and Regulation B.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Having found there was no liability, the district court did not evaluate Fischl\u2019s entitlement, under \u00a7 1691e, to actual damages, punitive damages or attorney\u2019s fees. When addressing this question on remand, the court is reminded that actual damages may include out-of-pocket monetary losses, injury to credit reputation and mental anguish, humiliation or embarrassment. <em>Anderson v. United Finance Co., </em>666 F.2d 1274 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Magee Finance Serv. of Bogalusa, Inc., </em>476 F.Supp. 758 (E.D.La.1979). Punitive damages may be awarded pursuant to \u00a7 1691e(b), regardless of proof of actual damages, if the creditor\u2019s conduct is adjudged wanton, malicious or oppressive, or if it is deemed to have acted in reckless disregard of the applicable law. <em>Anderson; Shuman v. Standard Oil Co., </em>453 F.Supp. 1150 (N.D.Cal.1978) <em>(dicta </em>). <em>See Sayers v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., </em>522 F.Supp. 835 (W.D.Mo.1981); <em>Cherry </em>v. <em>Amoco Oil Co., </em>490 F.Supp. 1026 (N.D.Ga.1980). Finally, attorney\u2019s fees are available if an award of actual or punitive damages is made. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691e(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\n<em>Fair Credit Reporting Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AP8\">Fischl next argues that the district court erred in finding, first, that credit was not denied in whole or part on the basis of information contained in the consumer report issued by Credit Bureau Services, within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681m(a) and, second, that GMAC\u2019s oral disclosure of the name and address of the agency in response to Fischl\u2019s inquiry complied with the statute. Credit was not refused, in the district court\u2019s estimation, \u201cbecause of information <em>in </em>the report; nothing adverse was there .... [rather, Fischl] was denied credit, in a sense, for what was <em>not </em>in the report: there was not sufficient evidence ... of his ability to sustain high monthly payments.\u201d (emphasis by the trial court.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Section 1681m(a)\u2019s disclosure requirement is triggered \u201c[w]henever credit ... for personal . . . purposes ... is denied ... either wholly or partly because of information contained in the consumer report from a consumer reporting agency . ... \u201d In this situation, \u201cthe user [a lender or other creditor, insurance company, firm or employer] of the consumer report shall so advise the consumer against whom such adverse action has been taken and supply the name and address of the consumer reporting agency making the report.\u201d <em>Id. See Wood v. Holiday Inns, Inc., </em>508 F.2d 167 (5th Cir.1975). The purpose of the notification provision is to enable the subject of a consumer report to request disclosure from the reporting agency of the nature and scope of the information in his file.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">Disclosure is not conditioned upon the creditor\u2019s consideration of derogatory or negative information in a consumer report in arriving at an adverse decision, so long as that decision is attributable wholly or in part to information in the report. FTC Pamphlet, Compliance With the Fair Credit Reporting Act at 38 (rev\u2019d ed. 1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>R. Clontz, Fair Credit Reporting Manual at 5-3 (1977 ed.). <em>See also Carroll v. Exxon Co., U.S.A. </em>(where denial of credit not premised on adverse information in consumer report, but on credit bureau\u2019s inability to furnish definitive information regarding applicant\u2019s credit, \u00a7 1681m(a)\u2019s disclosure requirement deemed controlling). According to an unofficial staff interpretation released by the FTC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-15\">Section 615 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681m] makes no distinction between derogatory or favorable information in a consumer report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>which is used as a basis for denial of credit. Furthermore, the definition of a consumer report [set forth in \u00a7 1681a(d) ] is not limited to derogatory or adverse information, [but encompasses] a communication of <em>any </em>information by a consumer reporting agency relating to a consumer\u2019s credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">FTC Unofficial Staff Interpretation (July 5, 1973), <em>reprinted in </em>R. Clontz, Fair Credit Reporting Manual at E-100 (1977 ed.) (emphasis in the original). Thus a creditor could, upon obtaining a consumer report, discover that a prospective borrower had established an excellent credit record over a period of years, yet determine that qualifications revealed in the report did not meet its own standards of creditworthiness. Under these circumstances, disclosure would be mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Such is the case herein. Fischl\u2019s application for credit was denied in part because of information in a report prepared by a credit reporting service. This information was incomplete and misleading. The details of his credit history set forth in the report, when evaluated under GMAC\u2019s judgmental criteria, did not furnish a sufficient guarantee of financial responsibility to support an extension of credit in the amount sought. GMAC concluded that the record of Fischl\u2019s current obligations did not justify a prediction that he could successfully undertake the monthly payments contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">Despite its reliance on data contained in the credit report, when reporting to Fischl via the form letter of October 3, 1980, GMAC did not disclose this information, advising instead that disclosure was inapplicable. This action did not comport with \u00a7 1681m(a). Similarly, GMAC\u2019s subsequent oral response to Fischl\u2019s inquiry, noting the name and address of the credit bureau, did not suffice under the statute. We need not and do not decide whether the notice required by \u00a7 1681m(a) must be written, nor do we decide the mandated timing for the notice. Those questions remain for another day.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number> Because Fischl succeeded in locating the credit bureau and securing a copy of the report in short order, the district court determined that he could not have suffered any actual damages. That does not end the inquiry before us. Even where no pecuniary or out-of-pocket loss has been shown, the FCRA permits recovery for humiliation and mental distress, <em>Thompson v. San Antonio Retail Merchants Ass\u2019n, </em>682 F.2d 509 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Millstone </em>v. <em>O\u2019Hanlon Reports, Inc., </em>528 F.2d 829 (8th Cir.1976); <em>see Evers v. Equifax, </em>650 F.2d 793 (5th Cir. 1981), as well as for injury to one\u2019s reputation and creditworthiness. <em>Bryant v. TRW, Inc., </em>689 F.2d 72 (6th Cir.1982) <em>(citing </em>Representative Sullivan\u2019s remarks, set forth at 116 Cong.Rec. 36570 (1970)). Negligent noncompliance with the FCRA entitles the consumer to an award of actual damages and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 o; willful noncomplianee in addition gives rise to liability for punitive damages. Section 1681n(2). <em>See Bryant v. TRW; Thornton v. Equifax, </em>619 F.2d 700 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 835, 101 S.Ct. 108, 66 L.Ed.2d 41 (1980). Malice or evil motive need not be established for a punitive damages award, but the violation must have been willful. <em>Thornton. </em>On remand, the district court should assess plaintiff\u2019s right under \u00a7\u00a7 1681o and 1681n to actual damages, costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and punitive damages. In so remanding, we intimate no conclusion as to whether damages should be awarded. That is for the district court to determine, either on the basis of the record as presently constituted or as supplemented by additional submissions, as the district court deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-9\">. Creditors utilize two types of evaluation systems in deciding whether to grant credit: the judgmental and the credit scoring systems. Judgmental scoring is a subjective process whereby the creditor examines an applicant\u2019s ability and willingness to repay. Such information as home ownership, income, length of employment and credit references are typically relied upon. The creditor evaluates the character and repayment capacity of the applicant in light of his credit history, and formulates a professional judgment whether to grant or deny credit. Taylor, Meeting the Equal Credit Opportunity Act\u2019s Specificity Requirement: Judgmental and Statistical Scoring Systems, 29 Buffalo L.Rev. 73 (1980). <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.-2(t). Under GMAC\u2019s judgmental system of credit evaluation, payments on debt secured by real estate, such as Fischl\u2019s mortgage obligation, did not figure in the credit decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\">.

The Commission may exercise limited rule-making power by promulgating procedural rules to ensure compliance with the FCRA. 15 U.S.C. 1681s(a). Due to the absence of express statutory authority to issue binding interpretations of the FCRA, which effectively deprives any such interpretation of the force of law, opinions disseminated by the FTC, whether in the form of its compliance manual or unofficial staff letters, are intended only to clarify the FCRA and are advisory in nature. These opinions may nonetheless offer helpful guidance to the courts. <em>Watts v. Key Dodge Sales, Inc., </em>707 F.2d 847 (5th Cir.1983.) Compare R.

In the course of her presentation of the conference bill to the House, Representative Sullivan commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">The House conferees succeeded in <em>assuring immediate notification </em>to any individual, who is rejected for credit, insurance or employment because of information in a credit report, of the name and address of the agency which made the report on him. Thus, his right to access to his file is made more meaningful \u2014 he will <em>automatically </em>be told where to look for information which may be causing him needless harm. The Senate Bill would have required the consumer who had been rejected for credit, insurance, or employment because of .. . information in a credit file to request, in writing, the name and address of the credit reporting bureau, in order to check further into the information which may have caused his rejection. It was our feeling that this was a needless technicality which would have resulted, from a practical standpoint, in some, or many, individuals, for timidity or other reasons, failing to exercise their rights to find out where to go in order to have a damaging credit report reevaluated and, if wrong, corrected.
