As provided by statute, once the government finished its surveillance, the court told appellant that he had been overheard. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(d). He moved to inspect the surveillance records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>pursuant to that statute, which states that the district court judge</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A90\">may in his discretion make available to such person or his counsel for inspection such portions of the intercepted communications, applications and orders as the judge determines to be in the interest of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Appellant argued that, since he is an attorney, the government might have intercepted privileged attorney-client communications; he said he needed to inspect the documents, to prevent privileged materials from being placed before the grand jury. The district court examined the relevant records <em>in camera </em>and concluded that there was no improper interception. It found that the government had intentionally turned off the monitoring devices whenever an apparently privileged communication began. The court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1n\">the importance of assuring the grand jury\u2019s investigation remains secret outweighs Attorney Cintolo\u2019s interest in discovering at this time the contents of his intercepted communications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Appellant first asserts a general point, namely, that he cannot prove that privileged communications were intercepted unless he can see the government\u2019s records. His practical problem arises, however, from the fact that Congress resolved the \u201csecrecy/impropriety\u201d dilemma to which he points by authorizing a district court to examine the records <em>in camera </em>and \u201cin his discretion\u201d to decide the issue. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(d). This procedure has been endorsed by the courts, <em>see, e.g., In re Lochiatto, </em>497 F.2d 803, 808 (1st Cir.1974) (\u00a7 2518(10)); <em>Application of the United States for an Order Authorizing Interception of Oral Communications At the Premises Known as Calle Mayaguez 212, Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, </em>545 F.Supp. 1271, 1273 (D.P.R.1982); <em>Application of the United States for an Order Authorizing Interception of Wire and Oral Communications, </em>495 F.Supp. 282, 284 (E.D.La.1980); <em>Application of the United States for an Order Authorizing Interception of Wire Communications, </em>413 F.Supp. 1321, 1333 (E.D.Pa.1976); and in general it is the recommended method by which to resolve disputes over confidentiality. <em>In re John Doe Corp., </em>675 F.2d 482, 490 (2d Cir.1982). Appellant has received whatever benefits \u00a7 2518 provides him, and he alleges no specific facts suggesting any abuse. Indeed, since he received from the district court the dates and times when he was \u201cpresent on the premises being monitored,\u201d it would not be as difficult as appellant claims for him to make specific allegations to this court of invasion of the lawyer-client privilege, if any such invasions have taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Moreover, even if it should later turn out, contrary to the district court\u2019s finding, that the government did invade the lawyer-client privilege, Cintolo\u2019s clients can refuse to answer questions from the grand jury based on privileged material, <em>see United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 346, 94 S.Ct. 613, 619, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974); they can move to dismiss the indictment, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Rasheed, </em>663 F.2d 843, 853-54 (9th Cir.1981); and any such evidence would be excluded at trial, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 501. <em>See also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2515, 2518(5); <em>Scott v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978) (suppression authorized where government fails to comply with requirement that interception of noncriminal matter be minimized). We find no abuse of discretion by the district court in refusing to allow defendant to inspect the government\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Appellant makes one other claim of error. He argues that the district court should have heard the evidence of several reporters, whom he had subpoenaed to testify about newspaper and television stories they had written. He claims that if these unwilling witnesses had been forced to testify, he could have shown that the government had already breached the secrecy of its investigation by \u201cleaking\u201d stories to the press; hence, the need for secrecy in his case presumably would be diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Appellant, however, did not explain to the court precisely how these witnesses would help him. The press stories themselves presumably could have been made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>available to the judge and would likely have revealed the maximum extent (and thus the relevance) of any \u201cleak.\u201d Moreover, appellant did not claim that the government had leaked information specifically about <em>him. </em>Under these circumstances, appellant, at a minimum, should have specified what he believed the witnesses would say and why their testimony would be material. <em>See Cohen v. United States, </em>378 F.2d 751, 760-61 (9th Cir.1967). Instead, he relied upon conclusory allegations. We therefore find no error in the decision of the district court not to allow Cintolo to call his reluctant press witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">For these reasons, the decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
