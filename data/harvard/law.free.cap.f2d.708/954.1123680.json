We conclude that Vela\u2019s counsel at his sentencing proceeding was constitutionally deficient, and that counsel\u2019s errors resulted in actual and substantial disadvantage to his client\u2019s defense. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to grant the writ unless the State elects within a reasonable time to retry Vela.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-20\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-21\">On the evening of July 1, 1973, a dispute erupted between petitioner\u2019s brother, Fred Vela, and Kenneth Brown, a clerk at the convenience store where the disturbance occurred. Brown accepted Fred Vela\u2019s invitation to \u201cstep outside\u201d and settle their differences. As they left the store, they encountered petitioner, Conrado Vela, who became involved in the dispute. Brown punched petitioner in the mouth, knocking him off his feet, then went back into the store. Enraged, petitioner sped home, retrieved his automatic pistol, and returned to the store twenty minutes later. Upon entering the store, he opened fire on Brown. Petitioner fired six to eight times, striking Brown in the back and killing him. Petitioner then returned home, where he was later arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-22\">Petitioner [hereinafter Vela] pled guilty in open court to the indictment charging him with murder with malice of Kenneth Brown. The guilty plea was accepted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>the trial court and repeated for the jury. Under the Texas procedure in effect at that time, the jury then had the option of finding Vela guilty of murder with malice aforethought, which carried a punishment of two years to life, or murder without malice aforethought, carrying a term of two to five years imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">The jury found Vela guilty of murder with malice aforethought and assessed his punishment at 99 years confinement in the Texas Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Vela shortly thereafter appealed his conviction in state court through court-appointed counsel, urging three points of error: 1) The trial court erred in admitting testimony by Harvey Martin as to Brown\u2019s good character, when that was not in issue; 2) The trial court erred in admitting testimony by Brown\u2019s widow that was irrelevant, immaterial and calculated solely to prejudice the jury; 3) The trial court erred in failing to grant Vela\u2019s motion for a mistrial on the ground that the State\u2019s closing argument to the jury was harmful, prejudicial and manifestly improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that: 1) Although it was error to admit the prejudicial character testimony, Vela\u2019s counsel failed to make a specific objection sufficient to preserve the error for review; 2) Testimony by Brown\u2019s widow was completely irrelevant, immaterial, and prejudicial. However, since all but a small portion of this inadmissible testimony was admitted in other testimony without an objection from Vela\u2019s counsel, there was no reversible error; 3) Because counsel failed to specifically object to the State\u2019s closing argument as outside the record and inflammatory, the alleged error was waived. Unable to reach the merits of any of Vela\u2019s asserted points of error because of counsel\u2019s failure to preserve them for review by making the proper objections, the Court affirmed Vela\u2019s conviction. <em>Vela v. State, </em>516 S.W.2d 176, 176-179 (Tex.Cr.App.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">Vela next filed a petition for habeas corpus in the court that had convicted him, alleging that he had been denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel at his sentencing proceeding. The court concluded that Vela had received effective assistance of counsel, and recommended that all relief be denied. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals then denied Vela\u2019s application without written order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">Vela next applied <em>pro se </em>for federal habe-as corpus relief under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 (West 1977), again claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The magistrate concluded that trial counsel\u2019s \u201cinartful\u201d performance \u201cmore than adequately represented the Petitioner,\u201d and alternatively found that even if counsel\u2019s performance was seriously inadequate, Vela had failed to show that the sentencing proceeding was so unfairly prejudicial as a whole to be \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings, conclusions and recommendation, and dismissed Vela\u2019s petition. Vela appeals that dismissal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">ANALYSIS:</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">\n<em>Exhaustion Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">We are faced at the outset with the State\u2019s contention that Vela\u2019s supplemental brief to this Court contains claims which the state habeas court never had the opportunity to consider.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The State maintains that we may not entertain these unexhaust-ed claims, and must dismiss Vela\u2019s petition as mixed. Specifically, the State alleges that Vela now for the first time claims that his attorney at trial failed to prepare him for questions regarding his guilty plea, neglected to make a large number of objections he should have made, or objected on improper grounds, failed to properly stipulate to evidence, and performed inadequately in his summation. The State does not object to Vela\u2019s citation on appeal of the three central errors urged in his state habe-as petition as grounds for a finding that counsel was ineffective, <em>viz. </em>1) failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>properly object to prejudicial character testimony, 2) failure to properly object to Brown\u2019s widow\u2019s testimony, and 3) failure to properly object to the State\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">The principle that a state prisoner must normally exhaust all available state remedies before he can apply for federal habeas relief has been established for nearly a century. <em>See Ex parte Royall, </em>117 U.S. 241, 6 S.Ct. 734, 29 L.Ed. 868 (1886). This exhaustion requirement, now codified at 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2254(b), (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cserves to minimize friction between our federal and state systems of justice by allowing the State an initial opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of prisoners\u2019 federal rights.\u201d <em>Duckworth v. Serrano, </em>454 U.S. 1, 102 S.Ct. 18, 19, 70 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981); <em>Picard v. Connor, </em>404 U.S. 270, 92 S.Ct. 509, 512, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971). <em>See Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 1202-03, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Exhaustion is not a jurisdictional prerequisite, but derives from considerations of comity between the state and federal judicial systems.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Felder v. Estelle, </em>693 F.2d 549 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Galtieri v. Wainwright, </em>582 F.2d 348, 354 (5th Cir. 1978). The rule that a state prisoner is required to exhaust his state remedies before he applies for federal habeas relief is not graven in stone. <em>Minor v. Lucas, </em>697 F.2d 697 (5th Cir.1983). To have exhausted his state remedies, a habeas petitioner must have fairly presented the substance of his claim to the state courts. <em>Picard, </em>92 S.Ct. at 513 (1971). It is not enough that petitioner has merely been through the state courts. <em>Id. </em>92 S.Ct. at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">Normally, the exhaustion requirement is not satisfied if a petitioner presents new legal theories<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or entirely new factual claims in his petition to the federal court. <em>Brown v. Estelle, </em>701 F.2d 494 (5th Cir. 1983); <em>Winfrey v. Maggio, </em>664 F.2d 550, 553 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Hart v. Estelle, </em>634 F.2d 987, 989 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Messelt v. State of Alabama, </em>595 F.2d 247, 250 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">Here, there is no dispute that the alleged sixth amendment violation and its underlying legal theories were presented to both the state habeas court and the federal district court. Vela argued before both courts that counsel\u2019s failure to render reasonably effective assistance deprived him of his sixth amendment right to counsel, as incorporated in the fourteenth amendment due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">The only dispute here is over those instances of alleged substandard conduct cited in this appeal which were not explicitly enumerated in Vela\u2019s state habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">This Court has normally refused to review on habeas entirely new factual claims never presented to the state habeas court. <em>Brown, </em>701 F.2d at 495-96; <em>Bums v. Estelle, </em>695 F.2d 847, 849-50 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Hart, </em>634 F.2d at 989; <em>Knoxson v. Estelle, </em>574 F.2d 1339, 1340 (5th Cir.1978). In <em>Brown, </em>petitioner supplemented the record on appeal with three affidavits that corroborated several substantially unsupported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>contentions argued before the state court. We affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Brown\u2019s petition for failure to exhaust available state remedies. In <em>Hart, </em>we remanded with directions to dismiss the habe-as petition because it presented entirely new medical testimony never considered by the state court. In <em>Knoxson, </em>we dismissed the petition because it contained new factual allegations based on documents which became part of the record only after the state habeas court had dismissed the petition. Similarly, in <em>Burns, </em>we found that petitioner had failed to exhaust his state remedies when he presented in support of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim entirely new evidence of the existence of a deceased alibi witness whom his attorney arguably should have called to testify at trial. None of this evidence was presented to the state habeas court. As we stated in <em>Burns:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-5\">The \u201csubstance\u201d of Burns\u2019 claim is quite different in his federal petition. For the first time, he now sets forth the scenario involving the alibi witness. Although petitioner concedes that he did not present these allegations in the state proceeding, he argues that he was never given the opportunity to do so. The state record, however, is simply barren of any hint or reference to a purported alibi defense or the existence of any alibi witness. The vague nature of the allegations in his appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals belies the contention that he had no opportunity to apprise the court of the contentions underlying his claim. In <em>Hart v. Estelle, </em>634 F.2d 987 (5th Cir.1981), this court held that state remedies may not be considered exhausted \u201cwhere entirely new factual claims are made in support of the writ before the federal court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 989. We believe that the factual bases underlying petitioner's federal claim are significantly different from those underlying his state claim, and therefore, require a finding that Burns has not exhausted his state remedies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\"><em>Burns, </em>695 F.2d at 849-50. Our case is quite different from both <em>Burns </em>and the other cases discussed above. Here, <em>all </em>the instances of ineffective assistance alleged in Vela\u2019s supplemental brief to this Court were contained in the trial record reviewed by the state habeas court when it denied Vela\u2019s original petition. This petition argued ineffective assistance on the basis of counsel\u2019s entire performance. The petition cited the entire record below, singling out for comment certain strikingly prejudicial errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">In denying Vela\u2019s petition, the state ha-beas court cited a number of instances in which counsel performed his duties well, examples never mentioned in Vela\u2019s petition. The state court\u2019s findings therefore indicate that the court carried out its own independent analysis of counsel\u2019s performance. The transcript and all the documents in this case were transmitted to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which denied the application without written order. We must presume that its consideration of the record, and all the facts contained therein, was no less thorough than that of the state habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">The findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the federal magistrate repeatedly refer to counsel\u2019s conduct as a whole. Like the state habeas court, the federal magistrate relied on numerous particulars of counsel\u2019s performance that were not raised in Vela\u2019s federal habeas petition. The district court order denying habeas relief was premised upon \u201can independent review of the pleadings, files and records in this case.\u201d Recognizing that the federal court\u2019s consideration of the entire record is not dispositive of the question of Vela\u2019s exhaustion of available state remedies, we nevertheless deem it relevant insofar as it illustrates that court\u2019s application of the general rule that counsel\u2019s performance is to be evaluated on the basis of \u201cthe <em>totality </em>of the circumstances in the entire record.\u201d <em>Washington v. Watkins, </em>655 F.2d 1346, 1355 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 949, 102 S.Ct. 2021, 72 L,Ed.2d 474 (1982) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). Although the state habeas court in its findings and conclusions made passing reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>outdated \u201cfarce or mockery of justice\u201d standard of effective assistance of counsel, it; like the federal court, actually applied the \u201creasonably effective assistance\u201d standard which requires an evaluation of counsel\u2019s conduct on the basis of the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">We recognize that the exhaustion requirement is designed to prevent unnecessary friction between the state and federal systems, and that federal review of state habeas orders entails significant costs. <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 1571, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982). However, although Vela has highlighted in his brief to this Court a number of trial errors that were not specifically mentioned in his <em>pro se </em>state habeas petition, all of these errors support the same constitutional claim urged before the state court, and all were readily discernible from the review of the entire record which that court was obligated to carry out. Characterizing these allegations as \u201cunexhausted claims\u201d would require us to find that the state habeas court failed in its duty to evaluate counsel\u2019s performance on the basis of the record as a whole. This we are unwilling to do, given that court\u2019s citation in its findings of instances drawn from the record in which counsel performed properly. Concluding as we do that the alleged \u201cnew facts\u201d are not new at all, we cannot see how our consideration of these same facts in any way undercuts the state court, or creates any friction between the state and federal judicial systems. Accordingly, we hold that Vela has exhausted all available state remedies as required by \u00a7 2254(b), (c), and move on to an analysis of the merits of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">Although several decisions by this Court suggest that whether a defendant has received effective assistance of counsel is a purely factual question reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard of Fed.R.Civ. Pro. 52(a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we most recently held in <em>Washington v. Watkins, </em>655 F.2d 1346 (5th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 949, 102 S.Ct. 2021, 72 L.Ed.2d 474 (1982) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-9\">Whether a defendant has enjoyed effective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of fact and law. While subsidiary findings of basic, historical fact that the district court has made after it has conducted an evidentiary hearing are subject to review under the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a), the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusion as to whether the defendant enjoyed effective assistance of counsel is not subject to review under that standard, and the court of appeals must make an independent evaluation based on those subsidiary findings in determining whether counsel\u2019s representation satisfied the qualitative, normative standards dictated by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aa4-dedup-0\"><em>Watkins, </em>655 F.2d at 1354. We have since <em>Watkins </em>implicitly recognized this standard in Ware <em>v. King, </em>694 F.2d 89, 92 (5th Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 2092, 77 L.Ed.2d 302 (1983), and applied it explicitly in <em>Baty v. Balkcom, </em>661 F.2d 391, 394 n. 7 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 1011, 102 S.Ct. 2307, 73 L.Ed.2d 1308 (1982). The Tenth and Eleventh Circuits have recently cited the <em>Watkins </em>standard with approval. <em>See, e.g., Griffin v. Winans, </em>684 F.2d 686, 688 (10th Cir.1982); <em>Sullivan v. Wainwright, </em>695 F.2d 1306, 1308 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Proffitt v. Wainwright, </em>685 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>F.2d 1227, 1247 (11th Cir.1982); <em>Goodwin v. Balkcom, </em>684 F.2d 794, 803 (llth Cir.1982), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 1798, 75 L.Ed.2d 364 (1983). The Supreme Court in <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1715, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980) held that the question whether attorneys representing co-defendants engaged in multiple representation in violation of the sixth amendment was a mixed question of law and fact. For these reasons, as well as those set forth in our analysis in <em>Watkins, </em>655 F.2d at 1351-54, we conclude that whether counsel rendered effective assistance is a mixed question of law and fact. We are therefore free to substitute our own judgment for that of the district court. <em>Baker v. Metcalfe, </em>633 F.2d 1198, 1201 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 974, 101 S.Ct. 2055, 68 L.Ed.2d 354 (1981).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">\n<em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">The right to counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment is a fundamental right, <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin, </em>407 U.S. 25, 92 S.Ct. 2006, 2008-10, 32 L.Ed.2d 530 (1972), and applies through the fourteenth amendment to the states. <em>Cuyler, </em>100 S.Ct. at 1715. This vital component of our judicial system includes within its broad compass the right to a minimal quality of counsel, <em>Gandy v. Alabama, </em>569 F.2d 1318, 1320 (5th Cir.1978), defined as the right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 1449 n. 14, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970). This right is present at every stage of a criminal proceeding where substantial rights of a criminal accused may be affected, and consequently extends to sentencing proceedings in criminal cases. <em>Mempa v. Ray, </em>389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 257, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967). A plea of guilty does not strip a defendant of his right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>Woodward v. Beto, </em>447 F.2d 103, 104 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 957, 92 S.Ct. 325, 30 L.Ed.2d 275 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">The standard governing counsel\u2019s effectiveness under the sixth amendment is a straightforward one.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-11\">In this circuit, the standard for constitutionally effective assistance of counsel is \u201cnot errorless counsel, and not counsel judged ineffective by hindsight, but counsel reasonably likely to render <em>and rendering </em>reasonably effective assistance.\u201d <em>Herring v. Estelle, </em>491 F.2d 125, 127 (5th Cir.1974) (quoting <em>MacKenna v.

Estelle, </em>648 F.2d 276, 279 (5th Cir.) <em>[cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 899, 102 S.Ct. 402, 70 L.Ed.2d 216 (1981) ] (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-12\"><em>Watkins, </em>655 F.2d at 1355. <em>See also Baldwin v.

Although <em>Watkins </em>was a death penalty case, the same standard applies in imprisonment cases. <em>See Hardin v. Wainwright, </em>678 F.2d 589, 592 (5th Cir. 1982); <em>Daniels v.

State, </em>516 S.W.2d 176 (Tex.Ct.Cr.App.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-16\">In his appeal, Vela objected to the admission of testimony by Harvey Martin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>as to Brown\u2019s good character. Martin, a well-known professional football player, testified that Brown was a man of kind and inoffensive character, that he had never seen Brown get in a fight, and that Brown intended upon his graduation from college to go into social work with children. Because Vela never sought to justify murdering Brown, but pleaded guilty to the charge, and because the record contained no evidence of any threat by Brown against Vela before the dispute erupted, nor any evidence portraying Brown as a violent or dangerous person, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that Martin\u2019s testimony was improperly admitted. Unfortunately, counsel made only a general objection to the admission of this testimony, failing to preserve the error for review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-4\">Although it was error to admit such prejudicial testimony, the appellant has waived the right to complain on appeal for failure to make the proper specific objection. From the record, the only objection made in the trial court was that the testimony was irrelevant, immaterial, and inflammatory. This objection was made prior to any testimony actually given. At no time did appellant ever make an objection to this testimony on the grounds that it was improper character evidence; nor was any motion to strike such testimony as being irrelevant made after the witness testified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-5\">A general objection preserves nothing for review and is not sufficient to apprise the trial court of the complaint urged. <em>It is a long established rule that an objection to the admission of evidence must be specific and must state the grounds of the objection. </em>Failing to meet this requirement, such a general objection will not be considered for review by this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\"><em>Vela, </em>516 S.W.2d at 178 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Counsel\u2019s error here was fundamental, revealing ignorance of one of tfi'e~mos'1rb'asic rules of Texas procedure; an objection must be specific to preserve the error for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">In his direct appeal, Vela also argued that the admission of Mrs. Brown\u2019s testimony constituted reversible error. We reproduce below the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 disposition of that claim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a5s-dedup-0\">From a close examination of [Mrs. Brown\u2019s] testimony, it is apparent that it was completely irrelevant, immaterial, and prejudicial. She testified that she had one child, age three, and that the deceased at the time of his death was working at two jobs, attending college, and playing on the championship football team. She also testified that he had aspirations to play professional football, sang in the church choir, was an usher in the church, and was a social worker for an organization benefitting the underprivileged children of all races. <em>There can be no doubt that this testimony had no bearing whatsoever on any material issue in the case and its sole purpose was to inflame the minds of the jury. </em>The State, by its own concession, admits that it was not even intended to be good character evidence of the deceased. This Court has consistently held evidence of this type to be inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-10\">Even though the prejudicial evidence admitted through Mrs. Brown\u2019s testimony <em>is far more prejudicial than any case cited above, </em>all except the portion dealing with the deceased\u2019s church and social activities was admitted in other testimony without objection from appellant. This Court has held that admission of improper evidence is not reversible error if the same facts are proven by other testimony not objected to.... The remaining portion of her testimony which was not proven from other unobjected to testimony, standing alone, does not rise to sufficient magnitude to warrant a reversal.... Appellant\u2019s second ground of error is overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_s5\"><em>Vela, </em>516 S.W.2d at 179 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Although the court did not reach the reversible error issue, we note that it did state in dictum that the testimony admitted was far more prejudicial than that found in any of the cases cited.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>fendants\u2019 convictions were reversed in several of those cases. <em>See Cadenhead, Elizon-do, Ainsworth, Faulkner, supra </em>note 8. In the great majority of the remaining eight cases in which the court, for one reason or another, failed to reach the question of reversible error, it nevertheless found the evidence inadmissible. We agree with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals that Mrs. Brown\u2019s- tesflBBBg3ttrPasses~^omP^ble testimony in all of the cases citedTboth in. its irrelevance, and its prejudicial .effect. ^However, the question whether this testimony constituted reversible error in our ,casa__is ..not._hefore us. and we need-mot decide it. We note only thatjpnnsel\u2019s error Kere^vas \u2014 fundamental. The evidence in 'question was admitted solely for the purpose of inflaming the jury. The state itself admitted that it was not intended to be good character evidence of the deceased. Counsel\u2019s failure to object to similar testimony later in the trial had the same effect for purposes of subsequent review as would a failure to object to this testimony, and was just as serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Vela\u2019s third point of error alleged that the prosecutor\u2019s jury argument was essentially an appeal to emotion, and was therefore improper. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did not reach this ground of error because counsel failed to specifically object that the argument was outside the record and inflammatory, but instead simply moved for a mistrial. The court noted in dictum that since an instruction to the jury to disregard would have been sufficient to cure the alleged error, a motion for a mistrial was inappropriate. Counsel\u2019s error here therefore does not appear quite as serious as the first two errors we have examined, since the jury would have heard the improper appeal anyway. The fact remains, however, that because of counsel\u2019s error, no curative instruction was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">Quite apart from any prejudice Vela may have suffered as a result of these errors, an issue we address <em>infra, </em>it is clear, that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>each of these instances, counsel failed to do what reasonably should be expected of every Texas attorney representing criminal defendants. He did not follow the most elementary of blackletter rules of procedure found in bar review materials, beginner trial manuals and basic books on Texas procedure: (1) avoid general objections; (2) specify the particular ground of an objection; and (3) move to strike the improper testimony and ask for an appropriate instruction, or, when appropriate, a mistrial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">Counsel failed to follow these rules on numerous other occasions, and committed several other serious errors as well. When counsel saw fit to make an objection, he did not insist on a ruling to preserve the point. On at least four occasions counsel\u2019s hearsay objection was made only after the jury had heard the question answered. -HeJiailedjo object to the improper and prejudicial testimony of Willia\u00f1\u00ed Berry, establishing Brdwrfs~~good character,~\"tfluch as He~had ~done-wheirthe proseCPtoFixanunedHarvey Martin. Counsel missed numerbUS'-objec---' tions~~fegarding evidentiary foundations, leading questions, hearsay, improper summation of testimony, questions assuming facts not in evidence, and relevancy. On at least four occasions, the court had to intervene and do counsel\u2019s job for him. In his cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses, counsel asked trivial questions, and actually bolstered their testimony. In his defense presentation, counsel spent most of his time trying to convince the sentencing jury, which had, just heard Vela plead guilty to murder, that Vela enjoyed a good reputation~for being peaceable and law-abiding, despite what the magistrate called \u201cuncontroverted testimony which precluded any theory of justifiable homicide.\u201d Some of the same witnesses who testified to Vela\u2019s peaceable nature also testified to his rage at the time of the murder. When Vela himself took the stand, his lack of preparation became immediately evident. At one point, he actually volunteered the information that he expected to receive a life sentence. The prosecutor had a field day with Vela.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">\u201cThe-smrtenomg-gtage of any case, regardless of the potential punishment, is ^tKe~time at.jivlnctHFoR\u00f1a\u00f1V^\u00ed\u00e9fendants-the most important services of the entire proceeding-can be performed. \u2019 \u201d <em>Stanley v.

See Stanley, </em>697 F.2d at 962-63. Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>Vela was charged with perhaps the most serious of offenses; murder. \u201cUnless a defendant charged with a serious offense has counsel able to invoke the procedural and substantive safeguards that distinguish our system of justice, a serious risk of injustice infects the trial itself.\u201d <em>Cuyler, </em>100 S.Ct. at 1715.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">Vela does not claim that he was denied counsel reasonably likely to render effective assistance, rather, he claims that he was denied counsel <em>rendering </em>effective assistance. Accordingly, we evaluate counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfrom the perspective of counsel, taking into account all of the circumstances of the case, but only as those circumstances were known to him at the time in question.\u201d <em>Watkins, </em>655 F.2d at 1356. Here, we do not judge counsel\u2019s performance with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, secure in the possession of new evidence which, had it been known to counsel, would have caused him to act differently. We assess his performance on the basis of the facts known to him, and the rules of law and procedure he is held to know as an attorney representing defendants in criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">It is Vela, of course, who bears the burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Maggio, </em>699 F.2d 198, 201-02 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Washington v. Strickland, </em>693 F.2d 1243, 1250 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982) <em>(en banc), cert. granted, </em>462 U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 2451, 77 L.Ed.2d 1332 (1983); <em>Ward v. United States, </em>694 F.2d 654, 664 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Adams v. Balkcom, </em>688 F.2d 734, 738 (11th Cir.1982). In some cases, a single critical error may render counsel\u2019s performance constitutionally defective. <em>Nero Blackburn, </em>597 F.2d 991, 994 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">Here, Vela has identified not one error, but many, several of which were sufficiently grave to preclude the review of serious claims on direct appeal. We find that Vela has met his burden, and conclude that counsfilis..performance in this proceed-' ing fell below the range of competency-generally demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. <em>Young v. Zant, </em>677 F.2d 792 at 798 (11th Cir.1982). Assessing counsel\u2019s performance on the basis of the totality of the record, we_hoM-that--cOunsel ~nT~this pro ceedinaadid-not-render reasonably effective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">\n<em>Actual and Substantial Disadvantage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">This does not, of course, complete our inquiry. In <em>Strickland, </em>we stated that once it is determined that defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel was violated, a court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-12\">should then separately determine whether petitioner suffered prejudice of sufficient magnitude to warrant granting the writ of habeas corpus. We decide that the petitioner has the burden of persuasion to demonstrate that the ineffective assistance created not only \u201ca <em>possibility </em>of prejudice, but that [it] worked to his <em>actual </em>and substantial disadvantage.\u201d If he successfully satisfies this burden, the writ must be granted unless the state proves that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a_d-dedup-0\"><em>Strickland, </em>693 F.2d at 1258 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). In <em>Strickland, </em>the <em>en banc </em>Court rejected a <em>per se </em>rule of prejudice in ineffective assistance of counsel cases. It also rejected an outcome-determinative test as setting too high a standard, and refused to adopt the rule proposed by the panel majority, whereby petitioner had only to show that but for counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness the trial, but not necessarily its outcome, would have been altered in a way helpful to the defense. <em>Id. </em>at 1260-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">Vela pled.,.guilty \u2014 to-murder-\u2014T-he\u2014jury'' was given the broadest range of punishment options7frdm two~y ears'to life.

Under the dence of this typeUs-inadmis&amp;ible'precisely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>because of its prejudicial effect.. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals characterized Mrs. Brown\u2019s testimony as \u201ccompletely irrelevant, immaterial and prejudicial,\u201d concluding that \u201c[tjhere can be no doubt that this testimony had no bearing whatsoever on any material issue in the case and its sole purpose was to inflame the minds of the jury.\u201d <em>Vela, </em>516 F.2d at 179. The court also found this evidence to be far more prejudicial than comparable evidence in any of the twelve Texas cases it examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Vela was thrice prejudiced. First, defense counsel allowed the prejudicial evidence on Brown\u2019s good character to be introduced. Second, by failing to object to it and ask for a curative instruction, counsel allowed the jury to consider it as if it had been material, probative evidence, relevant to the issue of Vela\u2019s sentence. Third, defense counsel\u2019s failure to object waived the issue for consideration on direct appeal. We have no difficulty concluding that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness \u201cresulted in actual and substantial disadvantage to the cause of [Vela\u2019s] defense.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>693 F.2d at 1262.

The State has failed to carry its burden of showing thaFthe admission of thiFtestimonv was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v.

Defense counsel made no serious effort to either identify it as a skunk, have it removed, or have the jury instructed to disregard its presence. We cannot in reason conclude that the jury did not consider this inadmissible, improper, highly prejudicial testimony in determining Vela\u2019s sentence.
