Fed.R.App.P. 34(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b513-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">George Freeman, individually and on behalf of The Sanctuary, a Universal Life Church Monastery, appeals from the dismissal of his civil rights action. Freeman alleged that the King County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s office deprived him of property without due process in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983,1985 and 1986, and interfered with his contractual relationship with his landlord. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">The district court correctly found that all four defendants were absolutely immune from suit. <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">The complaint named as defendants the King County Prosecuting Attorney (Mal-eng), two Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys (Redkey, Evans), and an investigator for the Fraud Division of the Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s office (Colwell). The complaint alleged that Colwell, acting under the authority of the Maleng\u2019s office, told the plaintiff\u2019s landlord that he was not getting as much rent from plaintiff\u2019s lease as he could get from someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">Freeman claims that the purpose of the statement was to cause the landlord to terminate The Sanctuary\u2019s lease, thereby depriving it of property without due process, He also contends that the statement wrongfully interfered with the contractual relationship between landlord and tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">A state prosecuting attorney acting within the scope of his duties in initiating and pursuing a criminal prosecution is absolutely immune from a civil suit for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for alleged deprivations of constitutional rights. <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). Investigative functions carried out pursuant to the preparation of a prosecutor\u2019s case also enjoy absolute immunity. <em>Atkins v. Lanning, </em>556 F.2d 485, 488-89 (10th Cir.1977); <em>see also O\u2019Connor v. State of Nevada, </em>686 F.2d 749, 750 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">The challenged actions of Maleng, Redkey, and Evans were within the scope of the prosecutor\u2019s duties in initiating and pursuing the state\u2019s case. They therefore have absolute immunity from damages under \u00a7 1983. Maleng\u2019s involvement with Freeman and The Sanctuary was limited to the use of his title in the formal pleadings of the state criminal case pursued against Freeman. Evans, Redkey\u2019s supervisor, did not participate in Redkey\u2019s decision to pursue criminal charges against Freeman. Redkey, the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, was responsible for Freeman\u2019s prosecution. Thus, the district court correctly found that Maleng, Redkey, and Evans were entitled to absolute immunity from damages under Freeman\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for deprivation of property without due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
