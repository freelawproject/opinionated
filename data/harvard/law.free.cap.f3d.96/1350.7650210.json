California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the direct appeal is correct. Because the record reveals no issues of arguable merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and Smith\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-12\">The government has cross-appealed with respect to the sentence given in this case. The sentencing court found that the government could not rely upon Smith\u2019s 1978 state court plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>to a felony narcotics offense, followed by a withholding of adjudication, because it was not a \u201cconviction\u201d within the purview of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 851. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>856 F.Supp. 665, 667 (S.D.Fla.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-13\">We specifically have held that a \u201cprior plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>with adjudication withheld in Florida state court is a \u2018conviction\u2019 that supports an enhanced sentence under [federal narcotics law].\u201d In <em>United States v. Mejias, </em>47 F.3d 401, 404 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam). In reaching this conclusion, we noted that \u201c[t]he meaning of the word \u2018conviction\u2019 in a federal statute is a question of federal law unless Congress provides otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403 (citing <em>Dickerson v. New Banner Inst., Inc., </em>460 U.S. 103, 119, 103 S.Ct. 986, 995, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983)). Because there is no indication in either 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 or \u00a7 851 that Congress intended that the definition of a conviction should be determined by reference to state law, we concluded that federal law was controlling. <em>Id. </em>at 403-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-15\">Applying <em>Mejias </em>to this ease, we VACATE the decision of the sentencing court wherein it failed to consider Smith\u2019s 1978 state felony disposition as a conviction for the purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 851 and REMAND to the district court for resentencing in accord with our decision in <em>Mejias. </em>Smith, the cross-appellee, contends that application of <em>Mejias </em>in these circumstances would result in a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment and that imposition of such a sentence would constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Until the district court imposes such a sentence, however, Smith\u2019s challenge is premature and not ripe for review. If the government at resentenc-ing again requests that a mandatory life sentence be imposed, and the court does so, Smith may raise, preserve, and pursue his Eighth Amendment challenge at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-16\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the convictions of Smith, VACATE Smith\u2019s sentence, and REMAND to the district court for resentenc-ing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
