However, the opinion, issued June 5, 1996, does not specifically state that a separate judgment had been entered on the unap-pealed claims, one point raised in the petitions. For clarification, note 1 on page 2 of the slip opinion [85 F.3d at 603, note 1] is amplified to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-8\">1 Kraft had also made claims to certain investment tax credits on television films. A separate judgment was entered denying these claims on January 31, 1994. That judgment was vacated and reentered as part of the March judgment sought to be appealed. Kraft has not pursued these claims, and we need not refer to them further herein as the part of the March judgment dealing with these claims is not challenged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">So ORDERED.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">A suggestion for rehearing in banc having been filed by the APPELLANT, and a response thereto having been invited by the court and filed by the CROSS-APPELLANT,</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">UPON CONSIDERATION THEREOF, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b983-16\">ORDERED that the suggestion for rehearing in banc be, and the same hereby is, DECLINED.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-17\">The mandate of the court will issue on October 4,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-18\">SCHALL, Circuit Judge, did not participate in the vote.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
