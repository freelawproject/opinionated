He complains to us of the denial of that motion. It is, however, the settled law of our Circuit that new evidence is not the requisite good cause for such a remand unless a proper explanation is given of why it was not submitted earlier. <em>Chaney v. Sckweiker, </em>659 F.2d 676 (5th Cir.1981). The explanation offered by Geyen \u2014 that he obtained new counsel after the administrative process concluded, counsel who sent him to a psychologist \u2014 is not the sort upon which we can hold the trial court in error. Such a rule would require that court to order a new beginning in such a matter whenever an applicant acquires a new lawyer with a new idea. We decline to adopt such a general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-19\">We have examined Mr. Geyen\u2019s other points for reversal and find them lacking in merit. As the magistrate\u2019s careful report indicates, and as numerous examining physicians have noted, his \u201csymptoms seem to outweigh his signs\u201d and the overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates that he is not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
