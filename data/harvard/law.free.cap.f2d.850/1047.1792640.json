Const. Art. 5 \u00a7 3-c, and Tex.R.App.P. 114, we certify to the Texas Supreme Court questions of Texas law which are determinative of the appeal now pending before this court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-29\">CERTIFICATE FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT TO THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-30\">TO THE HONORABLE, THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, AND THE HONORABLE, THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND ASSOCIATE JUSTICES THEREOF:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1123-34\">It appears to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that this case involves questions of Texas law for which we find neither a dispositive statutory provision nor controlling precedent in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Texas. The answers to the questions posed will be determinative of the pending appeals and are essential to the appropriate resolution of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-35\">1. <em>Style of the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-36\">The styles of the consolidated cases are \u201cAlfred Moreno and Emma Moreno vs. Sterling Drug, Inc.\u201d and \u201cCamilla Sloan and James Sloan vs. Sterling Drug, Inc.\u201d, bearing number 87-5583 on the docket of this court and numbers SA-85-CA-3242 and SA-85-CA-3243 on the docket of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, where the appeals originated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>2. <em>Statement of Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">On January 21, 1981 Alfred Moreno, Jr., the infant son of Alfred and Emma Moreno, died of Reye\u2019s Syndrome. On September 19, 1981 Shawna Rae Sloan, the infant daughter of James and Camilla Sloan, died of Reye\u2019s Syndrome. In the days preceding their deaths, the infants had been administered doses of Bayer Childrens Chewable Aspirin, manufactured by Sterling Drug, Inc. Some time after the death of the infants the parents were informed that in some instances the use of aspirin factored into Reye\u2019s Syndrome deaths. On October 22, 1985 the instant wrongful death suits were filed in state district court in Bexar County, Texas. Sterling Drug removed the actions to the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, San Antonio Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">Following removal, Sterling Drug moved for summary judgment dismissal of the suits, claiming that the actions were barred by the Texas Statute of Limitations, Tex. Civ.Proc. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 16.003(b) (Vernon 1986). The federal district court dismissed the suits, citing a recent decision by a panel of this court, <em>Tennimon v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., </em>823 F.2d 68 (5th Cir.1987). The parents appealed; their appeals pend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">3. <em>Questions Certified</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-7\">A. Does the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d apply to the Texas Statute of Limitations, Tex. Civ.Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 16.003(b), in an action brought pursuant to the Texas Wrongful Death and Survival Statutes, Tex.Civ.Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 71.001 <em>et seq., </em>\u00a7 71.021, respectively?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-8\">B. If the discovery rule does not apply to the Texas Statute of Limitations in wrongful death and survival actions, does that statute of limitations, as applied to the plaintiffs herein, violate the open-courts provision of the Constitution of the State of Texas, Tex. Const, art. I \u00a7 13?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-9\">\n<em>4.Counsel for the Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-10\">The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the attorneys for the parties are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-11\">A.
