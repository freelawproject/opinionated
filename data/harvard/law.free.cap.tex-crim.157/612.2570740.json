Roger Garrett, Judge Presiding.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b629-5\"><em>Thomas L. Blanton, </em>Albany, and <em>T. R.

Each of them testified that they were intoxicated, but each claimed that the other had been the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Bill of Exception No. 5 shows that, when cross-examining Bowman, appellant\u2019s counsel asked him if immediately after the accident he had not told one Lieb that he himself had been driving, to which Bowman replied that he didn\u2019t say anything. Then Lieb was called as a witness and testified that at such time Bunkey had said that he was the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">Upon objection by the county attorney, the court instructed the jury not to consider the question to Lieb or his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">In this, the court was clearly in error, as this evidence was admissible as impeachment of the witness Bowman.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">Bill of Exception No. 7 reflects manifest error in the argument of the county attorney. In his closing argument, he told the jury, in part, as follows: \u201c* * * I would not have filed the charge against this man if I had not known that he was guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">Such argument is never proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">Time will not permit us to discuss the other questions raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-16\">For the errors shown, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
