The officer testified, further, that, instead of complying with his instructions, appellant started his automobile and continued on his journey; that he gave chase but was outdistanced and finally gave up and returned to town. He testified that, shortly thereafter, appellant came back through town headed in another direction; that he secured assistance, re-instituted the chase and succeeded in bringing appellant to a halt and had a full opportunity to observe that appellant was intoxicated. Other witnesses corroborated the officer\u2019s testimony as to appellant\u2019s state of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Appellant, testifying in his own behalf, denied that he had drunk anything prior to his second apprehension by the officer but stated that, after he was halted and while the officer was looking in the automobile, he had drunk a half pint of whiskey, which resulted in his state of intoxication when observed by witnesses who saw him later. This constituted a denial of the charge that he had driven his automobile while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">The jury found against appellant\u2019s contention, and we find the evidence sufficient to support their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">Bill of Exception No. 1 complains of the overruling of his motion to quash the information on the grounds that the \u201cterm\u201d at which the information was presented was not shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">The information reads, in part, as follows: \u201cI, John M. Harrod, County Attorney of Concho County in said State, at the present Term, A. D. 1951 * * The same was filed on December 15, 1951. The order of the commissioner\u2019s court, fixing the terms of the county court, is a matter of public record of which the trial court could take judicial knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>We find no error reflected by the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Bill of exception No. 2 complains of the court\u2019s failure to give the following requested charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">\u201cYou are further instructed that if you find and beleive from the evidence that the defendant was intoxicated as that term has herein before been defined to you, but that such intoxication resulted from whiskey consumed after his arrest and you further find and beleive from the evidence that the defendant was not intoxicated before his arrest, or if you have a reasonable doubt, you will acquit the defendant and so say by your verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Appellant contends that appellant\u2019s testimony that he drank the whole half pint of whiskey at one drink after being arrested constituted an affirmative defense to the offense charged. With this contention, we are not in accord. We think, rather, that such testimony constituted a denial of the truth of the charge that he drove while intoxicated. If this be true, then it is not an affirmative defense. In Carter v. 8th Ward Bank, 67 N.Y.S. 300, an affirmative defense was defined, in part, as meaning a new matter, <em>assuming the complaint to be true, </em>which constitutes a defense to it. That is, an affirmative defense is analagous to a plea of confession and avoidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Bill of Exception No. 3 complains of the definition of \u201cintoxication\u201d given by the court in his charge. We have long held that a definition of the term need not be given but that it does not constitute error to do so. The definition as given was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">\u201cA person is deemed intoxicated within the meaning of the law defining the offense charged against the defendant, when such person does not have the normal use of his physical and mental faculties by reason of the use of intoxicating liquor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">We see no purpose in requiring the insertion of the word \u201cimmediate\u201d before \u201cuse\u201d as requested by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Bill of Exception No. 4 complains of the failure to charge on circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">We think the testimony of the officer as to smelling alcohol on appellant on the first occasion he was halted takes the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>out of the realm of circumstantial evidence irrespective of appellant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Finding no reversible error, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
