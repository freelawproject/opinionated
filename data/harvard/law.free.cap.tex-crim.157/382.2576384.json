The facts warrant the jury\u2019s conclusion of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">Appellant insists that the so-called fondling statute (Art. 535d, Vernon\u2019s P. C.) is vague and indefinite both as to the offense denounced and the punishment authorized to be assessed thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">We deem the validity of the statute to have been determined by the case of Jones v. State, 156 Tex. Cr. R. 2, 238 S. W. 2d 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">The statute applies to \u201cany person.\u201d It became unnecessary, therefore, for the state to prove either the sex or the age of the appellant. If appellant was not of sufficient age to authorize his conviction of a felony, he should have so shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">No reversible error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-16\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
