He denied that he had consumed any alcoholic drink except for a bottle of beer he drank some time before. He explained the presence of the partly filled whisky bottle by saying that his companion, who also was injured on the occasion, was drinking from the bottle and was asleep or intoxicated at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Occupants of the several approaching cars denied that the car which appellant struck had left its side of the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The jury accepted the state\u2019s version of the collision, and the evidence sustains their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">There was no error in permitting testimony as to injuries to persons other than the injured party named in the information, such injuries having resulted from the same collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Appellant having testified that he was the driver of the Oldsmobile, and that he lost control thereof, is in no position to complain of the officer\u2019s testimony as to his statement to that effect made shortly after the collision and during the investigation thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">No reversible error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
