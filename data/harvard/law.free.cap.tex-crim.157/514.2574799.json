As the closing hour approached, the party fortified themselves with two cases of beer and repaired to a side road in the country to continue their revelry. As to what happened there, we are relegated to the confession. Therein, it is related that, on the way to the country, the appellant offered Barker a \u201cturn,\u201d and that, instead of accepting the same, Barker hit the appellant. \u201cDan\u201d took offense at this and hit Barker, telling him that appellant was his buddy. After the car came to a stop, appellant, evidently encouraged by \u201cDan,\u201d hit Barker. \u201cDan,\u201d not being satisfied that appellant would give Barker a proper whipping, interceded and brutally beat Barker to insensibility. The confession continues, \u201cI tried to get Dan to stop and he said to get away and leave him alone * * After this was over, the confession continues, \u201cThen either Dan or Albert (McKenzie) one said \u2018get his wallet\u2019 \u201d but he does not confess that he ever saw them do so. Barker\u2019s wallet was found in his hip pocket the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">The closing statement of the confession is to the effect that when the three returned to town, leaving the injured party by the roadside, they went to the Hill Top Cafe, where \u201cDan\u201d told them that Barker\u2019s wallet had contained about $13 and gave appellant and McKenzie $4 each.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">The state\u2019s case, which included the appellant\u2019s confession, did not establish the corpus delicti of the offense; i.e., it was not established that any money had been taken from the injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>party as an incident to the assault committed upon him. The fact that the injured party was later found on the roadside would not corroborate the confession as to the robbery. Nor was the confession corroborated in any way to show that appellant had received any of the fruits of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The appellant called the witness Tom Burge, who testified that, on the night in question, he had seen \u201cDan\u201d shove some money over to the appellant while they were seated at the Hill Top Cafe. This did not corroporate the appellant\u2019s confession that the $4.00 had come from the person of the injured party. There was no showing that Barker ever had $13.00, or any money at all, upon his person, other than the $2.00 later found in his pocket, and no showing that any money was taken from him; and, as stated before, the wallet was found on Barker\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In Lott v. State, 141 Tex. Cr. Rep. 366, 148 S. W. (2d) 1102, where, like the case at bar, the injured party was not available to testify that he, in fact, had lost the money alleged to have been stolen from him, we said: \u201cOther than the confession there is nothing in the record to show that Stelle lost $20.00 by theft. * * * Obviously, the evidence is not sufficient to support the judgment of conviction.\u201d The case at bar is weaker than the Lott case, because the confession in this case does not show that the money received by the appellant came from the injured party.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Finding the evidence insufficient to support the conviction, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
