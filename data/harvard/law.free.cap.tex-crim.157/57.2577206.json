The plea was not before a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>There is an entire absence in the judgments of any reference to the requirements of Arts. 10a and 12, C. C. P., as amended, such as waiver of trial by jury and consent and approval of the court and state\u2019s counsel for a trial before the court. These requirements are mandatory, and requisite to a valid judgment, upon a plea of guilty before the court in an ordinary felony case. Thompson v. State, 154 Tex. Cr. R. 273, 226 S. W. 2d 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">It follows that each of the judgments and the sentences imposed upon relator thereunder are void, and, for that reason, relator is entitled to be discharged from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The invalidity of the judgments does not affect the indictments, which, for all this record shows, are yet pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">It is ordered, therefore, that relator be delivered by the penitentiary authorities of this state into the custody of the sheriff of Eastland County to answer the accusations pending against him. Ex Parte Traxler, 147 Tex. Cr. R. 661, 184 S. W. 2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
