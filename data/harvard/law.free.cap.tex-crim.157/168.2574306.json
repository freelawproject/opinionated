On the hearing on the motion.for new trial, the officer testified that he had told appellant, \"Well, if you plead guilty, we won\u2019t take your car from you.\u201d Appellant does not contend that he in fact was not guilty of the offense charged. He testified, on the motion for new trial, that the officers found two cases of whiskey in his car and offered no explanation of the purpose for which he possessed it. We have carefully examined the testimony of the appellant, given at such hearing, and find nothing therein showing that the statement of the officer set forth above in any way caused, or contributed to cause, appellant to plead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>guilty. He alone knew why he plead guilty; and when he failed to say that the officer\u2019s statement caused him to plead as he did, we cannot presume that it had any influence upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">This case is readily distinguishable from our recent decision in Adams v. State, 241 S. W. (2d) 150, wherein appellant testified that he had plead guilty <em>because </em>the officer threatened to take him to the Federal court if he did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We find that the trial court did not abuse his discretion in overruling appellant\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
