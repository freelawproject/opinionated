Objection was made to the introduction of these articles in evidence. Bill of Exception No. 6 shows that both the affidavit for the search warrant and the search warrant itself were introduced in evidence, over the defendant\u2019s objection. This was clearly error.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">It is contended in brief filed by the district attorney\u2019s office that the objection is insufficient in that the grounds were based on the claim of an invalid search warrant. We have always held that it is not admissible for any purpose and, therefore, it is not necessary to state the grounds. We do observe, however, that the search warrant fails to comply with Article 316, Vernon\u2019s Ann. C.C.P., in that it does not \u201c* * * state the particular offense for which such implements are designed.\u201d It follows, further, that the search warrant is invalid and the fruits of the search are not admissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Other errors complained of in the appeal should not occur on another trial and it is not deemed necessary to discuss them herein. The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
