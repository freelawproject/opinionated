It recites that appellant objected to the use of the venire on the grounds that he had not been furnished a list thereof prior to the trial and, further, that he objected to the use of the jury selected therefrom for the same reason. We find no certificate of the judge in the bill that the facts which constitute the basis of the objection are true. The mere recitation of an objection in a bill is not sufficient. It, therefore, follows that the bill presents nothing for review. Texas Digest, Crim. Law, 1901 (10)i; Garza v. State, No. 25,510, (page 6, this volume) 246 S.W. 2d 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Appellant, in his brief, makes reference to a hearing on motion for new trial.
