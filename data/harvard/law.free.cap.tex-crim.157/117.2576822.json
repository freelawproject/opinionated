It is insisted that the absence of such proof renders the evidence insufficient to support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The judgment nisi is a necessary and essential element of the state\u2019s cause of action in a bond forfeiture case, for without a judgment nisi there can be no final judgment. Watkins, et al. v. State, 16 Tex. App. 646; Gass, et al. v. State, 110 Tex.. Cr. R. 238, 8 S. W. 2d 123; Texas Jurisprudence, Vol. 5, p. 969, Sec. 96. In Nelson, et al v. State, 44 Tex. Cr. R. 595, 73 S. W. 398, and authorities there cited, the failure to introduce the judgment nisi in evidence was fatal to a valid judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">The state appears to recognize the seriousness of the situation confronting it by the failure to introduce in evidence the judgment nisi and insists that inasmuch as the trial was to the: court without the intervention of a jury, the trial court could', and would take judicial knowledge of its own judgments, thereby rendering unnecessary the introduction in evidence of the judgment nisi.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">It is unnecessary to here determine the question presented, for we note a variance between the bond and the judgment nisi\", of such nature and seriousness as that appellants would have been entitled to urge such variance if the judgment nisi had', been introduced in evidence. They would be deprived of such-right in the absence of an effort by the state to introduce the-judgment nisi in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">The variance referred to lies in the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">The bond described the offense with which the principal:, stood charged as a \u201cfelony.\u201d No further description of the? nature of that offense was made or attempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>The judgment nisi describes the offense with which the principal stood charged as \u201cfailure to stop and render aid.\u201d It is not recited that such offense was a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u201cFailure to stop and render aid\u201d is not an offense eo nomine and cannot be said, as a matter of law, to be a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Because of the failure to introduce in evidence the judgment nisi, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
