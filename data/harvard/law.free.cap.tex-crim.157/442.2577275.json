In such case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>defendant or his counsel may waive a jury, and the punishment may be assessed by the court, either upon or without evidence, at the discretion of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">In Ex parte Bostick, 81 Tex.

(2d) 181, we held that, in a misdemeanor case where the defendant enters a plea of guilty, it is not necessary to introduce evidence showing the guilt of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">It has long been the holding of this Court that \u201cwhen the punishment assessed is within the limits prescribed by law, it is not \u2018excessive/ and courts cannot remedy the grievance, even though of opinion that the discretion of the jury was not judiciously exercised.\u201d Brown v.
