By its terms, it gave the Charlotte State Bank, of Charlotte, Texas, a chattel mortgage on a \u201c1950 <em>Caddalic </em>De Vel Tudor Sedan\u201d to secure the payment of a $2600 demand note. The mortgage, by its terms, contains this clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-13\">\u201cThat Mortgagor is the full and lawful owner of said property, that the same is fully paid for and is free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances whatsoever, and that the Mortgagor has perfect right to give this first mortgage upon the same * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">and was signed by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-15\">The banker Weber was a very reluctant witness for the state, having before the trial made a financial settlement with appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>lant; but, viewed in the light favorable to the prosecution, we find the following from his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">\u201cQ. Did he represent to you that he had a right to execute a mortgage, a first mortgage on the car? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">\u201cQ. What understanding did you have with him with reference to whether or not this was a first or second or other mortgage on the car? A. My understanding was that when the title came back we would have it changed and show a lien on the statement of title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\u201cQ. And that this would be a first lien? A. Yes, sir.\u201d and further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">\u201cQ. Up to that time (relating to the discovery of the existence of the other lien) he had had the automobile and you hadn\u2019t thought much about whether there was any other liens or anything else out on it. A. No, I thought the car was clear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Appellant contends that, since the mortgage described above did not comply with the terms of Section 42 of Article 1436, Vernon\u2019s Ann. P. C., Certificate of Title Act, evidence of the same would be insufficient to support a conviction. It will be noted, from the terms of the act, that it deals with the validity of a lien as to third parties without actual notice. In this connection, attention is directed to the following from our decision in Escue v. State, 88 Texas Crim. Rep. 447, 227 S. W. 483, to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">\u201cObjection was also made to the introduction of the mortgage given by appellant on said property, the ground of said objection being that the description of the property in the mortgage was not sufficiently definite to identify the particular animals therein described. It is not necessary that the description of the property be such as would make out a flawless contract. If the mortgage, as given, was relied upon and accepted by the injured party, and did in fact induce him to part with his property, and thus accomplish the object intended, the substantial requirements of the law would be met.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">There are no formal bills of exception and none are indexed in the statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">Believing the evidence to be sufficient to support the conviction, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
