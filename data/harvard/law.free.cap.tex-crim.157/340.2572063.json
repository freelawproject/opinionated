C. Hunt, the latter\u2019s wife being with him at the time, and caused the death of said wife of Mr. Hunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>There are about eight different and separate paragraphs to the only bill of exception found in the record. Undoubtedly this bill is multifarious, and cannot be considered by this court. Spruell v. State, 119 Tex. Cr. R. 317, 44 S. W. 2d 733; Miller v. State, 129 Tex. Cr. R. 166, 84 S. W. 2d 459; White v. State, 150 Tex. Cr. R. 546, 203 S. W. 2d 222; Sharp v. State, 151 Tex. Cr. R. 637, 210 S. W. 2d 174; Humphrey v. State, 212 S. W. 2d 159; Smithwick v. State, 155 Tex. Crim. Rep. 292, 235 S. W. 2d 237; Simpson v. State, 155 Tex. Crim. Rep. 400, 235 S. W. 2d 920; Renfro v. State, 156 Tex. Crim. 400, 242 S. W. 2d 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">We find, however, a matter that is fatal to the conviction. The indictment in this case, returned by the Galveston County Grand Jury, alleges that appellant, while driving a motor vehicle upon a public street in the city of Galveston, through negligence and carelessness struck \u201cCecile Hunt\u201d and caused her death. The testimony shows that the deceased\u2019s name was \u201cLucile Hunt\u201d; nowhere in the statement of facts is the name \u201cCecile Hunt,\u201d found. The allegata and probata do not correspond. Appellant was charged with taking the life of \u201cCecile\u201d Hunt, and the testimony shows he took the life of \u201cLucille\u201d Hunt. This is a fatal variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
