At the hearing of said writ, he was refused bail and remanded to custody. From that judgment he has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">After a careful consideration of the record, it is our opinion that appellant is entitled to bail, and we have fixed the amount of his bail in the sum of $5,000. The judgment will be set aside, and the appellant will be admitted to bail and released from custody, upon the execution by him of a bond in the sum of $5,000, with good and sufficient sureties, conditioned as the law directs.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
