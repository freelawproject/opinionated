As to this, the state introduced in evidence the order of the commissioners\u2019 court of Panola County, dated December 21, 1904, canvassing returns and declaring the result of the election, showing that prohibition had been adopted. The county judge was therein ordered to publish \u201cthis order for four successive weeks in some Newspaper published in Panola County, Texas.\u201d Some forty-six years thereafter, on March 21, 1951, Margie E. Neal made the following affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">\u201c \u2018THE STATE OF TEXAS :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">\u201c COUNTY OF PANOLA :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">\u201cTHAT I, MARGIE E. NEAL, BEING editory of the EAST TEXAS REGISTER during the Prohibition Election held in Panola County, Texas, on the 10th day of December, 1904, do hereby solemnly swear that the County Judge notice of results of said election, was published in my newspaper in the following issues:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-11\">January 6, 1905</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-12\">January 13, 1905</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-13\">January 20, 1905 January 27, 1905</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-14\">and that below is a true and correct copy of said notice which appeared in said issues of the EAST TEXAS REGISTER. . . .\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-15\">The order of the commissioners\u2019 court declaring the result of the election above referred to was copied in full in the affidavit. The affidavit was duly copied into the commissioners\u2019 court minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-16\">Objection was made to the receipt in evidence of the affidavit as being hearsay and insufficient to constitute proof of the publication of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>In support of this objection, reliance is had upon the case of Ray v. State, 138 Tex. Cr. R. 553, 137 S. W. 2d 1031, which apparently sustains such position. On the other hand, it appears that the case of Spears v. State, 136 Tex. Cr. R. 55, 123 S. W. 2d 674, and Cook v. State, 146 Tex. Cr. R. 523, 176 S. W. 2d 941, authorize the introduction of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">We have concluded that the holding in the Cook case and the reasoning there given are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The Ray case, supra, in so far as it announces a contrary doctrine, is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In the light of appellant\u2019s admission as a witness, the conclusion is expressed that the facts are sufficient to show the possession of more than a quart of whisky.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">No reversible error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b337-9\">ON APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b337-10\">GRAVES, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">Appellant insists that the introduction of the affidavit of the publisher of the <em>East Texas Register </em>of the order of the county judge of Panola County declaring, on December 21, 1904, the result of the election held therein on December 10, 1904, is hearsay and inadmissible for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">It seems as though this affidavit of such publisher was made on March 21, 1951, and that the cause herein was tried on November 21, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">Copied in the affidavit, together with the order of the commissioners\u2019 court canvassing returns, was a certificate which showed that such order of the county judge was entered in the minutes of the commissioners' court at the December, 1904, term, the objection being that it was hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">We held in the case of Beaty v. State, 53 Tex. Cr. Rep. 432, 18 S. W. 646, that if the county judge had failed to make entry, the same could have been proven by oral testimony. To the same effect is the holding in Ezzell v. State, 29 Tex. App. 521, 16 S. W. 782. We also held to the same effect in the recent case of Dabney v. State, 141 Tex. Cr. Rep. 16, 146 S. W. 2d 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>We think that under the above holdings, the affidavit of Miss Margie E. Neal, publisher of said newspaper, was correctly received in order to show that the order of the commissioners\u2019 court prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor in said county was properly made at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
