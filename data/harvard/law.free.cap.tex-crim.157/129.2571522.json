The appellant, testifying in his own behalf, denied that he had been driving the automobile and refuted the officer\u2019s testimony as to their conversation, stating that the officer had asked him the question, \u201cYou were driving, weren\u2019t you?\u201d and that he had replied, \u201cYou can put it that way on your report if you care to.\u201d He gave as his reason for making such a statement to the officer that his companion, who he said was actually driving the automobile, did not have his driver\u2019s license with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">In rebuttal, the state called the officer back to the stand, and he gave a more detailed version of the conversation as follows: He stated that he had asked appellant the question, \u201cAre you the driver of the Chevrolet?\u201d and that appellant answered, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">Appellant\u2019s one bill of exception contains the direct, cross, redirect, recross and redirect examination of the witness Wheeler during the presentation of the state\u2019s case in chief and the direct and cross on rebuttal; and the objection is leveled at \u201call of the testimony of the witness Wheeler, relative to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>versation with the defendant\u201d on the grounds that the same was not a part of the res gestae.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">It will be noted that the witness first testified that, from his conversation with appellant, he concluded that appellant had been drinking heavily. This was clearly admissible, though a part of his conversation with appellant. It is further noted that appellant\u2019s counsel questioned the witness about his conversation with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">A part of the testimony complained of being admissible and a part being elicited by appellant, an objection to all of it was too general to raise a question for review in this court. An objection must be specific as to the portion of the testimony to which it is leveled.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">After the state had rested, appellant testified as to what he had told officer Wheeler, and then officer Wheeler was called in rebuttal by the state and gave his version thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Under the doctrine of Florence v. State, 109 Tex. Cr. R. 339, 4 S. W. (2d) 555, this rebuttal testimony was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Finding no reversible error, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
