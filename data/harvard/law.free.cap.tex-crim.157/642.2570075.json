State, 138 Tex. Cr. Rep. 4, 133 S. W. 2d 584, in discussing the above quoted portion of the act, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-20\">\u201cThis provision of the statute seems to be mandatory, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>before a person charged with a felony can waive the valuable right of a trial by jury, provided he has no attorney representing him, we hold that it is the duty of the trial court to appoint one for him. Such an appointment should have been made by the trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">The trial court should have granted appellant\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
