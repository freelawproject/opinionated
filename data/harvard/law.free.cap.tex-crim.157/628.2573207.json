The jury was instructed to acquit appellant unless they found from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that appellants were found by the officers in such a place or under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">No objections were made to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">The statement of facts, approved by counsel for the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>and counsel for appellants, contains no ordinance of the city of Galveston, nor do we find any direct testimony that the place of arrest was in the city of Galveston. We are not authorized to take judicial notice of ordinances of municipalities, nor may we assume that the streets patrolled by the officers were within the corporate limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">In the absence of proof showing the arrests to have been made in the city of Galveston, it is unnecessary that we pass upon the effect of the absence of an objection to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Nor do we find it necessary to pass upon appellants\u2019 contention that, under the facts, the arrests were not authorized by the ordinance set forth in the charge and the contention that the ordinance, if it exists, is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Upon the record the conviction must be set aside because of the want of authority of the officers to make the arrests and searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The judgment against each of appellants is reversed and the causes remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
