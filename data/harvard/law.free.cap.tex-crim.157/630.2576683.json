They were engaged in shooting dice when the difficulty arose, the scene being a room back of a cafe in the city of Amarillo.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">An argument arose during the dice game about eight o\u2019clock in the morning when appellant, who was losing, accused the deceased of cheating, attacked him and demanded the return of his money. The deceased struck the appellant with a chair and appellant stabbed the deceased in the back with his pocket knife. The deceased then ran from the room into the street, where he was immediately struck by a passing car. His injuries included a broken thigh. He was then taken to a hospital where he soon died.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The medical testimony was to the effect that death resulted from the stab wound and not from injuries suffered by the deceased as a result of being hit by the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">The jury was instructed, in the court\u2019s charge, that if death would not have resulted but for the automobile striking the deceased, they should acquit.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">In other parts of the charge the jury was required to find that the deceased died as a result of a stab wound inflicted by appellant in order to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">Also at the request of the state, the jury was instructed that it was not necessary that the stab wound be the sole cause of death, it being sufficient if it was one of the material and contributing causes which either alone or coupled with other injuries \u201cin the natural and unbroken sequence of events\u201d brought about the death of the deceased and without which stab wound death would not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">Appellant objected to the giving of this requested charge as being on the weight of the evidence, and being erroneous and in conflict with the law as given elsewhere in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>We are inclined to the view that the charge is not on the weight of the evidence, and considering the instructions as a whole, appellant suffered no injury from the giving of the requested charge. Reversal is therefore not called for. See Art. 666, Vernon\u2019s Ann. C.C.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Several bills of exception are addressed to the testimony of the state\u2019s witness John Allen, an officer. Allen was recalled after appellant had testified in his own behalf, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">\u201cOut there that morning, as soon as I heard about Leon DeBose getting hit by the car I walked over to Mr. John Allen\u2019s car and told him, \u2018Here is the dice, I want you to hold them as evidence, and he has $55.00 of my money, and I want you to get it and take it to court and hold it for evidence, because I am going to say something about it in court.\u2019 When he took me to jail, I says, \u2018Did you get my money off that boy?\u201d and he says, \u2018No, I didn\u2019t need to.\u2019 And when I asked him again he told me that Clifford got in the ambulance and took $71.00 off of him. I know the boy had $55.00 of my money and I know that he had three $20.00 bills of his own.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">\u201cI stayed right there in the gambling house, didn\u2019t ever come out, until the police came. They got me and put me in the scout car. I don\u2019t remember whether it was Mr. Sewell, or who, but one of them, told me to sit there in the car, and then pretty soon Mr. Allen came and took me to jail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Upon being recalled Allen was asked by the district attorney: \u201cAnd what did he say about DeBose, in his own words?\u201d to which appellant made the objection: \u201cIt is shown he was under arrest at the time,' and it is not part of the res gestae, and it is not admissible for any reason whatever.\u201d The objection being overruled, Allen answered: \u201cHe told me he hoped the son-of-a-bitch died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The bills are insufficient to show reversible error for the reason it is not shown therein as a fact that the evidence received was not admissible under the rule of res gestae, the statement as a ground of objection to that effect being insufficient. See Hall v. State, 141 Tex. Cr. R. 607, 150 S.W. 2d 404, 4 Tex. Jur. p. 328, sec. 224; Branch\u2019s Ann. P.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Further, the testimony appears to be a part of the same conversation which appellant testified about on his direct examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>tion and is admissible under the statute Art. 728 C.C.P., a part of which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\">\u201cWhen part of an act, declaration or conversation or writing is given in evidence by one party, the whole on the same subject may be inquired into by the other . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction, and we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
