Bill No. 1 complains of the testimony regarding the search, and Bill No. 2 of the marijuana cigarette as an exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-12\">Both bills set out the ground of the objection as follows:-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-13\">\u201c* * * that the results of such search of the defendant was inadmissible under the provisions of Article 727a, Code of Criminal Procedure of the State of Texas, in that the arrest of the defendant was an illegal arrest as being in violation of Articles 212, 213, 215, and 217, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, said arrest being made without a warrant, and that a proper predicate had not been laid under Article 725b of the Penal Code of Texas so as to authorize a search of the defendant * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-14\">Nowhere in the bills does the trial court certify that in fact the officers had no search warrant, that in fact the officers had no warrant of arrest, or that in fact a proper predicate had not been laid for the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-15\">It follows that the bills are deficient and show no reversible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>error. See Martinez v. State, No. 25,563 (Page 91, this volume), 246 S. W. (2d) 633 this day decided and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">No reversible error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
