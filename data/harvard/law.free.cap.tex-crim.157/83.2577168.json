Appellant insists that the court had no right to be in session at that time and that therefore this trial was without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The following is an order of the commissioners\u2019 court dated February 12, 1951:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">\u201cThe Court approved County Court Terms as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">Term #1 being the months of \u2014 January and February</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">Term #2 being the months of \u2014 March and April</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-12\">Term #3 being the months of \u2014 May and June</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-13\">Term #4 being the months of \u2014 July and August</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-14\">Term #5 being the months of \u2014 September and October</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-15\">Term #6 being the months of \u2014 November and December</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-16\">\u201cJustice Court is in continuous session. A new Court being convened each 4th Monday of each Month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-17\">\u201cSam Bullock, County Judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-18\">Appellant contends that the order does not fix the terms of the County Court as provided by law for the commissioners\u2019 court. It is insisted that the word \u201capproved\u201d does not mean that the commissioners\u2019 court fixed those dates as the county court terms. We cannot agree with this contention. It seems to us that if the commissioners\u2019 court approved such as the terms of the county court of Mitchell County, it means that the commissioners\u2019 court fixed those as the dates of such terms and that the county court of Mitchell County should meet and remain in session for each two months as set forth therein, the present trial having been held in one of such terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-19\">Appellant also complains because the court, in setting forth the penalty in the event of a conviction herein, failed to charge the law relative to the punishment, in that the violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>of the law charged against appellant herein could have been punished by a fine or imprisonment in the county jail, either or both. The court neglected to say that appellant could have been punished by a fine and given a jail sentence, either or both, but only charged the assessment of either but not both. As a result thereof, so appellant contends, he was only fined the sum of $1,000.00, and that no jail penalty was assessed. In the first place, we are loathe to see where appellant was injured because of the court\u2019s failure to charge that both a fine and imprisonment could have been assessed against appellant. In the second place, we do not find any objection in the record to the court\u2019s charge. Therefore, appellant\u2019s contention is overruled in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b101-5\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b101-6\">MORRISON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Appellant questions the source of the order set forth in our original opinion. When the transcript was originally received by this court, it was defective in that it contained no caption. At the suggestion of our clerk, the clerk below furnished a supplemental transcript which contained the order set forth above, showing the terms of court as ordered by the commissioners\u2019 court.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Appellant contends that we are bound by the order fixing the term, as the same appears in the bill of exception, and that this court should not look elsewhere in the record in passing upon the question raised by the bill. We have examined each order and fail to find any material difference. As we construe the order shown in the bill of exception, as well as that contained in the supplemental transcript, we hold that the same provided for six terms of two months each, which would authorize the court to be in continuous session.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Bill of Exception No. 2 complains of that portion of the court\u2019s charge in which he instructed the jury as to the punishment they might assess. The charge properly gave the maximum and mimimum as to both the fine and imprisonment provided by Article 666-41, except that he failed to instruct them that they might assess both such fine and imprisonment. Thus, it will be seen that the punishment provided for in the court\u2019s charge was only a part of that provided by the statute and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>therefore, was more favorable to the accused than he was entitled to under the law and presents no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
