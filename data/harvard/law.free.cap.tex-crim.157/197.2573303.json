Schafer further testified that, after they arrived at the store, he told appellant that he had unloaded the calves at his pen and wanted to sell them; that appellant said he would look at them the next morning; that the following morning he returned, and. he then told appellant that one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>calves was his and that he had gotten the other from his grandfather; that they finally agreed upon a price of $75.00 for the two, and appellant gave him a check in that sum, marking the same, \u201cFor calves.\u201d There was further testimony from Schafer to the effect that he was at that time on a horse trade and needed $15.00 additional in order to close the same; that he secured this sum from appellant by means of a check marked, \u201cFor Loan.\u201d Schafer also testified that the appellant\u2019s pens consisted of a city block in the town of Glazier, one block from a through highway, with a dirt road running around the same and enclosed by a barbed wire fence; \u201cthat you could see cattle in (there) for 2 or 3 blocks\u201d; that he had pointed out the two calves in question to the officers at such pens on July the seventh, and that they were then restored to the owner. Schafer testified that he was familiar with livestock values, that, at the time he sold them for $75.00 he had \u201cthought they were worth a little more than that, but I didn\u2019t argue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The evidence relating to the identity of the two calves recovered as being the ones stolen was very meager. Schafer answered, in part, \u201cI didn\u2019t know * * * whether or not they were the same calves I hauled down there in April, I couldn\u2019t swear to it positively, and I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The owner of the calves did not reside on the ranch from which they were stolen and, in testifying about the identity of the calves which were returned to his ranch, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201cNot having seen them, I couldn\u2019t say the calves I saw in July were the same calves this boy took in April, of my own knowledge, because I didn\u2019t stay there. I don\u2019t know whether I had ever seen the calves before in my life until in July * * * I didn\u2019t know what these two calves were, or what they looked like that this boy took off my place in April, 1951, because I didn\u2019t see them. I didn\u2019t know what they looked like until they brought them back.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Kirk placed a value of $75.00 each on those returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The state offered the testimony of Schafer\u2019s brother and another, who stated that they had branded two calves in the pen in question with appellant\u2019s brand during the latter part of May or the early part of June.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Peace officers testified that, in the course of their investigations during the month of July, they called upon appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>to show them his cancelled checks, which he did; and, among them in their regular place, they found the two checks above described; that appellant told the officers that he had given one of the checks to Schafer in purchase of the two calves, which were still in his pen. The officers further testified that they recovered two calves from appellant\u2019s pen and returned them to the ranch where Schafer had been employed. They valued the calves so returned at $65.00 to $70.00 each. The officers described the pen where the calves had been kept as being surrounded by a barbed wire fence, with a road around it, and said \u201cSo far as concealing calves in a place like that, it would be impossible to conceal them * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Appellant, testifying in his own behalf, corroborated the State\u2019s witnesses in every detail, adding that he had known Schafer all his life and had no reason to doubt Schafer\u2019s statement to him that one of the calves had belonged to him and one he had gotten from his grandfather, who was Sam Schafer. Appellant testified that his pens, where he kept the calves, were located one block from the highway, one block from the railway, and open to the public and used by the public at all times for their convenience in storing cattle. Appellant testified that he had bought the calves to go with a cow he had in order to keep from milking her, and that he had refused to pay any more for the calves because he did not know how they would work out with the cow.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">It will be noted, from the above, that there is an absence of corroboration of Schafer\u2019s testimony to the effect that he had stolen the calves found in appellant\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Recently, in Carpenter v. State, 156 Tex. Cr. R. 461, 243 S. W. (2d) 834, we had occasion to reverse a conviction for receiving and concealing stolen property; there, we said, \u201cMoreover, Gilley was an accomplice witness and there is an utter absence of any corroborating testimony that the tires he said he sold and delivered to appellant were, in fact stolen tires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">No corroboration is supplied by the owner\u2019s testimony that Schafer had told him of the theft. Recently, in Curry v. State, 151 Tex. Cr. R. 102, 205 S. W. (2d) 586, we cited with approval from Texas Jurisprudence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201cAn accomplice witness cannot corroborate himself or furnish corroboration of his testimony by a statement to a third person who testifies thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>The evidence of concealment is totally absent. The calves were kept in a pen in town visible to the public for about 2% months.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">We further note that the evidence fails to show that appellant knew the calves to have been stolen at the time he received them.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Appellant had known Schafer all his life and testified he had no reason to doubt Schafer\u2019s statement to him, admitted by Schafer, that one of the calves was his and that he had gotten the other from his grandfather. Here, we have no testimony from the thief that the receiver knew the property to have been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Because the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
