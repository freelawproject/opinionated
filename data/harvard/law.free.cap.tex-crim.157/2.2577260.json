Miss Tigert testified that at this point appellant got out of his car with a pair of pliers in his hand, cursed deceased for having shone his light on him, hit deceased over the head with the pliers, and then stabbed deceased in the stomach with the same. Miss Tigert further testified that after some additional conflict appellant drove away, leaving her to carry deceased home.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">The state proved that deceased died some 30 hours later as the result of a puncture of his stomach inflicted by a blunt instrument, and that when appellant was first questioned by the officers he denied having been at White Rock Lake on the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-8\">Appellant and his companion of the evening, who was by the time of the trial his wife, both testified that the deceased had been the aggressor in the conflict and that appellant had acted in his own self defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-9\">One bill of exception is presented for our review. It claims that the trial court in his charge did not give appellant the benefit of his affirmative defenses under his claim of self defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-10\">The court qualified this bill by stating that in his main charge he had given an unlimited charge on self defense and that he had refused appellant\u2019s requested charge because, in his opinion, the same was on the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-11\">After a review of the main charge, we conclude that the trial court was correct in his qualification of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Finding no reversible error, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b20-4\">ON APPELLANT\u2019S motion for rehearing</p>\n<author id=\"b20-5\">BEAUCHAMP, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">In appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing he insists that he was entitled to a charge affirmatively submitting his issue of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">In his objections to the court\u2019s charge he did make this complaint. He then presented a requested charge which the court refused because, as stated in his qualification to the bill of exception, it was on the weight of the evidence. This bill need not be considered. The objections to the court\u2019s charge raise the issue. The original opinion could have gone further and said that an examination of the court\u2019s charge shows that he properly submitted the issue of self-defense in an affirmative manner applying the law to the facts of the case. This we find to be embodied within the court\u2019s charge. There was, therefore, no ground for complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-8\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
