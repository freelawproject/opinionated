The deceased, Miguel Gonzales, was also in the cafe and was included in appellant\u2019s offer to \u201cset up the beer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>to everybody.\u201d Deceased refused the invitation, and this appeared to irritate the appellant. The latter then requested Sanchez to take him home, and left the cafe, going to Sanchez\u2019s pick-up truck. Later, appellant was seen standing by the truck talking to deceased and was heard to say to him, \u201cFollow me.\u201d Appellant walked away, with deceased following. Some time afterward, his clothing bloody, appellant returned to the cafe with a pistol in his hand and told Martines that he had killed the deceased and wanted to be taken to \u201cthe law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Upon surrendering to the sheriff, appellant stated to him, also, that he had killed the deceased. He then handed the sheriff the pistol, in which there were four fired and two unfired cartridges. The sheriff went to the scene of the killing, as disclosed by the appellant when questioned, and found that deceased had been shot twice; once in the left breast and once in the neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Appellant testified to facts showing that he shot in self-defense from the actual attack of the deceased. He insisted, further, that he had shot into the ground twice as a warning to deceased to leave him alone. A witness corroborated that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">As a part of its testimony in chief, the state proved by Jesus Gonzales, the brother of deceased, that appellant had been keeping company with his (Jesus Gonzales\u2019s wife) wife under circumstances suggesting an illicit relationship between them and that, about a week prior to the homicide, the witness accompanied by the deceased, found her and appellant in appellant\u2019s truck parked on a public highway at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">To the introduction of this testimony the appellant registered several objections, chief among which was that it was irrelevant, immaterial, and highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The conclusion is expressed that in overruling the objection the learned trial judge fell into error, for we are unable to see wherein it was material for the state to prove acts of misconduct on the part of the appellant with the wife of a brother of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The prejudicial effect of such testimony can hardly be doubted, and reversible error is shown thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">This disposition of the case renders unnecessary a discussion of the question of newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>For the error discussed, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b395-5\">ON state\u2019s motion for rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b395-6\">MORRISON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Our able state\u2019s attorney has urged us to modify our original opinion. If the same may be construed as holding that in no case is it admissible to prove clandestine conduct between the appellant and the sister-in-law of the deceased, then it should be modified. We did not intend to so hold, but did hold that, in the case at bar, the materiality of such testimony had not been established. On another trial, it is possible that the materiality thereof may be developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Remaining convinced that we properly disposed of this cause originally, the state\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
