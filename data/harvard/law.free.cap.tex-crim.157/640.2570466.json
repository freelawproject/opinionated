The trial court qualified such bill as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">\u201cThe Court cannot certify that the argument of the Assistant District Attorney as complained of above was, or was not, made for the reason stated in this bill; that the Court had for the moment stepped into an adjoining office and did not hear the statement made as alleged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">It is apparent from the bill of exception as qualified that the trial judge absented himself from the courtroom during the trial and thereby placed himself in a position where he could not hear what transpired; further, that during his absence the argument for the state continued; that appellant\u2019s counsel considered a remark of the state\u2019s attorney to be improper and desired to object thereto and have the jury instructed to disregard the remark; and, finally, that appellant was deprived of a ruling on his objection and motion because of the absence of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">Recently, in Gasway v. State, (page 647, this volume), 248 S. W. 2d 942, it was alleged that the judge had gone to sleep during the interrogation of a witness. The statement of facts in that case gave us an accurate picture of everything that occurred during the moment of inattentiveness, and we found therefrom that nothing had transpired that would cause injury to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Here, however, we conclude that the accused has been deprived of a valuable right to have an impartial arbiter present to rule on his objections and that the cause must be reversed because of such deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
