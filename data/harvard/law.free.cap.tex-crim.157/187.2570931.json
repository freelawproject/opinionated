The district judge issued the writ of habeas corpus, the relator was produced before him and witnesses were introduced. Relator produced no testimony other than the cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">We have read appellant\u2019s brief and the statement of facts in its entirety and are of the opinion that the trial court should be sustained in denying bail in this case. See Ex parte Cantu, 135 Tex. Cr. R. 281, 117 S.W. 2d 1102; Ex parte Roberts, 151 Tex. Cr. R. 547, 209 S.W. 2d 361; Ex parte Smithwick, 154 Tex. Cr. R. 105, 225 S.W. 2d 187; Ex parte Meeks, et al, 154 Tex. Cr. R. 250, 226 S.W. 2d 437; and Ex parte Aeby, 154 Tex. Cr. R. 391; 228 S.W. 2d 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-15\">While not commenting upon the testimony at this time, we think the judge was supported by the evidence. It was a matter within his discretion and there being no indication of a defense or extenuating circumstances, we cannot say he abused that discretion. The judgment remanding relator to the custody of the sheriff without bail is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
