John A. Hancher, Judge Presiding.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-14\"><em>E. W. Newman, Heidingsfelder, Knight &amp; Dcmiel, </em>all of Houston, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-15\"><em>George P.

The. appellant, father of one of the participants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>by words and gestures, encouraged his son in the affray. The sole question is whether the wounds inflicted gave rise to apprehension of danger to life, health or limb.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The doctor, in describing the black eye received by the injured party, testified on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u201cAt that time he had a severe bruise of the left eye around the orbit of the eye and the soft tissue was black, the eyeball was bleeding and had what was called subconjunctive hemorrage, that is a hemorrage of the outer layer of the eyeball.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">On cross-examination, we find the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">\u201cQ. Was this injury to Mr. Mayes of a permanent nature? A. No, not in my opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">\u201cQ. Would it be such an injury that would endanger his life or his health? A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Later, we find:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">\u201cQ. How long were you in bed? A. Oh, I layed around 2 or 3 days, I think.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Recently, in Gonzales v. State, 146 Tex. Cr. R. 108, 172 S. W. (2d) 97, we had occasion to review our decision on the question of what constitutes serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">From the record before us, it does not appear that the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">Judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
