State, 147 Tex. Cr. R. 98, 178 S. W. 2d 865, and Jordan v. State, 140 Tex. Cr. R. 238, 144 S. W. 2d 274, which are cited by appellant, and Harrell v. State, 153 Tex. Cr. R. 141, 218 S. W. 2d 466, sustain his contention. However, in the case of Ex parte James Byrd, No. 25,808, decided June 18, 1952, (Page 595, this volume), 251 S. W. (2d) 537, 538, the doctrine upon which the Harrell, Brooks and Jordan cases rested \u2014 that is, that assault with intent to murder with malice and assault with intent to murder without malice are separate and distinct offenses \u2014 was expressly overruled. Therefore, the cases mentioned and all others were overruled in so far as they may be inconsistent with that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">It is apparent, then, under the holding in the Byrd case, that the verdict here is not vague or indefinite. Accordingly, the sentence is reformed so as to read \u201cnot less than one nor more than two years\u201d in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">Where the jury\u2019s verdict is silent on the question of malice, we will construe such verdict as a finding of guilty of assault with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>intent to murder without malice, if the punishment is less than three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">As so reformed, the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Opinion approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
