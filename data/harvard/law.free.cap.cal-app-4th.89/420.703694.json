Action No. 96F07655 was a proceeding to revoke probation in a felony case which was consolidated for hearing with action No. 98M09139. At the conclusion of the misdemeanor trial/probation revocation hearing, the trial court revoked probation based on its independent evaluation of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">This court is without jurisdiction to adjudicate an appeal in action No. 98M09139; an appeal in said action must be taken to the appellate division of the superior court. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 11; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1466.) The appeal from action No. 98M09139 is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">The appeal from action No. 96F07655 remains properly pending in this court. However, the parties, in their briefs, have raised issues and cited law that apply to trials and not necessarily to probation revocation proceedings. All briefs of appellant and respondent are hereby stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">Appellant shall file, within 30 days, a new opening brief that raises issues, if any, as are appropriate to the probation revocation proceeding. Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>shall file its brief within 30 days of the filing of appellant\u2019s new opening brief. Appellant may thereafter file a reply brief within the time designated by the California Rules of Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-14\">Before Sims, Acting P.
