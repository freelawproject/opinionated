In her motion, Tucci relied on the provision in the California workers\u2019 compensation law (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3200 et seq.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> allowing her to avoid the law\u2019s exclusivity to sue for damages in tort. Tucci claimed she was entitled to summary judgment on the issue of her employer\u2019s negligence. In its motion, Club Med acknowledged the jurisdiction of the California courts but contended that under applicable choice of law principles, the law of the Dominican Republic governed and precluded Tucci\u2019s tort action against her employer. Ruling that the law of the Dominican Republic applied, the trial court granted Club Med summary judgment and denied Tucci\u2019s motion. We conclude, pursuant to established choice of law principles, that the trial court was correct. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The facts are undisputed. Tucci, a California resident, accepted by telephone the offef to work for four months as an aerobics instructor for the Club Med resort in Punta Cana, the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">While at work in Punta Cana, Tucci injured her eye. On April 18, 1996, on her ride back from an eye doctor\u2019s office in Santo Domingo, in a truck owned by Club Med and driven by a Club Med employee, she suffered pelvic injuries. After being treated locally, she was airlifted to a United States hospital for further treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Pursuant to Dominican Republic law, Club Med maintained workers\u2019 compensation insurance for its employees with AXA Courtage (a French insurance company). AXA Courtage is not authorized to write compensation insurance in California. Club Med had not secured a workers\u2019 compensation policy with an insurer licensed in California. AXA Courtage paid Tucci in excess of $110,000 in medical benefits. She rejected all additional benefits offered by Club Med and its insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Tucci filed for benefits with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB), which action is not part of this lawsuit. Simultaneously, she brought this personal injury suit in superior court seeking declaratory relief and damages for breach of Club Med\u2019s statutory duty to carry workers\u2019 compensation according to California law, and for negligent operation, maintenance, and entrustment of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">In due course, Tucci moved for summary judgment on the grounds, because she was a resident of California at the time of her injury and the employment contract was entered into in California, that she was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits from California. She then asserted, because Club Med failed to carry a workers\u2019 compensation policy with an insurer \u201cduly authorized [and licensed] to write compensation insurance in this state\u201d (\u00a7 3700, subd. (a); see \u00a7 5305), that she was entitled further to <em>avoid </em>the exclusivity of the workers\u2019 compensation law and sue Club Med in tort for damages (\u00a7 3706, 3700, subd. (a)); see including attorney fees, and to invoke the applicable presumption of employer negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Club Med opposed Tucci\u2019s motion and claimed its entitlement to summary judgment on the ground of an absolute defense. Rather than to contest jurisdiction, Club Med urged that choice of law principles required application of the law of the Dominican Republic whose workers\u2019 compensation and social security systems provided the exclusive remedy for Tucci\u2019s work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>The trial court granted Club Med\u2019s summary judgment motion and denied Tucci\u2019s motion. Applying California choice of law rules, the trial court concluded that Dominican Republic law governed this case. In particular, the court found while Club Med did not have a \u201cCalifornia policy,\u201d as defined under the Labor Code, the AXA Courtage insurance policy provided Tucci \u201cwith proper coverage under <em>Dominican law.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) That is, the court noted, all medical treatment that plaintiff had undergone by the time of the judgment, totaling well over $110,000, was fully paid for by AXA Courtage pursuant to the worker\u2019s compensation policy purchased by Tucci\u2019s employer. The court noted that Tucci did not claim that her employer had failed to provide her coverage or that the benefits were inadequate. Rather, the court observed, Tucci\u2019s position was that she should be allowed to sue her employer for tort damages because Club Med did not purchase a <em>California </em>workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy. After all of her claims were dismissed, Tucci filed her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">1. <em>Standard of review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u201c ' \u201cSummary judgment is granted when there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. [Citation.] We review the trial court\u2019s decision to grant [Club Med\u2019s] summary judgment de novo.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] An appellate court is not bound by the trial court\u2019s stated reasons, if any, supporting its ruling; we review the ruling, not the rationale. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Prilliman v. United Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 935, 951 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 142].) There being no dispute as to the operative facts here, the question is purely a legal one for us to resolve by de novo review. (Ibid.; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c.)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">2. <em>Jurisdiction of the California courts is not at issue in this case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Initially, we address Tucci\u2019s contention that section 5305 requires application of California substantive law in this case. Section 5305 is a <em>jurisdictional </em>statute and has no impact on choice of law principles. That section declares the jurisdiction of the California Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the WCAB over all controversies arising out of (1) injuries suffered outside California to employees who are residents of California at the time of the injury when (2) the employment contract was made in California. (\u00a7 5305<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1967) 68 Cal.2d 7, 11 [64 Cal.Rptr. 440, 434 P.2d 992], disapproved on another point in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>LeVesque v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 627, 637 [83 Cal.Rptr. 208, 463 P.2d 432].) As a California resident who contracted in California for employment with Club Med, and who was injured in the course of her employment outside California, Tucci falls within the class of people whom \u201cthe Legislature intended to protect under the comprehensive California workmen\u2019s compensation statute.\u201d <em>(Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 17.) <em> </em>There is thus no doubt that the <em>WCAB </em>has subject matter jurisdiction over Tucci\u2019s <em>workers\u2019 compensation claim </em>in California. (\u00a7 5305.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n                   Tucci\u2019s right to <em>workers\u2019 compensation benefits, </em>however, is not at issue here; that is before the WCAB elsewhere.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   The point here is that because it is a jurisdictional statute involving the WCAB and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, section 5305 does not determine whether California law or the Dominican Republic\u2019s rule of decision governs the substantive issues in an action for damages at common law. (\u00a7 3209.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">As contrasted with the claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, a California superior court does have both subject matter and personal jurisdiction over Tucci\u2019s common law action for damages. Club Med has submitted to the jurisdiction of the California courts over it. Once in a California forum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the question for our resolution is what rule of decision controls the substantive issues in this case. (See <em>Janzen </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 61 Cal.App.4th 109, 115 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 260].)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">3. <em>Applicable legal principles and the parties\u2019 contentions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">We turn then to an overview of the relevant principles of workers\u2019 compensation law. Nearly every workers\u2019 compensation statute in this country contains \u201can exclusive remedy provision\u201d under which an employee who receives \u201can award of statutory benefits [is] foreclosed from] any other type of compensation for the [work-related] injury, including damages in tort. [Citation.] Employees trade their tort remedies \u2018for a system of compensation without contest, thus sparing [them] the cost, delay and uncertainty of a claim in litigation.\u2019 [Citation.] Conversely, workers\u2019 compensation statutes typically allow a damages remedy against employers who fail to assume the statutory compensation burdens.\u201d <em>(Garcia v. American Airlines, Inc., supra, </em>12 F.3d at p. 310, fn. omitted; <em>Huffman v. City of Poway </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 975, 987 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 325].) The employer \u201cwho avoids sharing the burdens of the system is not entitled to enjoy its primary benefit, the immunity from non-statutory liability.\u201d <em>(Garcia v. American Airlines, Inc., supra, </em>12 F.3d at p. 310.) This is the workers\u2019 compensation quid pro quo. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 311.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">This quid pro quo works thusly for a California resident injured elsewhere: An employee, who was <em>hired here </em>and who suffered accidental injury in the course of employment outside this state, is entitled to seek California workers\u2019 compensation <em>benefits. </em>(\u00a7 3600.5, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The injured employee may also avoid the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision and seek damages at common law, against the employer who fails to assume the statutory burdens by \u201cfail[ing] to <em>secure the payment of compensation.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 3706, italics added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As applicable here, employers obtain security for payment of compensation pursuant to section 3700, subdivision (a), by obtaining insurance through an insurer that is <em>\u201cduly authorized to write compensation insurance in this state.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">By contrast, the Dominican Republic\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law provides the exclusive remedy for an employee injured there. The workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>compensation insurer in the Dominican Republic is obligated, upon receipt of proof of an injury, to disburse funds irrespective of negligence. Additionally, all employees in the Dominican Republic have access to the state social security system, which operates as a pension plan and state-sponsored health care provider. Otherwise, employees in the Dominican Republic may <em>not </em>file a negligence action against the employer independent from an action to recover workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Punitive or exemplary damages are also unavailable to employees there.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Tucci\u2019s position is essentially, because she was hired in California and injured in the course of employment outside of this state, that California law governs and she is entitled to California\u2019s compensation benefits. Continuing, she argues, because Club Med was not insured by a company licensed to write insurance in California (\u00a7 3700, subd. (a)), section 3706 allows her to avoid the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision and to seek additional recovery in tort. Stated differently, even though she may obtain all California workers\u2019 compensation benefits that exceed her recovery under Dominican Republic law (see fn. 5, <em>ante), </em>Tucci aims additionally <em>to </em>render inapplicable the exclusivity of the California Workers\u2019 Compensation Act on the ground that AXA Courtage is not an insurance company \u201cduly authorized to write compensation insurance in this state.\u201d (\u00a7 3700, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Club Med argues, under applicable choice of law rules, that the law of the Dominican Republic governs and prohibits Tucci from obtaining any recovery beyond worker\u2019s compensation benefits and that country\u2019s social security system.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Thus, our task is to determine which law applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">4. <em>Conflict of laws analysis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">When it is the forum, California resolves choice-of-law questions in disputes arising out of a tort using the \u201cgovernmental interest analysis,\u201d which balances the interests of the involved states and parties. <em>(Offshore Rental Co. v. Continental Oil Co. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 157, 161 [148 Cal.Rptr. 867, 583 P.2d 721] [applying Louisiana law in tort action].) \u201cCalifornia applies its own rule of decision unless a party litigant properly invokes the law of a foreign state. A party advocating application of foreign law \u2018must demonstrate that the [foreign] rule of decision will further the interest of that foreign state and therefore that it is an appropriate one for the forum to apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>to the case before it.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(McGhee v. Arabian American Oil Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 871 F.2d 1412, 1422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">This governmental interest analysis involves three steps. (1) The court determines whether the foreign law differs from that of the forum. (2) If there is a difference, the court examines each jurisdiction\u2019s interest in the application of its own law to determine whether a \u201ctrue conflict\u201d exists. <em>(McGhee v. Arabian American Oil Co., supra, </em>871 F.2d at p. 1422, citing <em>Offshore Rental Co. v. Continental Oil Co., supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 161-162.) When both jurisdictions have a legitimate interest in the application of its rule of decision, (3) the court analyzes the \u201c \u2018comparative impairment\u2019 of the interested jurisdictions.\u201d <em>(McGhee, supra, </em>871 F.2d at p. 1422.) The court applies \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe law of the state whose interest would be the <em>more impaired </em>if its law were <em>not </em>applied.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added, quoting from <em>Offshore Rental Co., supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 165.) With these rules in mind, we turn to a comparison of the laws of these two jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">a. <em>The laws of California and the Dominican Republic differ.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">With respect to the exclusivity of workers\u2019 compensation, the laws of California and the Dominican Republic are clearly different. As explained above, under California law, when an employer is not insured by a company authorized to write insurance in California, the injured employee may obtain compensation benefits and also sue for damages in tort.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> By contrast, an employee in the Dominican Republic may not file a negligence claim independent of an action to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">b. A <em>true conflict exists between California\u2019s interests and those of the Dominican Republic.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Turning to the respective interests of California and the Dominican Republic in providing recovery under each state\u2019s laws, we conclude they are divergent, although both jurisdictions have recognized \u201csubstantial interests ... in the welfare and subsistence of disabled workers.\u201d <em>(Thomas </em>v. <em>Washington Gas Light Co., supra, </em>448 U.S. at p. 285 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2663].)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\"> California has clearly expressed its interest in swiftly compensating its own residents for work-related injuries <em>(State Comp. Ins. Fund v. Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 264, 272 [125 P.2d 42]), in triggering industrial safety, encouraging employers to obtain adequate insurance, and in shifting the cost of injury onto the cost of goods rather than onto society. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>(S. G. Borello &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 341, 354 [256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\n                   More important, California has a strong interest in assuring that its employers are adequately insured. (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 4.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The quid pro quo, above described, allowing an injured employee to avoid the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity, provides an incentive for employers to secure adequate insurance. (\u00a7 3602; <em>Huffman </em>v. <em>City of Poway, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 987, quoting from <em>Hernandez v. Chavez Roofing Inc. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1092, 1095 [286 Cal.Rptr. 919]; <em>Rideaux v. Torgrimson, supra, </em>12 Cal.2d at p. 637; cf. <em>Neighbours v. Buzz Oates Enterprises </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 325, 334 [265 Cal.Rptr. 788] [penalties for failure to insure are incentive to employer to secure payment of compensation].)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The Dominican Republic\u2019s interest in applying its laws lies not only in making certain (1) that workers are adequately insured for workplace injuries, as in California, but also in (2) assuring that businesses in that country face limited and predictable financial liability for work-related injuries, and in (3) predictably defining the duties and liabilities of an employer doing business within its borders, all with the goal of encouraging business investment and development there. The Dominican Republic has a particular interest in applying its law to incidents occurring within its borders, where claims are based largely on the alleged acts of the employer in that country. (Cf. <em>Offshore Rental Co. v. Continental Oil Co., supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 168 [finding this same interest to be \u201cvital\u201d to Louisiana].) In short, both of the jurisdictions have legitimate interests in applying their own laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">c. <em>The Dominican Republic\u2019s interests will be more impaired by not applying its laws.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">We next look at whose interest would be most impaired if its law were not applied. \u201cIn workers\u2019 compensation law, the United States Supreme Court has long recognized that the state where an injury occurs, the state where an employment relationship is created, and the state where an injured employee resides all have the significant contacts necessary to justify application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>their own <em>workers\u2019 compensation laws. </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Dailey v. Dallas Carriers Corp., supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 726, italics added.) Hence, both the Dominican Republic where the injury occurred, and California where Tucci resides and the employment relationship was created, have sufficient connection to this case to justify Tucci\u2019s receipt of <em>workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">However, California\u2019s interest in assuring that Tucci receive maximum <em>workers\u2019 compensation benefits (Travelers Ins. Co. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at pp. 12-13) because she is a resident and the contract of hire was created here (\u00a7\u00a7 5305, 3600.5), does not in and of itself justify applying California law to enable her to seek <em>additional recovery </em>in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Applying California law to provide Tucci with a common law remedy would both contravene the quid pro quo around which American workers\u2019 compensation systems are designed <em>(Garcia v. American Airlines, Inc., supra, </em>12 F.3d at p. 311), and defeat the Dominican Republic\u2019s policy of providing limited and predictable legal liability and financial responsibility for employers. Under the quid pro quo, \u201cemployees secure \u2018a practical and expeditious remedy for their industrial accidents,\u2019 [citation], while employers secure \u2018a limited and determinate liability,\u2019 [citation]. . . . ffl] . . . ffl] When a worker\u2019s second claim is for common-law damages rather than additional benefits, however, most states, on grounds of comity and policy, will respect the other jurisdiction\u2019s exclusive remedy provisions immunizing the employer from non-statutory liability. [Citations.] The rationale underlying this uniform treatment is compelling. The central purpose of compensation acts is \u2018to substitute a limited but certain remedy for the former remedy in tort\u2014a compromise benefiting both employer and employee.\u2019 [Citations.] When an employee who has received benefits under such a compensation scheme later tries to get back into the common-law damage system, he is essentially un-doing this fundamental <em>quid pro quo. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Garcia v. American Airlines, Inc., supra, </em>12 F.3d at pp. 311-312.) Given that Tucci will receive all <em>compensation benefits </em>to which she may be entitled under either jurisdiction, and can also partake of the Dominican Republic\u2019s social security system\u2019s benefits, a holding allowing her also to sue for tort damages under California law would seriously undermine California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation bargain and flout the guarantee of predictable and limited liability for Dominican Republic employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Moreover, application of California law would not advance the purpose of the section 3706 penalty provision. Tucci seeks to avail herself of the penalty of a common law damages action simply because Club Med was not insured by a company authorized to write insurance in California as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>by section 3700, subdivision (a). However, the objective of section 3700 appears to be to ensure that employers are adequately insured by a solvent company.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Cal. State Federation of Labor, Rep. on Labor Legislation and Labor Record of Senators and Assemblymen, <em>supra, </em>at p. 9.) Tucci does not claim she was <em>inadequately </em>reimbursed. Nor can she given that AXA Courtage has paid all of her medical bills and she remains entitled to the Dominican Republic\u2019s social security system\u2019s benefits, and possibly any California benefits that exceed her Dominican Republic benefits. Therefore, California has little interest in penalizing Club Med for providing adequate workers\u2019 compensation through a solvent French, rather than Californian company.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><em>Reynolds Elec. etc. Co. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 429 [55 Cal.Rptr. 248, 421 P.2d 96], upon which Tucci relies, is hence distinguishable. There, the Nevada-based employer argued that application of California, as opposed to Nevada, workers\u2019 compensation law to a Californian injured in Nevada, would suggest that an employer must obtain insurance in every state from which it hires. The Supreme Court responded, \u201c[t]he judicial function does not encompass evaluating the wisdom of provisions of the Labor Code making California compensation laws applicable to contracts of hire consummated in this state. This is a problem which, if significant, should more appropriately be addressed to the Legislature.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 437-438.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, the argument in <em>Reynolds </em>was raised by a neighboring state\u2019s employer in an economy that was more local than global. More important, <em>Reynolds </em>involved the question of whether California law should apply to determine whether it has <em>jurisdiction </em>under section 5305 over a California resident who is injured elsewhere. <em>Reynolds </em>did not address whether, as here, the employee could subsequently avoid the exclusivity provision of workers\u2019 compensation as a penalty for the employer\u2019s failure to insure with a California company. Given the global economy extant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>California\u2019s interests would actually be protected by applying the Dominican Republic\u2019s ban on common law tort actions. Permitting a tort lawsuit against an international employer that does not obtain California-authorized insurance would place roadblocks to hiring qualified California employees, making it more difficult for California residents to obtain employment abroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The goals behind California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation scheme would not be harmed by applying Dominican Republic law. The aims of the California system to encourage employers to obtain adequate insurance and to place the cost of injury on the cost of goods rather than on society <em>(S. G. Borello &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Industrial Relations, </em>supra, 48 Cal.3d at p. 354) are met here. Club Med <em>had </em>adequate insurance and the burden of this injury was assumed by it and not by the California public. Moreover, California\u2019s interest in making certain that California residents, such as Tucci, receive the maximum workers\u2019 compensation benefits allowed by law <em>(Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at pp. 12-13; <em>Arno v. Club Med Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 22 F.3d 1464, 1468), is satisfied even if this state\u2019s laws are not applied because Tucci may seek all workers\u2019 compensation benefits afforded by California law that exceed those to which she is entitled in the Dominican Republic. California\u2019s interests would not be impaired if they were not applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Turning to the Dominican Republic\u2019s interests, its critical goal of fostering business investment and development, its legitimate interest in seeing that its law determines the consequences of actions within its borders causing injury to people there <em>(McGhee v. Arabian American Oil Co., supra, </em>871 F.2d at pp. 1424-1425) and its interest in predictably and finally limiting liability predominate and would be significantly undermined if its laws were not applied. (See <em>Offshore Rental Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Oil Co., supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 168 [Louisiana\u2019s \u201cvital interest in promoting freedom of investment. . <em>. within Louisiana\u2019s borders . . . </em>.\u201d lies \u201cat the heart of Louisiana\u2019s law\u201d].) Our Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have both in the past resolved similar conflict of law questions by applying the law of the foreign jurisdiction where the conduct occurred causing injury there. <em>(Arno v. Club Med Inc., supra, </em>22 F.3d at p. 1468; see also <em>Offshore Rental Co., supra, </em>at p. 168; <em>McGhee, supra, </em>at pp. 1425-1426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Finally, application of Dominican Republic\u2019s law to limit Tucci\u2019s recovery to workers\u2019 compensation benefits comports with California\u2019s long-held preference for workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity.  \u201cThe rule of liberal construction [of the workers\u2019 compensation law] \u2018is not altered because a plaintiff believes that [she] can establish negligence on the part of [her] employer and brings a civil suit for damages.\u2019 [Citation.] It requires that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>liberally construe the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act \u2018in favor of <em>awarding workers\u2019] compensation, not in permitting civil litigation. </em>[Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Arriaga </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1055, 1065 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 116, 892 P.2d 150], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">On balance, California\u2019s interest will not be impaired if its laws do not govern, whereas the goals of the Dominican Republic\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation scheme will be greatly undermined if its laws are not applied in this case. This is especially true where Club Med was insured by a solvent company that paid Tucci all of her medical benefits, and she remains entitled to seek benefits under the Dominican social security system and is also pursuing any California workers\u2019 compensation benefits to which she may be entitled. Therefore, the trial court was correct, as a matter of law, in ruling that the law of the Dominican Republic governs the substantive issues of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Klein, P.

[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Garcia v. American Airlines, Inc. </em>(1st Cir. 1993) 12 F.3d 308, 309.) Hence, Tucci is not precluded from recovering a workers\u2019 compensation award in California, notwithstanding that she already recovered from AXA Courtage. (1 Herlick, Cal. Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (5th ed. 1996) \u00a7 13.01, pp. 13-3 to 13-4; <em>Thomas v.

To avoid double recovery, any award made in California will take into account the payments Tucci received from AXA Courtage.
