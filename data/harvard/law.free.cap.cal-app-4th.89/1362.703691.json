Code, \u00a7 289, subd. (j)), and was sentenced to the low term of three years in state prison. He argues that the judgment must be reversed because: (1) there was no substantial evidence of vaginal penetration; or (2) he was unlawfully coerced into waiving his right to a jury trial. In the published portion of this opinion we hold that the Penal Code section 289, subdivision (k)(l) definition of \u201csexual penetration\u201d as \u201cpenetration, however slight, of the genital . . . opening[]\u201d refers to penetration of the labia majora, rather than penetration of the vagina. This conclusion and others lead us to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">The incident occurred on November 25, 1998. The victim, five-year-old Jade E., testified at the preliminary hearing that she and appellant were on the couch in his house watching a movie when he touched her with his hand between her legs. She said that he touched her on the outside of her panties and that it hurt when he did so. She said that he kept his fingers still and did not move them. She went right away to her friend Barbara\u2019s house next door, and told her mother and her friend Nicole what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Based on that testimony, and records of a medical examination of Jade the next day which found various physical symptoms consistent with a \u201cmolest including blunt force penetration of hymenal tissue,\u201d appellant was held to answer on the charge of aggravated sexual assault of a child by forcible penetration with a foreign object. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 269, subd. (a)(5), 289, subd. (a)(1).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">Appellant filed a section 995 motion arguing that there was insufficient evidence of the force required for the section 269 charge; the motion was denied. Appellant renewed this argument in a writ petition to this court; that petition was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">Appellant thereafter waived his right to a jury trial in exchange for a six-year cap on his state prison sentence if he were convicted. As part of this bargain, appellant also waived his right to cross-examine Jade if the prosecution elected to use her testimony at the preliminary hearing in lieu of calling her as a witness at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">Jade\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony was admitted into evidence at trial, and the prosecution called two other witnesses: Jade\u2019s friend Nicole, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>Patricia Temaban, the physician\u2019s assistant who performed Jade\u2019s sexual assault examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Nicole testified that she and her mother Barbara lived next door to appellant. Jade, Jade\u2019s sister, Jade\u2019s mother Trenetta, and various members of appellant\u2019s family resided with appellant at the time of the incident. Nicole had known Jade for years; they were like sisters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Trenetta was over at the Nicole\u2019s apartment on the night in question. Jade banged on the door of the apartment around 10:00 p.m.; she was crying and looked scared. Jade told Nicole and Trenetta that appellant had licked her ear, put his tongue in her mouth, and put his hand in her pants, \u201cpoking her.\u201d When Nicole asked Jade where appellant had poked her, Jade pointed to her vagina. When Trenetta wiped Jade\u2019s vagina with a piece of tissue, Jade said \u201cit bums.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Temaban testified that she had performed over 1,000 child sexual assault examinations and had been qualified as an expert in child sexual abuse in over 100 cases. She said that the injuries she observed when she examined Jade were consistent with \u201cblunt force trauma or digital penetration to the hymenal tissue.\u201d The injuries included: swelling of the labia majora; irritation of the perihymenal tissue; and a laceration and broken capillaries at the posterior fourchette. The abnormal shape of the border of the hymen was also indicative of a recent injury. Temaban opined that these injuries could have been inflicted by digital penetration through panties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Appellant and his daughter-in-law testified for the defense; their testimony is immaterial to the issues on appeal. Appellant\u2019s counsel conceded in closing argument that Temahan\u2019s testimony was \u201cconvincing to establish that Jade . . . was molested\u201d; he said this was entirely a case of \u201cwho done it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">The court found appellant guilty under section 289, subdivision (j) of object penetration without force, as a lesser included offense of the section 269 charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">A. <em>Substantial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">(1) <em>\u201cSexual Penetration\u201d in Violation of Section 289</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-13\">Section 289 provides: \u201c(j) Any person who participates in an act of sexual penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age and who is more than 10 years younger than he or she shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for three, six or eight years. ft[| (k) As used in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>section: [1Q (1) \u2018Sexual penetration\u2019 is the act of causing the penetration, however, slight, of the genital or anal openings of any person or causing another person to so penetrate the defendant\u2019s or another person\u2019s genital or anal openings for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or abuse by any foreign object, substance, instrument, or device, or by any unknown object.\u201d Appellant contends that the genital \u201copening\u201d to which the statute refers is the vagina, and thus that the judgment must be reversed because there was no evidence of vaginal penetration in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Appellant admits that an argument like the one he now advances was rejected in <em>People v. Karsai </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 224 [182 Cal.Rptr. 406].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The crime in that case was rape, which by the terms of section 263 is \u201ccomplete[d]\u201d by \u201c[a]ny sexual penetration, however slight.\u201d The defendant argued that he did not commit rape because his penis did not penetrate the victim\u2019s vagina. The victim testified that she believed the defendant\u2019s penis was inside her body when it was between her labia majora and minora, and at the entrance to her vagina. The court held that \u201c[p]enetration of the external genital organs is sufficient to constitute sexual penetration and to complete the crime of rape even if the rapist does not thereafter succeed in penetrating into the vagina.\u201d (131 Cal.App.3d at p. 232.) This conclusion was consistent with the \u201cuniversal rule\u201d in other jurisdictions, and the \u201cclear intent\u201d of the statutory reference to penetration, \u201chowever slight.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 233.) The court noted that the \u201cpenetration which is required is sexual penetration and not vaginal penetration.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Appellant attempts to distinguish <em>Karsai </em>on the ground that section 289, unlike the rape statute (\u00a7 263), refers to penetration of an \u201copening.\u201d  However, statutes relating to the same subject are to be harmonized if possible. <em>(People v. Simon </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 493, 514 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 278, 886 P.2d 1271]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lamb </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 664, 678 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 565].)  The \u201csexual penetration\u201d element of section 289 can be readily harmonized with the \u201csexual penetration\u201d element of section 263 by interpreting the words \u201cgenital. . . opening[]\u201d in section 263 to refer to penetration of the labia majora in accordance with <em>Karsai, </em>rather than penetration of the vagina as appellant posits. Appellant offers no rationale for distinguishing the degree of penetration which constitutes rape from that which constitutes object penetration. On the other hand, there are a host of reasons, ranging from statutory language and case precedent to considerations of anatomy and policy, supporting the conclusion we reach here that the degree of penetration required to commit these crimes is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">First, to hold that no \u201cpenetration\u201d of an \u201copening\u201d occurred in this case would ignore the anatomical facts to which the medical examiner testified. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>The evidence shows that appellant\u2019s finger penetrated at least as far as the victim\u2019s hymen. Temaban explained in describing Jade\u2019s examination that the labia majora \u201care usually quite plum[p] and cover the genital area\u201d of a five-year-old girl, that the hymenal tissues are \u201cnot easy to get to,\u201d but that medical methods had been developed to painlessly separate the \u201cseveral layers of material\u201d and \u201cgive us a good view of what is hidden.\u201d The labia majora were thus an \u201copening\u201d through which appellant\u2019s finger penetrated. The labia majora are part of the female genitalia. (Stedman\u2019s Medical Dict. (26th ed. 1995) pp. 1257, 1954 [defining \u201cexternal female genital organs\u201d and \u201cvulva\u201d]; 3 Schmidt, Attorney\u2019s Dict, of Medicine (2000) p. G-59 [defining \u201cgenital organs, external\u201d].) Accordingly, the opening through which appellant\u2019s finger penetrated was a \u201cgenital\u201d opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Second, a \u201cgenital\u201d opening is not synonymous with a \u201cvaginal\u201d opening as appellant\u2019s argument assumes. The vagina is only one part of the female genitalia, which also include inter alia the labia majora, labia minora, and the clitoris. (Stedman\u2019s Medical Dict., <em>supra, </em>pp. 1257-1258, 1954 [defining \u201cexternal female genital organs,\u201d \u201cinternal female genital organs,\u201d and \u201cvulva\u201d]; 3 Schmidt, Attorney\u2019s Dict, of Medicine, <em>supra, </em>pp. G-59 to G-60 [defining \u201cgenital organs, external,\u201d \u201cgenital organs, internal,\u201d and \u201cgenitalia\u201d].) Thus, \u201cgenital\u201d opening does not necessarily mean \u201cvaginal\u201d opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Third, section 289 refers to a penetration of a \u201cgenital,\u201d not a \u201cvaginal,\u201d opening, and, fourth, this was not always the case. As amended in 1985, section 289 included three subdivisions, (a), (b), and (c) which referred to penetration of the \u201cgenital . . . opening[].\u201d (Stats. 1985, ch. 945, \u00a7 1, p. 2986.) In 1986, four new subdivisions, (d), (e), (f) and (g), were added which referred to the \u201cgenital . . . opening[],\u201d and three new subdivisions, (h), (i), and (j), were added which referred to the \u201cvaginal . . . opening[].\u201d (Stats. 1986, ch. 1299, \u00a7 6, pp. 4598-4599.) In 1988, the references to \u201cvaginal . . . opening[]\u201d were replaced by references to the \u201cgenital . . . opening[],\u201d so that all of the subdivisions referred consistently to the \u201cgenital . . . openingO.\u201d If. as appellant argues, \u201cgenital\u201d opening were synonymous with \u201cvaginal\u201d opening, the 1988 amendment would have been unnecessary. This amendment shows that the Legislature meant \u201cgenital,\u201d not \u201cvaginal,\u201d opening in section 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">Fifth, in contrast to section 289, a number of other statutes refer to penetration of the \u201cvagina.\u201d (E.g., \u00a7\u00a7 311.3, subd. (b)(2) [child exploitation statute defining \u201csexual conduct\u201d to include \u201c[p]enetration of the vagina or rectum by any object\u201d], 311.4 [same], 1203.066 [for probation eligibility after a violation of \u00a7 288 or 288.5, \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d includes \u201cpenetration of the vagina or rectum of either the victim or the offender by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>the penis of the other or by any foreign object\u201d], 11166 [reporting statute defining \u201csexual conduct\u201d to include \u201c[p]enetration of the vagina or rectum by any object\u201d]; Welf. &amp; Ins. Code, \u00a7 6600.1 [sexually violent predator statute defining \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d to include \u201cpenetration of the vagina or rectum of either the victim or the offender by the penis of the other or by any foreign object\u201d].) These statutes show that the Legislature knows how to say \u201cvagina,\u201d when it presumably means vagina.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Sixth, more recent amendments to section 289 also support application of the penetration standard for rape in cases of object penetration. Prior to October 10, 1999, the language at issue in section 289\u2014penetration of a \u201cgenital . . . opening!]\u201d\u2014was repeated in multiple subdivisions of section 289. (See Historical and Statutory Notes, 48 West\u2019s Ann. Pen. Code (2001 supp.) foil. \u00a7 289, pp. 44-46.) To streamline the statute without making a substantive change (Historical and Statutory Notes, 48 West\u2019s Ann. Pen. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 289, p. 46), the language in question was defined as \u201c \u2018sexual penetration\u2019 \u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 289, subd. (k)(l)), and references to acts of \u201csexual penetration\u201d were substituted for the longer, genital-opening formulation that had been repeated throughout the statute (see 48 West\u2019s Ann. Pen. Code, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 289, pp. 43-44).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Thus, sections 289 and 263 now use the very same words\u2014\u201csexual penetration\u201d\u2014to characterize the type of penetration that is prohibited.  \u201cThe Legislature, of course, is deemed to be aware of statutes and judicial decisions already in existence, and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof. [Citation.] Where a statute is framed in language of an earlier enactment on the same or an analogous subject, and that enactment has been judicially construed, the Legislature is presumed to have adopted that construction.\u201d <em>(People v. Harrison </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 321, 329 [256 Cal.Rptr. 401, 768 P.2d 1078].)  Appellant offers no grounds for rebutting that presumption here. The recent technical amendments to section 289 thus suggest that there has <em>never </em>been any difference in the degree of penetration required to violate sections 289 and 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">Seventh, the term \u201csexual penetration\u201d has also been added to many of the statutes that cross-reference section 289. (\u00a7\u00a7 209, subd. (b)(1) [kidnapping to commit \u201csexual penetration in violation of Section 289\u201d], 289.6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>subd. (d)(4) [prohibited consensual sexual activities in detention facilities include \u201c[sjexual penetration, as defined in subdivision (k) of Section 289\u201d], 667.71, subd. (c)(12) [habitual sex offender is one who has committed multiple specified offenses, including \u201c[kjidnapping in violation of Section 209 with the intent to commit. . . sexual penetration'in violation of Section 289\u201d], 667.9, subd. (c)(10) [sentence enhancements for \u201c[s]exual penetration, in violation of subdivision (a) of Section 289\u201d against certain types of victims], 999l, subd. (a) [criteria for repeat sexual offender prosecutions of defendants arrested for specified offenses, including \u201csexual penetration, in violation of Section 289\u201d], 1174.4, subd. (a)(2)(M) [eligibility for alternative sentencing; relevant crimes include \u201c[s]exual penetration in violation of subdivision (a) of Section 289\u201d], 2933.5, subd. (a)(2)(M) [eligibility for sentence credit; relevant crimes include \u201c[s]exual penetration as described in subdivision (a) of Section 289\u201d], 11160, subd. (d)(22) [duty to report injuries from certain conduct, including \u201c[s]exual penetration, in violation of Section 289\u201d], 12022.53, subd. (a)(13) [enhancement for personal use of a firearm in the commission of certain offenses, including \u201cSection 289 (sexual penetration)\u201d]; Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 15610.63, subd. (e)(8) [\u201csexual assault\u201d against elderly persons and dependent adults includes \u201c[sjexual penetration, as defined in Section 289 of the Penal Code\u201d].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It would be anomalous and confusing if all of these references to the words \u201csexual penetration\u201d in section 289 meant something other than \u201csexual penetration\u201d in section 263, where those words first appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Eighth, there is a very close relationship between the crimes of rape and object penetration. Section 289 was enacted to put object penetration on par with rape. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Harrison, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at pp. 327-328 [before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>\u00a7 289 there had been no crime comparable to rape and sodomy prohibiting penetration of the genitals or anus by an instrument or body part other than the mouth or penis].) The punishment for most forms of object penetration is the same as for rape. (Compare \u00a7 264 [three, six, eight years for rape] with \u00a7 289, subds. (a), (b); (d), (e), (f), (g), (j) [same]; see also \u00a7 264.1 [same punishment for rape and object penetration in concert].) Statutes have referred, and continue to refer, to section 289 object penetration as \u201crape.\u201d (See \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(K) [special circumstances include murder in connection with \u201c[r]ape by instrument in violation of Section 289\u201d]; see also, e.g., 47A West\u2019s Ann. Pen. Code, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 209, p. 68 [\u201csexual penetration in violation of section 289\u201d recently substituted for \u201crape by instrument in violation of section 289\u201d in \u00a7 209, subd. (b)(1)]; 49 West\u2019s Ann. Pen. Code, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 667.71, p. 67 [same change to \u00a7 667.71, subd. (c)(12)].) Cases have referred, and continue to refer, to Section 289 object penetration as \u201crape.\u201d (E.g., <em>People v. Anzalone </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1074, 1081 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 315, 969 P.2d 160]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 71, 74 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 830]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 693, 704 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 506]; <em>People v. Steele </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 788, 789 [286 Cal.Rptr. 887]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Meyer </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1307, 1309 [243 Cal.Rptr. 533]; <em>Planned Parenthood Affiliates v. Van de Kamp </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 245, 258 [226 Cal.Rptr. 361]; <em>People v. Tolbert </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 685, 688 [222 Cal.Rptr. 313].) Section 289 object penetration, in sum, <em>is </em>a form of rape, and there is no reason to distinguish the degrees of penetration required to commit different forms of this same crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Ninth, appellant\u2019s argument is inconsistent with the discussion in <em>People v. Harrison, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d 321. The defendant in <em>Harrison </em>inserted his finger into the vagina of the victim three times over the course of a single encounter, with each insertion preceded by separate acts of force. The court held that the defendant was properly convicted of three distinct crimes because \u201ca <em>new and separate </em>violation of section 289 is \u2018completed\u2019 each time a <em>new and separate </em>\u2018penetration, however slight,\u2019 occurs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 329.) Although the opinion did not need to address the precise degree of penetration involved, it otherwise equated the penetration required for a section 289 violation with that required for a violation of section 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\"><em>Harrison </em>noted that, like section 263, section 289 had always provided that penetration with a foreign object involved a \u201cpenetration, however slight.\u201d Unlike section 263, section 289 did not expressly state that the crime was \u201ccompleted\u201d upon each such penetration. However, the court concluded that the section 263 concept of \u201ccompletion]\u201d could be read into section 289. <em>(People v. Harrison, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 329.) It noted that the Legislature had used \u201cmaterially similar language\u201d in defining the penetrations required for rape and penetration with a foreign object. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 328.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>\u201cSince the origin of the rape and sodomy statutes, the courts ha[d] strictly adhered to the statutory principle that a \u2018penetration,\u2019 however slight, \u2018completes\u2019 the crime.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 329.) The Legislature was presumed to have been aware of that construction. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThus, in using identical words to define the analogous act in section 289, the Legislature undoubtedly intended to convey the same meaning.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>If, as <em>Harrison </em>indicates, \u201cpenetration, however slight,\u201d means the same thing for purposes of the \u201canalogous act[s]\u201d covered by sections 289 and 263, there is no basis for the distinction appellant seeks to draw.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Tenth, from a policy standpoint, section 289 should not be given the narrow construction appellant advocates. <em>Karsai </em>reasoned that a broad interpretation of the penetration element was consistent with the Legislature\u2019s \u201cclear intent\u201d in prohibiting \u201cpenetration <em>however slighf\u2019 </em>in section 263. <em>(People v. Karsai, supra, </em>131 Cal.App.3d at p. 233, italics added.) The same words in section 289 dictate the same interpretation. Our construction will best serve to deter and punish the kind of heinous conduct section 289 was enacted to prevent. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 764, 783 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 117, 919 P.2d 731] [Penal Code ambiguities are to be interpreted so as to implement apparent legislative intent].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Eleventh, our interpretation of section 289 is consistent with those given to similar statutes in other jurisdictions. (E.g., <em>People v. Bristol </em>(1981) 115 Mich.App. 236 [320 N.W.2d 229, 230] [contact with labia minora violated statute referring to \u201c \u2018intrusion, however slight, . . . into the genital . . . openings\u2019 vaginal entry not required]; <em>State v. Hirsch </em>(1994) 245 Neb. 31 [511 N.W.2d 69, 80] [entry of labia was intrusion into \u201cgenital . . . opening[]\u201d; vaginal entry not required]; <em>State v. Shamp </em>(Minn.Ct.App. 1988) 422 N.W.2d 520, 526 [contact \u201cbetween the folds of skin over [the] vagina\u201d was intrusion into \u201c \u2018genital . . . opening[]\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">The evidence here, which included injury to the hymen, established penetration of the labia majora under the <em>Karsai </em>standard. The external female genitalia are referred to as the \u201cvulva\u201d and \u201c \u2018include[e] the labia majora, labia minora, clitoris and vestibule of the vagina.\u2019 \u201d (Langston, <em>supra, </em>26 Pepperdine L.Rev. at p. 15, fn. 68; see also <em>Jett v. Com. </em>(1998) 27 Va.App. 759 [501 S.E.2d 457, 459].) The labia majora \u201c \u2018form the external lateral boundaries of the vulva.\u2019 \u201d (Langston, <em>supra, </em>at p. 15, fn. 68.) The hymen is \u201clocated directly at the front of the opening to the vagina\u201d <em>(State v. Shoop </em>(1993) 87 Ohio App.3d 462 [622 N.E.2d 665, 669]); the vagina is \u201c \u2018the passage leading from the external genital orifice to the uterus\u2019 \u201d <em>(Langston, supra, </em>at p. 15, fn. 68). Accordingly, contact with the hymen as well as the clitoris and the other genitalia inside the exterior of the labia majora constitutes \u201csexual penetration\u201d within the meaning of section 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>(2) <em>Vaginal Penetration</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">B. <em>Coerced Jury Trial Waiver*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">III.

(See Langston, <em>No Penetration\u2014and It\u2019s Still Rape </em>(1998) 26 Pepperdine L.Rev. 1 [hereafter Langston; characterizing the vaginal penetration requirement as an archaic male construct that does not fully address the ways in which women may be violated].)

Some continue to cite the \u201cgenital. . . openings,\u201d rather than the \u201csexual penetration,\u201d language of section 289. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1036.2, subd. (h) [defining \u201csexual assault\u201d for purposes of sexual assault victim-counselor privilege]; \u00a7 666.7, subd. (d) [referring to the \u00a7 667.10 sentence enhancement for multiple \u00a7 289 violations].) Another statute simply refers to \u201cpenetration by foreign object, as described in subdivision (a) of Section 289.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 602, subd. (b)(2)(E) [criteria for trying minors as adults].) A reporting statute takes a belt and suspenders approach, defining \u201csexual assault\u201d to include: conduct in violation of section \u201c289 (sexual penetration)\u201d; \u201c[a]ny penetration, however slight, of the vagina or anal opening of one person by the penis of another person\u201d; and \u201c[a]ny intrusion by one person into the genitals or anal opening of another person, including the use of any object for this purpose.\u201d (\u00a7 11165.1, subds. (a), (b)(1), (b)(3).) Section 667.7, subdivision (a), listing prior offenses that trigger a sentence enhancement for felonies involving great bodily injury, refers to \u201cpenetration of a <em>vaginal </em>or anal opening in violation of Section 289.\u201d (Italics added.) Among the many statutes that cross-reference section 289, section 667.7 is the only one we have found which suggests that section 289 requires vaginal penetration. For the reasons set forth herein, we find this suggestion untenable and regard section 667.7\u2019s reference to vaginal penetration as loose, aberrant language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1362.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">Judge of the San Francisco Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
