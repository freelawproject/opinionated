J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHt\">Plaintiff and appellant National Technical Systems (plaintiff or the subcontractor) appeals a postjudgment order denying its motion to summarily enforce a judgment against United Pacific Insurance Company (the surety), the surety on a stop notice release bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">The essential question presented is whether plaintiff is entitled to enforce a money judgment against the surety pursuant to the summary proceedings provided by the Bond and Undertaking Law (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 995.010 et seq., 996.440)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for recovery on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">Summary enforcement may be had only if a bond is \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding.\u201d (\u00a7 996.440, subd. (a).) Here, the stop notice release bond was <em>not </em>given in an action or proceeding because the bond was issued prior to the filing of the lawsuit. Because the issuance of the bond preceded the filing of the lawsuit, the surety should have been joined as a party to the action. (\u00a7 996.430, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">Because the instant bond was not \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding\u201d in that it preceded the filing of the action, the trial court properly rejected plaintiff\u2019s attempt to enforce the bond against the surety pursuant to the summary remedy under section 996.440. Therefore, the order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">On April 9, 1996, Commercial Contractors, Inc. (the general contractor) entered into a written prime contract with the City of Long Beach (the city), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>a public entity, to perform remediation and excavation work in the Port of Long Beach.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 16, 1996, the general contractor hired plaintiff as a subcontractor on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The subcontractor claimed it was only partially paid for services rendered to the general contractor, and on March 21, 1997, the subcontractor filed a stop notice with the city in the amount of $343,905.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">On April 8, 1997, the general contractor obtained a bond from the surety in the sum of $429,881 to release money withheld on the stop notice. On April 30, 1997, the surety notified the subcontractor by certified mail that the general contractor had filed a bond to release money withheld on the stop notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Although the subcontractor was aware of the surety\u2019s issuance of the bond, on May 17, 1997, the subcontractor filed the instant action against the general contractor (the <em>NTS v. CCI </em>action) (Super. Ct. L.A.' County, 1997, No. NC021319), without naming the surety, seeking damages on the contract, enforcement of the stop notice, and recovery on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">On or about January 31, 1999, on the eve of trial, the subcontractor moved for leave to file a second amended complaint to add the surety as a party and to add a new cause of action for recovery on the bond \u201cso that it may avail itself of the summary proceeding provided by . . . section 996.440 .... HQ Otherwise, [plaintiff] will be required to file a separate civil action against [the general contractor] and the Surety to recover on the Bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The general contractor opposed the motion to amend, arguing the surety had not participated in any manner during the course of the litigation, and that it would be unduly prejudicial to the surety to force it to defend itself on the eve of trial.  The trial court denied leave to amend because trial was imminent and the surety had not been involved in any of the discovery or other trial preparation in the action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The matter came on for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>jury trial, the amount due and owing from the general contractor to the subcontractor was litigated, and the trial court entered judgment in favor of the subcontractor. Neither party appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On October 11, 1999, the subcontractor made demand upon the surety in a letter for payment of $466,552, representing the judgment, attorney fees, penalties and accrued interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The surety refused to pay. It advised the subcontractor by letter that it \u201cwas never served with the lawsuit or made a party to the lawsuit. The first notice of claim was [the subcontractor\u2019s] letter of October 11, 1999. The verdict does not mention either the stop notice, the [city] or [the surety]. [The subcontractor\u2019s] judgment is only against [the general contractor]. ft[] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [H] While we do not require that you file an action to enforce your rights, [the surety] is not bound by the judgment.... There is no basis at this time to make payment to your client. If your client seeks to enforce its rights on the stop notice release bond, [the surety] will have the opportunity to assert all the relevant defenses on the claim. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">On March 1, 2000, due to the surety\u2019s refusal, the subcontractor filed a separate action against the surety <em>(National Technical Systems </em>v. <em>United Pacific Insurance Co. </em>(Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2000, No. NC027374) (the <em>NTS v. UPIC </em>action) to recover on the stop notice release bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">On March 14, 2000, notwithstanding the pendency of the second action, the subcontractor attempted to invoke the summary proceeding of section 996.440 by filing a motion in the instant action, the <em>NTS </em>v. <em>CCI </em>action, for summary enforcement of the judgment against the surety. The subcontractor asserted that having obtained a judgment against the general contractor, and the judgment having become final, the subcontractor was now entitled to enforce the judgment against the surety. The subcontractor further contended that a surety which fails to make payment after a claim is made for payment on a bond incurs its own liability for attorney fees and costs and postjudgment interest from the date of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">On April 18, 2000, the trial court heard and denied the subcontractor\u2019s motion for summary enforcement of the judgment against the surety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>\u201cwithout prejudice, and it\u2019s based on the fact that the court feels that [the surety] has not been made a party to the action. Further, . . . there is another action pending where [the surety] is named as a party with the same recovery being requested.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The subcontractor filed a timely notice of appeal from the order denying its motion for summary enforcement of the judgment against the surety.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The subcontractor contends: the Bond and Undertaking Law (\u00a7 995.010 et seq.) allows for summary enforcement of the judgment against the surety; and because the surety has an absolute right to recover from the general contractor, the bond includes the award of attorney fees and penalties against the general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">1. <em>Overview of statutory scheme.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">A \u201cstop notice\u201d is a remedy to reach unexpended construction funds in the hands of the owner or lender, is available on both public and private works, and may be served by a claimant other than an original contractor. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3181; <em>Department of Industrial Relations v. Fidelity Roof Co. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 411, 419 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 465].)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">If the general contractor disputes a stop notice claim, the public entity may permit the general contractor to post a stop notice release bond. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3196.) After the bond is posted, the remedies of the claimant rest solely on the bond and the public entity may not withhold money due the general contractor on account of the stop notice. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3196; <em>Winick Corp. </em>v. <em>County Sanitation Dist. No. 2 </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1170, 1178 [230 Cal.Rptr. 289].)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">The Bond and Undertaking Law (\u00a7 995.010 et seq.) applies to stop notice release bonds. <em>(Grade-Way Construction Co. v. Golden Eagle Ins. Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 826, 831 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 649].) Liability on a bond may be enforced in a single civil action by the subcontractor in which both the principal and sureties are joined as parties to the action. (\u00a7 996.430, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In the alternative, if a stop notice release bond <em>\u201cis given in an action or proceeding, </em>the liability on the bond may be enforced on motion made in the court without the necessity of an independent action.\u201d (\u00a7 996.440, subd. (a), italics added.) Such motion shall not be made until after the finality of the judgment in the action or proceeding in which the bond is given. (\u00a7 996.440, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">2. <em>The subcontractor cannot pursue summary enforcement under section 996.440 because the instant bond, which was given before the filing of the NTS </em>v. <em>CCI action, was not \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">The procedure for summary enforcement by way of a postjudgment motion is available only \u201c[i]f a bond is given in an action or proceeding.\u201d (\u00a7 996.440, subd. (a).) Therefore, the pivotal issue is whether the subject bond was given in an action or proceeding. Here, the bond was given on April 8, 1997, 39 days <em>before </em>the subcontractor filed its action against the general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">Although the Bond and Undertaking Law repeatedly uses the phrase \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding\u201d (see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 995.050, 995.140, 995.230, 995.330, 995.340, 995.360, 995.840, 995.910, 996.010, 996.110, 996.420, 996.430, 996.440), the statutory scheme fails to define that term, either in article 1 thereof (\u00a7 995.010 et seq.), which sets forth various definitions, or elsewhere. <em>(Grade-Way Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Golden Eagle Ins. Co., supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 832; <em>Walt Rankin &amp; Associates, Inc. v. City of Murrieta </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 605, 618 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 48].) Therefore, we look to the customary rules of statutory interpretation, as well as case law, for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">a. <em>Principles of statutory construction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">\u201cThe touchstone of statutory interpretation is the probable intent of the Legislature. When interpreting a statute, we must ascertain legislative intent so as to effectuate the purpose of a particular law. Of course our first step in determining that intent is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute, giving them a plain and commonsense meaning. <em>(California Teachers Assn. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>v. <em>Governing Bd. of Rialto Unified School Dist. </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 627, 632-633 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 671, 927 P.2d 1175].) When the words are clear and unambiguous, there is no need for statutory construction or resort to other indicia of legislative intent, such as legislative history. <em>(California Fed. Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 342, 349 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 279, 902 P.2d 297].) But language that appears unambiguous on its face may be shown to have a latent ambiguity; if so, a court may turn to customary rules of statutory construction or legislative history for guidance. <em>(Stanton </em>v. <em>Panish </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 107, 115 [167 Cal.Rptr. 584, 615 P.2d 1372].) [H] . . . Statutory language which seems clear when considered in isolation may in fact be ambiguous or uncertain when considered in context. (See <em>Stockton Sav. &amp; Loan Bank </em>v. <em>Massanet </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 200, 207 [114 P.2d 592].)\u201d <em>(Quarterman v. Kefauver </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1371 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 741].)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">b. <em>Bond given after judgment but before ruling on motion to vacate default is \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In <em>Mark Briggs &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kinestar, Inc. </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 483, 486 [192 Cal.Rptr. 21], it was claimed \u201cthe bond was not given \u2018in any action or proceeding\u2019 \u201d as required by former section 1058a (the predecessor to \u00a7 996.440) because at the time the bond was filed, the plaintiff had already obtained a judgment and the court had not yet ruled on the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the default, so that there was no action pending on the date the bond was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">In defining the phrase \u201cgiven \u2018in any action or proceeding,\u2019 \u201d <em>Briggs </em>resorted to the basic statutory definition of an \u201caction,\u201d observing: \u201cCode of Civil Procedure section 22 defines an \u2018action\u2019 as \u2018an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the declaration, enforcement, or protection of a right, . . .\u2019 . . .It has similarly been called \u2018the judicial means or procedure of enforcing a right.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Mark Briggs &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Kinestar, Inc., supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d at p. 486, italics omitted.) <em>Briggs </em>concluded the bond \u201cwas given in an \u2018action or proceeding\u2019 to enforce plaintiff\u2019s right.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It reasoned the bond \u201cwas recorded for the purpose of preventing enforcement of plaintiff\u2019s judgment against the property defendants had conveyed. ... As the purpose of the bond was to postpone enforcement of plaintiff\u2019s judicially declared right, <em>the action or proceeding to enforce that right was still pending. </em>That the bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>was filed in the county recorder\u2019s office and not the superior court is neither controlling nor relevant.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">c. <em>Stop notice release bond given after commencement of action is \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\"><em>Grade-Way </em>dealt with whether a stop notice release bond issued <em>after </em>the filing of an action to enforce a stop notice was \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding\u201d for purposes of section 996.440. <em>(Grade-Way Construction Co. v. Golden Eagle Ins. Co., supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at pp. 836-837.) <em>Grade-Way </em>observed, \u201ca stop notice \u2018cease[s] to be effective\u2019 if the claimant fails to bring an action against the owner or construction lender within 90 days \u2018following the expiration of the period within which claims of lien must be recorded . . . .\u2019 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3172.) By virtue of these statutory provisions and the broad definitions of \u2018action\u2019 and \u2018proceeding,\u2019 <em>any . . . stop notice release bond necessarily is \u2018given in an action or proceeding.\u2019 \u201d (Grade-Way Construction Co., supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 833, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Despite that broad language, <em>Grade-Way </em>narrowly held that stop notice release bonds issued <em>after </em>the filing of an action to enforce a stop notice are \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding\u201d for purposes of section 996.440. <em>(Grade-Way Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Golden Eagle Ins. Co., supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at pp. 836-837.) <em>Grade-Way </em>emphasized \u201c[u]nder the facts presented, we need not decide if release bonds given <em>prior </em>to the filing of an enforcement action are \u2018given in an action or proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 837, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">d. <em>Stop notice release bond given before action is commenced is not \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Here, because the issuance of the stop notice release bond preceded the filing of the action, we have before us the fact situation not present in <em>Grade-Way. </em>We conclude a stop notice release bond which is given prior to the commencement of litigation is <em>not </em>\u201cgiven in an action or proceeding.\u201d This interpretation is guided, in part, by the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding.\u201d (\u00a7 996.440, subd. (a).) It logically follows that if no action has been commenced at the time the bond is given, the bond is not \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding\u201d and therefore the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>summary enforcement procedure of section 996.440 would be inapplicable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">This conclusion is also informed by the language of section 996.430, subdivision (a), which states: \u201cThe liability on a bond may be enforced by civil action. <em>Both the principal and the sureties shall be joined as parties to the action.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Thus, where the issuance of the bond precedes the filing of the lawsuit so that the bond was not \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding,\u201d the surety has an absolute statutory right to be joined as a party to the action pursuant to section 996.430.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In contrast, where the bond is issued after the lawsuit is filed, the surety is on notice of the pendency of the action so that the plaintiff may enforce the liability on the bond by way of a postjudgment motion under section 996.440, without first having joined the surety as a party to the action. The rationale for this distinction is that a surety on a bond \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding submits itself to the jurisdiction of the court\u201d in all matters affecting its liability on the bond. (\u00a7 996.420, subd. (a); <em>Grade-Way Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Golden Eagle Ins. Co., supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 835.) As stated in <em>Grade-Way, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at page 835, \u201c[wjhere ... the surety issues rel\u00e9ase bonds <em>after </em>the filing of suit on the . . . stop notices, all parties know where, when, and in what context and forum the surety must honor the terms of its bonds. [The surety] was clearly on notice of [the claimant\u2019s] actions. Under the circumstances, to construe [the surety\u2019s] issuance of the Release Bonds as a waiver of service of process does not deny it due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The reason for distinguishing between a bond given <em>before </em>an action is commenced and a bond given <em>afterwards </em>pertains to the surety\u2019s right to notice. Where the stop notice release bond is issued <em>after </em>the filing of the lawsuit, i.e., is \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding,\u201d the surety is deemed to have notice of the action. At that juncture, the surety may move to intervene in the action (\u00a7 387), or it may simply elect to await the final judgment in the action and the plaintiff\u2019s enforcement of the liability on the bond through the summary procedure of section 996.440. That decision is left to the surety. However, where the stop notice release bond is issued <em>before </em>the lawsuit is filed, the bond is <em>not </em>\u201cgiven in an action or proceeding,\u201d and consequently the plaintiff is required to join both the principal and surety pursuant to section 996.430, thereby giving the surety notice of the action so as to enable the surety to protect its rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>Here, the subcontractor filed its stop notice with the city on March 21, 1997, the stop notice release bond was given on April 8, 1997, and the action was filed on May 17, 1997. Accordingly, the bond was not \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding.\u201d Therefore, the subcontractor cannot summarily enforce the liability on the bond pursuant to section 996.440.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">3. <em>Remaining issues not reached.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Because the subcontractor has yet to establish the surety\u2019s liability on the bond, it is unnecessary to address the subcontractor\u2019s contention concerning the amount it is entitled to recover from the surety, or any other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Because the issuance of the bond preceded the filing of the lawsuit, the bond was not \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding,\u201d and hence, the summary enforcement procedure of section 996.440 is inapplicable. Instead, because the bond preceded the lawsuit, the surety had a right to be joined as a party and to defend the action. (\u00a7 996.430.) Because the surety was not a party to the action, the subcontractor cannot summarily enforce the judgment against the surety. The subcontractor, if it chooses, will have to litigate the liability on the bond as against the surety.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>. <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The order denying the subcontractor\u2019s motion for summary enforcement of the judgment is affirmed. The surety is to recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Croskey, J., and Aldrich, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 27, 2001, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-14\">All further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure, unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Neither the general contractor nor the city is a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b702-10\">We observe that had the trial court granted the subcontractor\u2019s motion for leave to amend and then granted a reasonable continuance to enable the surety to prepare for trial, this controversy and multiplicity of litigation could have been avoided. Moreover, section 389 \u201crequires joinder of persons materially interested in an action whenever feasible.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 1971 Amend., 14 West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (1973 ed.) foil. \u00a7 389, p. 222.) In view of section 996.430\u2019s requirement that both the principal and surety be joined as parties to the action, as discussed <em>infra, </em>the surety herein should have been joined as a party. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>However, \u201c[e]ven if the court is mistaken in its decision to proceed in the absence of an interested person, it does not by that token deprive itself of the power to adjudicate as between the parties already before it through proper service of process.

However, the issue presented in <em>Acoustics </em>was whether the bond was \u201cobtained <em>\u2018in connection with </em>the action\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 916, italics added), which language is much broader than the phrase \u201cgiven in an action or proceeding.\u201d (\u00a7 996.440, subd. (a).) The court concluded \u201cthe filing of the stop notice, and the filing of the release bond followed by the filing of the action <em>are so related that it can be said that the release bond was obtained in connection with the action </em>within the meaning of [former] section 1035, Code of Civil Procedure, and, therefore, the premiums paid on such bond . . . may be allowed as costs . . . .\u201d <em>(Acoustics, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 916, italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b709-10\">The subcontractor has acknowledged the weakness of its position in attempting to enforce the judgment against the surety, a nonparty, by means of section 996.440. In belatedly seeking leave to amend to add the surety as a party, the subcontractor argued that if leave to amend were denied, \u201c[plaintiff] will be required to file a separate civil action against [the general contractor] and the Surety to recover on the Bond.\u201d Also, the subcontractor\u2019s initiation of the <em>NTS v. UPIC </em>action is a tacit admission that section 996.440 is not a proper vehicle for obtaining a judgment against the surety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b709-11\">If our interpretation of the statutory scheme is not what the Legislature intended, the enactment could use clarification.
