Plaintiff Ronald Craddock, Rebecca\u2019s husband, alleged loss of consortium. (We sometimes refer to the plaintiffs by their first names for clarity.)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">After jury trial, plaintiffs won a special verdict. The jury found that Kmart\u2019s negligence was 90 percent responsible for Rebecca\u2019s injuries and that her negligence was 10 percent responsible. The jury awarded Rebecca total damages (without reducing the award for comparative fault) of $1,158,000 ($728,000 in economic damages and $430,000 in noneconomic damages); it also awarded Ronald $25,000 for loss of consortium. Reducing Rebecca\u2019s award by the percentage of Rebecca\u2019s comparative fault, the trial court entered judgment for Rebecca for $1,042,200 and for Ronald for $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Kmart moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and for new trial, partly based on the claim that a special instruction was erroneous. The trial court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">Kmart also moved to set aside and vacate the judgment and to enter a new and different judgment as to Ronald, alleging that his award of loss of consortium must be reduced by the percentage of Rebecca\u2019s comparative fault. The trial court granted this motion and entered an amended judgment reducing Ronald\u2019s award to $22,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">Kmart appeals from the judgment; plaintiffs cross-appeal from the reduction of Ronald\u2019s award. Finding both the appeal and the cross-appeal without merit, we shall affirm the (amended) judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Viewed most favorably to the verdict, the evidence showed the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">While shopping at a Kmart store with her mother-in-law in Redding, California, on June 23, 1996, Rebecca was looting for towels. Rebecca walked down an aisle where it formed a T-intersection with another, started to turn, and looked up at an overhead directory sign to locate the linen department.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Store employees were constructing a display bin in the middle of the aisle and metal brackets were lying on the floor. Kmart\u2019s store manager conceded that objects lying on aisle floors create a hazard and that the brackets should not have been left on the floor. He also acknowledged that shoppers do not always watch their feet as they walk down the aisles. Other Kmart employees testified that the display bin could have been assembled after hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">Employee Michelle Sisk was positioned in the aisle to warn shoppers of the hazard, but she was facing the wrong way to see Rebecca approaching. The store had done nothing else to secure the area or signal the hazard to shoppers.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">While looking up at the directory sign, Rebecca stepped on a bracket and started to slip. Trying to right herself, she twisted violently. Michelle Sisk said \u201cbe careful,\u201d then pushed Rebecca upright to steady her.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">A few days later, Rebecca noticed low back pain, which was diagnosed as a herniated disk requiring surgery. Following surgery, the disk rehemiated (a known risk), and a second surgery was performed. In consequence, Rebecca suffered permanent disabling nerve damage (also a known risk of the procedure she underwent), causing severe chronic pain and preventing her from ever returning to her occupation as a registered nurse or from performing any other gainful employment.. Rebecca was 46 years old at the time of her accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Abn\">\n<em>The Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">The jury received the standard BAJI instructions defining negligence, the duty of a premises owner as to the maintenance and management <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>of the premises, and the duty of a plaintiff to use due care for her own safety. (BAJI Nos. 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.50, 8.00, 8.01, 8.02.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Over defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>objection, the trial court also gave the following special instruction requested by plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-4\">\u201cWhen a store is open for business, one who enters it to purchase some commodity or service does so at the implied, if not the express, invitation of the owner of the store. Upon that owner the law places the duty of exercising ordinary care so as not unnecessarily to expose the patron to danger or accident and, to that end, to keep in a reasonably safe condition the aisles, passage ways and general store premises made available for the patron\u2019s use in [and] which the latter is expressly or impliedly invited to use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-5\">\u201cIn judging the conduct of the parties, you may consider the fact that the attention of persons who visit public stores ordinarily is attracted by the display of wares offered for sale and may be more or less absorbed by the transactions which they have in mind. You may consider whether the defendant anticipated that fact with ordinary care in the exercise of the duty herein mentioned. You may also consider whether the plaintiff did or did not share that ordinary experience of store visitors, and if so, what effect that fact had on her conduct in relation to the cause of the accident, if any.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">On appeal, as it did on its motion for JNOV or new trial, defendant contends that this instruction was legally erroneous and unsupported by the evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">The language of the instruction derives almost word for word from an instruction approved in <em>McKenney </em>v. <em>Quality Foods, Inc. </em>(1957) 156 Cal.App.2d 349, 358-360 [319 P.2d 448]. As the comt there noted, the legal principles underlying the instruction derive mainly from <em>Tuttle v. Crawford </em>(1936) 8 Cal.2d 126 [63 P.2d 1128]. In <em>Tuttle v. Crawford, </em>our Supreme Court stated: \u201cThat it is the duty of storekeepers to keep the floors of their premises safe for those who must pass over them in the transaction of their business must be conceded. <em>The fact that the attention of persons who visit public markets is attracted by the display of the wares offered for sale and more or less absorbed by the transactions which they have in mind would seem to increase the necessity of exercising care to the end that the floor spaces and aisles allotted to the use of customers should be made safe and kept fit for such purpose. </em>[1Q \u2018It is the rule in California that the keeper of a public place of business is bound to keep his premises and the passageways to and from it in a safe condition, and must use ordinary care to avoid accidents or injury to those properly entering upon his premises on business.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Tuttle </em>v. <em>Crawford, supra, </em>8 Cal.2d at p. 130, italics added; see also <em>Neel v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number><em>Mannings, Inc. </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 647, 652 [122 P.2d 576] [\u201c \u2018One who, during business hours, lawfully enters a store to purchase goods does so at the implied invitation of the owner [citation], upon whom the law imposes the duty of exercising ordinary care and prudence to keep the aisles and passageways of the premises, in and through which by their location and arrangement a customer in making purchases is induced to go, in a reasonably safe condition so as to not unnecessarily expose him to danger or accident. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Wills </em>v. <em>J. J. Newberry Co. </em>(1941) 43 Cal.App.2d 595, 602-603 [111 P.2d 346].)</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Defendant cites no authority holding that these decisions no longer state the law and we have found none. Instead, defendant asserts that the principles underlying the special instruction have been superseded by <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108 [70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561, 32 A.L.R.3d 496] and <em>Li v. Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 804 [119 Cal.Rptr. 858, 532 P.2d 1226, 78 A.L.R.3d 393]. Defendant also asserts that the instruction\u2019s expression \u201cnot <em>unnecessarily </em>to expose the patron to danger or accident\u201d (italics added) imposes a higher duty than reasonable care on the store owner and invites a finding of liability for anything it did without necessity that led to the customer\u2019s injury, regardless of whether the customer exercised reasonable care to avoid injury. We do not agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Defendant barely makes an argument as to <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian. </em>Defendant says that the instruction approved in <em>McKenney v. Quality Foods, Inc., </em>and given in this case \u201cwas last discussed by an appellate court ... in the context of care owed to an \u2018invitee\u2019\u2014before the general language of negligence with respect to premises liability was embraced by the California Supreme Court in <em>Rowland v. Christian </em>. . . .\u201d However, defendant does not develop this proposition. Nor does defendant cite authority\u2014not even <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian </em>itself\u2014holding that <em>Rowland v. Christian </em>supersedes all case law which speaks of invitees. We need not consider an argument so poorly articulated. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 137, 214, fn. 19 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 762, 878 P.2d 521].) In any event, the argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">As our Supreme Court said recently, \u201c \u2018[t]he proper test to be applied to the liability of the possessor of land ... is whether in the management of his property he has acted as a reasonable man in view of the probability of injury to others . . . .\u2019 <em>(Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian[, supra,] </em>69 Cal.2d 108, 119. . . .) This requires persons \u2018to maintain land in their possession and control in a reasonably safe condition. [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(Ann M. </em>v. <em>Pacific Plaza Shopping Center </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 666, 674 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 137, 863 P.2d 207].)\u201d <em>(Alcaraz </em>v. <em>Vece </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1149, 1156 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 448, 929 P.2d 1239].)</p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>Nothing in the special instruction placed upon defendant any duty other than reasonable care. The instruction is not at odds with <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Defendant appears to argue that <em>Li v. Yellow Cab Co., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 804, invalidates the special instruction because that instruction \u201cwas given [in <em>McKenney v. Quality Foods, Inc., supra, </em>156 Cal.App.2d 349] in the context of an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 verdict for plaintiff[,]\u201d i.e., at a time when contributory negligence was a complete defense. However, defendant does not explain how <em>Li\u2019s </em>institution of comparative fault in California negligence law invalidates this instruction. Nothing in its language is aimed at negating the plaintiff\u2019s comparative fault or could reasonably be so construed. In any event, the trial court instructed the jury on comparative fault<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we presume the jury followed that instruction, as well as the instruction it was given to consider all the instructions as a whole. (See <em>People v. Adcox </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 207, 253 [253 Cal.Rptr. 55, 763 P.2d 906].) In fact, the jury found that plaintiff Rebecca was 10 percent at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Finally, defendant objects to the instruction\u2019s language \u201cunnecessarily .. . expose the patron to danger or accident\u201d because \u201cit may be inferred from this that an occupant of premises may only avoid liability when exercising ordinary care to do what is <em>necessary.\u201d </em>We think not. The instruction plainly tells the jury in the same sentence that an occupant of premises need exercise only \u201cordinary care\u201d to \u201ckeep [the premises] in a reasonably safe condition\u201d for patrons. A reasonable jury would not understand from this language that the defendant had a duty to do only what was necessary because such a duty would far exceed <em>\u201cordinary </em>care\u201d and maintenance of \u201ca <em>reasonably </em>safe condition.\u201d Nor would the jury understand from this instruction that the plaintiff had no duty to use due care for her own safety, because: (1) The instruction does not say so; and (2) The jury was expressly instructed elsewhere that she had that duty. (See fn. 1, <em>ante.) </em>But so far as defendant acted negligently by constructing a display bin in a busy aisle during shopping hours rather than after hours without customers present, and by leaving metal brackets on the floor rather than picking them up immediately, the instruction properly invited the jury to consider whether that unnecessary exposure of customers to danger violated the standard of ordinary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">Defendant separately contends that there was no evidentiary basis for the special instruction. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">Defendant asserts: (1) plaintiff offered no testimony that she was \u201cdistracted\u201d by a display of merchandise; (2) there was no evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>directory signs were deficient in any manner; and (3) there was no legal basis for excusing plaintiffs conduct because she was availing herself of appropriate signage. These points are immaterial because they have nothing to do with the special instruction. It does not use the word \u201cdistracted.\u201d Nor does it impose liability for \u201cdeficient\u201d directory signs. Nor does it concern itself with whether the signage was \u201cappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">All the evidentiary basis needed for the instruction is that plaintiff was a customer in defendant\u2019s store, that the store had wares on display, and that the store had aisles, passageways, and general premises which customers traversed in order to inspect those wares. These facts were undisputed here. Everything else in the instruction is couched only in terms of possibilities. Nothing in the instruction directs the jury it must find any of those possibilities true or supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The trial court did not err in giving the special instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">\n<em>The Cross-appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">On defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court reduced Ronald\u2019s damages for loss of consortium by 10 percent, the percentage which the jury found Rebecca\u2019s negligence contributed to her accident. Plaintiff contends the trial court erred by doing so. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">The trial court acted under Civil Code section 1431.2 (hereafter section 1431.2), which codifies Proposition 51\u2019s change in the law on joint and several liability for noneconomic damages. That statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-10\">\u201c(a) In any action for personal injury, property damage, or wrongful death, based upon principles of comparative fault, the liability of each defendant for non-economic damages shall be several only and shall not be joint. Each defendant shall be liable only for the amount of non-economic damages allocated to that defendant in direct proportion to that defendant\u2019s percentage of fault, and a separate judgment shall be rendered against that defendant for that amount. HO ... HD</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-11\">\u201c[(b)](2) For purposes of this section, the term \u2018non-economic damages\u2019 means subjective, non-monetary losses including . . . loss of consortium</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">As the parties agree, case law before the enactment of Proposition 51 held that a spouse\u2019s recovery for loss of consortium could not be reduced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>proportion of negligence attributable to the injured spouse. <em>(Lantis </em>v. <em>Condon </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 152, 155-156 [157 Cal.Rptr. 22].) However, contrary to the parties\u2019 representations, the effect of Proposition 51 on this area of law is not a question of first impression. In <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Badger Construction Equipment Co. </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1791, 1810-1811 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 732], Division One of the Fourth District held a wife\u2019s claim for lack of consortium was subject to reduction for her husband\u2019s comparative fault under section 1431.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Plaintiff acknowledges section 1431.2 (but not Hernandez), but contends that Family Code section 783 (formerly Civ. Code \u00a7 5112), which deals with injury to a spouse by a third party tortfeasor, is more specific and therefore controlling. <em>Hernandez </em>does not discuss the possible effect of Family Code section 783. We shall do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Where a general statute conflicts with a specific statute, the specific statute controls the general one. <em>(Tapia v. Pohlmann </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1126, 1133 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 1].) \u2018\u201cIt is well settled . . . that a general provision is controlled by one that is special, the latter being treated as an exception to the former. A specific provision relating to a particular subject will govern in respect to that subject, as against a general provision, although the latter, standing alone, would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more particular provision relates.\u2019 <em>(Rose </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 713, 723-724 [123 P.2d 505].)\u201d <em>(San Francisco Taxpayers Assn. v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 571, 577 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 245, 828 P.2d 147].)</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Family Code section 783 provides: \u201cIf a married person is injured by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of a person other than the married person\u2019s spouse, the fact that the negligent or wrongful act or omission of the spouse of the injured person was a concurring cause of the injury is not a defense in an action brought by the injured person to recover damages for the injury except in cases where the concurring negligent or wrongful act or omission would be a defense if the marriage did not exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">In the present context, we think that section 1431.2, not Family Code section 783, is the more specific statute. Damages for loss of consortium are available only to married persons. <em>(Elden v. Sheldon </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 267, 277-279 [250 Cal.Rptr. 254, 758 P.2d 582].) Section 1431.2 expressly mentions damages for loss of consortium, whereas Family Code section 783 does not. Because section 1431.2 expressly provides for the calculation of damages for loss of consortium, a specific kind of damage suffered by married persons, section 1431.2 is the more specific statute and controls here.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>The trial court correctly reduced Ronald\u2019s award for loss of consortium under the compulsion of section 1431.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">The (amended) judgment is affirmed.
