The police department contends the court should have required the defendant to comply with the <em>Pitchess </em>process <em>(Pitchess v. Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 531 [113 Cal.Rptr. 897, 522 P.2d 305]). We agree and order a writ of mandate to issue commanding the trial court to vacate its order releasing the officers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>birth dates and to allow defendant to file a discovery motion in accordance with Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">James Carl Reimann was arrested and charged with causing bodily injury to another person while driving under the influence of alcohol (Veh. Code, \u00a723153, subds. (a) &amp; (b)), with an enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury on another (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7). During the course of discovery, Reimann asked the district attorney to run criminal records checks on the officers involved in Reimann\u2019s arrest. When the district attorney declined, Reimann filed a motion requesting the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The police department asked the court for the opportunity to appear and to brief the issue. The police department and the district attorney filed oppositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The court ordered the district attorney to run criminal records checks on the officers. Because the district attorney needed the officers\u2019 birth dates to run the criminal records checks, the court ordered the police department to disclose the birth dates to the district attorney. The court left the determination whether the evidence was material or favorable to the district attorney for later. It refused to hold an in camera hearing or allow the disclosure of the records checks to Reimann.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">The court based its order on Penal Code section 1054.1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the federal due process clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It stated, \u201cThis is not a <em>Pitchess </em>sort of order, obviously. There\u2019s been no allegation that the police officers did anything wrong in executing their duties in this case. So I don\u2019t view this as a <em>Pitchess </em>issue.\u201d The police department seeks a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the trial court to vacate its order requiring it to disclose the officers\u2019 birth dates to the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The police department argues the trial court should have required Reimann to comply with the <em>Pitchess </em>process because he sought confidential information from the officers\u2019 personnel files. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u201cIn 1978, the California Legislature codified the privileges and procedures surrounding what had come to be known as <em>\u2018Pitchess </em>motions\u2019 [citation] through the enactment of Penal Code sections 832.7 and 832.8 and Evidence Code sections 1043 [and] 1045.\u201d <em>(City of Santa Cruz v. Municipal Court </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 74, 81 [260 Cal.Rptr. 520, 776 P.2d 222], fns. omitted.) Penal Code section 832.7, subdivision (a) provides, \u201cPeace officer personnel records ... or information obtained from these records, are confidential and shall not be disclosed by the department or agency that employs the peace officer in any criminal or civil proceeding except by discovery pursuant to Section[] 1043 ... of the Evidence Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045 do not limit discovery of confidential information from police officer personnel files to altercations between police officers and arrestees. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Memro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 658, 679 [214 Cal.Rptr. 832, 700 P.2d 446].) Motions made pursuant to Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045 may also be used to discover information to impeach an officer\u2019s credibility. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hustead </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 410, 417 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 875].) Such was the case here: Reimann asked the district attorney to run criminal records checks on the officers and \u201cprovide information of crimes or acts of moral turpitude or misdemeanor or felonious behavior or convictions.\u201d Reimann sought \u201cspecific acts of misconduct\u201d and \u201cother acts done under \u2018color of authority\u2019 \u201d to \u201cimpeach the credibility\u201d of the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Reimann argues the information he requested is not covered by <em>Pitchess </em>and Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045 because he is not seeking confidential information but only the officers\u2019 birth dates from their files.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Evidence Code section 1043, subdivision (a) provides, \u201cIn any case in which discovery or disclosure is sought of peace officer personnel records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>... or information from those records, the party seeking the discovery or disclosure shall file a written motion with the appropriate court or administrative body upon written notice to the governmental agency which has custody and control of the records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Penal Code section 832.8 defines \u201c \u2018personnel records\u2019 \u201d as \u201cany file . . . containing records relating to any of the following: HQ (a) personal data, including marital status, family members, educational and employment history, home addresses, <em>or similar information, </em>[f] . . . [^] (f) Any other information the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">A birth date is personal data. The Legislature\u2019s inclusion of the term \u201csimilar information\u201d signifies its intent to include other things relating to the listed items, such as birth dates and Social Security numbers, which are not expressly listed. \u201c \u2018[Personnel records\u2019 \u201d include information \u201cthe disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d The disclosure of birth dates and Social Security numbers could lead to an invasion of personal privacy because they could lead to other sensitive information.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In his motion, Reimann also sought other confidential information that would be found in an officer\u2019s personnel file. He requested information regarding \u201cspecific acts of misconduct\u201d including \u201cexcessive force, false reports, dishonesty, or other bad acts.\u201d This information, as dictated by Evidence Code section 1045,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> should be evaluated by the court, in camera, to determine its relevance. To hold otherwise would allow Reimann to discover information the Legislature clearly thought should be kept confidential without a showing of relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Reimann\u2019s motion circumvented the <em>Pitchess </em>process by requesting the officers\u2019 criminal records from the district attorney and not from the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>department.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We cannot allow Reimann to make an end run on the <em>Pitchess </em>process by requesting the officers\u2019 personnel records under the guise of a Penal Code section 1054.1 and <em>Brady</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>discovery motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue commanding the trial court to vacate its order releasing the officers\u2019 birth dates and to allow Reimann to file a discovery motion in accordance with Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Beds worth, Acting P. J., and Moore, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The petition of real party in interest for review by the Supreme Court was denied August 8, 2001.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Penal Code section 1054.1 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe prosecuting attorney shall disclose to the defendant or his or her attorney all of the following materials and information, if it is in the possession of the prosecuting attorney or if the prosecuting attorney knows it to be in the possession of the investigating agencies: [ID ... [H] (d) The existence of a felony conviction of any material witness whose credibility is likely to be critical to the outcome of the trial, [fl] (e) Any exculpatory evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-11\">The court relied on <em>Brady v. State of Maryland </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 83 [83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215], and its progeny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Reimann argues, \u201cThe dates of birth are not treated as confidential by the police officers themselves. They appear on driver\u2019s licenses, birth certificates, credit card and loan applications and Vons cards.\u201d He misses the point. The issue is not whether a police officer can disclose his or her own birth date; clearly, the officer can. The issue is whether the court, without complying with Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045, can order the police department to disclose an officer\u2019s birth date to the district attorney so the district attorney can run a criminal records check on an officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Evidence Code section 1045, subdivision (a), permits a party to discover confidential information from a police officer\u2019s personnel file \u201cprovided that such information is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending litigation.\u201d Evidence Code section 1045, subdivision (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn determining relevance the court shall examine the information in chambers . . . and shall exclude from disclosure: [H] (1) Information consisting of complaints concerning conduct occurring more than five years before the event or transaction which is the subject of the litigation . . . [1[] (2) In any criminal proceeding the conclusions of any officer investigating a complaint filed pursuant to section 832.5 of the Penal Code, ffl] (3) Facts sought to be disclosed which are so remote as to make disclosure of little or no practical benefit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The police department stated it could have provided the same information to Reimann if he would have complied with the <em>Pitchess </em>process because they have greater access to the information than the district attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b271-9\"><em>Brady v.
