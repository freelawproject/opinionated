(Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 366.26, 395.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">A petition was filed by the Sacramento County Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in April 1999 alleging the 19-month-old minor was at substantial risk of harm because his mother had a substance abuse problem and the home had exposed electrical wires and other unsafe and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>unsanitary conditions. Police had been called to the residence on a report that a suspicious subject was possibly selling narcotics to juveniles. Although this report was not substantiated, the minor\u2019s mother told the officer that appellant \u201cwas probably the person that they were looting for.\u201d The mother told the officer that appellant was a methamphetamine and marijuana user and, on occasion, had drugs in the residence. The mother advised the officer that appellant had fled through the bathroom window prior to their arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Several attempts were made to locate appellant to offer him services prior to court intervention. A letter requesting contact for an interview was hand-delivered to appellant\u2019s residence. Notice of the detention hearing and a copy of the detention order containing notice of the jurisdictional hearing were delivered to appellant\u2019s address. The minor\u2019s mother advised the social worker she had seen appellant and \u201che would probably not be available due to a warrant situation that he believes he has pending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The social worker\u2019s jurisdictional report provided information about appellant\u2019s criminal history, which consisted of convictions for burglary, assault, felony driving under the influence of alcohol, and possession of narcotics for which he was on probation. The social worker recommended that a case plan be offered to appellant once his paternity was established, if the court determined this would be in the minor\u2019s best interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant did not appear at the jurisdictional hearing. Reunification services were ordered for the mother but denied for appellant under section 361.5, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">At the six-month review hearing, DHHS had not had contact with appellant. Notice of the hearing was sent to him at his last known address. Appellant did not appear at the hearing. The court set a section 366.26 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Appellant was served with notice of the section 366.26 hearing in December 1999 while in custody. In March 2000, appellant appeared at the scheduled section 366.26 hearing and informed the court that he was of Cherokee heritage. He also advised the court that he had been diagnosed four months earlier with a bipolar disorder and was on medication. The court continued the matter to assure compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act (the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>At the next hearing, the court appointed counsel for appellant and ordered that notice of the proceedings be sent to the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. At a subsequent hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel provided the court with a declaration of paternity signed by both parents. Appellant requested that visitation be assessed, which the court denied in the absence of a section 388 petition. Appellant did not file a section 388 petition and did not make any further requests for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The Cherokee Nation filed a notice of intervention, setting forth its determination that the minor was an Indian child. At a hearing in June 2000, the tribe asserted there had not been compliance with the \u201cactive efforts\u201d requirement of the Act because appellant was not offered a treatment plan when he initially appeared in the proceedings. Appellant\u2019s attorney argued that the court could not proceed with the section 366.26 hearing because the testimony of an Indian expert was required and there was not evidence beyond a reasonable doubt before the court \u201cthat termination should occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In a written pretrial statement, appellant asserted the Act had not been complied with \u201cin terms of having expert testimony proffered by the Department to establish the evidence necessary to terminate his parental rights . . . .\u201d Appellant contended that there was \u201cvery little information [before the court] about [appellant] or his ability to care for his son\u201d and that DHHS needed to assess him in order to \u201cfind the information necessary\u201d to terminate parental rights. Additionally, appellant again asserted that he had not been \u201coffered the opportunity to participate in any services\u201d and he requested the opportunity to reunify with the minor. Appellant indicated his intent to testify at the hearing and to call his sister and the social worker as witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In August 2000, an addendum to the social worker\u2019s section 366.26 report was filed. Attached to the addendum was an \u201cICWA Report\u201d prepared by Dr. Wynne DuBray, which included a statement of Dr. DuBray\u2019s qualifications and expertise in the area of Indian child welfare. Dr. DuBray\u2019s evaluation was based on court documents and other reports made available by DHHS, as well as discussions with the social worker. In a letter to the social worker, Dr. DuBray stated the information contained in the documents was sufficient for an adequate evaluation of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Under the assessment section of the report, Dr. DuBray stated: \u201cAfter examining the court reports and other supporting documents it appears that both biological parents are gravely impaired by both substance abuse and the fathers <em>[sic\\ </em>mental illness. Both have criminal backgrounds and behavior which has placed the minor at risk of great harm. Both parents have been on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>probation and/or parole and the father will be on probation until January 6, 2002. Neither parent appears able to provide a safe and protective environment for this minor.\u201d Dr. DuBray concluded: \u201cThe violent criminal history, substance abuse and mental illness of one of the parents in this case appear to provide evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that termination of parental rights for this child would not be detrimental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">On August 11, 2000, at the section 366.26 hearing, appellant and the tribe objected to termination of parental rights because appellant had not been offered reunification services. Appellant did not object to the absence of expert testimony and did not present any of his own witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The court found by clear and convincing evidence that the minor would be adopted and that termination of parental rights would not be detrimental. The court also stated: \u201cBased on Dr. DuBray\u2019s report, ... I do find beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child . . . .\u201d The court continued: \u201c[T]he Court found that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the break up of the Indian family and the efforts were unsuccessful. In fact, in this case, no reunification services were offered to the father.\u201d The court terminated parental rights and set a future hearing to consider placement in compliance with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Appellant first contends the trial court was required to provide him reunification services once the tribe determined the minor was an Indian child. Respondent makes numerous arguments as to why appellant is not entitled to relief. Since we will find that DHHS\u2019s efforts to notify and involve appellant in the proceedings satisfy the requirements of the Act, we do not address respondent\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The Act requires that \u201c[a]ny party seeking . . . termination of parental rights to ... an Indian child under state law shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d).) \u201cA tribe\u2019s determination that the child is or is not a member of or eligible for membership in the tribe is conclusive.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1439(g)(1) [further undesignated rule references are to the California Rules of Court].)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Appellant does not contend that attempts to notify him of the dependency proceedings were inadequate, and the record would not support such a contention. DHHS delivered to appellant\u2019s residence an offer to provide services prior to any court intervention. When appellant did not respond, DHHS delivered to his residence notices of the juvenile court proceedings that had been initiated. Again, he did not respond. The minor\u2019s mother told DHHS that she had seen appellant and that he \u201cwould probably not be available\u201d to DHHS because he had an outstanding warrant and, we may infer, he did not want to risk being arrested. This demonstrates that defendant was aware of the opportunities to receive services but decided to avoid them.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Instead, he argues that, even though he did not appear in the proceedings for close to a year, he was entitled to reunification services once he appeared. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The Act requires that active efforts be made to provide services, not that services be provided regardless of when a parent becomes available to receive those services. Even had DHHS known of the minor\u2019s Indian heritage, they would not have been able to provide services to appellant during the period of reunification because he chose to make himself unavailable. Assuming that DHHS was required to show compliance with the \u201cactive efforts\u201d requirement for a period prior to when they became aware the Act might apply, we find that their repeated attempts to contact appellant and to notify him of the proceedings satisfy the requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Appellant argues his request for services should not be deemed untimely because the Act provides that a parent \u201cmay petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate [an] action [for termination of parental rights] upon a showing that such action violated\u201d other specified provisions including the \u201cactive efforts\u201d requirement. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Appellant\u2019s Indian heritage was not known to DHHS or the juvenile court until after the reunification period had ended. Once he advised the juvenile court of his heritage, the court required compliance with the Act. As appellant has failed to show that the Act was violated, his argument as to timeliness fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">II-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The order of the juvenile court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AUD\">Scotland, P.
