J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjG\">We address the construction and application of Welfare and Institutions Code section 827, subdivision (a)(2), which deals with the public disclosure of the juvenile records of deceased dependent minors. We hold that (1) redaction, from the records pertaining to a deceased child, of information about a living child is not the sole statutory means by which the juvenile court may protect the interests of the living child; (2) a finding by the juvenile court that disclosure of information relating to the deceased child is \u201cdetrimental to the safety, protection, or physical, or emotional well-being of\u2019 <em>(ibid.) </em>a living child is sufficient to justify withholding some or all of the information about to the deceased child and implies a finding that redaction would be insufficient to protect the interests of the living child; (3) substantial evidence is the proper standard for the review of such express and implied findings by the juvenile court; and (4) the juvenile court\u2019s order in this case refusing to release any information about the deceased child is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Summary of Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">On February 10, 2000, Jaime M., a minor and a dependent child under the provisions of Welfare and Institutions Code section 300,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> died while in the care of a foster mother.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The foster mother was later charged with the murder of Jaime.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">On March 7, 2000, appellant Amy L. Pack, publisher of the Visalia Times Delta, filed a petition in Kings County Superior Court for disclosure pursuant to section 827, subdivision (a)(2) (the subdivision or subdivision (a)(2)), of \u201call juvenile case files pertaining to\u201d Jaime M. The petition was summarily denied on the same date. Pack then filed a request for reconsideration, citing recent amendments to subdivision (a)(2). On March 27, appellant The McClatchy Company, doing business as The Fresno Bee (McClatchy), filed a similar petition for access to Jaime\u2019s juvenile court files; this petition was amended on March 29. McClatchy sought disclosure of all Jaime\u2019s juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>court records covered by section 827, subdivision (e) and California Rules of Court, rule 1423(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">A hearing on both press petitions was set for April 19, 2000. On April 12, 2000, the California Department of Social Services (Department) moved for permission to file opposition, under seal, to the petitions for disclosure. This motion was denied. No written opposition or objection to either petition was filed by the Department or by any other person or entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">At the hearing on the petitions, respondent Kings County Human Services Agency (HSA), the Department, both parents, and a court appointed advocate for Jaime appeared and orally objected to any disclosure of Jaime\u2019s juvenile records. The juvenile court considered the arguments of the parties and approved the parties\u2019 agreement that the court review the records in camera. The court performed the review and then, on May 9, 2000, denied both press petitions. The court found that release of any information from Jaime\u2019s files \u201cwould be detrimental to the safety, protection, physical, or emotional well-being of another child who is directly or indirectly connected to the juvenile case.\u201d (\u00a7 827, subd. (a)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Both McClatchy and Pack subsequently asked the court to make additional findings explaining why appropriate redaction of Jaime\u2019s records would not adequately protect the interests of the other child. The court did not respond and took no further action on the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\"> On ju]y 5; 2000, Pack filed her timely notice of appeal from the order denying her petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On July 6, 2000, McClatchy filed its timely notice of appeal. Only HSA is participating as a respondent on these appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Appellants \u201csuggest\u201d that redaction was the \u201crequired remedy\u201d under subdivision (a)(2). We understand appellants to mean that redaction was the only tool available to the juvenile court to protect information pertaining to any child other than Jaime, and consequently, the juvenile court was without power to deny appellants all access to Jaime\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Section 827 sets the current parameters of this state\u2019s policy with respect to the confidentiality of juvenile records and governs the release of such records. <em>(In re Keisha T., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th 220; see also <em>T.N.G. v. Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 767, 778 [94 Cal.Rptr. 813, 484 P.2d 981]; <em>In re Tiffany G. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 443, 451 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 8]; <em>In re Michael B. </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1698, 1706 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 290]; <em>Lorenza P. v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 607, 610-611 [242 Cal.Rptr. 877]; <em>Navajo Express v. Superior Court </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 981, 985 [231 Cal.Rptr. 165].) The juvenile court has both \u201cthe sensitivity and expertise\u201d to make decisions about access to juvenile records and is in the best position to consider any other statutes or policies which may militate against access. <em>(In re Maria V. </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1099, 1103 [213 Cal.Rptr. 733]; <em>In re Keisha T, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 229-230; <em>T.N.G. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at pp. 778, 781.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Subdivision (a)(2), which concerns the records of deceased dependents, was amended in 1999. As so amended, it states: \u201cNotwithstanding any other law and subject to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (3) [which is not pertinent to this appeal], juvenile case files, except those relating to matters within the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to Section 601 or 602, which pertain to a deceased child who was within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to Section 300, shall be released to the public pursuant to an order by the juvenile court after a petition has been filed and interested parties have been afforded an opportunity to file an objection. Any information relating to another child or which could identify another child, except for information about the deceased, shall be redacted from the juvenile case file prior to release, unless a specific order is made by the juvenile court to the contrary. Except as provided in this paragraph, the presiding judge of the juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>court may issue an order prohibiting or limiting access to the juvenile case file, or any portion thereof, of a deceased child only upon a showing that release of the juvenile case file or any portion thereof is. detrimental to the safety, protection, or physical, or emotional well-being of another child who is directly or indirectly connected to the juvenile case that is the subject of the petition.\u201d (\u00a7 827, subd. (a)(2), as amended by Stats. 1999, ch. 996, \u00a7 22.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The 1999 legislation was prompted by the deaths of several dependent children. The Legislature decided that opening the records of a deceased child to public scrutiny would promote free investigation, uncover any government culpability, and prompt necessary changes in the system of placing and monitoring dependents. (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 199 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 6, 1999, p. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Subdivision (a)(2) constitutes one of several inroads into the barrier of confidentiality that protects juvenile records.  Though it is still the Legislature\u2019s intent \u201cthat juvenile court records, in general, should be confidential\u201d (\u00a7 827, subd. (b)(1)), this policy has become less absolute, and the lawmakers in the recent past have authorized significant departures from it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For example, since 1992 a juvenile court may permit, upon good cause shown, \u201cany . . . person\u201d to inspect the records of a juvenile dependent. (\u00a7 827, subd. (a)(l)(M), as amended by Stats. 1994, ch. 1018, \u00a7 1, pp. 6196-6199; Stats. 1994, ch. 453, \u00a7 14, pp. 2548-2550; Stats. 1993, ch. 589, \u00a7 .193, pp. 3082-3084; Stats. 1992, ch. 148, \u00a7 1, pp. 437-440.) Newspapers and other representatives of the press qualify as \u201cpersons\u201d under this provision. (See <em>In re Keisha T., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th 220.) In addition, certain specific categories of individuals may inspect juvenile records without first obtaining a court order. As of and after 1994, the list includes city attorneys and prosecutors who handle criminal or juvenile cases, judges, referees, hearing officers, and law enforcement officers actively participating in criminal or juvenile proceedings involving the minor, the superintendent of the school district where the minor is enrolled, members of child protective agencies, children\u2019s multidisciplinary teams, and persons or agencies providing treatment or supervision of the minor. (\u00a7 827, subd. (a)(1), as amended by Stats. 1994, ch. 1019, \u00a7 4, pp. 6204-6207.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In cases not governed by subdivision (a)(2) where a prior court order is required for access\u2014that is, whenever \u201cany . . . person\u201d other than one who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>falls within a specified category seeks disclosure\u2014the juvenile court must inspect the file in question and determine what information, if any, should be released. (\u00a7 827, subd. (a)(l)(M); <em>In re Keisha T, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 240-241.) The court must take into account any restrictions on disclosure found in other statutes, the general policies in favor of confidentiality and the nature of any privileges asserted, and compare these factors to the justification offered by the applicant. (Subd. (a)(2); <em>In re Keisha T, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at p. 241.) The process may be lengthy, and the balance of the concerns weigh predominately against access. (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 199 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 8, 1999, pp. 2-4; see also <em>In re Keisha T., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th 220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In cases governed by subdivision (a)(2), the Legislature has decided that the considerations favoring confidentiality are for the most part trumped by the considerations favoring public view, government accountability and reform. The legislators concluded that, when a dependent child dies in the care of a public agency, the need for confidentiality evaporates and the requirement for an expedited decision becomes manifest, because community reaction to the child\u2019s death may abate with the passage of time, and, without prompt investigation and assessment, the \u201copportunity to effect positive change\u201d may cease. (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 199, <em>supra, </em>as amended Apr. 8, 1999, p. 1-4; Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 199, <em>supra, </em>as amended May 6, 1999, p. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">In contrast to the veritable presumption in favor of confidentiality that attends the juvenile records of a living child, subdivision (a)(2) reflects a veritable presumption in favor of release when the child is deceased. (See Assem. Republican Caucus, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 199 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 6, 1999, June 26, 1999, p. 1; Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 199, <em>supra, </em>as amended May 6, 1999, p. 3; Sen. Com. on Judiciary, 3d reading analysis of Sen. Bill No. 199 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended July 1, 1999, p. 1.) Thus, unlike records pertaining to a living dependent, which must be maintained as confidential unless some sufficient reason for disclosure is shown to exist, records pertaining to a deceased dependent must be disclosed unless the statutory reasons for confidentiality are shown to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">We find two exceptions to disclosure written into subdivision (a)(2). The first arises when the records pertaining to the deceased child contain information about another living child. Obviously desiring that the presumption in favor of confidentiality should persist as to such living children, the Legislature in subdivision (a)(2) required the juvenile court to resort to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>simple expedient of redaction as the principal means by which to protect the other child. (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 199, <em>supra, </em>as amended Apr. 8, 1999, pp. 2-3; Sen. Rules Com., Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 199 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 6, 1999, p. 2.) However, the Legislature also obviously recognized that redaction may not in every case be sufficient to serve this end, given the potential complexities of dependency proceedings, including consolidated actions involving several children and multiple placements with a single foster home. The subdivision therefore articulates a second exception to the presumption of disclosure\u2014the limitation or outright prohibition of access to all or a part of the records relating to a deceased child when disclosure is shown to be detrimental to \u201cthe safety, protection, or physical, or emotional well-being of another child who is directly or indirectly connected to the juvenile case that is the subject of the petition.\u201d (Subd. (a)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Considering the subdivision in its entirety, we disagree with appellants that redaction is the \u201crequired remedy to protect information pertaining to other children.\u201d To the contrary, we think the grant of power to the juvenile court to restrict or entirely deny all access to some or all of the records of a deceased child, when the statutory conditions are proved, is an alternative separate and apart from redaction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> First, the two remedies are inconsistent. Redaction, on the one hand, reduces the amount of information disclosed from a deceased child\u2019s file, but the retained information relates only to the other child, not to the deceased child. The inclusion of the phrase \u201cexcept for information about the deceased\u201d child in the statutory text dealing with redaction is consistent, for it appears to manifest a legislative intention that information about the deceased child is not to be excised even if this information may also relate to or identify another child. On the other hand, the last portion of subdivision (a)(2) authorizes the court to limit or prohibit the dissemination of information about the deceased child when the court, even after it has redacted all information pertaining solely to the other child, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>concludes that information about the deceased child should not be released because it will somehow tend to harm the other child.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Second, the two remedies must be presumed to have been intended to be effective. The Legislature would have had no conceivable purpose in authorizing the juvenile court to curtail all access to the records of a deceased child under the specified conditions if it intended redaction of information about another child to be the only means by which to protect that other child. (See <em>Stafford v. Realty Bond Service Corp. </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 797, 805 [249 P.2d 241] [courts do not presume the Legislature indulged in an idle act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Third, the two remedies are separated by the statutory language itself. The final sentence of the subdivision is introduced by the clause \u201cExcept as provided in this paragraph.\u201d The prior sentences of \u201cthis paragraph,\u201d i.e., subdivision (a)(2), mandate that disclosure of a deceased child\u2019s records be ordered, with the redaction of information relating solely to other children. The introductory words of the last sentence therefore can only be read as manifesting a legislative desire that the grant of judicial power to wholly or partially deny access to the deceased child\u2019s records is separate from the provisions of the preceding portion of the subdivision. In addition, the fact that the last paragraph of the subdivision gives the court the power to take into account other living children who are \u201cindirectly connected\u201d to the case involving the deceased child demonstrates that the Legislature contemplated situations where there might be little or nothing about another child to redact and yet the nature of the information in the deceased child\u2019s file, if released, would tend to prejudice the other child.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The juvenile court\u2019s order was accompanied by the statement, framed for the most part in the relevant statutory language, that the release of Jaime\u2019s records \u201cwould be detrimental to the safety, protection, physical, or emotional well-being of another child who is directly or indirectly connected\u201d to the juvenile court case. Appellants maintain this expression does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>not promote meaningful appellate review. According to appellants, the juvenile court was compelled to do more than just repeat the words of subdivision (a)(2). As McClatchy puts it, \u201cthe juvenile court was required to provide specific factual findings demonstrating that its denial of the petition to release juvenile case files served some overriding interest. Mere conclusory statements which parrot the language of the statute are insufficient. In addition, the juvenile court\u2019s findings should also reveal whether less restrictive alternative to outright denial of the petition were considered and the reasons such alternatives were not acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Appellants rely on several cases, both state and federal, which have held that certain specific factual findings are required when the press is denied access to otherwise public information. <em>(Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325 [283 Cal.Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d 240]; <em>Telegram-Tribune, Inc. v. Municipal Court </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 1072 [213 Cal.Rptr. 7]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brooklier </em>(9th Cir. 1982) 685 F.2d 1162; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Criden </em>(3d Cir. 1982) 675 F.2d 550, 554, 562; <em>NBC Subsidary (KNBC-TV), Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 778, 980 P.2d 337] <em>(NBC Subsidiary).)</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>While we have no quarrel with these opinions, we do not find them dispositive here. First, as appellants implicitly acknowledge, the information they seek is not public; there is no overarching First Amendment right to unfettered access to juvenile court proceedings. <em>(San Bernardino County Dept. of Public Social Services v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 188, 196-197 [283 Cal.Rptr. 332]; <em>In re Keisha T., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 233-234; <em>In re Tiffany G., supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th at p. 451.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Logically, the same must be said for juvenile court records. (See <em>NBC Subsidiary, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at pp. 1217-1218 [access issues involve both closure of proceedings and sealing of records].)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Second, this is not a case analogous to <em>NBC Subsidiary, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th 1178, where the statute in issue, Code of Civil Procedure section 124, contained no provisions identifying what findings were necessary before a civil proceeding could be closed to the media, and therefore the Supreme Court was constrained to construe the statute constitutionally by judicially engrafting onto it acceptable standards. Here, by contrast, the subdivision does state the ground\u2014harm to another child\u2014which authorizes complete or partial nondisclosure. Appellants have not made any argument or offered any authority to the effect that the protection of other, involved children is not a legitimate \u201coverriding interest\u201d that can legally support a restriction or outright ban on the disclosure of a decedent child\u2019s juvenile records. (See <em>NBC Subsidiary, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at pp. 1217-1218.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In point of fact, the authorities favor the statutory condition. (See <em>T.N.G. v. Superior Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 778; <em>In re Tiffany G., supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th at p. 451; <em>In re Michael B., supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at p. 1706; <em>Lorenza P. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.3d at pp. 610-611; <em>Navajo Express </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>186 Cal.App.3d at p. 985.) The primary concern raised by a request for access to juvenile records is the best interests of the impacted child or children. <em>(In re Tiffany G., supra, </em>at p. 451.) The showing required by subdivision (a)(2) as a condition to the restriction or denial of access to information detrimental to a child other than the deceased child addresses that concern directly. (See <em>In re John H. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 18, 21-25 [145 Cal.Rptr. 357, 577 P.2d 177]; <em>In re Lawrence B. </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 671, 675 [132 Cal.Rptr. 599] (dis. opn. of Jefferson, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Third, the statutory language describes a circumstance that is as concrete as it rationally can be, given the confidential nature of the information about the other child. A closure order must articulate the interest involved and be accompanied by a statement of reasons, \u201cspecific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.\u201d <em>(Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court oc Cal. </em>(1984) 464 U.S. 501, 510 [104 S.Ct. 819, 824, 78 L.Ed.2d 629]; <em>NBC Subsidiary, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 1204.) The goal to be served by subdivision (a)(2) is apparent\u2014the best interests of a living child \u201cwho is directly or indirectly connected to the juvenile case that is the subject of the petition.\u201d (\u00a7 827, subd. (a)(2); see <em>T.N.G. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 778; <em>In re Tiffany G., supra, 29 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 451.) A conclusion by the juvenile court that release of information relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>to the deceased child is \u201cdetrimental to the safety, protection, or physical, or emotional well-being\u201d of an involved living child recites a legitimate reason for retention and provides the appellate court with a point on which to focus its evaluation of the record. (\u00a7 827, subd. (a)(2); see <em>Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 516 [Adequate findings relieve the appellate courts of having to \u201cgrope through the record to determine whether some combination of credible evidentiary items which supported some line of factual and legal conclusions supported the ultimate order or decision . . . .\u201d].) Given the myriad of unpredictable circumstances that could serve to connect a yet-living child with the former dependency of a deceased child, any more specific standard would risk, on the one hand, .the exclusion of a case where the maintenance of confidentiality is appropriate and, on the other, the disclosure of confidential information in an effort to support a decision intended to protect that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Fourth, though the juvenile court did not expressly find that redaction was not available as a less restrictive alternative to complete secrecy, the court\u2019s determination that preserving the confidentiality of Jaime\u2019s records was necessary to protect another child was tantamount to a finding that redaction of the information pertaining solely to the other child was inadequate to do so. (See <em>In re Jesse B. </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 845, 851 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 516] [order terminating reunification in juvenile case implies a finding that child will not suffer detriment as a result of termination].) We explained above that the statute requires full disclosure of the information about the deceased child even if it relates to or identifies another child, unless whole or partial retention of that information is necessary to safeguard the interests of the other child. Consequently, the juvenile court\u2019s ruling in this case that the withholding of all of Jaime\u2019s files was necessary to protect another involved child reflects an implicit determination by the court that redaction of any information pertaining solely to such child would not guard the interests of that child because of the nature of the information pertinent to Jaime.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">We are not persuaded by Pack\u2019s alternate argument that the juvenile court\u2019s statement does not comport with subdivision (a)(2) because the court used the subjective tense \u201cwould be detrimental\u201d instead of the declarative \u201cis detrimental\u201d found in the statute. Subdivision (a)(2) unambiguously addresses conditional conduct\u2014if the information in the file is released, harm will or is likely to follow. The juvenile court\u2019s expression accurately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>reflects this sentiment. There is no material difference between the language of the statute and the language used by the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Moreover, the variance is not of such import as to compel either reversal with directions to the juvenile court to enter an order releasing Jaime\u2019s records or an outright order to that effect by this court. At most we would remand for correction, a needless waste of time which we are confident would not result in the entry by the juvenile court of a finding favorable to appellants. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Osband </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 622, 728 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 26, 919 P.2d 640] [no prejudice in a criminal case where reversal of technical sentencing error would not likely result in the imposition of a different sentence on remand]; 9 Witkin, Cal.

G. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1408, 1413 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 818]; see also <em>In re Keisha T., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at p. 225.) McClatchy says this test is not pertinent to subdivision (a)(2) and we must assess the record de novo and exercise our independent judgment as to the merits of appellants\u2019 petitions because (1) the interpretation of a statute such as subdivision (a)(2) is a question of law; (2) there were no disputed factual issues raised in the juvenile court; and (3) the petitions present First Amendment issues. Mc-Clatchy maintains the \u201cproper remedy on appeal is for this court to conduct an independent review of the juvenile case files and to issue a ruling on the merits of the petitions releasing the juvenile case files in question.\u201d HSA takes the position the correct standard of review is abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">We agree appellate interpretation of a statute or rule is a question of law and is evaluated de novo by the appeals court. <em>(Hansen Mechanical, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 722, 727 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 47]; <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Compton Unified School Dist. </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 32, 38 [17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 474].) However, other than with respect to appellants\u2019 allusion that subdivision (a)(2) establishes redaction as the only remedy available to the court to protect other children and appellants\u2019 challenge to the formal sufficiency of the juvenile court\u2019s findings, issues we have already resolved, the contentions advanced by appellants relate not to the construction or interpretation of the subdivision but instead to its application in this case; that is, whether the juvenile court\u2019s refusal to allow access to any part of Jaime\u2019s file was in some manner in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Next, though we agree there were no written objections filed in the trial court, appellants\u2019 petitions were not unopposed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Foreclosed by the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit a confidential response to the petitions, HSA and the other objectors were relegated to orally stating their respective positions and arguing in general terms at the hearing against disclosure. The hearing record leaves no doubt the objectors took the position the petitions should be denied in toto under section 827, subdivision (a)(2), even though the ability of the objectors to present facts and specific reasons supporting this stance was compromised by the need to maintain confidentiality in the absence of a protective order. For example, the minor\u2019s advocate, for one, stated that: \u201cif there is another child involved in this case, there can be some very serious issues. I feel a little bit restricted of what I can say here because of the nature of the hearing and the press being here and the confidentiality issue. But I think there could be some very serious issues and information that I think will have to be redacted from the file and the Court would have to look at [it] very carefully in determining what information that the press should have access to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Counsel\u2019s comments were not limited to the name of or identifying information about another child, but included \u201cinformation that pertains to Jaime that could be detrimental to another child.\u201d The same points were made by counsel for the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In addition, the juvenile court was not obliged to grant appellants\u2019 petitions even in the absence of opposition or objection, written or oral. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>As the parties themselves acknowledged at the hearing, subdivision (a)(2) imposes an independent duty on the juvenile court to seek out the positions of interested third parties and protect the interests of <em>any child </em>directly or indirectly connected to the case. (Subd. (a)(2).) The children to whom the benefits of the statute extend need not be parties to the case or even be under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The Legislature knew precisely what it was doing when it wrote the provisions relating to the protection of other children. (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, 3d reading analysis of Sen. Bill No. 199, <em>supra, </em>as amended July 1, 1999, p. 1; Assem. Republican Caucus, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 199, <em>supra, </em>as amended July 1, 1999, p. 1, see also fn. 4.) Senate Bill No. 199 as initially authored allowed release of the juvenile court file without court intervention, unless a petition was filed by some person contesting the release. Early in the process, this self-executing procedure was rejected, and a court supervised release process was substituted. (Compare Sen. Bill No. 199, proposed subd. (a)(3), as introduced, with Sen. Bill No. 199 as amended Apr. 8, 1999, proposed subd. (a)(3).) It seems apparent the Legislature was unwilling to leave to unknown persons the responsibility for looking after the interests of involved other children and was quite content to place this responsibility on the juvenile courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Furthermore, the juvenile court had evidence, in the form of the records pertaining to Jaime, relating to the issues raised by appellants\u2019 petitions. Even if the contents of these records were not in dispute, the same cannot be said about the inferences and conclusions that might be drawn from the facts stated in the records. The records were before the court by virtue of the parties\u2019 unanimous agreement that the juvenile court would review Jaime\u2019s records in camera and on that basis decide how best to protect the interests of any directly or indirectly involved other children. The records were themselves sufficient proof of the nature of the information they contained. (See <em>In re Maria V., supra, </em>167 Cal.App.3d at p. 1103.) If the contents of these records rationally supported a conclusion that disclosure would be detrimental to another child, we know of no authority or reason, and appellants have provided none, which made necessary any further proof. <em>(In re Keisha T., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 233-234 [the juvenile court is best suited to evaluate what is in the child\u2019s file and what, if anything, contained in that file might be detrimental to another child]; <em>In re Tiffany G., supra, 29 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 451 [same].) In camera review was an appropriate procedure, and is routinely used when a judicial decision concerns information claimed to be covered by some rule of confidentiality or privilege. <em>(In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number><em>Maria V., supra, </em>167 Cal.App.3d at p. 1103.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Cases involving media claims to access are not exempted. <em>(Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 596, 609, fn. 25 [102 S.Ct. 2613, 2621, 73 L.Ed.2d 248]; <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 555, 598, fn. 23 [100 S.Ct. 2814, 2839, 65 L.Ed.2d 973]; <em>Telegram-Tribune, Inc. </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d at p. 1078.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">If the foregoing appears to presage a decision that the correct standard of review is abuse of discretion, it is deceiving because we think the subtly different \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test is the appropriate one when an appellate court is called upon to review a juvenile court\u2019s order under subdivision (a)(2) withholding all or part of a deceased child\u2019s records based upon prejudice to another involved child. Though both the abuse of discretion test and the substantial evidence test entail \u201cconsiderable deference to the fact-finding tribunal\u201d <em>(Department of Parks and Recreation v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 813, 831 [284 Cal.Rptr. 839]), the former centers upon legal principles\u2014whether, in light of the record, the trial court\u2019s ruling \u201cfalls within the permissible range of options set by the legal criteria\u201d <em>(Dorman </em>v. <em>DWLC Corp. </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1808, 1815 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 459])\u2014while the latter centers upon evidentiary proof\u2014whether the trial court\u2019s factual conclusions are rationally supported by record evidence <em>(Winograd </em>v. <em>American Broadcasting Co. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 624, 632 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 378]).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">We are led by the relevant language of subdivision (a)(2), which permits retention of the deceased child\u2019s records only when a \u201cshowing\u201d of prejudice to another child is made. The juvenile court thus does not have, given the evidence, a range of viable alternative options within the bounds of the law. Instead, it has no discretion and <em>must </em>release all the records of the deceased child in the absence of proof (1) that there exists \u201canother child who is directly or indirectly connected to the juvenile case,\u201d and (2) that release of all or a portion of the deceased child\u2019s records is \u201cdetrimental to the safety, protection, or physical, or emotional well-being\u201d of the other child. (Subd. (a)(2).) By contrast, a request for disclosure of juvenile records under subdivision (a)(1) of section 827 puts the court in the position of balancing the preference for confidentiality and the best interests of the minor against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>the benefits of public disclosure and the legitimate interest of the person seeking access, and then selecting a course of action which best deals with the conflict among the competing concerns. (See <em>In re Keisha T., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at p. 240.) The same is true, for example, under section 366.26 when the juvenile court must decide whether to terminate parental rights and place the child for adoption or instead to consider alternate placement options because termination would be detrimental to the child. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(4).) This decision necessitates the weighing of the child\u2019s need for stability against the extent of the detriment that would flow from termination and the identification of \u201c \u2018a compelling reason for determining that termination would be detrimental to the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Jasmine D. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1339, 1349 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 644].) Review of such an order is governed by the abuse of discretion test. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1351.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The determination to withhold all or part of a deceased child\u2019s records under subdivision (a)(2) is more like a ruling under section 300 when the juvenile court must decide whether a minor comes within the statutory description of a dependent child. (\u00a7 300; <em>In re Brison C. </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1373, 1378-1379 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 746].) In this instance, the juvenile court must evaluate whether the evidentiary facts prove any one or more of the statutory criteria indicative of a dependent child. <em>(In re Brison C., supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1378-1379.) Review of such an order is governed by the substantial evidence test. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Analogous also is a ruling under section 361.5, subdivision (b) when the juvenile court must decide whether to deny reunification services to a parent. (\u00a7 361.5, subd. (b); <em>In re Brian M. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1398, 1401-1402 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 881].) In this instance, the juvenile court must evaluate whether the evidentiary facts prove any one or more of the statutory criteria justifying the disallowance of services. (See <em>Brian M. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1401-1402 [\u00a7 361.5, subd. (b)(12)].) Review of this type of order is likewise governed by the substantial evidence test. (82 Cal.App.4th at p. 1401.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In <em>In re Jasmine D., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at page 1351, the court found that abuse of discretion was a \u201cbetter fit\u201d than substantial evidence as the standard applicable to the review of juvenile court custody rulings under section 366.26 because custody decisions are \u201ctypically reviewable for abuse of discretion\u201d and because the statutory mandate that a refusal to terminate be supported by a \u201c \u2018compelling reason\u2019 \u201d is a \u201cquintessentially discretionary determination.\u201d We think substantial evidence is the \u201cbetter fit\u201d for purposes of review of decisions under the last sentence of subdivision (a)(2). First, although this part of subdivision (a)(2) does not expressly require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>juvenile court to \u201cfind\u201d by any measure of proof that detriment to another child would result from disclosure of the deceased child\u2019s records, the language used is tantamount to such a directive, for, unless the specified ultimate facts\u2014the existence of and prejudice to another child\u2014are established, the court is without authority to withhold the sought after records. Thus, subdivision (a)(2) does not contemplate a balancing of a variety of competing interests and the fashioning of an order which represents a reasonable adjustment of the several factors. The court has no discretion to deny release of the deceased child\u2019s records for some compelling reason borne out by whatever circumstances may be found to be material; the court cannot do anything but release the records in the absence of a \u201cshowing,\u201d i.e., evidence, demonstrative of prejudice to another child. Second, the application of the substantial evidence standard is consistent with the presumption of disclosure inherent in subdivision (a)(2) and better protects the interests of the public and furthers the Legislature\u2019s intent to promote governmental responsibility and reform. Review on the basis of substantial evidence ensures that restrictive orders will be rigorously tested against the record facts and upheld only when there is evidence of sufficient value to justify the effective rebuttal of the presumption favoring disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">We now turn to the question whether the juvenile court here erred by refusing to give appellants access to Jaime\u2019s juvenile records.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Appellants contend their petitions should have been granted (with redaction of information relating to any other involved child) because there was no proof \u201cunder any evidentiary standard\u201d that release of Jaime\u2019s juvenile records would be detrimental to another child. Appellants point to the absence of any \u201cdeclarations, affidavits, or testimony\u201d in opposition to, and of any written objections to, the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">We have already addressed this subject. To summarize, the juvenile court had an independent obligation to consider the interests of other children in ruling upon appellants\u2019 petitions even in the absence of any objection by a specific person or entity. There were, in any event, oral objections by HSA and others, and there was evidence, in the form of the records sought, properly considered in camera by the juvenile court, with the consent of all parties, in ruling on the merits of the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">We arrive now at the last issue presented by this appeal\u2014was there substantial evidence before the juvenile court to support the court\u2019s refusal to release any of Jaime\u2019s records? We conclude there was such evidence and therefore that the juvenile court did not err by denying appellants\u2019 petitions entirely.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Having read Jaime\u2019s files, we understand fully the juvenile court\u2019s dilemma and why the court found it so difficult to expound on its conclusions without at the same time compromising the interests of another child connected to Jaime\u2019s case, the very thing the court was required to protect. We now face the same quandary, with an added element arising out of our own constitutional obligations. We must, on the one hand, evaluate whether the decision of the juvenile court is supported by substantial evidence and at the same time carry out the legislative intent that Jaime\u2019s records be kept confidential if we conclude the evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s decision that disclosure would operate to the detriment of another child. On the other hand, we must also state the reasons for our opinion. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 14). The following is our best effort at satisfying these commands.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The contents of the relevant records amply justify a conclusion that release of any part of them would be highly detrimental to the well-being of another child. The initial petition that invoked the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over Jaime also named another child. The subsequent course of the proceeding, and the documents and reports filed in it, involved the other child. Both children were under HSA\u2019s close supervision. The continual and intimate linking of the two children in the dependency proceeding makes it impossible as a practical matter to disclose information pertaining to Jaime without disclosing the identity of, or information prejudicial to the interests of, the other child. Redaction is not a reasonable remedy, for there is little if anything in the files which relates only to the other child, and, if only the other child\u2019s name were excised, what remained would nonetheless serve to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>identify the other child and open to view information obviously relevant and prejudicial to him or her.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In addition, we have complied, though we are not required to do so, with appellants\u2019 request that we give independent review to Jaime\u2019s records. Having assessed those records de novo and without regard to any of the trial court\u2019s express or implied factual findings, we conclude that, for the reasons set out immediately above, (1) release of Jaime\u2019s \u201cjuvenile case file or any portion thereof is [and will be] detrimental to the safety, protection, or physical, or emotional well-being of another child who is directly . . . connected to\u201d Jaime\u2019s case (\u00a7 827, subd. (a)(2)); and (2) redaction from Jaime\u2019s case file of all the information pertaining solely to the other child is not a viable, less restrictive alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Beyond these explanations and statements we cannot go without violating the confidentiality due the other child. We recognize the significance of the interests of the public and therefore of the press when a child in governmental custody dies. The Legislature grappled with the clash of the competing viewpoints in drafting subdivision (a)(2), and ultimately concluded that the presumption in favor of disclosure should yield when it would result in harm to a living child.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">We also recognize the frustration likely felt by appellants who have been told their presumptive right to access will not be honored in this case but at the same time have not been told why this is so, beyond a recitation of some statutory phrases and a few factual generalities which together probably communicate nothing more than that appellants will not get Jaime\u2019s files \u201cbecause we said so,\u201d and without detailed explanation of the substantial evidence which supports the juvenile court\u2019s order. We can only respond by pointing out that \u201cbecause we said so\u201d is about all that can be said in most cases arising under subdivision (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">We also note that subdivision (a)(2) is not an aberration in the law of California. In many instances where matters claimed to be entitled to some degree of confidentiality are in issue, the courts are authorized to receive the contested data under seal, to review it privately or in the presence of the proponent of confidentiality, to decide the extent and nature of any lawful</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>disclosure, and to tell the disappointed party only that the claim of confidentiality has been sustained in whole or part, as the case may be. This is true with respect to many qualified privileges, such as trade secret, informant and official information (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 915; 2 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (4th ed. 2000) Witnesses, \u00a7 88, pp. 340-341), with respect to certain claims under the newsperson\u2019s shield law (see 2 Witkin, Cal. Evidence, <em>supra, </em>Witnesses, \u00a7 348, subd. (2), p. 639; <em>Delaney v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 785, 814 [268 Cal.Rptr. 753, 789 P.2d 934]), and with respect to so-called \u201cPitchess\u201d motions, which seek information from police officer personnel records (see 5 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Criminal Trial, \u00a7\u00a7 58-59, pp. 113-116). The underlying rationale in all these situations is the same commonsense notion\u2014the right to confidentiality is not preserved by requiring its destruction as a condition precedent or as a condition subsequent to its protection. (See, e.g., <em>Delaney v. Superior Court, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 814 [the newsperson\u2019s shield law \u201cwould be illusory if a reporter had to publicly disclose confidential or sensitive information in order for a court to determine whether it should remain confidential or sensitive\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The orders denying appellants\u2019 respective petitions under section 827, subdivision (a)(2), are affirmed.

County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 517 [113 Cal.Rptr. 836, 522 P.2d 12].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">In its reply brief, McClatchy implies that <em>San Bernardino </em>might not be decided the same way today. If this is an invitation to this court to reexamine <em>San Bernardino, </em>we decline. McClatchy has pointed to nothing, by way of authority or argument, that was not considered by the court in <em>San Bernardino. </em>Moreover, <em>NBC Subsidiary </em>is not to the contrary. In <em>NBC Subsidiary, </em>the Supreme Court did not hold that press access to civil proceedings can never be judicially restrained. Instead, the court, interpreting Code of Civil Procedure section 124 in a constitutional manner, decided that under certain limited conditions press access to civil trials may be curtailed if an overriding interest supports closure or sealing, a substantial probability exists the interest will be prejudiced without closure or sealing, the closure or sealing is narrowly tailored to serve only the overriding interest, and there is no less restrictive means of protecting the overriding interest. <em>(NBC Subsidiary, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at pp. 1217-1218.) The court expressed no intention to decide any question of media access in juvenile matters. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1212, fn. 30.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Neither appellant rested upon a right to disclosure other than as may be permitted under subdivision (a)(2), and neither appellant asked the juvenile court to make the findings they now claim were necessary. Rather, both petitions in the juvenile court cited section 827 as authority for the disclosure sought. For example, McClatchy\u2019s petition, as amended, advanced no argument for disclosure other than that McClatchy had met \u201c[a]ll requisite elements of the disclosure statute . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The reason why no written objections to the petitions were filed is apparent\u2014the juvenile court refused to allow the filing of opposition under seal. Because the court would not enter the requested protective order, the objectors were placed in an impossible position. If their purpose was to keep the file confidential because of the potential for detriment to another child, disclosing the information pertinent to the other child in order to frame opposition to the petition would be self-defeating and put the objectors in the position of having violated the confidentiality of those juvenile records. This concern was raised again during the hearing, but the juvenile court still declined to grant any protective order for purposes of the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The procedure consists generally of two parts. First, the parties present a general outline of their respective positions supported by nonconfidential or nonprivileged evidence. Thereafter, the parties identify the specific confidential or privileged evidence for in camera review. The superior court then preserves the in camera record for later appellate review. (See <em>In re Keisha T., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 240-241; <em>Telegram-Tribune, Inc. v. Municipal Court </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 1072 [213 Cal.Rptr. 7] [procedure used in determining whether public should be granted access to a preliminary hearing in a first degree murder prosecution.].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\">The record establishes the juvenile court understood the terms of the statute, including the presumption in favor of release. The court at the outset of the hearing anticipated that at least some of the records would be opened to petitioners, and attempted to predict the length of the review, redaction, and decision process. Ultimately, however, the court\u2019s first impressions were disabused after the files were reviewed in camera.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Though it might be mechanically possible to eliminate all information pertaining to the other child from the records in issues, this remedy would be improper because the material so deleted would apply equally to Jamie. As we explained earlier, subdivision (a)(2) does not permit redaction of information relevant to the deceased child.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
