Father contends the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdictional findings under Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, subdivision (b) and order removing Dani from his physical custody are not supported by substantial evidence. (All further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.) In addition, he argues the court abused its discretion by granting him only monitored visitation. Mother joins in the issues raised by father and, in addition, contends the juvenile court erroneously denied her reunification services.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Minor\u2019s counsel informed us the juvenile court subsequently granted mother\u2019s section 388 petition for reunification services. On our own motion, we requested letter briefs addressing the issue of mootness. Respondent argues mother\u2019s appeal is moot and the remaining issues on appeal should also be dismissed as moot based on the parents\u2019 stipulation to various findings at the six-month review hearing. We agree and therefore dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The juvenile court sustained the allegations in the petition for the parents\u2019 failure to adequately protect Dani and for mother\u2019s prior abuse or neglect of his half siblings. The court also found \u201cto vest custody with the parents at this time would be detrimental to the minor, and to vest custody with social services director is required to serve in the minor\u2019s best interests.\u201d Reunification services were ordered for father, but not for mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">After the appeal was filed, mother petitioned the juvenile court for reunification services, and her petition was granted. The six-month review hearing took place on March 19, 2001, and the parents stipulated to the findings \u201cthat return of minor to parents would create a substantial risk of detriment to the physical or emotional well being of the minor\u201d and \u201cthat there has been some progress made toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating placement . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">\u201c[A]n action that originally was based on a justiciable controversy cannot be maintained on appeal if all the questions have become moot by subsequent acts or events. A reversal in such a case would be without practical effect, and the appeal will therefore be dismissed.\u201d (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 642, p. 669.)  The question of mootness in a dependency case should be decided on a case-by-case basis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>particularly when an error in the juvenile court\u2019s initial jurisdictional finding has been alleged. <em>(In re Kristin B. </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 596, 605 [232 Cal.Rptr. 36]; see also <em>In re Joshua C. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1547 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 10].)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">We previously held a parent does not waive the right to challenge the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdictional findings merely because the parent stipulates to a dispositional order. <em>(In re Jennifer V. </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1206, 1209-1210 [243 Cal.Rptr. 441].) In <em>Jennifer V., </em>we concluded waiver would only be found in the event of an unambiguous stipulation to the jurisdictional findings. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1209.) Because the stipulation in that case contained no admission by the parents to the truth of the jurisdictional allegations of child abuse and neglect, we concluded the father had not waived his right to challenge the jurisdictional findings. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1210.)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">More recently we concluded a parent had waived the right to challenge the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdictional findings by unambiguously stipulating to those jurisdictional findings at the six-month review hearing. <em>(In re Eric. A. </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1394-1395 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 401].) In <em>Eric </em>A., the father\u2019s attorney checked the box on the stipulation form stating \u201c \u2018pursuant to Section 364(c) . . . [that] conditions still exist which would justify initial assumption of jurisdiction under Sec. 300 ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1394.) After concluding the father\u2019s stipulation constituted an express waiver, we further explained our \u201cdecision should serve notice that such stipulations are fatal to pending appeals.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1395.)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The facts regarding the stipulation in this case are not directly analogous to the facts in either of our earlier decisions. Unlike <em>Jennifer V., </em>the parents here did more than simply stipulate to a dispositional order. But, unlike the father in <em>Eric A., </em>the parents refrained from checking the box stating \u201cconditions still exist which would justify initial assumption of jurisdiction under Sec. 300.\u201d  Respondent nonetheless argues <em>Eric A. </em>applies because the parents checked the boxes stating \u201cthat return of minor to parents would create a substantial risk of detriment to the physical or emotional well being of the minor\u201d and \u201cthat there has been some progress made toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating placement . . . .\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The parents stipulated to express findings, made by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d that it would be detrimental to return Dani to them and that continued placement is appropriate and necessary based on the progress they have made in alleviating or mitigating th\u00e9 causes necessitating Dani\u2019s placement. Read together, these findings amount to an unqualified admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>that the initial jurisdictional findings and dispositional order are supported by substantial evidence. In addition, the parents stipulated to the visitation plan set forth in the social services reports filed with the juvenile court after the appeal was initiated. These subsequent acts directly contradict, and therefore moot, the issues raised in father\u2019s appeal. The sole issue raised by mother on appeal is also undeniably moot, because \"she has since been offered reunification services. <em>(In re Pablo D. </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 759, 761 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 247].)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Father\u2019s counsel on appeal makes the unsupported argument the attorney at the six-month review hearing signed the stipulation without father\u2019s consent. While we note father did not personally attend the hearing, mother was present. The parents live together, father previously expressed his devotion to both mother and child, and there is no reason to believe father would not have consented to the stipulation even if he had personally attended the six-month review hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Sills, P. J., and O\u2019Leary, L, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
