Appeals Bd. </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 860, 865-866 [101 Cal.Rptr. 105, 495 P.2d 433].) This principle, which is known as the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule, is subject to an exception where the commuting employee is on a special mission or errand for the employer. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 868.) We hold that a police officer whose duties include testifying in court is not on a special mission while commuting from home to court to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">San Diego Police Officer Stephen E. Molnar was required by subpoena to attend a court proceeding on a day that he was not scheduled to report for duty. He was scheduled to testify on a matter arising out of his police work as a patrol officer. While Molnar was driving his personal car from home to the courthouse, he was injured in an accident. Thereafter, Molnar submitted a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits to his employer, the City of San Diego (the City), which is self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation purposes. The City denied the claim on the ground that the going and coming rule applied to preclude recovery for his injuries. On Molnar\u2019s application to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (the Board) for adjudication of his claim for benefits, the workers\u2019 compensation judge rejected the City\u2019s argument and awarded Molnar benefits based on a finding that he was on a special mission during his commute to the courthouse and thus was acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of his injury. The City sought reconsideration of the matter by the Board, which affirmed the award of benefits. The City now petitions for a writ of review of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">In precluding recovery of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries sustained during an employee\u2019s normal commute to and from work, the going and coming rule is based on the notion that an employee is not rendering services that benefit the employer during his or her commute. <em>(Santa Rosa Junior College </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 345, 351-352 [220 Cal.Rptr. 94, 708 P.2d 673].) However, when the employer requests or invites the employee to travel to or from a place to engage in a special activity that is within the scope of employment, the employee\u2019s travels on the special mission are deemed to incidentally benefit the employer. (Di<em>mmig </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 868.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>The special mission exception applies \u201c \u2018when the employee is requested to perform an unusual service or a usual service at an odd hour[.] [T]he trip becomes \u201cspecial\u201d because the bother and effort of the trip itself is an important part of what the employee is being compensated for.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Luna v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 77, 82 [244 Cal.Rptr. 596].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">To support the existence of a special mission, the underlying activity must be (1) special, that is, extraordinary in relation to the employee\u2019s routine duties, (2) within the course of the employee\u2019s employment, and (3) undertaken at the request or invitation of the employer. <em>(C. L. Pharris Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 584, 590 [187 Cal.Rptr. 899].) The City contends that Molnar cannot establish the first prong of a special mission because testifying in court is part of his routine duties as a traffic officer. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">In <em>Baroid v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 558 [175 Cal.Rptr. 633], the court annulled the decision to award workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an employee who was injured while traveling to work for a 5:00 a.m. assignment. Although the employee regularly began his workday at 8:00 a.m., the court concluded that because the employee was frequently required to work additional hours, his commute to work at 5:00 a.m. was not \u201cunusual or extraordinary\u201d and thus did not come within the special mission exception of the going and coming rule. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 571.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">Similarly, in <em>Luna v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d 77, a police officer was injured while driving his personal car to the police station at an earlier time than he normally reported for duty so that he could direct traffic for an annual art festival. The officer contended that he was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his injuries because he was acting within the scope of his employment during the commute to the station pursuant to the special mission exception. The Court of Appeal rejected this contention, however, concluding that because officers\u2019 shifts were routinely extended to meet additional needs, the festival had been a annual event for more than 50 years, and officers were expected to work extra hours during the festival and received overtime pay for their efforts, the officer\u2019s commute was not an \u201cunusual or special trip\u201d that brought him outside the going and coming rule. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">We conclude that a similar analysis applies here. The record shows that it is an integral part of a San Diego patrol officer\u2019s duties to testify, if subpoenaed to do so, in a proceeding arising out of his or her patrol work, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>and that such an officer testifies at such proceedings an average of twice a month. Molnar testified that he is subpoenaed to testify an average of one to two times per month. Testimony at the hearing also established that it is not unusual for officers to be called to testify on days when they are not scheduled to report to the station, and that the police department has various policies applicable to officers who testify on off-duty days. Pursuant to one such policy and a memorandum of understanding between the San Diego Police Officers Association and the San Diego Police Department, Molnar received overtime compensation for testifying on an off-duty day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">As observed in <em>Baroid v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>121 Cal.App.3d 558, the common thread of the cases involving a special mission is that there is some deviation in the location, nature or hour of the work to be performed that distinguishes the special mission from the normal work commute. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 569.) In contrast here, there was nothing extraordinary about Molnar\u2019s travel to the courthouse. The location, nature and timing of the work were within the purview of Molnar\u2019s customary work responsibilities, and his travel to the courthouse was a commute that he regularly made in carrying out his duties as a traffic officer. Although police department policies required Molnar to attend court to testify regarding matters arising out of his work, his travels to court did not provide a special benefit to the City different than his commute to the police station to report for duty. We conclude that Molnar\u2019s commute to the courthouse was not a special mission but instead was within the purview of the going and coming rule, and thus he is not entitled to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries suffered during the commute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">The order of the Board is annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">Benke, Acting P. I., and O\u2019Rourke, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">Respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 17, 2001. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
