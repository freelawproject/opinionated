Eames, Frank A. Heeht and Alfred Cowles, against Ellen R. Dorsett and Daniel H. Dorsett, who are husband and wife. The bill is predicated on two judgments in the circuit court of Cook county, one rendered March 2, 1890, in favor of George W. Clother, againstvDaniel H. Dorsett, for the sum of \u00a71582.50 and costs. This judgment was appealed by defendants therein to the Appellate Court, and, after affirmance therein, the order of affirmance and a procedendo were filed in the circuit court on the 29th day of July, 1890, and thereupon execution issued and was properly returned. The second judgment is for \u00a74140.44, entered May 31, 1890, by confession, in favor of Benjamin F. Gump, against Daniel H. Dorsett. The complainants are the assignees of both judgements. The first judgment was assigned to complainants on the 29th day of July, 1890, and the second judgment on the 31st day of July, 1890. By the sale of certain bonds and stocks pledged as collateral security for the payment of the judgment note on which the Gump judgment was entered, the Gump judgment has been reduced by the sum of $1576.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-5\" pgmap=\"541(298) 542(14)\">It was, among other things, alleged in the bill, that in the month of August, 1885, defendant Daniel H. Dorsett purchased certain real estate in Cook county, Illinois, described as follows: Lot 2 and the west half of lot 3, in O. W. Kettlestrings\u2019 addition to Harlem, in section 7, township 39, north, range 13, east of the third principal meridian, and, with the intent to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors, caused said real estate to be conveyed to his wife, Ellen R. Dorsett; that said lot 2 was conveyed to Ellen R. Dorsett by Samuel E, Pebbles and wife, by warranty deed dated August 3, 1885, and filed for record in the recorder\u2019s office of said county September 10, 1885, for the consideration therein expressed of $4000; that the west half of lot 3 was conveyed to Ellen R. Dorsett by J. Willis Kettle strings and wife, by warranty deed dated August 4, 1885, and filed for record in the recorder\u2019s office September 10, 1885, and recorded therein in book 1667 of records, on page 584, for the consideration therein expressed of $5500. It was also alleged that said real estate was purchased by Daniel H. Dorsett and paid for with-his money; that the real estate was conveyed to the wife of Daniel H. Dorsett, with the intent, on his part, to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors. The bill prays that it may be adjudged that said real estate be held in trust by Ellen R. Dorsett for her husband, for the purpose and with the intent, on their part, to hinder, delay and defraud the creditors of Daniel H- Dorsett; that defendants be decreed to pay complainants\u2019 debt, and in default thereof that said real estate be ordered sold under the direction of the court, to pay complainants\u2019 judgments, etc.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-5\" pgmap=\"542\">Ellen E.

Dorsett, and the same conveyed to her by deeds executed by said Pebbles and wife and Kettlestrings and wife, on or about the dates named in said bill, and for the considerations therein named, 'but denies that either of said pieces of land was conveyed to her for the purpose of hindering, delaying- or defrauding the creditors of said Daniel H. Dorsett, or with any other fraudulent intent or purpose, and that all the consideration money for the premises was paid in cash, except the sum of $900, which was secured by note and trust deed on said lot 2, which note and trust deed were afterwards paid and taken up by money belonging to the answering defendant, and that prior to the purchase of said premises the defendant had paid over and given to her husband between $4000 and $5000, which has never been repaid to her in any way\"; that a portion of the premises is now occupied by herself and family as a homestead, and has been so occupied for several years last past; that when said premises were purchased, in the year 1885, her said husband was entirely solvent and abundantly able to pay all his debts, and answering .defendant believes that he is still solvent and able to pay his debts; that the judgments set up in the bill were rendered three or four years after said premises were conveyed to her, and that between the year 1885 and the recovery of said judgments her husband owned, in his own right and in his own name, large and valuable pieces of real estate situated in Cook county, besides personal property and effects.

Dorsett, of lot 2 and the west half of lot 3, which are more particularly described in the bill, was fraudulent as against the two creditors who obtained judgment on their respective claims against Daniel H. Dorsett. The law is well settled that a voluntary conveyance of property by a husband to his wife, where the husband is insolvent or indebted beyond his ability to pay, will be regarded as fraudulent as against existing creditors. (Moritz v. Hoffman, 35 Ill. 553; Patterson v. McKinney, 97 id. 41; Marmon v. Harwood, 124 id. 106.) So, also, a voluntary conveyance made by the husband to the wife, if made with a view of becoming indebted and with a fraudulent intent, may be impeached by subsequent creditors. On the other hand, a conveyance from a husband to his wife when the husband is solvent, and the gift is a reasonable provision according to the state and condition in life of the husband, will be sustained. In Bridgford v. Riddell, 55 Ill. 261, Yazel v. Palmer, 81 id. 82, and Faloon v. McIntyre, 118 id. 292, the rule is declared that a voluntary conveyance can only he attacked by creditors in existence at the time the conveyance was made,\u2014that subsequent creditors can not inquire into the validity of the transaction. The same doctrine is recognized in Jackson v. Miner, 101 Ill. 550.</p> <p id=\"b546-5\" pgmap=\"546\">The two deeds which the complainants seek to impeach were executed, one on August 3, 1885, and the other on the day following, and the principal question of fact before the circuit court was, whether Daniel H. Dorsett was at that time insolvent, or so heavily involved that he was not able to pay his existing liabilities. Upon this question much evidence was introduced by the respective parties, and the testimony is somewhat contradictory. Several witnesses called on behalf of the complainants gave it as their opinion that Dorsett was, at the time the deeds were executed, insolvent; but the facts before the court, in our judgment, when properly'considered, establish the contrary. We shall not refer to all the evidence in detail, as that is not necessary; but we shall content ourselves with alluding to a few leading facts in the case, which, in our opinion, fully sustain the decree of the circuit court and the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming the decree.</p> <p id=\"b546-6\" pgmap=\"546(163) 547(131)\">The property involved cost in the neighborhood of $12,000. About the same time this purchase was made, Dorsett puiv chased, in his own name, property at Oak Park which cost about the same amount. Prior to the purchase, Ellen E.Dorsett bad advanced to her husb.and, on different occasions, of her own money, which she had received from her father\u2019s estate, from $4000 to $5000. She also paid an incumbrance on the property of $960. From the fall of 1883 to the fall of 1886 Dorsett was a stockholder and principal member in the Chicago Pipe and Paving Company, and in the spring of 1885 Dorsett entered into a contract with the Chicago Sectional Electric Underground Company and Elisha Gray for the construction of a system of underground conduits in Chicago. For the purpose of completing this contract, Dorsett had arranged with the Pipe and Paving Company for the use of its factory, upon certain agreed terms. J. E. Burdock had an interest in this contract, with Dorsett. The contract was completed about the first day of September, and the profits realized amounted to over $60,000, the entire amount of which, except some $9000, belonged to Dorsett. During the time the work was being done under this contract, Dorsett was compelled to borrow money, and was somewhat involved until the contract was completed, but after the completion of the contract he had ample means to pay all liabilities, and had a surplus to invest in the Oak Park property of $30,000. Burdock, a witness-called for complainants, testified that upon the completion of this contract, September 1, 1885, he and Dorsett, the two parties composing the firm of Dorsett &amp; Co., were solvent, and could then pay their debts at any time.</p> <p id=\"b547-5\" pgmap=\"547\">In 1883, Dorsett commenced doing business with the Commercial National Bank in Chicago, and continued to do business with the bank for several years. Henry F. Eames was-president of the bank, and in his testimony he now thinks that Dorsett was then insolvent. But in 1885 the Commercial National Bank loaned Dorsett $8000 or $10,000 on his own paper. Eames knew of no suits being brought against him from 1885 to 1887, or judgments rendered against him. He also testified that all indebtedness to the bank was taken up in 1887, and in 1886 he gave Dorsett the following letter of endorsement:</p> <p id=\"b547-6\" pgmap=\"547\">\u201cChicago, April 8, 1886.</p> <p id=\"b547-7\" pgmap=\"547\">\u201cTo whom it may concern\u2014I have known Mr. D, H. Dorsett for many years. He has been a pleasant customer of this bank also for several years. Our business relations have been entirely satisfactory. I believe Mr. Dorsett is entirely responsible for any agreement he may make. I consider him a careful and discreet man, and I believe that he has been quite, prosperous, and is making money in his present business.</p> <p id=\"b547-8\" pgmap=\"547\">H. F. Eames, Pres.\u201d'</p> <p id=\"b547-9\" pgmap=\"547(23) 548(14)\">Frank A. Hecht, another of the complainants, on May 26',, 1886, as a member of the firm of Chas. Kaestner &amp; Co., wrote '\u25a0the following to a New York house concerning the standing of JDorsett &amp; Go.:</p> <p id=\"b548-5\" pgmap=\"548\">\u201cIn reply to your favor of the 24th, say we have been building machinery for Dor sett &amp; Co. during past three years, given them credit from $1000 to $8000, and never had any difficulty with them, and our banker, to whom we discounted their paper, said it was always paid before due. Consider them good and shrewd business men, and not likely to undertake anything they can not swing. Our contracts will amount to $6000, for which we expect to carry them four or . five months, or until such time when their new factory begins to turn out conduits. We know there is a large profit in their business, and do not hesitate. to give them credit for any amount they desire. While we do not care to guarantee their \u00a1account with you, we think it will be a good one. Dorsett\u2019s backing here is of the very best, as near as we can learn, consisting of one of our largest bankers. Have- never asked for a statement, and can give no idea, but consider them good for all they want in our line. Treat this as confidential.\u201d</p> <p id=\"Ade\" pgmap=\"548\">Dor sett testified that in 1885 no creditors were pressing Mm for payment; that he \u201cwas solvent three or four times .over,\u201d but he had to borrow money for his New York enterprise, but had something to show for it. He further testified that on the 13th of May, 1885, his account with the Gommer,-cial National Bank showed a balance in his favor of $3880.77, and his bank book, put in evidence, showed that during July, August and September, 1885, there was deposited to his credit $75,859.45. He testified, also, that between June and September, 1885, he deposited at Christoph\u2019s bank, on his private \u2022account, about $50,000, and this is not contradicted by any other evidence we find in the record.</p> <p id=\"b548-8\" pgmap=\"548(46) 549(109)\">During the summer and fall of 1885 Dor sett paid out for the Oak Park property over $30,000. One-half of the property was placed in the name of his wife, and the other half in his own name. The property purchased in his own name, worth from $12,000 to $15,000, stood of record in his name, clear of incumbrance, from 1885 to 1887,\u2014a period of two years. It might happen that an insolvent person would hold for two years unincumbered property of the value of $12,000 in his own name, within a short distance of the center of the city of Chicago, and no creditor attempt to reach the property. But occurrences of that kind, it must be conceded, are scarce. It also appears from the record that in 1887 Dorsett and these complainants organized a new company, and in the organization and distribution of stock the entire indebtedness of Dorsett was liquidated.</p> <p id=\"b549-5\" pgmap=\"549\">It is clear from the record that Daniel H. Dorsett was ss speculator. He was largely engaged in contracts for putting, in conduits and sewers in New York, Brooklyn, Minneapolis, Detroit, Chicago, and other cities. His business required the use of large sums of money to enable him to carry out his contracts. But while he was a large borrower, the testimony all shows that he had excellent credit, and furnished men of fine financial standing as endorsers. Moreover, in 1885, 1886 and 1887 he owned property, and by resorting to the courts no reason is perceived why a debt could not, at any time, have been collected from him. John Syme, a witness for appellee, who was book-keeper for the National Subway Company, and knew Dorsett\u2019s financial standing, testified; \u201cHe always had financial resources, as far as I know, and I think he was during those years (1884 to 1889) perfectly solvent.\u201d There is other testimony of a like character in the record, but it will not be necessary to refer to it.</p> <p id=\"b549-6\" pgmap=\"549\">The circuit court and the Appellate Court have both found' that the evidence is insufficient to show that Dorsett was, at the time the deeds were executed, insolvent, and we are not' inclined, after a full consideration of all the evidence, to hold that those courts have so far misjudged the evidence as to authorize a reversal of the judgment. The judgment will therefore be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"APn\" pgmap=\"549\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
