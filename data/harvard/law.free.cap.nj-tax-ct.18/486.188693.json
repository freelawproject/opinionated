We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Plaintiff argues that in the \u201creasonableness\u201d hearing held in accordance with <em>Ocean Pines, Ltd. v. Borough of Point Pleasant, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>1, 547 A.2d 691 (1988), the Tax Court should have imposed the burden of proving the reasonableness of the assessment upon the defendant municipality. We recently rejected the same argument in <em>Two Brighton Avenue Associates v. City of Passaic, </em>18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>480, 482 (App.Div.1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s reference [in <em>Ocean Pines, supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 12, 547 A.2d 691] to the presumption of validity of the \u201coriginal assessment,\u201d and the need for the taxpayer to produce \u201cevidence that is \u2018definite, positive and certain in quality and quantity,\u201d\u2019 in order to overcome that presumption, it is difficult to understand the basis for plaintiffs argument that the burden of proof at a reasonableness hearing is on the municipality rather than the taxpayer. The tax court found no merit in that argument and neither do we.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">The purpose of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34 is \u201cto assist the assessor, in the first instance, to make the assessment and thereby hopefully to avoid unnecessary expense, time and effort in litigation.\u201d <em>Terrace View Gardens v. Dover Tp., </em>5 <em>N.J.Tax </em>469, 471-72 (1982), <em>affd o.b., </em>5 <em>N.J.Tax </em>475 (App.Div.1983). When the taxpayer refuses to comply with such a request, the statute provides that the assessor is entitled to proceed on the basis of whatever information is available, and in whatever method the assessor deems appropriate. The qualification to that principle is that the assessor act \u201creasonably.\u201d However, given the rationale for the statute, the justifiable demand that the taxpayer provide necessary information, and considering that it is the taxpayer\u2019s refusal to do so that makes the entire hearing necessary, the presumption of validity of the municipal action is certainly justified. As the Supreme Court noted, if that presumption is to be overcome, the taxpayer must do so by presenting \u201cdefinite, positive and certain\u201d evidence. <em>Ocean Pines, Ltd., supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 12, 547 A.2d 691.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">[T]here simply is no basis within the statute, within the <em>Ocean Pines </em>decision, or in policy or logic for the rule urged by plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">We adhere to the conclusion reached in <em>Two Brighton Avenue Associates </em>that the taxpayer has the burden of proof in a reasonableness hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Plaintiff also argues that the assessment of its property was unreasonable as a matter of law because, lacking the information which chapter 91 requires a taxpayer to produce, the assessor placed the same value on plaintiffs property as the prior year\u2019s assessment. However, it is not intrinsically unreasonable for an assessor to assess a property at the same value as in the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>year. <em>See Pantasote Co. v. City of Passaic, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>408, 416, 495 A.2d 1308 (1985). Therefore, the assessor\u2019s decision to carry forward the assessment from the prior year did not relieve plaintiff of the burden of proving the unreasonableness of that assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Finally, plaintiff contends that Tax Court erred in sustaining the municipality\u2019s objections to certain questions which plaintiff asked the assessor. However, we find no prejudicial error in any of those rulings. The Court in <em>Ocean Pines </em>indicated its expectation that \u201cfijn most cases\u201d the county board of taxation or Tax Court would be able to determine the issue of reasonableness \u201cin summary fashion, without the taking of testimony.\u201d 112 <em>N.J. </em>at 11-12, 547 A.2d 691. The Court also indicated that \u201c[t]he taxpayer shall be entitled to discovery = ' my information relied on by the assessor in arriving at the subject valuation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, 547 A.2d 691. In this case, plaintiff did not avail itself of the opportunity to conduct discovery. In fact, plaintiff did not even subpoena the assessor to appear at the reasonableness hearing. As a result, although the assessor testified at the hearing, she did not bring her records with her and was unable to answer many of plaintiffs questions. Under these circumstances, it is understandable that the Tax Court took a somewhat restrictive view of the permissible scope of questions the assessor could be asked. In any event, we are satisfied that any answers the assessor may have been able to give to the questions which the court precluded plaintiff from asking would not have changed the outcome of the reasonableness hearing. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
