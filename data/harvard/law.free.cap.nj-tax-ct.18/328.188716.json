The background is fully detailed in the Tax Court\u2019s published opinion, <em>Boardwalk Regency v. Director, Div. of Tax., </em>17 <em>N.J.Tax </em>331 (Tax 1998), and need not be restated.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">We are in total agreement with the Tax Court judge, substantially for the reasons he stated, that the complimentary providing of non-alcoholic beverages to casino patrons and employees \u201cis a transfer for no consideration, or at least for legally \u2022insufficient consideration, and does not constitute a \u2018resale\u2019 of the beverages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342-43. Accordingly, we also agree that \u201c[w]ith this provision to the patrons, the sale-for-resale exemption disappeared, and BRC became, for tax purposes, the consumer or \u2018end-user\u2019 of the nonalcoholic carbonated beverages\u201d and, thus, that \u201ca use tax became due on the beverages BRC purchased under the sale-for-resale certificates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>We part company with the trial judge only with respect to the power of the Director to compromise a tax dispute and its impact in this case. Before the trial judge the parties stipulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">8. On December 14, 1981, the Division entered into an Agreement in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:53-1 (the \u201c1981 Agreement\u201d) with BRC, which provided, <em>inter </em>alia, that no sales tax would be imposed on the provision of \u201ccomplimentary meals\u201d and that a use tax would be imposed upon the \u201ccost\" of a complimentary meal. Such \u201ccost\u201d would be deemed to equal 25# of the amount that such meals would have been sold for to the public. A copy of the 1981 Agreement is attached as Joint Exhibit 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">9. On May 15,1986, the Division entered into an Agreement, in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:53-1 (the \u201c1986' Agreement\u201d), with BRC, which amended the 1981 Agreement and provided that \u201cLn]o sales or use tax will be imposed in the provision of complimentary meals or complimentary liquor effective January 1, 1986.\u201d The 1986 <em>Agreement </em>specifically provided that \u201cComplimentary Meals\u201d means \u201cany transaction where the patron is not required to pay any cash consideration for any portion of the price (including any possible sales tax) of food or (non-alcoholic) beverage.\u201d A copy of the 1986 Agreement is attached as Joint Exhibit 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">10. On June 15, 1988, paragraph 3 of the 1986 Agreement was amended (with the 1986 Agreement, as amended, referred to as the \u201c1988 Agreement\u201d). Copies of the revised paragraph 3 and the related transmittal letter are attached as Joint Exhibit 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">11. When the 1981 Agreement, the 1986 Agreement and the 1988 Agreement were entered into, and during the taxable period, under the Sales and Use Tax Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-1 <em>et seq., </em>in accordance with the Division's long standing administrative position, purchasers such as BRC could provide Resale Certificates to their Suppliers for the purchase of all non-alcoholic carbonated beverages, provided that non-alcoholic carbonated beverages would be resold in the ordinary course of their businesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Although not quoted in the stipulation, it is undisputed that paragraph 3 of the 1986 agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">With respect to issuance of coupons to be used by bus patrons or others which are utilized to satisfy a portion of retail price of the meals consumed by such patrons, sales tax will be imposed upon the full value of said meals pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54.32B-2(e); and said sales tax shall be collected from the patrons and remitted pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:82B-12, -14, -17 and -18. For purposes of the amended agreement the term 'coupon\u2019 shall mean any coupon, token or other emolument which entitles the holder to a discount or credit on the purchase price of meals or (non-alcoholic) beverage but shall not include coupons or other documents which <em>are </em>accepted in total satisfaction of the purchase price (including any possible sales tax) of such meals or beverages as described in paragraph 2 . . Lquoted above in paragraph 9 of the stipulation].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>That paragraph was amended by the 1988 revision, referred to in paragraph 10 of the stipulation. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">With respect to issuance of coupons to be used by bus patrons or others, sales tax will be imposed upon the price charged for a meal, including nonalcoholic beverages, less the face value of the coupon pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-3(c); and said sales tax shall be collected from the patrons and remitted pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-12, -14, -17 and -18. For purposes of this amended agreement the term \u2018coupon\u2019 shall mean any coupon, token or other emolument which entitles the holder to a discount or credit on the purchase price of meals or nonalcoholic beverage for which the casino receives no reimbursement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Hence, as part of the agreements, plaintiff agreed to pay the disputed tax on the partially \u201ccomped\u201d meals and beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:53-1 provides that the Director is authorized to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">enter into a written agreement with any person relating to the liability of such person, or of the person or estate for whom he acts, in respect of any state tax for any taxable period ending prior or subsequent to the date of such agreement. A closing agreement may be entered into in any case in which there appears to be an advantage in having the case permanently and conclusively closed, or if good and sufficient reasons are shown by the taxpayer for desiring a closing agreement and it is determined by the director that the State will sustain no disadvantage through consummation of such an agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>54:53-1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The statute was part of \u201c[a]n act to establish the authority of the Director of the Division of Taxation to enter into closing agreements and compromises with taxpayers within certain limitations .\u201d <em>See L. </em>1975, c. 387, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:53-1 to -15, as amended by subsequent legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">We read <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:53-1 literally and find no basis for voiding the agreements because they were not limited in time or \u201cwould govern the future tax liability of a taxpayer for an indeterminate period of time.\u201d <em>Boardivallc Regency, supra, </em>17 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 346. The agreements were authorized because they concerned a \u201ctaxable period ending ... subsequent to the date of such agreement.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:53-1; <em>see also </em>N.J.S.A. 54:53-3(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The judge, however, concluded that the agreements in question \u201ccould not have [been] intended to include the \u2018purchase\u2019 of nonalcoholic carbonated beverages\u201d because it \u201cwould [have] effectively eliminatefd] the tax liability of BRC in regard to nonalcoholic beverages\u201d and, therefore, would not have been authorized as \u201cadvantageous to the. State\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:53-1. <em>Boardwalk Regency, supra, </em>17 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 347. We disagree. The Director has broad discretion, and if the agreements were designed to settle a dispute concerning the taxability of transactions including those now in dispute, the administrative action must be deemed presumptively valid. <em>See Public Serv. Elec. and Gas Co. v. New Jersey Dept. of Environ. Protection, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>95, 103, 501 A.2d 125 (1985); <em>Gloucester Cty. Welfare Bd. v. State, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>384, 397-99, 461 A.2d 575 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Here, the 1986 and 1988 agreements abandoned an effort to collect taxes for fully complimentary meals in exchange for an agreement by the plaintiff to collect and pay the sales tax for partially \u201ccomped\u201d meals and beverages. The record includes a memorandum from the Division\u2019s Audit Supervisor to the Director indicating that \u201cthe state will benefit\u201d from the 1986 agreement \u201cbecause of the increased use of coupons\u201d and a memo from the Assistant Chief Tax Counselor recommending that the State \u201center into an agreement with the casinos which binds them to collect and remit the sales tax on the coupon sales and, as the <em>quid pro quo, </em>eliminate the use tax on the complimentary meals altogether.\u201d Hence, if the Director felt that an agreement, as opposed to litigation, would be \u201cadvantageous to the State,\u201d his decision to compromise an unsettled issue of tax law would not be arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. <em>See Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579-80, 410 A.2d 686 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Settlement of disputes has as much priority in this tax setting as in others. Thus \u201ccourts will strain to give effect to the terms of a settlement whenever possible,\u201d even when an administrative agency is involved. <em>Department of Public Advocate v. New Jersey Bd. of Pub. Util., </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>523, 528, 503 A.2d 331 (App.Div.1985); <em>see also Pascarella v. Bruck, </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>118, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>125, 462 A.2d 186 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>600, 468 A.2d 233 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u201cThe use tax is a tax complimentary to the sales tax as an aid to its enforcement. It is a tax on possession and enjoyment of that which was purchased and for which no sales tax was paid.\u201d <em>McGraw-Hill v. Div. of Taxation, </em>9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>372, 382 (Tax 1987); <em>see also, e.g., Heuer v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>12 <em>N.J.Tax </em>443, 447 (Tax 1992), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>14 <em>N.J.Tax </em>283 (App.Div.1993). Thus, BRC states that there could not be both a sales tax and use tax imposed on the purchase and use of the same beverages. Hence, it contends that \u201c[wjhen the Division agreed not to collect the compensating tax <em>(i.e., </em>the use tax) it necessarily agreed not to collect the tax for which it compensated (i.e., the sales tax on the purchase).\u201d It further argues, \u201cthe Division agreed to the casinos\u2019 proposal that (a) they pay the-sales tax on the retail value of the partially comped items, provided (b) the Division agree to not impose a use tax on the fully comped items.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">We agree that, there cannot be both a sales tax on the purchase <em>and </em>a use tax on the enjoyment upon abandonment of the intention to sell an item bought for purposes of resale, and that an agreement as to one had to constitute a settlement of the taxability of both the purchase and use of the item. In other words, because of the interrelationship between the purchase and' use of the same item, a settlement as to the sales tax must resolve any claim regarding the use tax with respect to that item, and vice-versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">However, the judge agreed with the Director that the purchase of the beverages was a \u201cdiscrete\u201d taxable event distinct from the \u201cprovision\u201d of complimentary drinks to patrons and employees, and that the agreements related only to the latter. <em>Boardwalk Regency, supra, </em>17 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 337, 344-45. <em>See also Trump Plaza Associates v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>17 <em>N.J.Tax </em>327 (Tax 1998). Under that theory, the agreement to tax only the use of partially complimentary beverages does not constitute an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ment not to impose a sales tax on the purchase of beverages ultimately distributed on a fully complimentary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">We believe there is a factual dispute relating to the scope of the agreements which precludes summary judgment. The dispute concerns precisely what the 1981, 1986 and 1988 agreements were designed to address and whether the agreements were designed to include the purchase of all nonalcoholic beverages as well as their service on a complimentary basis to BRC\u2019s patrons, independent of a meal, and to BRC\u2019s employees at all. While both parties sought summary judgment, a factual dispute remains as to whether the parties intended to resolve this subject within the meaning of the agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In <em>summary, we agree </em>with the trial judge that there was no \u201csale\u201d of the fully \u201ccomped\u201d nonalcoholic beverages and, therefore, that a use tax was payable because they were not resold. However, we reject the judge\u2019s conclusion \"that a \u201csettlement\u201d of the disputed tax liability could not have been perfected under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:53-1 as a matter of law. Accordingly, we reverse the grant of summary judgment to the Director and remand for resolution of the factual dispute regarding what was settled by the agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded for farther proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-10\"> The judge also said \"[tjhis tax liability can be viewed either as the original sales tax due on the product that was not resold, or as a use lax compensating for the fact that sales tax was not collected at the time of the initial purchase. Whatever the tax is called, it is clearly due under the provisions of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 344. We also note that <em>Adamar of N.J. v. Director, Division of Taxation, </em>17 <em>N.J. Tax </em>80 (Tax 1997), discussed by the trial judge in this case, <em>see Boardwalk Regency, supra, </em>17 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 350-51, has been affirmed for the reasons stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Judge Kuskin's opinion. See <em>Adamar of N J. v. Director, Division of Taxation, </em>18 <em>N.J Tax </em>70 (App.Div.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-12\"> The 1986 agreement permitted termination \u201cby either party upon the giving of six months \u2022written notice and such termination shall apply to periods subsequent to the six month termination notice.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
