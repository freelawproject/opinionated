Their estate appeals from Judge Axelrad\u2019s dismissal of their challenge to 1998 assessed taxes. The Morey\u2019s estate has been substituted as party appellants, but we refer to the estate and appellants as plaintiffs. Judge Axelrad dismissed plaintiffs appeal after they failed to respond in a timely fashion to the assessor\u2019s request for information under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34 (\u201cChapter 91 request\u201d). Plaintiffs contend that good cause should have excused their failure. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:4-34, on September 12, 1997, Wildwood Crest\u2019s tax assessor mailed via certified mail a form entitled \u201cAnnual Statement of Income and Expense for 1997\u201d to plaintiffs and indicated that the form \u201cmust be completed and returned on or before October 27, 1997.\u201d Because the statute was last amended by <em>L. </em>1979, c. 91, effective May 16, 1979, such an information request is referred to as a \u201cChapter 91 request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34 provides, in pertinent part, that if an owner of real property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">[S]hall fail or refuse to respond to the written request of the assessor within 45 days of such request .. the assessor shall value his property at such amount as he may, from any information in his possession or available to him, reasonably determine to be the full and fair value thereof. No appeal shall be heard from the assessor\u2019s valuation and assessment with respect to income-producing property where the owner has failed or refused to respond to such written request for information within 45 days of such request . . The county board of taxation may impose such terms and conditions for furnishing the requested information where it appears that the owner, for good cause shown, could not furnish the information within the required period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">[N.J.S.A. 54:4-34.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Plaintiffs received the Chapter 91 request on September 13, 1997, but did not respond in any way from September 13 through October 27, 1997. In fact, plaintiffs did not make any contact with the assessor until February 9, 1998, when Jacqueline Morey\u2019s brother went to the assessor\u2019s office and asked for a second copy of the Chapter 91 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>On February 12,1998, the assessor finally received the completed 1997 Annual Statement for the Pan American Hotel. On April 1, 1998, plaintiffs filed them complaint contesting the hotel\u2019s 1998 assessed valuation of $4,378,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">On May 27, 1998, Wildwood Crest moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, claiming that plaintiffs failed to comply with the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34. The Borough also sought an order precluding plaintiffs from introducing any income information and limiting plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to a \u201creasonableness hearing\u201d as permitted under <em>Ocean Pines, Ltd. v. Borough of Point Pleasant, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>1, 547 A.2d 691 (1988). Such an\u2019inquiry focuses on whether the assessor\u2019s valuation was reasonable, given the data available at the time of the evaluation, and the methodology used by the assessor. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 547 A.2d 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">On July 7, 1998, plaintiff Jacqueline Morey filed a certification in opposition to the Borough\u2019s motion in which she certified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">1. I am the owner of the Pan American Hotel which is commonly known as: Block: 26.04, Lot: 1, in Wildwood Crest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">2. In March, 1996,1 was diagnosed with ALS commonly known as \u201cLou Gehrig\u2019s\u201d disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">3. In the fall of 1997, at or about the time the tax assessor allegedly served the initial Chapter 91 request form, my husband\u2019s health also began to fail from his diagnosis with pulmonary fibrosis. In November, 1997, his health declined further and he subsequently died on January 22,1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">4. During the time between the fall of 1997, and my husband\u2019s death, my time was consumed with both his and my own health problems. As a result, we were unable to answer the tax assessor\u2019s Chapter 91 request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">At oral argument, plaintiffs argued that good cause for their delay in responding was clearly present. Judge Axelrad, however, questioned why Mrs. Morey\u2019s brother could not have responded on behalf of plaintiffs from September 13 through October 27, 1997. She also noted that Mrs. Morey\u2019s certification does not say \u201cI was unable to write a letter to the assessor telling the assessor we couldn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">Judge Axelrad found two decisions by Judge Kuskin persuasive and \u201cconcluded that there was a two-step analytical framework for deciding motions to dismiss under Chapter 91.\u201d According to the decisions Judge Axelrad relied upon, if the taxpayer did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>respond at all within forty-five days of the assessor\u2019s request, then the failure constitutes a -waiver of the taxpayer\u2019s right to appeal the assessor\u2019s valuation. <em>TMC Properties v. Wharton Borough, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax </em>155, 463 (Tax 1996); <em>Hastings Plaza v. Washington Tp., </em>17 <em>N.J.Tax </em>165, 169 (Tax 1998). Judge Axelrad indicated that because plaintiffs made no response whatsoever within the forty-five day time period, she would not reach the issue of good cause. She, therefore, limited plaintiffs\u2019 hearing to the reasonableness of the assessor\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">On August 12, 1998, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel moved for reconsideration and raised two arguments. First, he again asserted that his clients had good cause for failing to answer the Chapter 91 request. He also indicated that he had just learned that Jacqueline Morey had passed away sometime during the summer. Second, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel argued, for the first time, that the assessor\u2019s request was defective and, therefore, under <em>Cassini v. City of Orange, </em>16 <em>N.J.Tax. </em>438, 449-50 (Tax 1997), plaintiffs did not have to respond to the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Judge Axelrad indicated that because the <em>Cassini </em>issue had not been raised in opposition to the earlier motion, she would not address this argument. And, after she denied reconsideration, she conducted a reasonableness hearing and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint because she believed the assessment was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Plaintiffs vigorously argue that we must overrule the two Judge Kuskin decisions that Judge Axelrad relied upon. Plaintiffs assert that, given their extraordinary illnesses, the tax court erred by not considering whether plaintiffs had established good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">We decline to overrule <em>TMC Properties </em>and <em>Hastings Plaza. </em>And, we need not construe the Chapter 91 good cause provision because we conclude that even if the taxpayers\u2019 personal situation during the forty-five day period were relevant, plaintiffs could not establish good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">The Supreme Court perceived the Chapter 91 statutory purpose as assisting assessors by providing timely and sufficient information so the assessor can make an assessment without unnecessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>time and effort expended in litigation. <em>Ocean Pines, Ltd., supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 7, 547 A.2d 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">We recently recognized the importance of assessors receiving timely information from taxpayers. Judge Kestin, wilting for the court, noted that the Legislature has imposed \u201cas the cost of noncompliance, waiver of the right to appeal a valuation and assessment arrived at by the assessor in an exercise of his or her best judgment in the absence of the information required, which is, after all, in the possession and control of the property owner.\u201d <em>Cascade Corp. v. Township of Middle, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>184, 190, 732 A.2d 564 (App.Div.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In <em>Ocean Pines, </em>the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[i]t is apparent from the record that plaintiff made no attempt within the forty-five day period to explain to the assessor why it could not comply with the request. Instead, plaintiff simply chose to ignore the notice.\u201d <em>Ocean Pines, Ltd., supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 8, 547 A.2d 691. So too here. While plaintiffs, in this case, claim they were unable to answer the Chapter 91 request because of their serious illnesses, they continued to run their four million dollar business. Furthermore, as Judge Axelrad noted, how difficult would it have been to call the assessor and explain the problem? Or, why was Mrs. Morey unable to contact her brother earlier?</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In short, even when we consider the taxpayers\u2019 condition during the forty-five day period, the evidence does not reflect an inability to respond in any fashion. Given the legislative recognition of the importance to the assessor of timely information, total avoidance of the request during the forty-five day period, even under the facts of this case, cannot be good cause. The taxpayer cannot \u201caltogether ignore\u201d the assessor\u2019s request. <em>Tower Center </em>Associates <em>v. Township of East Brunswick, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>433, 438, 669 A.2d 829 (App.Div.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Finally, we do not believe that Judge Axelrad abused her discretion in declining to consider plaintiffs\u2019 argument on reconsideration that the assessor\u2019s request was invalid because it sought annual data before the year had ended. <em>Cassini v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Orange, supra, </em>16 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 438. Generally, counsel should use reconsideration motions to acquaint the court with controlling decisions counsel believes the court has overlooked or on which it has erred. <em>R. </em>l:7-4(b). When new information is provided on reconsideration, the court generally will hear this information when the new or additional information could not have been provided on the first application. <em>D\u2019Atria v. D Atria, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>392, 401, 576 A.2d 957 (Ch.Div.1990). Because plaintiffs \u201coverlooked\u201d this matter, Judge Axelrad was within her discretion in declining to consider this claim. <em>Cummings v. Bahr, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>374, 384, 685 A.2d 60 (App.Div.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
