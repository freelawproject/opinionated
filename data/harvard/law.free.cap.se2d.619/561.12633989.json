On 1 May 2002, DSS filed petitions alleging that the children were not receiving proper care and were living in an environment injurious to their welfare. At the 3 June 2002 adjudication hearing, the district court, in part, found the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   6. Although the mother of the children is in need of psychiatric counseling, she has failed to secure same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   7. The environment in which the children have been living is one characterized by violence and lack of proper supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   8. The Wilkes County Department of Social Services has utilized reasonable efforts to eliminate the need for placement of the children, including encouraging the parents to maintain a clean home, securing mental health assistance for the parents, finding a safe environment for the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court also found that the family had a history of domestic violence, including threats to harm the children, and that the children were filthy and living in extremely dirty conditions. Based on these findings the district court adjudicated the children\n   neglected as defined by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-101(15). According to the record, the district court \"entered\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the order in open court on the \"2nd day of June, 2002\"; however, the hearing was on the 3rd of June. Also, the order was signed \"this 12 day of September, 2003,\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc,\n   </em>\n   June 2, 2002,\" and filed on 16 September 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 10 February 2003, the district court conducted a permanency planning hearing. It found that the children would best be served by a permanent plan of adoption and ordered the Wilkes County Department of Social Services (DSS) to cease reunification efforts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court also ordered that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [w]ithin sixty (60) days from the date of this Order, the Wilkes County Department of Social Services shall institute a termination of parental rights action with regard to the parents and shall pursue the completion of such termination of parental rights proceeding. If such termination of parental rights proceeding results in the termination of the children's parents' rights, the Department of Social Services shall then pursue adoption of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court's order was \"entered\" in open court on 10 February, signed the 20th day of February, and filed the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Notably though, DSS failed to initiate a termination of parental rights proceeding within sixty days. In fact, on 18 August 2003, the district court, during a mandated review hearing, again directed DSS to file the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court has heretofore approved a permanent plan of adoption for the children, and has directed that [DSS] institute a termination of parental rights proceeding in order to help accomplish the plan of adoption. For reasons unexplained, this has not yet been done. The Court admonished the attorney for [DSS] to make haste in following through with the prior direction of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although finding no reason for the delay in institution of termination proceedings, the district court gave DSS an additional ten days \"from the filing of this Order\" to comply. The order was filed on 5 September 2003. On 29 September 2003, twenty-four days after the second district court's order and over seven months after the first order, DSS filed a petition for termination of parental rights. Respondent argues that the five-month delay by DSS in filing for termination of parental rights prejudiced her case and is therefore reversible error. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The statutory time limitation at issue here is N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-907(e) (2003), which mandates that DSS \"file a petition to terminate parental rights within 60 calendar days from the date of the permanency planning hearing\" if termination is \"necessary in order to perfect the permanent plan for the juvenile[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The General Assembly has placed this burden on DSS \"unless the court makes written findings why the petition cannot be filed within 60 days,\" in which case DSS would comply with the time frame mandated by the district court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The permanency planning hearing here, in which adoption was identified as the permanent plan, occurred on 10 February 2003. According to the statute then, DSS should have filed its petition to terminate respondent's\n   parental rights on or before 10 April 2003. But DSS did not file the necessary petition until 29 September 2003. Thus, DSS violated the statutory framework which required it to file a petition for termination of respondent's parental rights within sixty days of the permanency planning hearing. Moreover, DSS violated the district court's order demanding the same conduct of them. Then, after admonishment from the district court and a new deadline set, DSS still failed to comply, violating a second order of the court. These violations are clear error and we must now assess whether prejudice has been shown to the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Whether a party has adequately shown prejudice is always resolved on a case-by-case basis; however, determining prejudice is not a rubric by which this Court vacates or reverses an order when, in our opinion, the order is not in the child's best interest. Nor is prejudice, if clearly shown by a party, something to ignore solely because the remedy of reversal further exacerbates the delay. If we were to operate as such, we would either reduce the General Assembly's time lines to a nullity,\n   <em>\n    see In re L.E.B.,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C.App. ___, ___,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=610%20S.E.2d%20424\">\n    610 S.E.2d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 428 (Timmons-Goodson, J., concurring) (stressing that reversal was necessary to restore the effectiveness of the General Assembly's mandates),\n   <em>\n    disc. review denied,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3798082,3795365,3797350,3794823,3804744,3796621,3795799\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/359/632/\">\n    359 N.C. 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633576,12633575\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/616/538/\">\n    616 S.E.2d 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005); or worse, escalate violations of them beyond the reason for their existence: the best interests of the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-906(d). The \"unusual circumstances\" of the case had both respondent and DSS arguing prejudice from the delayed order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633568\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/616/392/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633568\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/616/392/\">\n    616 S.E.2d at 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After extensive discussion on the issue, we concluded that \"the circumstances of this case demonstrate prejudice to L.L., the parents, [DSS], and the statutorily-mandated permanency planning process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633568\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/616/392/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Thus, it is apparent that prejudice can manifest itself in many forms and can equally befall parties other than the respondent, but it must nonetheless be appropriately articulated. Here, respondent has argued prejudice; however, we cannot agree that any befell her from DSS's delay. And without any additional information regarding the best interests of the children, typically expressed by a guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem,\n   </em>\n   we can ultimately find no prejudice in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Respondent failed to attend the 23 March 2004 hearing on termination of her parental rights. This failure was after the court granted a continuance due to the fact that respondent had not communicated with her attorney before the previously scheduled 18 February 2004 hearing on termination. Respondent does not assert that if DSS timely filed its petition (and a hearing was scheduled reasonably close to the ninety-day deadline), she would have attended. In fact, respondent was barely involved with her children once the permanency plan changed to adoption. Thus, despite respondent's assertions to the contrary, we cannot agree that she was prejudiced by any delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It is abundantly clear that despite the General Assembly's mandate that termination proceedings begin within sixty days of the permanency hearing, and in contravention of two court orders requiring termination, along with knowledge from the children's foster parents that they would adopt the children, DSS inexplicably delayed the custody and termination process by five months. Yet, without any input at the appellate level from the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem,\n   </em>\n   we are left with only speculation regarding potential prejudice to the children and foster parents in this case and whether the delay contravened the best interest of the children. A.L.G. and A.R.G. resided with their maternal aunt and uncle in foster care since the time when DSS first obtained custody of them. From that point until the termination order was filed, nearly two years passed by. The record also indicates that since first being placed in their care, the children's aunt and uncle had committed to DSS that they would adopt the children.

Here, DSS recommended counseling as part of respondent's family plan, and no significant evidence exists in the record that would suggest respondent's parental rights were terminated due to any mental illness or substance abuse.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(1) and (2) (2003).

Essentially, she argues that her actions or omissions in parenting that led to the district court's finding two grounds on which to terminate her rights, can all be accounted for by her poverty. Several examples of this interconnectedness cited by respondent are\n   her failure to obtain psychological evaluations or attend counseling, and her inability to leave a working phone number where she could be contacted. We see no connection between respondent's failure to abide by the district court's orders and her impoverished state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Respondent also argues, when rebutting the findings and conclusions of neglect, that the allegations reflect her mental illness and she should have had a guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem.\n   </em>\n   We have already determined this was not the case and find no support for this argument either. Thus, without more from respondent, we find that the evidence supports the trial court's findings and those findings support its conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We further conclude that since at least one ground was proven to terminate respondent's parental rights, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that termination was in the children's best interest.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 569,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=471%20S.E.2d%2084\">\n    471 S.E.2d at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re D.J.D.,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C.App. at ___, 615 S.E.2d at 32.
