Based on defendant's stipulation, the court found defendant guilty of habitual driving while impaired and found him a prior record level II for purposes of sentencing. The court then consolidated the charges and sentenced defendant to 19 to 23 months in prison. Defendant appeals. For the reasons discussed below, we find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The evidence tended to show that, on the afternoon of 7 November 2003, Trooper Gary Fox saw defendant driving a pickup truck on Brices Creek Road. As Trooper Fox followed, defendant's truck crossed the center line several times, once running off the left side of the road. Trooper Fox pulled defendant over, and found his movements sluggish and his speech slurred, but did not smell alcohol on defendant. When Trooper Fox asked defendant what was wrong, defendant replied that he was on his way home from the dentist and was on a pain medication called Floricet. Based on his observations and defendant's statement, Trooper Fox arrested defendant and took him to the Craven County Sheriff's Department. Trooper Fox did not administer an Intoxilyzer or blood test to defendant. Kevin Popkin, an expert in pharmaceuticals, testified about the impairing effects of Floricet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant first argues that the court erred in allowing defendant's uncorroborated statements into evidence to prove an element of the charges against him. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant contends that the court erred in denying his motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude the statements he made to Trooper Fox about taking Floricet because they were contradictory and uncorroborated. Defendant did not object to this evidence at trial. Our Courts have long held that \"a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   is not sufficient to preserve for appeal the question of admissibility of evidence if the defendant does not object to that evidence at the time it is offered at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Roache,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2987693\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/358/243/#p292\">\n    358 N.C. 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20S.E.2d%20381\">\n    595 S.E.2d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 413 (2004). The General Assembly attempted to change this law by amending Rule 103(a) of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence to provide: \"Once the court makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting or excluding evidence, either at or before trial, a party need not renew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 103(a)(2) (2004). This amendment applies to the case before us. 2003 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 101 (stating that the amendment applies to rulings made on or after 1 October 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This Court has recently held that \"to the extent that N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 103(a)(2) is inconsistent with N.C. R.App. P. 10(b)(1), it must fail.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

N.C.

R.App. P. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant asserts that the admission of his statements to Trooper Fox that he had been given pain medication at his dentist office violates the\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   rule. This rule \"requires that there be corroborative evidence, independent of the defendant's confession,\n   which tends to prove the commission of the crime charged.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Supreme Court went on to state that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   independent evidence of the\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   . . . does not equate with independent evidence as to each essential element of the offense charged. Applying the more traditional definition of\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti,\n   </em>\n   the requirement for corroborative evidence would be met if that evidence tended to establish the essential harm, and it would not be fatal to the State's case if some elements of the crime were proved solely by the defendant's confession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 232,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=337%20S.E.2d%20487\">\n    337 S.E.2d at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, testimony from Mr. Popkin about the effects of Floricet and from Trooper Fox about defendant's behavior corroborate defendant's statement about consuming Floricet. Thus, we overrule this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant next assigns error to the court's failure to bifurcate defendant's trial. Defendant acknowledges that under current law, because habitual DWI is a substantive offense for which predicate convictions are an element which must be proven at trial, habitual DWI cases are not bifurcated as habitual felon cases are.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant stipulated to prior DWI convictions pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-928(c) (2004). \"The purpose of this procedure is to afford the defendant an opportunity to admit the prior convictions which are an element of the offense and prevent the State from presenting evidence of these convictions before the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Burch,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8956363\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/160/394/#p396\">\n    160 N.C.App. at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20461\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant contends, however, that the current law prejudices him and violates his constitutional rights. Defendant did not challenge the constitutionality of N.C.

Contradictions and discrepancies do not warrant dismissal of the case but are for the jury to resolve. The test for sufficiency of the evidence is the same whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial or both. Circumstantial evidence may withstand a motion to dismiss and support a conviction even when the evidence does not rule out every hypothesis of innocence. If the evidence presented is circumstantial, the court must consider whether a reasonable inference of defendant's guilt may be drawn from the circumstances. Once the court decides that a reasonable inference of defendant's guilt may be drawn from the circumstances, then it is for the jury to decide whether the facts, taken singly or in combination, satisfy [it] beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is actually guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    State v.
