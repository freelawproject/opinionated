We vacate and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   D.B. and her husband are the adoptive parents of A.L. At an early age A.L. was removed from the home of her biological parents by the Buncombe County Department of Social Services because she had been severely neglected and abused. A.L. was placed in the foster care of D.B. and her husband and then later, in 1999, adopted as a special needs child. Because A.L. is a special needs child, she is eligible for Medicaid coverage until she is at least 21. Since the time A.L. was adopted by D.B. and her husband, A.L.'s care has been coordinated, paid for, and provided by Blue Ridge Center (BRC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Due to the abuse suffered by A.L. in her early childhood, she has been diagnosed with numerous medical conditions including rage disorder, borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. At times A.L. experienced violent rages and attempted to injure herself and others, including her family. A.L.'s physicians determined that she needs crisis intervention and stabilization services in order to help with her dangerous rages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before 2000, under the supervision of Dr. Kim Masters, crisis intervention and stabilization services were provided by Charter Psychiatric Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina. When this treatment was being provided to A.L., her condition gradually improved and there was a time period in which A.L. was not required to be placed outside of the home for treatment. However, Charter closed in February 2000. Mission-St. Joseph's, the hospital located closest to A.L.'s\n   home, does not offer services any less restrictive than full psychiatric commitment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On several occasions after the closing of Charter, A.L. again began to have rage outbursts that escalated out of control. On two occasions, A.L. experienced severe episodes of rage, and D.B. contacted BRC's triage line to request services to stabilize A.L. On both occasions, D.B. was informed that the only crisis service available was to find a magistrate, obtain a commitment order, then call the police who would take A.L. to the local emergency room for possible involuntary commitment. D.B. did not think this course of action was appropriate and believed that it was harmful to A.L.'s overall health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Due to repeated denials of crisis intervention and stabilization services requested by D.B. for A.L., D.B. filed a grievance with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services (DMH). In her grievance, D.B. requested in-home emergency after-hours crisis service and therapeutic foster bed service. BRC denied D.B.'s request on 9 October 2000 stating,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Blue Ridge Center's after hours emergency service is provided via telephone and on-site at Mission-St. Joseph's Emergency Room. Blue Ridge Center presently has no crisis therapeutic foster bed providers. We continually seek such providers including providers in our own therapeutic foster care program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After receiving this denial, D.B. filed a petition for a contested case hearing in the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) on 6 December 2000. A hearing was held before Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) James L. Connor, II, where evidence was heard as to the denial of requested relief, medical diagnosis of A.L., prescribed treatment and framework for the provision of Medicaid services to children. The ALJ issued a recommended decision on 19 May 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the hearing before the ALJ, D.B. offered statements from a Dr. Masters, one of A.L.'s treating physicians, to show that in her opinion A.L. needed 24 hours a day and 7 days a week crisis and community based wrap-around services. Another treating physician, Dr. Patrick Lilliard, also testified as to the need for crisis intervention and stabilization services. When asked directly whether, in his clinical opinion, the provision of effective crisis intervention and stabilization services were medically necessary for A.L., Dr. Lilliard answered that the absence of such services put A.L. at risk and that they were essential to her psychiatric care. He declined to state that the requested services were medically necessary. Dr. Munger, a non-treating physician, testified that \"crisis stabilization\" was a medical necessity for A.L. but that he did not believe that it was medically necessary that the initial intervention occur in A.L.'s home. The ALJ concluded that the requested crisis intervention and stabilization services had been proven by a preponderance of the evidence to be medically necessary. In the ALJ's recommended decision, he recommended that the denial for the requested services be reversed and that BRC and DMH\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   provide to A.L. 24 hour per day, 7 day per week crisis intervention and stabilization services in a form consistent with the direction of her treating physicians. This need not include having a therapeutic foster bed always empty and available for A.L., but should include a sufficient number of such beds, given the population who need them, so as to make such beds usually available when needed. To the extent A.L. is living at home with D.[B.], these services should also include the 24/7 availability of a properly trained person to come to A.L.'s home during severe crises for therapeutically appropriate interventions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   DMH and BRC filed exceptions and objections to the ALJ's recommended decision on 15 August 2003. In its final agency decision, the agency declined to adopt the entire recommended decision of the ALJ. The final agency decision stated,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [i]t is recommended that a comprehensive person centered plan be developed that includes a 24/7 crisis plan among other identified treatment and supports. This plan should identify the desired outcomes for A.L.['s] health, safety and well being in order to meet the mental needs identified\n   by a comprehensive assessment. These services should be covered by EPDST.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   However, the agency's final decision failed to state its reasons for refusing to accept the recommended decision of the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   D.B. then filed a petition for judicial review on 14 November 2003 in Buncombe County Superior Court. The superior court vacated the final agency decision, concluded as a matter of law that the requested Medicaid relief was not medically necessary, and reinstated the original denial of relief by BRC. From the superior court's order, D.B. now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On appeal D.B. contends,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that the superior court exceeded its authority under the pre-2001 version of the Administrative Procedure Act, which is applicable in the instant case. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We note that, although the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) has been amended to make new procedures and standards applicable, the amendments only apply to cases commenced on or after January 2001. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-51 (2003). Because the present case was commenced with a December 2000 filing in the OAH, the procedures and standards afforded in the pre-2001 statute apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When under the applicable version of the APA a petition for review of an agency decision is filed in superior court, the superior court acts as an appellate court; both this court and the superior court must utilize the same standard of review.\n   <em>\n    See Teague v.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-51(a) before undertaking a substantive review of the agency's decision. Further, upon making its substantive review of the final agency decision, the superior court improperly entered an order containing new findings of fact.\n   <em>\n    See N.C.

Thus, the ALJ who conducts a contested case hearing possesses those `institutional advantages,' that make it appropriate for a reviewing court to defer to his or her findings of fact.\") (citations omitted). Moreover, the superior court's order fails to indicate that it employed the \"whole record\" test in reviewing the final agency decision. The trial court's actions may be unproblematic under the amended APA; however, the superior court was bound by the pre-2001 APA in the present case. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-51 (2003) (In the event that the agency does not adopt the recommended decision of the ALJ, the court must review the official record\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law, giving no deference to prior decisions made in the case and unbound by the findings of fact and conclusions of law made in the final agency decision.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the instant case, there were conflicting views between the physicians who testified whether A.L.'s requested crisis intervention and stabilization services were medically necessary. Some of the testifying physicians opined that the requested services were medically necessary, while others thought of these services as merely medically desirable. On these facts, the ALJ found by a preponderance of the evidence that the Medicaid services requested for A.L. were medically necessary and therefore made a recommended decision that A.L. be provided with crisis intervention and stabilization services in accordance with the recommendations of her treating physicians. In making its final decision, the agency decided not to adopt the recommended decision of the ALJ, but it failed to state the specific reasons for this course of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We note that, given the breadth of medical opinions offered which constitutes substantial evidence, the final agency decision would be affirmed under the whole record test if the agency had stated appropriate reasons for rejecting the ALJ's decision.\n   <em>\n    See In re Broad and Gales Creek Community Association,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8561043\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/300/267/#p282\">\n    300 N.C. 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 282-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=266%20S.E.2d%20645\">\n    266 S.E.2d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 656 (1980) (holding that, where the case is one of conflicting views, the court is not permitted to replace the agency's view with views of its own where the reasons for adopting this view, in light of the whole record, appear to be implicit in the order). However, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-51 (1999) dictates the precise procedural steps that must be followed by appellate courts. The superior court, acting as an appellate court, did not follow these standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   N.C.

In the absence of such stated reasons, the courts cannot \"reasonably determine from the record whether the petitioner's asserted grounds for challenging the [substance of the] agency's final decision warrant reversal or modification of that decision under the applicable provisions of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 150B-51(b).\"\n   <em>\n    N.C.
