Hannett is the duly elected Commonwealth's Attorney for the County of Floyd. His term of office will expire on December 31, 2007. Hannett is also a member of the United States Army Reserves. In February 2005, Hannett informed the Honorable Ray W. Grubbs, judge of the Circuit Court of Floyd County, that Hannett had been activated for military service in Iraq. Hannett's unit was scheduled to be mobilized into active service on May 8, 2005. Hannett informed Judge Grubbs that Hannett would deploy with his unit in Iraq unless the United States Army granted him a waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsequently, in support of Hannett's request for a waiver, Judge Grubbs forwarded a letter to the United States Army. Judge Grubbs stated in the letter:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"As Judge of the Circuit Court in Floyd County, Virginia, I am confronted with a perplexing situation with the call-up of Gordon E. Hannett, the Commonwealth's Attorney for said County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Mr. Hannett is the sole attorney in that office, which is the chief law enforcement office for the county.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"He prosecutes cases on behalf of the Commonwealth and Floyd County in three (3) separate courts, Circuit Court, General District and Juvenile and Domestic Relations. In all, Mr. Hannett represented the state and county in many of the cases as shown [on an attachment to this letter]. Obviously, his services are vital for the welfare of the Floyd County community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Please consider our precarious situation in evaluating Mr. Hannett's call-up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Sincerely yours,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Ray W. Grubbs\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The United States Army denied Hannett's request for a waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In April 2005, Hannett informed Judge Grubbs that Hannett planned to seek approval from the State Compensation Board to fund a part-time temporary position of assistant Commonwealth's Attorney. Hannett intended to perform the duties of the office of Commonwealth's Attorney while deployed in Iraq with the assistance of the temporary part-time assistant Commonwealth's Attorney. The Compensation Board authorized funding for the part-time temporary position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hannett and Judge Grubbs met on April 29, 2005, and Hannett told Judge Grubbs that the Compensation Board had approved funding for the part-time temporary assistant Commonwealth's Attorney position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Judge Grubbs suggested that Hannett hire an attorney who practiced law in Floyd County to serve as the temporary assistant Commonwealth's Attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Judge Grubbs and Hannett met again on May 3, 2005. During this meeting, Judge Grubbs provided Hannett with the names of three attorneys in Floyd County who would be willing to serve in the temporary position. According to Hannett, Judge Grubbs stated during the meeting that if Hannett failed to hire one of these attorneys, Judge Grubbs would appoint one of them to serve as the Commonwealth's Attorney during the period of Hannett's deployment. Later that day, Hannett informed Judge Grubbs that Hannett did not intend to resign from the office of Commonwealth's Attorney and, therefore, Hannett did not believe that the circuit court had the authority to appoint someone who would act during his deployment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Judge Grubbs and Hannett conversed by telephone on May 5, 2005. During the conversation, Judge Grubbs asked Hannett which of the three lawyers Hannett intended to hire to fill the temporary position. Hannett informed Judge Grubbs that Hannett had not made a decision. Judge Grubbs responded that he was compelled to appoint a lawyer who would serve as the temporary Commonwealth's Attorney. Later that afternoon, Hannett hired Dennis E. Nagle, a lawyer who has practiced in the City of Roanoke and Montgomery County and who is a member in good standing of the Virginia State Bar, as a temporary assistant Commonwealth's Attorney for the County of Floyd. Nagle executed the required oath of office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 5, 2005, about 5:25 p.m., Judge Grubbs, without notice to Hannett, convened the Circuit Court of Floyd County. Below is a transcript of that proceeding:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"This is the matter of the interim appointment of acting Commonwealth's Attorney, pursuant to section 19.2-156 of the 1950 Code of Virginia. The Court, on its own motion, is making an appointment for the interim Commonwealth's Attorney, and the reasons therefore are as follows: The Court has been advised by Mr. Hannett that he has been called to active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States for a period of eighteen months. That service is to be performed in Indiana for approximately three months, followed by deployment to Iraq. Consequently, Mr. Hannett will be outside the boundaries of the Commonwealth during the eighteen month period. In said office there is no chief deputy, and there is no other attorney employee. To fully perform the functions of the Commonwealth's Attorney's office in this county, as has traditionally been accomplished, it is required and necessary that a resident attorney be appointed for this interim period. The Court on its own motion is appointing Stephanie Murray-Shortt to be the acting Commonwealth's Attorney during the absence of Mr. Hannett, commencing at midnight May 8th, 2005, and terminating upon the return of Mr. Hannett to this office. An Order to that effect is entered this date, with copies to be served as directed in the Order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Judge Grubbs entered the following order that is the subject of this proceeding:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"This day came the Court on its motion, for the reasons stated of record, pursuant to the call to active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States of The Honorable Gordon E. Hannett, Attorney for Commonwealth in Floyd County, Virginia, said deployment commencing on 8 May, 2005, for an extended period of eighteen (18) months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"It appearing to the Court, pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-156 of the 1950 Code of Virginia, the prolonged absence requires the appointment of an attorney-at-law as acting attorney for the Commonwealth to serve for such length of time as may be necessary. Such acting attorney-at-law shall serve in the place of and otherwise perform the duties and exercise the powers of such regular attorney for the Commonwealth and while so acting, shall receive the salary and allowance for expenses fixed by the State Compensation Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"It is, therefore, ORDERED that Stephanie Murray-Shortt be, and she hereby is, appointed by this Court to serve in the place of The Honorable Gordon E. Hannett for such period of time as may be\n   necessary, commencing at midnight May 8, 2005, and terminating upon the return of The Honorable Gordon E. Hannett.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"The Clerk is directed to serve certified copies of this order to The Honorable Gordon E. Hannett, Commonwealth's Attorney, Stephanie Murray-Shortt, and mail a certified copy to Bruce W. Haynes, Executive Director, State Compensation Board, P.O. Box 710, Richmond, Virginia, 23218-0710. Further, the Clerk is also directed to mail certified copies of this Order to the Judges of the Twenty-Seventh Judicial Circuit and to The Honorable Edward Turner, Judge of the General District Court of Floyd County, and The Honorable James Tompkins, Judge of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court of Floyd County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"ENTER: May 5, 2005\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Ray W. Grubbs, Chief Judge\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The remaining judges of the 27th Judicial Circuit concurred with Judge Grubbs' decision to appoint a temporary attorney for the Commonwealth under Code \u00a7 19.2-156.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Subsequently, Hannett filed a \"petition for writ of mandamus, or prohibition (or both)\" in this Court. Hannett requests, among other things, that this Court enter an order that allows him to perform the duties of Commonwealth's Attorney for Floyd County while he is deployed on active duty with the United States Army.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Code \u00a7 19.2-156 states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"If it shall be necessary for the attorney for the Commonwealth of any county or city to absent himself for a prolonged period of time from the performance of the duties of his office, then, upon notification by such attorney for the Commonwealth, or by the court on its own motion, and the facts being entered of record, the judge of the circuit court shall appoint an attorney-at-law as acting attorney for the Commonwealth to serve for such length of time as may be necessary. Such acting attorney for the Commonwealth shall act in place of and otherwise perform the duties and exercise the powers of such regular attorney for the Commonwealth, and while so acting shall receive the salary and allowance for expenses fixed by the State Compensation Board for such regular attorney for the Commonwealth, who during such length of time shall not receive any such salary or allowance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Code \u00a7 2.2-2802 provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"No state, county or municipal officer or employee shall forfeit his title to office or position or vacate the same by reason of either engaging in the war service of the United States when called forth by the Governor pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 44-75.1, or when called to active duty in the armed forces of the United States. Any such officer or employee who, voluntarily or otherwise, enters upon such war service or is called to service may notify the officer or body authorized by law to fill vacancies in his office, of such fact, and thereupon be relieved from the duties of his office or position during the period of such service. The officer or body authorized to fill vacancies shall designate some suitable person to perform the duties of such office as acting officer during the period the regular officer is engaged in such service, and during such period the acting officer shall be vested with all the powers, authority, rights and duties of the regular officer for whom he is acting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Counsel for Judge Grubbs asserts that Hannett may not invoke this Court's original jurisdiction because he may not use a writ of mandamus to challenge the circuit court's conclusion that the Commonwealth's Attorney will be absent from the performance of the duties of his office during the period that he will be on active duty in the United States Army. Continuing, counsel for Judge Grubbs asserts that the circuit court's exercise of its authority under Code \u00a7 19.2-156 is discretionary and, thus, mandamus is an inappropriate remedy. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The basis of Hannett's petition for writ of mandamus is that he believes he has been wrongfully deprived of the office of\n   Commonwealth's Attorney of Floyd County. Clearly, mandamus is the appropriate remedy. Indeed, for over 200 years, courts in this Commonwealth have held that the writ of mandamus is a proper remedy to restore a public officer who has been unlawfully removed or deprived of that office.\n   <em>\n    In re: Joseph D.

Additionally, Hannett asserts that even if Code \u00a7 19.2-156 is applicable, the circuit court failed to make the requisite findings that Hannett will be unable to continue in the performance of the duties of his office. We disagree with Hannett's contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In Virginia, courts are required to apply the plain meaning of statutes, and this Court is not free to add language, or ignore language, contained in statutes.\n   <em>\n    SIGNAL Corp. v.

Read in this context, Code \u00a7 19.2-156 is the controlling statute in the case at bar, not Code \u00a7 2.2-2802.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Contrary to the assertions of both litigants, Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-2802 and 19.2-156 are not inconsistent. Rather, the two separate and distinct statutes govern different circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Code \u00a7 2.2-2800 provides that individuals cannot simultaneously serve as officers or employees of the federal government and of the Commonwealth of Virginia. If a Virginia officer or employee accepts a position with \"any emolument whatever\" from the federal government, then that officer or employee \"ipso facto\" vacates his office or position with the Commonwealth. Code \u00a7 2.2-2802, among other things, creates an exception to this \"ipso facto\" loss of office or position for Virginia officers or employees who are called into active service. Code \u00a7 2.2-2802 provides that such officer or employee \"shall not forfeit his title to office or position or vacate the same\" by reason of active service in the United States Armed Forces. Thus, pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-2802, Hannett did not forfeit or vacate the office of Commonwealth's Attorney \"ipso facto\" when he began to serve on active duty in the United States Armed Forces. Furthermore, Code \u00a7 2.2-2802 anticipates the appointment of a person to perform the duties of the office of attorney for the Commonwealth in an \"acting capacity.\" This statutory authorization to perform such duties of office in an\n   acting capacity does not cause a forfeiture or create a vacancy in that office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The General Assembly in Code \u00a7 19.2-156 specifically prescribed a procedure for the temporary appointment of an attorney for the Commonwealth when the attorney for the Commonwealth was absent for a prolonged period of time from the performance of the duties of the office. Because Code \u00a7 2.2-2802 and Code \u00a7 19.2-156 are not inconsistent, we need not apply rules of statutory construction reconciling the two statutes. In any event, Code \u00a7 19.2-156 would be the applicable statute because it deals specifically with the office of Commonwealth's Attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Code \u00a7 2.2-2802 states in part that \"[n]o state, county or municipal officer or employee shall\n   <em>\n    forfeit\n   </em>\n   his title to office or position or\n   <em>\n    vacate\n   </em>\n   the same by reason of either engaging in the war service of the United States . . . or when called to the active duty in the armed forces of the United States.\" (Emphasis added). Contrary to Hannett's assertions, he was not required to forfeit or vacate his office in violation of this statutory provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The word \"forfeit\" means \"to lose or lose the right to by some error, fault, offense, or crime: alienate the right to possess by some neglect . . . .\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 891 (1993). A public official who has forfeited title to the office lacks the authority to perform the duties of that office during the term of office.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Shell v. Cousins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4387879\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/77/328/#p332\">\n    77 Va. 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332 (1883) (sheriff who forfeited office created a vacancy in that office);\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

The order entered by the circuit court did not result in a forfeiture of the office of the Commonwealth's Attorney of Floyd County because Hannett will be able to resume the duties of Commonwealth's Attorney upon the conclusion of his active duty with the United States Army.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The circuit court similarly did not decree that Hannett had vacated the office of Commonwealth's Attorney of Floyd County. Hannett remains the Commonwealth's Attorney of Floyd County. He is the incumbent who possesses the title to the office of Commonwealth's Attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Murray-Shortt, who has been appointed as the \"acting attorney\" for the Commonwealth for Floyd County, is not the incumbent of that office. Her temporary authority to exercise the powers and discharge the duties of the office will abate when Hannett ends his prolonged absence on military duty and returns to Floyd County to resume his duties as the Commonwealth's Attorney. Simply stated, Murray-Shortt, the acting Commonwealth's Attorney, will be divested of all authority to perform the duties of that office upon the cessation of Hannett's prolonged \"period of time [absent] from the performance of the duties of his office.\" While Murray-Shortt is temporarily vested with the duties of the office of Commonwealth's Attorney under Code \u00a7 19.2-156 and the circuit court's order, she is not and could not be vested in the title of that office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Hannett's status as the Commonwealth's Attorney for Floyd County and Murray-Shortt's status as the temporary acting attorney for the Commonwealth are illustrated by the consequences that would ensue if either Hannett or Murray-Shortt resigned. If Murray-Shortt resigned, the office of Commonwealth's Attorney would not be vacant, and the circuit court, acting pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-156, would enter an order that appointed a lawyer to discharge the duties of the office of the Commonwealth's Attorney. However, if Hannett, the incumbent who holds title to the office resigned, a vacancy would indeed exist. Thus, pursuant to Code \u00a7 24.2-228.1(B), the circuit court would make an interim appointment \"until the qualified voters fill the vacancy by election and the person so elected has qualified and taken the oath of office.\" Code \u00a7 24.2-228.1(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Hannett argues that the circuit court erred by concluding, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-156, that it shall be necessary for him to be absent for a prolonged period of time from the performance of the duties of his office. We disagree. The verified statement of facts and exhibits before this Court contain facts that support the circuit court's conclusion that the Commonwealth's Attorney of Floyd County will absent himself for a prolonged period of time from the performance of the duties of his office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Hannett admitted that he advised the circuit court that Hannett's Army Reserve unit had been activated for military service in Iraq and would be mobilized on May 8, 2005. Even though Hannett had informed the circuit court that he could perform the duties of his office while deployed on active duty, the court was not required to accept this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Code \u00a7 15.2-1627(B), which prescribes certain duties imposed upon attorneys for the Commonwealth and their assistants, states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \"B. The attorney for the Commonwealth and assistant attorney for the Commonwealth shall be a part of the department of law enforcement of the county or city in which he is elected or appointed, and shall have the duties and powers imposed upon him by general law, including the duty of prosecuting all warrants, indictments or informations charging a felony, and he may in his discretion, prosecute Class 1, 2 and 3 misdemeanors, or any other violation, the conviction of which carries a penalty of confinement in jail, or a fine of $500 or more, or both such confinement and fine. He shall enforce all forfeitures, and carry out all duties imposed upon him by \u00a7 2.2-3126.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Based upon the record before the circuit court and this Court, it was certainly reasonable for the circuit court to conclude that Hannett could not discharge his statutorily prescribed duties during deployment on active military duty and engagement in a war thousands of miles from Floyd County. And, we note that the Commonwealth's Attorney in Floyd County prosecutes cases on behalf of the Commonwealth and Floyd County in the circuit, general district, and juvenile and domestic relations district courts in that County. Also, the circuit court was of the opinion that Hannett's services were \"vital for the welfare of the Floyd County community.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We recognize that Hannett hired a temporary assistant Commonwealth's Attorney for the County of Floyd, Dennis Nagle, to assist Hannett. We observe that Nagle possesses the lawful authority to act as an assistant Commonwealth's Attorney for the County of Floyd. However, the appointment of Nagle as a temporary employee did not impair the circuit court's statutory authority to appoint an acting attorney for the Commonwealth who will serve for such length of time as may be necessary. And, contrary to Hannett's assertion, the judges of the 27th Judicial Circuit concurred in the decision to appoint an acting attorney for the Commonwealth to serve for such length of time as may be necessary pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-156.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The circuit court failed to give Hannett notice of the hearing that occurred on May 5, 2005. The record does not reflect why Hannett, a constitutional officer, was not accorded notice of the hearing and an opportunity to appear and present evidence. However, Hannett does not raise these issues in his petition and, therefore, they have been waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Hannett also seeks, in this proceeding, a writ of prohibition. However, it is well-established in the jurisprudence of this Commonwealth that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \"The writ of prohibition does not lie to correct error, but to restrain an inferior\n   court from acting in a matter of which it has no jurisdiction, or in which it is transcending the bounds of its jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Moss v.

Grubbs, judge of the Circuit Court of Floyd County, unlawfully deprived Gordon E. Hannett of the office of Commonwealth's Attorney of Floyd County. The effect of the circuit court's order of May 5, 2005 was to require Hannett to vacate his title to office because he had been called to active duty in the armed forces of the United States. Thus, that order violated the express provisions of Code \u00a7 2.2-2802. For that reason, I respectfully dissent with regard to sections II(C) and III of the majority opinion and would issue the writ of mandamus. I concur with the other sections of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Under the provisions of Code \u00a7 2.2-2802, \"[n]o state, county or municipal officer or employee shall\n   <em>\n    forfeit\n   </em>\n   his title to office or position or\n   <em>\n    vacate\n   </em>\n   the same by reason of either engaging in the war service of the United States . . . or when called to active duty in the armed forces of the United States.\" (Emphasis added.) That statute creates an exception to the general prohibition set forth in Code \u00a7 2.2-2800 precluding a person from \"holding any office of honor, profit or trust under the Constitution of Virginia\" while at the same time holding \"any office or post of profit, trust, or emolument, civil or military, legislative, executive, or judicial, under the government of the United States.\" Code \u00a7 2.2-2800;\n   <em>\n    see City of Lynchburg v.

Except in the situations covered in Code \u00a7 2.2-2802, the acceptance of any such office with the government of the United States \"ipso facto[] vacate[s]\" any such office \"under the government of this Commonwealth or under any county, city, or town thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 216,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20S.E.2d%20323\">\n    13 S.E.2d at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The majority concludes that Code \u00a7 2.2-2802 is not applicable to the facts of this case because the action taken by the circuit court did not require Hannett either to forfeit or to vacate his title or position as Commonwealth's Attorney. No forfeiture occurred, according to the majority, because Hannett can return to his position when he concludes his active duty in the armed forces of the United States, and the office of Commonwealth's Attorney was not vacated because Hannett remains the incumbent. The General Assembly used the operative verbs, forfeit and vacate, in the disjunctive, meaning that the provisions of Code \u00a7 2.2-2802 apply if the May 5, 2005 order required Hannett either to forfeit or vacate his position. While I disagree with the majority's analysis in both respects, I will focus on its conclusion that the circuit court's order did not require Hannett to vacate the office of Commonwealth's Attorney of Floyd County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   To understand what it means to vacate the title to a public office or position, it is necessary to consider two of this Court's prior decisions,\n   <em>\n    Chadduck v.

In that context, we explained the word \"vacancy\":\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   It is said that the word \"vacancy,\" as applied to an office, has no technical meaning; that an office is vacant or not according to whether it is occupied by one who has a legal right to hold it and to exercise the powers and perform the duties pertaining thereto. A vacant office is one without an incumbent. Vacancy in office is one thing and term is another. An office may be vacant and filled many times during a term of four years; but it cannot become vacant at the end of a term where the incumbent is authorized to hold over, for the instant the successor is duly appointed and has qualified he becomes entitled to the office, and there has been no hiatus at all. So long, therefore, as an office is supplied with an incumbent, in the manner provided by the Constitution or law, who is legally qualified to exercise the powers and perform the duties which appertain to it, the office is not vacant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 698,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20S.E.%20976\">\n    49 S.E. at 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We then concluded that no vacancy existed in the office of the Superintendent of the Poor on January 1.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 700,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20S.E.%20976\">\n    49 S.E. at 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the regular term of the incumbent expired on January 1, \"he was just as fully authorized by law to hold the office and exercise the powers and perform the duties appertaining to it after that time, until his successor had been duly appointed and qualified, as he was before the expiration of his regular term.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 698,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20S.E.%20976\">\n    49 S.E. at 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It does not matter that Murray-Shortt was authorized to act as the Commonwealth's Attorney only until Hannett returned from active military duty. During the period of her appointment, although it was temporary and indefinite, she replaced Hannett as Commonwealth's Attorney and held the title to the office with the attendant duties, responsibilities, and salary.

Since a vacancy in a public office means the absence of an incumbent, it follows that the verb \"vacate\" as used in Code \u00a7 2.2-2802 means to deprive one of an incumbency.\n   <em>\n    See Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   2527 (1993) (the word \"vacate\" means to \"deprive of an incumbent\" or \"to give up the incumbency\"). There can be no doubt that the May 5, 2005 order required Hannett to give up his incumbency,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   his title to the office of Commonwealth's Attorney and the legal authority to discharge the duties of that office. Thus, I conclude that Code \u00a7 2.2-2802 is indeed applicable to this mandamus proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   To avoid the well-established meaning of the term \"incumbent,\" the majority separates the duties and powers of the office of Commonwealth's Attorney from the title to that office and concludes that Murray-Shortt was vested only with the duties and powers of the office. Even if such a proposition were possible under Virginia law, the terms of Code \u00a7 2.2-2802 provide that a public officer such as Hannett shall not vacate either his \"title to office or position\" by virtue of being called to active duty in the armed forces of the United States. There can be no doubt that the circuit court's order that appointed Murray-Shortt \"to serve in the place of\" Hannett caused Hannett to vacate his position. He could no longer perform the duties, exercise the powers, or receive the salary of the office of Commonwealth's Attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Since the circuit court required Hannett to vacate the \"title to office or position\" of Commonwealth's Attorney despite the clear mandate of Code \u00a7 2.2-2802 that \"[n]o state, county or municipal officer or employee shall . . . vacate\" his office or position \"when called to active duty in the armed forces of the United States,\" the order of May 5, 2005 unlawfully deprived Hannett of his title to office unless the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-156, the statute utilized by the circuit court to appoint an acting attorney for the Commonwealth, prevail over those of Code \u00a7 2.2-2802. Unlike the majority, I conclude that the provisions of those two statutes, in the context of this case, are conflicting. I resolve that conflict by applying an established rule of statutory construction: \"[W]hen one statute speaks to a subject in a general way and another deals with a part of the same subject in a more specific manner, the two should be harmonized, if possible, and where they conflict, the latter prevails.\"\n   <em>\n    Virginia Nat'l Bank v.

However, if a circuit court can appoint an acting attorney for the Commonwealth when the Commonwealth's Attorney is absent from performing the duties of the office for a prolonged period\n   <em>\n    due to any reason, compare\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 19.2-156 (authorizing appointment of acting attorney for the Commonwealth when Commonwealth's Attorney has a prolonged absence from performing the duties of the office, with attendant loss of salary)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 19.2-155 (authorizing appointment of acting attorney for the Commonwealth when the Commonwealth's Attorney \"is unable to act, or to attend to his official duties . . . due to sickness, disability or other reason of a temporary nature\", without loss of salary), that general authority is limited by the more specific provisions of Code \u00a7 2.2-2802 protecting a public officer from forfeiting or vacating the title to office because of being called to\n   active duty in the armed forces of the United States. Moreover, as I stated previously, the provisions of Code \u00a7 2.2-2800 prohibit holding an office under the Constitution of the Virginia while at the same time holding an office under the United States government. The narrow statutory exception to this prohibition provided in Code \u00a7 2.2-2802 for public officers who are called to active duty in the armed forces of the United States reflects an important policy choice by the General Assembly that should not be ignored.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Additionally, the General Assembly last amended Code \u00a7 19.2-156 in 1975, 1975 Va.
