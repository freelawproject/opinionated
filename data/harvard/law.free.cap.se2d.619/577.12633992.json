Inc. contemplated developing in Surf City, North Carolina. At various points in 2002 and 2003, each of the plaintiffs signed a \"Reservation Agreement\" (hereinafter \"reservation(s)\") with defendant. With each reservation, one of the plaintiffs purported to reserve the right to purchase one or more lots in Oceanaire Estates. The reservations required a $500 per lot deposit \"[a]s consideration\" from each plaintiff. Each reservation contained the following clause, which governed the holding and use of the deposits:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Said deposit shall be held by Anchor Real Estate Corp. until the first to occur of the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   a) [the particular plaintiff] requests cancellation of this Agreement and refund of the deposit[; or]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   b) the [parties] enter into an Offer to Purchase and Contract, in which case said deposit shall be credited to [the particular plaintiff] at the time of closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Further, some of the reservations contained the following provisions:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   c) Seller expects to have infrastructure in place and the plat map recorded by [a specified date].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   d) Buyer shall enter into an Offer to Purchase and Contract with Seller within 2 weeks after \"c\" has been completed with a closing date not to exceed 30 days from the date of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition, some of the reservations contained a provision which made the reservation void if the buyer had not either requested his deposit back or \"enter[ed] into an Offer to Purchase and Contract [with seller]\" by a specified date. Citing an inability to obtain necessary permits, defendant recanted the reservation agreements and returned plaintiffs' deposits in December 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs thereafter filed a lawsuit against defendant. Plaintiffs' complaint alleged that the reservations constituted binding option contracts, that defendant was in fact able to obtain the necessary permits to develop Oceanaire Estates, and that defendant had claimed that it could not obtain permitting in an attempt to avoid plaintiffs' reservations and make a greater profit on the sale of the land. Plaintiffs sought specific performance of the reservations and damages under the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-16,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' lawsuit for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(6). Plaintiffs appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In their first argument on appeal, plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred by dismissing their breach of contract claims. Plaintiffs claim that they pled the existence of an option contract that was breached by defendant. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the question is whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as true, state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

If there is none, the option is in effect a mere offer, and may be withdrawn at any time before acceptance.\"); 3-11 CORBIN ON CONTRACTS \u00a7 11.7 n. 11 (1999) (\"If no down payment were made and [an] option holder merely promised to pay . . . in the event the holder exercised the option, there would have been no sufficient consideration and the so-called `option' would have been a revocable offer only.\"). Consistent with the general rules concerning what constitutes valid consideration under North Carolina contract law and with the result reached in other jurisdictions, we hold that an option is not supported by sufficient consideration if it is purported to be held open only by a deposit which is (1) refundable at the behest of the depositing party, and (2) to be applied as payment towards the object for which the option is offered if a sale occurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the instant case, it is not disputed that each deposit was freely refundable at the request of the depositing plaintiff and that the deposit would be used, if ever, as payment towards the purchase price of the land that was alleged to be reserved by the option contract. Given these facts and circumstances, plaintiffs cannot show consideration for the alleged option contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, no valid option contracts existed pursuant to which the plaintiffs could allege breach by defendant. Therefore, the trial court properly dismissed plaintiffs' breach of contract claims pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(6).

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The elements of a claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1 are: \"(1) an unfair or deceptive act or practice, or an unfair method of competition, (2) in or affecting commerce, (3) which proximately caused actual injury to the plaintiff or to his business.\"\n   <em>\n    Spartan Leasing v.

Plaintiffs further alleged that they suffered resulting damages because they lost the benefit of their bargains, the free and unrestricted use of their deposit money, and the opportunity to use their money elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Significantly, plaintiffs did not allege that defendant intended to deceive them from the outset. As such, there was no allegation that an unfair or deceptive act by defendant induced plaintiffs either to pay the deposits mentioned in the reservations or to leave the deposits with defendant's agent rather than withdrawing them. Indeed, the unfair and deceptive acts averred in plaintiffs' complaint involved defendant's return of the deposits and failure to honor the reservations. Therefore, the damage to plaintiffs, if any, was the loss of their contract rights under the reservations. However, because plaintiffs did not have any contract rights under the reservations, they could not allege any damage by virtue of defendant's alleged unfair and deceptive acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed plaintiffs' unfair and deceptive trade practices claims pursuant to N.C.
