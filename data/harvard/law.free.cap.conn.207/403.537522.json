The charge arose from a complaint made by an eighteen year old woman who alleged that on July 4, 1985, she went to the defendant\u2019s home, at his invitation, to discuss arrangements for babysitting. While at his house, the complainant alleged that the defendant offered her money and forced her to submit to sexual contact over a thirty to forty minute period.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">On September 3, 1986, just prior to the commencement of trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>seeking a pretrial ruling on the admissibility of certain evidence. The court heard brief argument on the motion at which time defense counsel informed the court that he was not seeking an immediate ruling. It was then agreed by the court and both counsel that further argument on the motion in limine was not appropriate until after the direct examination of the victim had taken place, and that a hearing and ruling on the motion would be postponed until that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The trial commenced immediately thereafter and the state\u2019s first witness was the victim. She testified as to the particulars of the incident. Upon completion of direct examination defense counsel commenced cross-examination, at which time he inquired if the witness had previously sought to obtain money from another male acquaintance by informing him that she was pregnant and needed an abortion. The state immediately objected and, outside the presence of the jury, moved for a mistrial. The defense counsel sought a ruling on the question propounded. The court did not rule on the admissibility of the question but instead granted the motion for mistrial. A new trial was scheduled for the next morning at which time the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information and bar prosecution based upon the guarantee of the double jeopardy clause of the United States constitution. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion which resulted in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The sole issue raised by the defendant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is whether the trial court erred in failing to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground of double jeopardy as guaranteed by the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201cThe fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides, in relevant part, \u2018nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u2019 \u2018This clause, which is applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment; <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 787, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969); establishes the constitutional standards concerning the guarantee against double jeopardy. <em>Crist </em>v. <em>Bretz, </em>437 U.S. 28, 98 S. Ct. 2156, 57 L. Ed. 2d 24 (1978); <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 795.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>182 Conn. 382, 385, 438 A.2d 128 (1980); see <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 503, 98 S. Ct. 824, 54 L. Ed. 2d 717 (1978). Inasmuch as the jury had been selected and sworn . . . jeopardy had attached. <em>Crist </em>v. <em>Bretz, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 479, 91 S. Ct. 547, 27 L. Ed. 2d 543 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>supra. The fact that jeopardy has attached does not, however, mean that a later termination of the trial mandates a dismissal of the charge based on the double jeopardy clause. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, </em>supra, 483-84; <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>182 Conn. 124, 128, 438 A.2d 30 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1090, 101 S. Ct. 883, 66 L. Ed. 2d 817 (1981); see generally Schulhofer, \u2018Jeopardy and Mistrials,\u2019 125 U. Pa. L. Rev. 449 (1977). This is so even though this \u2018constitutional protection also embraces the defendant\u2019s \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u201d \u2019 <em>Arizonav. Washington, </em>supra.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Sant, </em>198 Conn. 369, 376, 503 A.2d 557 (1986). \u201cWhen a criminal defendant objects to the declaration of a mistrial . . . and the mistrial is declared for reasons amounting to \u2018manifest necessity,\u2019 his right to have his trial completed by his chosen tribunal is no longer protected and the double jeopardy clause does not bar a second trial. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 462, 93 S. Ct. 1066, 35 L. Ed. 2d 425 (1973); <em>Gori </em>v. <em>United States, </em>367 U.S. 364, 368, 81 S. Ct. 1523, 6 L.

L. Rev. 45, 57 (1979).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Sant, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u201cJustice Story, writing for the United States Supreme Court in <em>Perez, </em>set forth standards for determining when to order a retrial after the declaration of a mistrial over the defendant\u2019s objection. He said: \u2018We think, that in all cases of this nature, the law has invested Courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject; and it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere. To be sure, the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes . . . .\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra, 580.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Sant, </em>supra, 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">In criminal cases, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right not to be twice tried for the same offense places the burden on the state to establish the necessity for a mistrial. Mistrials should be granted only where there is substantial and irreparable prejudice to the defendant or to the state, or where the jury is unable to reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>a verdict. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 887 through 889.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Circumstances may arise which may cause the court to grant a mistrial in order to avoid an unjust decision to either parly. There is no mechanical formula by which to judge the propriety of declaring a mistrial in the varying and often unique situations arising during the course of a criminal trial. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>supra, 462. Each case must be assessed on the basis of the particular circumstances before the presiding judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u201c \u2018A reviewing court looks for a manifest necessity by examining the entire record in the case without limiting itself to the actual findings of the trial court. . . .\u2019 It is the examination of the propriety of the trial court\u2019s action against the backdrop of the record that leads to the determination whether, in the context of a particular case, the mistrial declaration was proper. Given the constitutionally protected interest involved, reviewing courts must be satisfied . . . that the trial judge exercised \u2018sound discretion\u2019 in declaring a mistrial.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Sant, </em>supra, 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>In the instant case, the defendant sought a ruling on his motion concerning the victim\u2019s alleged practice of extorting money from men by falsely claiming to be pregnant with their children. After discussion between counsel and the court, defense counsel informed the court that he was \u201cnot necessarily pressing for a ruling right now,\u201d but that he would begin cross-examination and \u201calert the court [when he was] approaching an area that\u2019s contained in [the] motion in limine, so the court can then decide how the court wants to handle that, either by excusing the witness or the [jury], however we want to do that.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court thus deferred ruling, stating that, \u201c[w]e\u2019re all in agreement then that the motion in limine should stand in abeyance at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Despite this agreement defense counsel, without alerting the court, proceeded to inquire whether the victim had sought money from a male acquaintance claiming that she needed an abortion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The state immediately objected and asked that the jury be excused. In the absence of the jury, the state moved for a mistrial claiming that the agreement with the court had been violated and that the question was \u201cunbelievably damaging\u201d and was \u201cso prejudicial that [it would] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>totally taint the perspective of the jury.\u201d Defense counsel conceded that \u201cmaybe I got caught up in the heat of the moment\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and sought a ruling on the admissibility of the question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court, upon reflection, stated, \u201cI don\u2019t believe the court has any choice but to declare a mistrial at this time, and the court will declare a mistrial.\u201d After informing counsel that the case would commence once again on the following morning, before discharging the jury, the court stated on the record, \u201cI just want to make one more brief statement for the record .... As I sat there listening to argument [on the state\u2019s motion for a mistrial,] I debated with myself whether or not this is something that I could cure by an instruction to the jury. I came to the conclusion that I couldn\u2019t, and therefore, I\u2019ve decided on the mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The record reflects that the trial court considered the agreement, the violation of the agreement by defense counsel, the prejudicial impact on the jury, and the possibility of curative instructions. The court was in the best position to evaluate the circumstances and the effect of the question on the right to a fair and just trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The court concluded the question was so damaging that it would prevent both the state and the defendant from receiving a fair trial before the jury. By scheduling the trial on the following day before a new jury, there was neither delay nor damage to the defendant\u2019s ability to conduct his defense before an impartial jury. The potential for a tainted jury verdict was eliminated and the opportunity for the jury trial to proceed without the potentially damaging statements made in the presence of the jury was assured.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The decision to declare a mistrial rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge who is best situated to take all the circumstances into account and to decide whether a mistrial is in fact required in a given case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Van </em>Sant, supra, 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The trial court is in the best position to assess all the factors that must be considered in making a necessarily discretionary determination whether the jury will be able to reach a just verdict. The difficulty that led to the mistrial in this case also falls in an area where the trial judge\u2019s determination is entitled to special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>respect. There are compelling institutional considerations militating in favor of appellate deference to the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the significance of possible juror bias. The judges have seen and heard the jurors during their voir dire examination. They are the judges most familiar with the evidence and the background of the trial. They have listened to the tone of the question propounded, observed the apparent emotionalism of defense counsel who got \u201ccaught up in the heat of the moment\u201d and any reaction the jurors may have had to the situation at hand. In short, they are far more \u201cconversant with the factors relevant to the determination\u201d than any reviewing court can possibly be. See <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 687, 69 S. Ct. 834, 93 L. Ed. 974, reh. denied, 337 U.S. 921, 69 S. Ct. 1152, 93 L.

After dismissing the jury, the court heard argument by the state regarding the grounds for a mistrial, and argument by defense counsel claiming that the question was raised for impeachment purposes, directed at the veracity of the victim, and did not involve the rape shield statute. The court concluded that mistrial was the appropriate remedy under the existing circumstances. The failure to rule on the admissibility of the question in this instance did not constitute error. Nor, under the circumstances do we express an opinion as to the admissibility of the question propounded to the complaining witness by defense counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
