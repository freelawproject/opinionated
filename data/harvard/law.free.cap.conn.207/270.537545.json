The record further discloses that on June 19,1987, probation officer Joseph H. Paquin filed a verified petition alleging that the respondent was again delinquent, having committed the underlying offense of escape from custody in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-171<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on November 28, 1986. This second petition claiming further delinquency was filed because of the respondent\u2019s escape on November 28 from Long Lane School where he had been committed on April 2 as the result of the earlier adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">On July 8, 1987, the respondent admitted commission of the underlying offense and the court entered a second finding of delinquency. On August 5, 1987, the court, <em>McGrath, J., </em>committed the respondent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the department of children and youth services for a further period of two years and ordered that the new commitment take effect upon the expiration of his present commitment. The effective date of the new commitment would be April 2,1990. From this disposition the respondent has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Under Connecticut law a child may be found \u201cdelinquent\u201d if he or she has (1) violated any federal or state law or municipal or local ordinance, or (2) violated any order of the Superior Court. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Upon a finding of delinquency, the court may: (1) place the child in the care of an institution or agency; (2) order the child to remain at home; (3) order the child to remain in the custody of a relative or other fit person subject to the supervision of a probation officer; or (4) withhold or suspend execution of any judgment. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-140 (a), see footnote 1, supra; <em>In re Robert H., </em>199 Conn. 693, 713-14, 509 A.2d 475 (1986). The court may also order the child \u201cto do work ... in public buildings and on public property or make restitution of the fruits of his offense or . . .in an amount he can afford to pay or [otherwise] provide in a suitable manner for the loss or damage,\u201d particularly in the event of wilful destruction of property. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-140 (a), see footnote 1, supra. If the court finds that the probation services or other available services are not adequate for the child, the court is authorized to commit the child to the department of children and youth services. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-140 (b), see footnote 1, supra; see also <em>In re Robert H., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Commitments to the department of children and youth services are to be for an indeterminate time up to a maximum of two years, or in the event of a serious juvenile offense, up to a maximum of four years. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-141 (a), see footnote 2, supra. During such two year period (or four year period in the event of a serious juvenile offense), the commissioner of the department of children and youth services may petition the court for an extension of the commitment for an additional period not to exceed two years. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-141 (b), see footnote 2, supra. Commitments may be reopened and terminated at any time by the court. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-141 (c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Extensions of existing commitments at the request of the commissioner are thus authorized. Successive commitments to be served in the future as a result of sequential petitions for findings of delinquency are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The objective of juvenile court proceedings is to \u201cdeterminfe] the needs of the child and of society rather than adjudicate] criminal conduct. The objectives are to provide measures of guidance and rehabilitation . . . not to fix criminal responsibility, guilt and punishment.\u201d <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 U.S. 541, 554, 86 S. Ct. 1045, 16 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1966); but see <em>In re Luis R., </em>204 Conn. 630, 634-35, 528 A.2d 1146 (1987). Thus the child found delinquent is not perceived as a criminal guilty of one or more offenses, but rather as a child in need of guidance and rehabilitative services. Commitments to the department of children and youth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>services are authorized only after other services have been found inadequate for the child. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-140 (b), see footnote 1, supra. The commitments are indeterminate and may be extended beyond their original term only upon later application by the commissioner of the department of children and youth services. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-141 (b), see footnote 2, supra. Thus, absent a request to transfer a matter to the regular criminal docket, extension of the existing commitment is the statutorily authorized response to further allegations of misconduct arising during a period of commitment. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-126 and 46b-127; cf. <em>Dart </em>v. <em>Mecum, </em>19 Conn. Sup. 428, 116 A.2d 668 (1955) (juvenile court not authorized to suspend execution of a commitment).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The postadjudicatory treatment of children in the juvenile justice system is totally unlike that which occurs in the adult penal system, which views the disposition following a judgment of guilty as being a punishment in the form of fines, imprisonment, or both. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-28;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but see <em>In re Luis R., </em>supra. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>In the adult system, consecutive sentences are specifically authorized to address the issue of the guilt of multiple crimes. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-37.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no similar provision for juvenile dispositions. We conclude, therefore, that the order entered was not authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">There is error and the matter is remanded to the trial court with direction to vacate the judgment of an additional commitment to the department of children and youth services for a period of two years commencing April 2, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-140 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The court, if it finds that the child is delinquent and needs the care, discipline or protection of the state, may adjudge him delinquent and place him in the care of any institution or agency which is permitted by law to care for children, order the child to remain in his own home or in the custody of a relative or any other fit person subject to the supervision of the probation officer or withhold or suspend execution of any judgment. The court may also order such child to do work of which he is capable in public buildings and on public property or make restitution of the fruits of his offense or make restitution in an amount he can afford to pay or provide in a suitable manner for the loss or damage caused thereby, particularly in cases in which the adjudication of delinquency was upon an allegation that the conduct of such child resulted in the wilful destruction of property; provided competent acceptance of such disposition has been given by the child and his parent or guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\u201c(b) If the court further finds that its probation services or other services available to the court are not adequate for such child, the court shall commit such child to the department of children and youth services in accordance with the provisions of section 46b-141.

The court may, after hearing and upon finding that such extension is in the best interest of the child, continue the commitment for an additional period of not more than two years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b288-10\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-171. escape from custody: classification.
