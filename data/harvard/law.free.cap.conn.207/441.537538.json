J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2H\">The principal issue in this case is whether the tenant of a residential apartment complex that is being converted to common interest ownership has an exclusive right to purchase the apartment that he occupies even though the conversion plan does not make the apartment available for sale as a separate unit. The plaintiff, Nicotra Wieler Investment Management, Inc., brought this summary process action against the defendant, Melvin Grower, alleging the expiration of an oral lease by lapse of time. The defendant refused to vacate the apartment principally because the plaintiff had not complied with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-284<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 47-285,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which govern the rights of ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ants in the conversion process. The trial court rendered a judgment awarding possession to the plaintiff. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">There is no dispute about the relevant facts. The defendant occupies an apartment at the Folly Brook Manor complex in Wethersfield, which is managed and operated by the plaintiff. The complex consists of nine separate groups of buildings. Each building contains four apartment units. In August, 1983, the owner of the complex was Creative Real Estate Marketing Investments (CREMI). About August 30,1983, CREMI designated the complex for development as a planned unit modular complex within the authority conferred by the Connecticut Common Interest Ownership Act (CIOA). General Statutes \u00a7 47-200 et seq. To initiate this new form of ownership, CREMI filed a \u201cDeclaration of Covenants, Easements, Reservations and Tenancies in Common\u201d in the land records of Wethersfield. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ing to the declaration, CREMI agreed to convey the land and common improvements, such as paved parking areas and concrete walkways, to the newly-created Folly Brook Manor Owners Association, Inc. As for the apartment structures, CREMI declared its intent to sell each of the forty-six buildings to various investors, who in turn would lease the land and common improvements from the owners association. In sum, the units for sale under the declaration consisted of the four-apartment buildings, not the individual dwelling units.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">In conjunction with the conversion, CREMI sent a form letter to the defendant describing the change in ownership structure. This letter explained that the \u201cgeneral nature of [Folly Brook] Manor as a rental complex has not been changed\u201d and that rental payments would be due under the terms of existing leases. The defendant was told that \u201c[y]ou may live in your apartment under your existing lease until your lease expires.\u201d CREMI further stated that no evictions would occur except for designated causes, including nonpayment of rent, removal of the apartment from the rental market or material noncompliance with the lease. Finally, with respect to purchase rights, the letter stated that \u201c[b]ecause the boundaries of the units have been changed from individual apartments to groups of four (4) apartments, we cannot offer you an exclusive right to purchase your apartment. If you are interested, however, in purchasing a modular group of four (4) apartments, please do not hesitate to call us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">On July 19,1984, the plaintiff served on the defendant a notice to quit possession of the premises by July 31,1984. The notice alleged that an oral lease had expired by lapse of time. When the defendant did not vacate the premises, the plaintiff brought the instant summary process action on August 8,1984. Thereafter, on October 10, 1984, the defendant moved to dismiss the action because the plaintiff had not provided him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>a proper conversion notice and public offering statement as required by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-284 and 47-285. In particular, the defendant claimed that the letter he had received from CREMI failed to offer him an exclusive right to purchase his apartment for a specified period.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">In a memorandum of decision dated December 16, 1985, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss. It was uncontested that the defendant had not been provided a conversion notice and a public offering statement. Whether the defendant was thereby protected from an eviction depended, according to the trial court, on a threshold question: did the conversion provisions of CIOA require the plaintiff to provide such documents in this case? After examining the relevant statutory provisions, the trial court decided that the tenant in this case stood outside the intended scope of CIOA. The trial court appears to have rested its decision on two alternate grounds. The court first held that the defendant was not a \u201cconversion tenant\u201d for whom the provisions of CIOA afford protection. In the alternative, the court also denied relief because \u00a7 47-285 (a) contains an exception that applies when the unit for sale does not \u201csubstantially conform to the dimensions of the unit before conversion.\u201d Of particular significance to the trial court in both holdings were the provisions of CIOA that give to developers latitude in declaring and defining the \u201cunits\u201d that are for sale in a newly-declared common interest community. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-202 (31) and 47-224 (a) (5).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This freedom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>to characterize as a \u201cunit\u201d whatever portion of the development is to be sold separately could not, the trial court reasoned, be squared with the defendant\u2019s claim of the right to purchase his dwelling unit. Under the defendant\u2019s view, the court believed that \u201cthe result would be difficult and unfathomable. How could each of four tenants have exclusive right to purchase the building which, not the individual apartments, was the only item available for conversion/sale?\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Subsequent to this decision, the defendant filed his answer and special defenses. The defenses essentially recounted the grounds for dismissal under CIOA that had already been rejected by the trial court in its prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>memorandum.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In its final judgment rendered on August 18, 1987, the trial court found for the plaintiff on the special defenses and on the question of possession for lapse of an oral lease. As its rationale for denying the special defenses, the trial court expressly incorporated its prior memorandum on the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">On appeal, the defendant claims that his eviction is improper because the trial court erred in: (1) holding that a proper conversion notice, with its attendent exclusive purchase right, was not required in this case; and (2) not requiring the plaintiff to provide a public offering statement to him. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In order properly to review these claims of error, we must briefly survey the conversion provisions of CIOA in the context of the act as a whole. The Common Interest Ownership Act is a comprehensive legislative scheme regulating all forms of common interest ownership that is largely modeled on the Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act. Public Acts 1983, No. 83-474. A \u201ccommon interest community\u201d is defined chiefly by the fact that each unit owner is obligated to pay certain charges, such as taxes and insurance premiums, attributable to common property held jointly by the owners through their association. General Statutes \u00a7 47-202 (7).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Part V<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the act sets forth special rules for the protection of tenants who occupy apartments in existing structures that are being converted to common interest communities.. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-282 through 47-293. In a statement of policy, the legislature declared the need for statewide action to preserve the stock of leased dwelling units in the face of the quickening tempo of conversions. General Statutes \u00a7 47-282. Because tenants who occupy buddings undergoing conversions often bear a disproportionate burden in this process, the legislature has established a regime of both substantive and procedural rights that must be respected by developers in this state. Three principal rights are: the exclusive right to purchase one\u2019s apartment for a specified period of time, a relocation payment of up to one thousand dollars and a guarantee against rent increases during the transition period. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-285, 47-287 and 47-289.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">CIOA affords its panoply of protection to a special type of person known under the act as a \u201cconversion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>tenant.\u201d This term is defined as <em>\u201ca </em>tenant who occupies a dwelling unit both before and after it becomes a converted unit.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-283 (3). The preliminary question in this case is whether the defendant is a \u201cconversion tenant.\u201d Only if this status has attached to the defendant as a consequence of the conversion in this case do the rights available under CIOA become enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The defendant in this case meets the statutory requirement for a \u201cconversion tenant.\u201d The definition of this term in \u00a7 47-283 (3) essentially ties the status of being a \u201cconversion tenant\u201d to the occupancy of an apartment that \u201cbecomes a converted unit.\u201d A \u201cconverted unit\u201d is defined as \u201ca dwelling unit that (A) was not in a <em>common </em>interest community when originally leased to its current tenant and (B) is now in a common interest community or is located in a building in which a unit is being offered for sale as part of a common interest community.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-283 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Applying these criteria in this case, we are persuaded that the evidence adduced at trial shows that the defendant fits the definition of a \u201cconversion tenant.\u201d It is undisputed that the defendant resided at Folly Brook Manor prior to its conversion to a common interest community. The defendant attested, in an undisputed affidavit, that he took leased occupancy of his apartment prior to August 30, 1983, the date of conversion. The second element in this definition of a \u201cconversion tenant\u201d is also uncontroverted. The evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the entire Folly Brook Manor complex, including the dwelling unit leased to the defendant, is now a common interest community.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The plaintiff nevertheless argues that a \u201cconversion tenant\u201d comes into being only when the conversion plan calls for the sale of individual dwelling units. Its argument, in syllogistic terms, is that only \u201cconverted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>units\u201d must be offered for sale to tenants; that a \u201cconverted unit\u201d is defined in the statute as a \u201cdwelling unit\u201d; and that because no separate \u201cdwelling unit\u201d has been offered for sale in this case there can be no \u201cconversion tenant.\u201d This argument cannot be squared with the express terms of the statutory definition of \u201cconversion tenant.\u201d The clear language of the interlocking definitions in \u00a7 47-283 (2) and (3) provide the dispositive criteria for determining whether a particular tenant is a \u201cconversion tenant.\u201d Contrary to the holding of the trial court, we therefore conclude that the defendant is a \u201cconversion tenant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We turn, then, to the more difficult question of whether the defendant was entitled to receive a conversion notice in this case. Although a conversion tenant is entitled to notice of his or her exclusive right to purchase the apartment, that entitlement applies only if such a purchase right exists. General Statutes \u00a7 47-284 (b) (3). Whether the purchase right exists depends on the language of \u00a7 47-285 (a), which provides that \u201ca declarant shall offer to convey the converted unit occupied by [the conversion] tenant to that tenant\u201d for a specified period. This broad right is subject, however, to an exception in the final sentence of \u00a7 47-285 (a): \u201cThis provision does not apply to any unit . . . the boundaries of which do not substantially conform to the dimensions of the unit before conversion.\u201d The outcome of this case hinges on the proper construction of this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The parties offer starkly disparate interpretations of this exception. According to the defendant, only if the actual physical walls, ceilings or floors of a preconversion dwelling unit are substantially changed does the exception apply. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that the exception is triggered whenever a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>declarant chooses to define and sell as a \u201cunit\u201d any bundle of property that is substantially different than the dimensions of a single dwelling unit. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">In determining whether CIOA affords the relief that the defendant seeks, it is axiomatic that we strive to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 553, 522 A.2d 753 (1987). \u201cIn reaching this goal, we consider first whether the language of the statute yields a plain and unambiguous resolution. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986). Any latent ambiguity in the statutory language itself is normally resolved by turning for guidance to the legislative history and the purpose the statute is to serve. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>206 Conn. 421, 428, 538 A.2d 193 (1988). In addition, we consider the statute as a whole with a view toward reconciling its parts in order to obtain a sensible and rational overall interpretation. <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 214, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984). In this same vein, CIOA refers to itself as a \u201cgeneral act intended as a unified coverage of its subject matter . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-208.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On its face, the language of the exception in \u00a7 47-285 neither absolutely supports nor absolutely refutes the defendant\u2019s exclusive right to purchase his apartment. The chief source of ambiguity in the statute is its use, at two junctures, of the term \u201cunit\u201d without explicit qualification. The CIOA lexicon contains at least three types of units: the \u201cunit\u201d defined by the declarant for separate ownership or occupancy; \u00a7 47-202 (31); the \u201cconverted unit\u201d defined in \u00a7 47-283 (2); and the \u201cdwelling unit\u201d used occasionally in the act but nowhere defined. It is our task to construe \u00a7 47-285 (a) in the context of the act as a whole so as to ascribe appropriate meanings to the exception\u2019s two uses of the term \u201cunit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Both parties urge us to clarify the meaning of \u201cunit\u201d in \u00a7 47-285 by interpolating additional terminology into the language of the statute. The defendant urges us to construe both uses of the term \u201cunit\u201d as references to \u201cdwelling unit.\u201d So clarified, the exception would apply only if the physical dimensions of a dwelling unit after the conversion do not substantially conform to its pre-conversion dimensions. The plaintiff, to the contrary, urges us to interpret the first \u201cunit\u201d as the bundle of property defined by the declarant in accordance with \u00a7 47-202 (31) and the second \u201cunit\u201d as a \u201cdwelling unit.\u201d So clarified, the exception would apply whenever the unit for sale does not substantially conform to the dwelling unit before conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Two principal reasons persuade us to agree with the plaintiff. First, the neighboring terminology clarifies the intended meanings of the term \u201cunit.\u201d The exception begins with the language that \u201c[t]his provision does not apply to any unit . . . the <em>boundaries </em>of which\u201d are substantially changed. (Emphasis added.) A \u201cboundary\u201d is the device by which the developer defines a \u201cunit\u201d under the act. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-202 (26) and (31), 47-224 (5), 47-228 (e) and 47-230 (3). Once defined, the \u201cunit\u201d owner is not only vested with certain allocated interests; General Statutes \u00a7 47-202 (2); but also with certain liabilities. General Statutes \u00a7 47-249. A \u201cboundary\u201d created in the declaration may, or may not, correspond to the physical dimensions of a dwelling unit. The mere removal of partitions between adjoining units, for example, is not an alteration of a \u201cboundary.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-230. Instead, boundaries are relocated by amending the declaration on application to the unit owners association. General Statutes \u00a7 47-231. In sum, the term \u201cboundaries,\u201d with its fixed correlation to the exercise of development rights, clarifies the meaning of the first \u201cunit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The subsequent use of the term \u201cunit\u201d in \u00a7 47-285 (a), in its full rendition, refers to the \u201cunit <em>before conversion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) A \u201cunit before conversion\u201d must be a dwelling unit or apartment since, prior to conversion, there is neither a \u201cunit\u201d nor a \u201cconverted unit\u201d within the purview of CIOA. In addition, by describing the latter \u201cunit\u201d as having \u201cdimensions\u201d instead of \u201cboundaries,\u201d the statute has provided further guidance that the second use of the term \u201cunit\u201d was meant in the ordinary sense of an apartment. Accordingly, the plaintiffs interpretation finds support in the language of the exception as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Second, the plaintiffs interpretation is consistent with CIOA\u2019s express aspiration to serve as a \u201cgeneral act intended as a unified coverage\u201d of its subject matter. General Statutes \u00a7 47-208. In creating a common interest community, a declarant has broad latitude in defining the \u201cunit\u201d for separate ownership or occupancy. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-202 (31) and 47-224 (a) (5). A declarant thus may exercise its development rights under part II of the act without regard to the existing dimensions of dwelling units. The \u00a7 47-285 exception is an apparent recognition of this possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We note also that our decision today furthers CIOA\u2019s overall policy of protecting the existing rental stock in the state. In a statement of policy, \u00a7 47-282 (3) declares that \u201cit is in the public interest to preserve a number of leased dwelling units as rentals\u201d for the elderly or infirm. The trial court, after reviewing the conversion instruments, stated that \u201c[t]he only effect this conversion will have on defendant is a change in landlord.\u201d The defendant has not challenged this conclusion in any way and our own review of the record reveals no reason to question the trial court\u2019s observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Applying the exception to this case in accordance with our interpretation of \u00a7 47-285 (a), we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the defendant has no exclusive right to purchase his apartment. The boundaries of the unit offered for sale by CREMI did not substantially conform to the dimensions of the apartment the defendant occupied prior to the conversion. Accordingly, the trial court was correct in holding that no conversion notice was required in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The defendant also claims that his eviction is unlawful because he has not received the public offering statement to which he is entitled. He offers two grounds for reversing the judgment of the trial court: (1) such a statement is a necessary adjunct to his right to purchase his apartment; and (2) his status as a \u201cconversion tenant\u201d per se mandates the service of a public offering statement before any eviction may occur. Because we already have determined that no purchase right exists in this case, we need only address the latter argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Before offering any interest in a unit to the public, a declarant is required to prepare a public offering statement in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-263 through 47-267. In the event that \u201ca conversion tenant will be required to vacate a converted unit, other than for reasons permitted by subsection (b) of section 47a-23c, <em>and, </em>if a tenant has a purchase right pursuant to section 47-285 . . . a declarant shall . . . provide that tenant with a public offering statement . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 47-284 (a). The defendant argues that this provision requires service of a public offering statement under two alternative circumstances: when a conversion tenant is impermissibly evicted <em>or </em>when such a tenant has a right to purchase his or her apartment. As we interpret the statute, however, the right to a public offering statement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>plainly contingent upon a showing of an impermissible eviction <em>and </em>a purchase right.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">In reaching this conclusion, we find significance in the use of the word \u201cand\u201d between the two stated conditions. \u201cWhere the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we have refused to speculate as to the legislative intention, because it is assumed that the words express the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>201 Conn. 115, 118, 513 A.2d 139 (1986); see <em>Simko </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>205 Conn. 413, 418, 533 A.2d 879 (1987). We believe that the legislature, in drafting \u00a7 47-284 (a) in the conjunctive, meant what it said. A principal purpose of the public offering statement under CIOA is to protect unit purchasers from making uninformed investment decisions. Mandating the service of such statements upon tenants who have no exclusive purchase rights would not materially advance the goal of the statute. A tenant in the shoes of the defendant might, of course, request a public offering statement and the declarant, in seeking to sell property, might voluntarily wish to honor that request. We conclude, however, that the defendant had no statutory right to receive a public offering statement merely because of his status as a \u201cconversion tenant.\u201d A declarant is only obligated to provide a public offering statement to conversion tenants who have a \u201cpurchase right pursuant to section 47-285 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-284 (a).

He urges in his brief, as he did before the trial court, that, under the unique circumstances of this case, his statutory right can be given full effect by allowing him to purchase an undivided one fourth interest in the unit that is for sale, i.e., the four-apartment building. At oral argument, the defendant initially claimed that he had an unequivocal right to purchase his own apartment. Under questioning in rebuttal, however, the defendant clearly conceded that he sought only to purchase a one fourth interest in the unit for sale. Because we decide the threshold question of whether he enjoys any purchase right under CIOA against the defendant, we need not consider the feasibility of either proposed remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\"> Seizing on this apparent repetition to invoke the law of the case doctrine, the plaintiff filed a motion to strike the CIOA special defenses.
