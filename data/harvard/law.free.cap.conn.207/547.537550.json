We conclude that the specification in \u00a7 52-49 that appeals \u201cfrom orders of commissioners and other administrative officers shall be taken to \u00e1 return day of the superior court within sixty days after their allowance\u201d is no longer operative and has been superseded by the general return day limitation of \u201ctwo months after the date of the process\u201d contained in General Statutes \u00a7 52-48 (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>in the granting of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and remand the case to the trial court with direction to deny that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">The complaint alleges that, after the Hebrew Home and Hospital (Hebrew Home), a defendant in this case, had discharged the plaintiff, she filed with the CHRO on March 24, 1981, an age discrimination complaint against her employer. An investigator for the agency initially determined that there was reasonable cause for her charges against the Hebrew Home. After some unsuccessful conciliation efforts, however, the legal division of the CHRO, in reviewing the file before certification to a public hearing, concluded that her case was not \u201clitigation worthy.\u201d The CHRO ultimately dismissed the complaint filed with it and notified the plaintiff of this action on March 28,1985. She requested that the CHRO reconsider its dismissal of her complaint. On March 26,1986, the agency notified her by mail that this request had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">On April 17, 1986, the plaintiff commenced her appeal of the CHRO\u2019s dismissal of her complaint against the Hebrew Home, as authorized by \u00a7 46a-95 (j), by service of process. The return day upon which the defendants were summoned to appear in the Superior Court was June 3, 1986. After the CHRO had moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the trial court granted the motion on the ground that the return date specified in the complaint \u201cwas more than 60 days beyond March 26, 1986, the date of the . . . decision . . . .\u201d The court concluded, therefore, that the complaint did not comply with the requirement of \u00a7 52-49 that appeals from administrative officers \u201cshall be taken to a return day of the superior court within sixty days after their allowance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The practice of \u201callowing\u201d appeals has ancient roots. Prior to the enactment of the appeals statute in 1882, chapter 50 of the 1882 Public Acts, there were no appeals as of right in this state. <em>State </em>v. <em>Caplan, </em>85 Conn. 618, 622-24, 84 A. 280 (1912). \u201cThe writ of error is the common-law method, and formerly the only method in this State, of carrying up a cause from an inferior to a higher court for the revision of questions of law.\u201d Id., 622. A party bringing a writ of error to a higher court first had to obtain an allowance of the writ. \u201cWrits of error shall be allowed and signed, by the judges of the court, to which they are returnable . . . .\u201d General Statutes (1821 Rev.) \u00a7 2-72. Out-present statutes relating to writs of error still contain the provision that \u201c[a]ll writs of error shall be allowed and signed by a judge of the superior court or by the clerk of the court . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-275. Our rules of practice have recently been amended to make it clear that the writ, \u201cif in proper form, <em>must </em>be allowed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 4114 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The practice of allowing appeals has been followed in the courts of probate since colonial times; <em>Orcutt\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>61 Conn. 378, 382, 24 A. 276 (1892); and is recognized by General Statutes \u00a7 45-294, which prescribes that a Probate Court \u201cin allowing an appeal, shall make such order of notice to persons interested as it deems reasonable.\u201d See <em>George </em>v. <em>St. Ann\u2019s Church, </em>182 Conn. 322, 324, 438 A.2d 97 (1980). Probate Court judges do not possess the discretionary authority to refuse to allow review by a higher court. A party cannot appeal directly from a refusal to allow an appeal, but may apply to a higher court for a writ of mandamus to compel the Probate Court to allow the appeal. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Cleaveland, </em>76 Conn. 426, 430, 56 A. 850 (1904); <em>Orcutt\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Section 52-49 has its origin in a statute regulating appeals from justices of the peace and other inferior courts. \u201cAppeals from judgments of justices of the peace and from other inferior tribunals shall be taken to the return day of the appellate court next after their allowance . . . .\u201d General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 5588. A provision for allowance of an appeal from a justice of the peace had been contained in an earlier statute; General Statutes (1866 Rev.) c. 5, \u00a7 88, p. 19; and the allowance had been deemed a mere \u201cclerical\u201d act of the justice court. <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Broughton, </em>77 Conn. 38, 41, 58 A. 236 (1904). In 1925, \u00a7 5588 was amended to include appeals from \u201corders of commissioners and other administrative officers.\u201d Public Acts 1925, No. 201. There is no recorded legislative history concerning this amendment nor can it be ascertained how the allowance of an appeal from \u201ccommissioners and other administrative officers\u201d could be obtained. In 1959 an act deleted reference to appeals from justices of the peace and other inferior tribunals, thus leaving only appeals from administrative officials within its scope. Public Acts 1959, No. 28, \u00a7 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The CHRO contends that \u00a7 52-49 requires that, before a party whose complaint has been dismissed by the agency may appeal to the Superior Court, the agency must \u201callow\u201d the appeal. The CHRO acknowledges that historically the allowance of appeals has been a judicial function. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>McConnell, </em>124 U.S. 489, 490, 8 S. Ct. 559, 31L. Ed. 495 (1888). It argues, however, that the legislature must have intended that administrative agencies assume this judicial function because the 1925 amendment to the statutory predecessor of \u00a7 52-49 referred to appeals from administrative officers along with those from justices of the peace. Public Acts 1925, No. 201. The CHRO.concedes, however, that there is no authority or other evidence indicating that administrative agencies ever have exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the function of \u201callowing\u201d an appeal as a discrete act. It maintains, nevertheless, that mailing the notice of its final order dismissing the complaint constituted an allowance of the appeal by the agency because, only at that point, does the statute permit the appeal to be instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">To treat the mailing of the notice of decision, which marks the start of the period for taking an appeal, as also being the allowance of the appeal has the effect of removing the requirement for any separate act of allowance from \u00a7 52-49 and renders that provision of the statute largely superfluous. Such a view, attributing virtually no significance to the reference to an allowance of the appeal except in limiting the return day for the appeal, cannot be reconciled with the intention of the legislature in originally establishing this requirement for appeals from justices of the peace and other inferior courts, at a time when the term \u201callowance\u201d referred to a specific act of such a court as a condition precedent to an appeal. The term \u201callowance\u201d continues to be used in that sense in the context of writs of error as well as probate appeals. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-275 and 45-294. To regard the mailing of the notice of decision as also an allowance of the appeal presents the paradox of an agency allowing an appeal from every one of its decisions, whether any such appeal is even contemplated. If we were to agree with the defendant\u2019s argument that mailing of the notice of decision is also the allowance of the appeal, we would have to depart significantly from the well established meaning of that term as it has been used in our statutes and decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Our conclusion that the allowance of an appeal referred to in \u00a7 52-49 cannot be equated with the start of the period for taking an appeal that is triggered by mailing the notice of decision leaves unresolved the determination of the point in time from which the sixty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>day period for the designation of a return day in taking an appeal after its allowance should be measured. The parties appear to agree that the CHRO has no mechanism for allowing appeals in the usual sense of that term. The statutes neither prescribe the procedure for allowing an administrative appeal nor designate the authority that is to perform that function. We are faced with the conundrum that in referencing the sixty day return day limitation to the allowance of an administrative appeal, \u00a7 52-49 points to a procedural event that no longer can occur in bringing such an appeal, whether or not it ever did.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">We now conclude that whatever problems may have been created by the reference in \u00a7 52-49 to the allowance of appeals from administrative agencies without any prescribed procedure for such allowance have been resolved by the enactment of \u00a7 4-183 (b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and related provisions of our Uniform Administrative Procedure Act. The statute authorizing the present appeal, \u00a7 46a-95 (j), requires only that such an appeal be brought \u201cin accordance with section 4-183,\u201d except for a different venue provision. Section 4-183 (b) provides that appeals from administrative agencies \u201cshall be instituted by filing a petition in superior court . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>within forty-five days after mailing of the notice of the final decision of the agency . . . .\u201d It is undisputed that the plaintiff filed her petition on April 22, 1986, twenty-seven days after the CHRO mailed notice of its final decision on March 26,1986, and, therefore, complied with this requirement of \u00a7 4-183 (b). It is also uncontroverted that copies of the plaintiffs appeal were served within thirty days after the notice of the final decision of the agency had been mailed, as \u00a7 4-183 (b) further requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">No reference to a return day is contained in \u00a7 4-183 (b). We do not view this omission as any indication that there should be no restriction upon the plaintiffs choice of date for the defendant to appear in response to an administrative appeal. The provisions of \u00a7 4-183 entitling a person \u201caggrieved by a final decision\u201d to judicial review and prescribing the procedure for an administrative appeal also contain no reference to the allowance of such an appeal. Because the provision of \u00a7 52-49 for such an allowance is inoperative, as we have determined, and there is no precise point in our present procedure for an administrative appeal corresponding to the act of allowance, from which that statute measures its return day limitation, we conclude that the only effective limitation is the broadly applicable provision of General Statutes \u00a7 52-48 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Section 52-48 (b) provides that \u201c[a]ll process shall be made returnable not later than two months after the date of the process and shall designate the place where court is to be held.\u201d Although we have been unable to identify in our present administrative appeal procedure any step corresponding to the allowance of an appeal, it appears that the date of the process would usually conform closely to the date on which an appeal is allowed where that practice is still followed. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-275 and 45-294. The \u201cdate of the process,\u201d of course, refers to the date of the writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>summons or attachment which must be accompanied by the complaint. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-45a and 52-45b.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The writ of summons in this appeal is dated April 15, 1986,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and therefore the plaintiff\u2019s designation of the \u201c3th day of June, 1986,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as the return day complied with the two month limitation of \u00a7 52-48 (b). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing the appeal for failure to comply with \u00a7 52-49, which we conclude no longer has any legal force.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-4\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-49. appeals prom administrative officers, when returnable.
