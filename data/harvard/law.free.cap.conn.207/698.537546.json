Hennessey, J., </em>reversing a decision of the freedom of information commission (FOIC), wherein the FOIC had ordered that the named plaintiff,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the commissioner of consumer protection (commissioner), provide the defendants, The Jackson Newspapers, Inc. (Jackson Newspapers), and Joan Barbuto, with access to records regarding the distribution of controlled substances by physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The underlying facts relating to this appeal are not in dispute. On April 11,1984, Joan Barbuto, a reporter for the Jackson Newspapers, wrote to the commissioner, seeking disclosure of all documents generated by compliance meetings held within the last five years pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (c). A compliance meeting is held when an investigation by drug control agents of the department of consumer protection reveals evidence supporting the revocation of a physician\u2019s drug registration. The compliance meeting provides a physician with the opportunity to show that the drug control agent\u2019s report is without foundation, and is designed to foster voluntary settlements between physicians and the department of consumer protection so as to avoid the need for formal adjudicatory proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">The commissioner refused to disclose all of the information sought by Barbuto. Barbuto and Jackson Newspapers filed a formal complaint with the FOIC. After a hearing, the FOIC issued a decision ordering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>the commissioner to provide Barbuto and Jackson Newspapers with the requested material. The commissioner appealed that decision to the Superior Court, which sustained the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">On appeal to this court, the FOIC, Jackson Newspapers and Barbuto claim that the trial court erred in holding that: (1) the Freedom of Information Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 1-19, permits the nondisclosure of records generated by compliance meetings; (2) General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-306<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is applicable to compliance meetings held pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 2 la-323<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 4-182 (c);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (3) compliance meetings are not proceedings involving the question of licensure or right to practice. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The defendants\u2019 first claim is that the trial court erred in holding that the act permits the nondisclosure of records generated by compliance meetings. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The trial court found that the act provided a basis for the exemption of the documents in question by balancing the public\u2019s right to have access to the information requested by Barbuto with the governmental need for confidentiality, relying on <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 435 A.2d 353 (1980). The trial court found that the <em>Wilson </em>balancing test supported the exemption of the documents generated by the compliance meetings. The trial court erred in applying the balancing test to the act as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Freedom oflnformation Commission, </em>192 Conn. 310, 315, 472 A.2d 321 (1984), we stated that \u201c[t]he exemptions contained in \u00a7 1-19 reflect \u2018a legislative intention to balance the public\u2019s right to know what its agencies are doing, with the governmental and private needs for confidentiality. . . . [I]t is this balance of the governmental needs for confidentiality with the public right to know that must govern the interpretation and application of the Freedom of Information Act. The general rule, under the act, however, is disclosure. . . . Exceptions to that rule will be narrowly construed in light of the underlying purpose of the act . . . and the burden of proving the applicability of an exemption rests upon the agency claiming it.\u2019 <em>[Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 328-29].\u201d Thus, <em>Maher </em>clarifies the fact that the <em>Wilson </em>balancing test applies to the exemptions to \u00a7 1-19, rather than to the act as a whole. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 170-71, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Although there is no inherent exemption from disclosure under the act, the possibility exists that the information may fall within the state or federal law exception to \u00a7 1-19. Section 1-19 (a) provides that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by any federal law or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>state statute, all records maintained or kept on file by any public agency . . . shall be public records and every person shall have the right to inspect such records . . . Compliance meetings, held pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-182, may therefore be exempt from the general rule of disclosure, because General Statutes \u00a7 21a-306 provides that \u201c[information received by the . . . state department of consumer protection . . . shall not be disclosed publicly in such a manner as to identify individuals or institutions, except in a proceeding involving the question of licensure or right to practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">This brings us to the defendants\u2019 second claim, which concerns the applicability of \u00a7 2 la-306 to compliance meetings. The defendants claim that the trial court erred in applying \u00a7 21a-306 to compliance meetings held pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-323 and 4-182 because: (1) neither \u00a7 4-182 (c) nor \u00a7 21a-323 is found in the specific chapters mentioned in \u00a7 21a-306; and (2) the records in issue are created by the department of consumer protection rather than received by it in the form of filed reports. The plaintiffs maintain that the test for whether information is protected from disclosure under \u00a7 21a-306 depends upon the chapter under which the information was collected, rather than the chapter which provides for a proceeding involving licensure. Thus, the plaintiffs argue that chapter 420b, entitled \u201cDependency-Producing Drugs,\u201d is the authority from which the investigative power in \u00a7 21a-306 is derived.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Section 21a-306 further provides: <em>\u201cInformation received by the . . . state department of consumer protection . . . through filed reports, inspection or as otherwise authorized under chapters 382 and J/.18 and [chapter 120b] shall not be disclosed publicly </em>in such a manner as to identify individuals or institutions, except in a proceeding involving the question of licensure or right to practice.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>clearly refers to the inspection, record keeping and reporting provisions of those statutes. Chapter 382, pertaining to pharmacists, includes statutes authorizing the employment of inspectors; General Statutes \u00a7 20-179; and the preservation of prescription records for inspection. General Statutes \u00a7 20-184c. Chapter 418 contains similar provisions relating to food, drugs and cosmetics: investigations, inspections, records; General Statutes \u00a7 21a-116; inspection of records; General Statutes \u00a7 21a-117; and inspection of premises. General Statutes \u00a7 21a-118. Chapter 420b has similar but more restrictive requirements for dependency-producing drugs: record keeping; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 2la-248, 21a-249; record requirements; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-254, 21a-255; and inspection of records. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-261, 21a-265. The plain lanquage of \u00a7 21a-306 supports the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the statutes. See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 6, 434 A.2d 293 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The FOIC asserts in its reply brief that the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is not properly before this court because it is raised for the first time in this appeal. The FOIC claims that there is no evidence in the record concerning the source of the authority under which the records sought by Barbuto were generated. We disagree because we find as a matter of law that the commissioner necessarily relied, in his investigations relating to compliance hearings, on the statutes that come within the express ambit of \u00a7 2la-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The FOIC argues that the commissioner had another source of authority in the subpoena power conferred by \u00a7 21a-323 relating to \u201cControlled Substance Registration,\u201d and contained in chapter 420c. That section does not purport, however, to grant such subpoena power except as it pertains to a formal hearing concerning possible denial, suspension, revocation or refusal to renew a controlled substance registration. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>In other words, \u00a7 21a-306 is consistent with the provisions of chapter 420b in conferring subpoena power for revocation and suspension proceedings. See General Statutes \u00a7 21a-275. Section 21a-323 confers no subpeona power for compliance meetings. Other provisions in chapter 420b do confer broad investigatory authority not only for dependency-producing drugs, but also for controlled substances. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-261 and 21a-265. Thus, the investigations conducted by the commissioner in conjunction with compliance meetings necessarily were conducted under authority that brings those investigations within the shelter of \u00a7 21a-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Even if the plaintiffs\u2019 investigations initially fall within the nondisclosure provisions of \u00a7 21a-306, the defendants claim that they must be made public because \u00a7 21a-306 requires disclosure of information generated by \u201cproceedings involving the question of licensure or right to practice.\u201d The defendants urge us to overturn the conclusion of the trial court that compliance hearings do not constitute such proceedings. We disagree with the defendants and hold that for the purposes of \u00a7 2la-306 compliance meetings are not \u201cproceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Under \u00a7 21a-306, public disclosure is not required until the initiation of \u201cproceedings involving the question of licensure or right to practice.\u201d Section 21a-l-20a of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>vides in pertinent part: \u201cNo revocation, suspension or bonding requirement of any certificate, license or registration is lawful unless <em>prior to the institution of agency proceeding . </em>. . the holder thereof was given <em>the opportunity to show compliance </em>with all lawful requirements for the retention of the certificate, license or registration.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, by its terms a compliance conference is not an agency proceeding giving rise to the requirement of public disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In support of the argument that compliance meetings are proceedings, the defendants claim that although a compliance meeting is preliminary to formal revocation proceedings, it nonetheless is a \u201cproceeding\u201d under the statute. The defendants claim that because \u201cproceeding\u201d is not specifically defined in \u00a7 21a-306 or chapter 420b, the term must be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language, citing <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 566, 440 A.2d 767 (1981). The defendants\u2019 rendition of the law is accurate, but it is inapplicable to this case where the language of the relevant statutes and regulations clearly defines the opportunity to show compliance as an event occurring prior to the initiation of a \u201cproceeding involving the question of licensure or right to practice.\u201d See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>196 Conn. 309, 493 A.2d 846 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>(1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1063, 106 S. Ct. 813, 88 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1986). The clear and unambiguous language of these statutes leaves no room for construction nor any need to resort to the common meaning of the term \u201cproceeding,\u201d as urged by the defendants. See <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>197 Conn. 358, 497 A.2d 402 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-9\"> The other plaintiffs are the department of consumer protection and the deputy commissioner of consumer protection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-306 provides: \u201cInformation received by the department of health services, state department of consumer protection or commission of pharmacy through filed reports, inspection or as otherwise authorized under chapters 382 and 418 and this chapter shall not be disclosed publicly in such a manner as to identify individuals or institutions, except in a proceeding involving the question of licensure or right to practice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-323 provides: \u201cBefore denying, suspending, revoking or refusing to renew a registration, the commissioner shall afford the applicant an opportunity for hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54.
