(Nor\u2019easter), a subcontractor, to recover a balance due for labor and material furnished in the construction of a municipal swimming pool for the city of Torrington. The action was brought on a payment bond against Colossale Concrete, Inc. (Colossale), the general contractor and principal on the bond, and the Continental Casualty Co. (Continental), the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Colossale, as general contractor, built the pool pursuant to a contract with the city of Torrington. Pursuant to an agreement with the defendant Colossale, the plaintiff, a swimming pool contractor, was to supply the labor and material for the installation of a stainless steel overflow system, drain piping, and forms for a gutter groove channel in connection with the pool construction. In conformity with General Statutes \u00a7 49-41 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>the defendant Colossale, as principal, and the defendant Continental, as surety, furnished a bond in the amount of $230,000 guaranteeing payment to subcontractors supplying labor and material to the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The plaintiff alleged that it had performed labor and furnished material for the pool project commencing in October, 1982, and terminating in July, 1984. At trial, through its president, Walter Liff, the plaintiff offered evidence that it had properly completed its portion of the Torrington pool contract and that there remained a balance due it of $25,817.84. It is undisputed that this balance remained unpaid for more than ninety days after the plaintiff last supplied labor or material to the job, before Nor\u2019easter commenced suit under \u00a7 49-42 in October, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The defendant\u2019s president, Dominic Colossale, testified that Colossale had not paid the balance due on its contract with the plaintiff because the plaintiff\u2019s work was defective. He claimed that there were leaks in two of the drains installed by the plaintiff and that the city of Torrington would not accept the pool or pay Colossale the unpaid balance of approximately $75,000 on Colossale\u2019s contract with the city until the leaks were fixed. Dominic Colossale also testified that it had cost his company considerable money to locate the leaks and that he and others had attempted, without success, over a period of three years, to induce the plaintiff to correct the problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The trial court found for the plaintiff and rendered judgment for Nor\u2019easter to recover from the defendants the total amount claimed of $25,817.84 together with costs and interest at the legal rate from July 6, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court erred in: (1) awarding damages to the plaintiff when it had found for the defendants \u201con the issue of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>formance by the plaintiff\u201d; (2) finding for the plaintiff despite the fact that it did not comply with the notice provision of General Statutes \u00a7 49-4 la (b); and (3) awarding the plaintiff interest on the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The defendants first claim that the plaintiff cannot prevail because the trial court resolved the question of whether the plaintiff had performed its obligations under the contract with Colossale in the defendants\u2019 favor. That simply is not so. It is true that at the beginning of its memorandum of decision the trial court appears to have found \u201cthat the drains which Nor\u2019easter had installed were leaking.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It went on in its memor\u00e1ndum, however, to determine \u201cthat the plaintiff has in fact established its right to recover against Colossale\u201d and rendered judgment for the plaintiff for the full amount of its claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This seeming contradiction was clarified and resolved in the plaintiff\u2019s favor by the trial court\u2019s response to the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent motion for articulation. Therein the trial court stated that it had found \u201c(A) . . . that the plaintiff substantially performed its obligation under its contract with the defendant Colossale [and] (B) . . . that the defendant Colossale failed to establish that a leak in the pool drain system was caused by the negligence or improper workmanship of the plaintiff Nor\u2019easter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Whether a building contract has been substantially performed is ordinarily a question of fact for the trier to determine. <em>Edens </em>v. <em>Kole Construction Co., </em>188 Conn. 489, 494, 450 A.2d 1161 (1982); <em>Randolph Con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>struction Co. </em>v. <em>Kings East Corporation, </em>165 Conn. 269, 274, 334 A.2d 464 (1973); <em>Chinigo </em>v. <em>Ehrenberg, </em>112 Conn. 381, 384, 152 A. 305 (1930). The resolution of conflicting factual claims falls within the province of the trial court. <em>Edens </em>v. <em>Kole Construction Co., </em>supra 495; <em>Fairfield County National Bank </em>v. <em>DeMichely, </em>185 Conn. 463, 466, 441 A.2d 569 (1981). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. Practice Book \u00a7 3060D; <em>Superior Wire &amp; Paper Products, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Talcott Tool &amp; Machine, Inc., </em>184 Conn. 10, 17, 441 A.2d 43 (1981); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).\u201d <em>Edens </em>v. <em>Kole Construction Co., </em>supra, 494.

Id., 495; <em>Vesce </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>185 Conn. 328, 335, 441 A.2d 556 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Upon reviewing the entire record we can find no reason to disturb the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had substantially completed the contract with the defendant and was entitled to recover the full amount of its claim. The trial court\u2019s factual findings and ultimate conclusion are adequately supported by the record and are not clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 4061; see also <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>supra; <em>Howie\u2019s Painting Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ferreria, </em>12 Conn. App. 583, 584, 532 A.2d 1318 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The defendants next contend that the trial court erred when it determined that it was unnecesssary for the plaintiff to give the defendants the notice required by General Statutes \u00a7 49-41a (b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> before commencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>suit on the defendants\u2019 payment bond under General Statutes \u00a7 49-42. The defendants argue that \u00a7 49-41a (b) is an integral part of the statutory scheme that furnishes a subcontractor with a cause of action against the general contractor and the surety on a payment bond under \u00a7 49-42. The defendants claim that \u00a7 49-41a (b) must be read together with, and its notice provision applied to \u00a7 49-42. Therefore, they argue that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to give them the notice that they contend was required by \u00a7 49-41a (b) is a jurisdictional defect which requires \u201cthe plaintiffs claim [under \u00a7 49-42] to fail.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>A brief summary of the applicable provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 49-41, 49-41a (a) and (b), and 49-42 is necessary in order to place the defendants\u2019 claim in proper perspective. At all relevant times \u00a7 49-41 required that, before any contract exceeding $1000 could be awarded for the construction of a public work by the state or a municipality, the general contractor selected for the job furnish a surety bond in the amount of the contract for the protection of subcontractors supplying labor or materials in the prosecution of the work. Section 49-41a (a) required that a contract for a public work for which a payment bond was required contain a provision that the general contractor pay amounts due any subcontractor for labor or materials supplied, within forty-five days after payment to the general contractor by the state or municipality, when the labor or materials supplied by the subcontractor were included in the requisition of the general contractor paid by the state or municipality.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">At all relevant times, \u00a7 49-41a (b) provided that if payment was not made to a subcontractor in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 49-41a (a), \u201cthe subcontractor <em>shall set forth his claim against the general contractor ... by registered or certified mail. Ten days after the receipt of that notice </em>the general contractor shall be liable to its subcontractor ... for interest on the amount due and owing at the rate of one per cent per month. In addition, the general contractor, <em>upon written demand </em>of its subcontractor . . . shall be required to place funds in the amount of the claim, plus interest of one per cent, in an interest bearing escrow account in a bank in this state . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 49-41a (b) also provided that the general contractor could refuse to place the funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>in escrow if the subcontractor\u2019s claim was disputed. If the subcontractor prevailed on its claim in arbitration or litigation, however, the general contractor was responsible for the attorney\u2019s fees of the subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"AIH\">At all relevant times \u00a7 49-42 (a) provided that every person who had furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in a public works contract for which a payment bond was furnished under the provisions of \u00a7 49-41, and who had not been paid in full within ninety days after last performing labor or furnishing material, had the right to sue on the payment bond for the amount unpaid at the time of the institution of suit. It further provided that a person having a contractual relationship with a subcontractor, but none with the general contractor furnishing the payment bond, had a right of action on the payment bond, upon giving written notice detailing his claim, by registered or certified mail, to the general contractor within ninety days from the day on which that person last performed the labor or furnished the material for which the claim was made. Section 49-42 contained <em>no </em>provision that such notice was a prerequisite to a cause of action by a subcontractor who had a direct contractual relationship with the general contractor who had furnished the payment bond. It is the defendants\u2019 position, however, that \u00a7 49-41a (b) required the plaintiff to give the general contractor, Colossale, the notice provided in that statute before commencing suit under \u00a7 49-42. This, they claim, fills in a gap in the statutory scheme authorizing suit against the general contractor by a subcontractor with a direct contractual relationship. We disagree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Keeping in mind the entire statutory scheme relating to payment bonds on public works projects we conclude that, in light of their respective legislative histories and pertinent rules of statutory construction, \u00a7\u00a7 49-41a (b) and 49-42 are not interrelated but rather, are separate and distinct statutes designed by the legislature to accomplish separate and distinct ends and to afford separate and distinct remedies to subcontractors. They are not, as claimed by the defendants, interrelated so that compliance with the notice provision of \u00a7 49-41a (b) is a jurisdictional prerequisite for a subcontractor to commence suit on a payment bond under \u00a7 49-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Section 49-42 has its remote genesis in chapter 118 of the Public Acts of 1917.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Chapter 118 was enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>in reaction to the case of <em>National Fireproofing Co. </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>81 Conn. 632, 71 A. 911 (1909). <em>Norwalk </em>v. <em>Daniele, </em>143 Conn. 85, 86, 119 A.2d 732 (1955). <em>National Fireproofing Co. </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>supra, 635, held that a mechanic\u2019s lien could not lie against the state or any of its subdivisions. To ameliorate that situation chapter 118 of the Public Acts of 1917 required a general contractor to furnish a payment bond with surety for the protection of subcontractors who provided labor or material for public works projects. Until 1941, chapter 118 and its progeny required subcontractors having an unpaid claim for labor or material furnished in the execution of a public works project to file their claims, within sixty days after they had last furnished labor or material, with the officer or agent who had contracted for the public work on behalf of the state or its subdivision. If a subcontractor\u2019s claim \u201cwas correct,\u201d it was required to be paid by such officer or agent. The officer or agent then recovered the amount paid, together with costs, from the surety on the bond.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In 1941, the legislature enacted General Statutes \u00a7 695f,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a predecessor of \u00a7 49-42. Section 695f divested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the contracting agent or official of the state or municipality of the responsibility for the payment of a subcontractor\u2019s claims. That enactment established the basic procedural format for suit by subcontractors on public works projects which exists until the present day. That format gives the right and the responsibility to subcontractors having unpaid claims for labor and material to bring suit themselves on the general contractor\u2019s payment bond. Section 695f and subsequent versions of the statute, including the version of \u00a7 49-42 which existed at the time this plaintiff brought suit, required that only a subcontractor who had no direct contractual relationship with the general contractor need give notice to the general contractor within a specified period after last supplying labor or material before commencing an action on the bond.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They contained no provision that required a subcontractor who had a direct contractual relationship with the general contractor to give the general contractor notice of the subcontractor\u2019s claim before commencing suit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>On the other hand, the remedy afforded subcontractors by \u00a7 49-41a (b) did not exist in 1941 and was not initiated by the legislature until the 1969 legislative session, almost thirty years after the statutory framework giving a subcontractor the right to bring suit on a payment bond had been established. See Public Acts 1969, No. 427, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2. Furthermore, \u00a7 49-41a (b) did not even apply to municipalities until 1976; see Public Acts 1976, No. 76-164; although \u00a7\u00a7 49-41 and 49-42 and their predecessors had applied to municipalities since their passage in 1941. In 1969, the legislature passed Public Acts 1969, No. 427, which later became \u00a7 49-41a (b). Public Acts 1969, No. 427 required a general contractor who had failed to pay a subcontractor within forty-five days, after the general contractor had been paid by the state, to pay interest on the subcontractor\u2019s claim at the rate of 1 percent per month, commencing ten days after the receipt of notice by registered or certified mail of the subcontractor\u2019s unpaid claim'.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In his remarks on the floor of the Senate while introducing and urging the passage of Senate Bill No. 536, which became Public Acts 1969, No. 427, Senator John F. Pickett stated that \u201c[t]he obvious reason for the bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>is, that the general contractor does not, on the last payment of the job, use the subcontractor\u2019s money to commence other jobs.\u201d 13 S. Proc., Pt. 5,1969 Sess., p. 2168. Nowhere in Senator Pickett\u2019s remarks did he mention that the bill was related to \u00a7 49-42 or that its notice provision was, henceforth, to be a jurisdictional prerequisite for the commencement of an action on a payment bond under \u00a7 49-42. Furthermore, the subsequent legislative history of \u00a7 49-41a (b) is devoid of any indication of the existence of a relationship between \u00a7 49-4 la (b) and \u00a7 49-42 or that the notice requirement of \u00a7 49-41a (b) is applicable to \u00a7 49-42.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">It would be incongruous for the legislature to engraft a jurisdictional notice requirement on \u00a7 49-42, a statute that had existed in substantially the same form for over a quarter of a century prior to the enactment of \u00a7 49-41a (b), without spelling out that requirement unambiguously, let alone not mentioning it at all. If \u00a7 49-41a (b) were meant to create a notice requirement for the institution of suit under \u00a7 49-42 somewhere in its original wording, in its many revisions, or in its legislative history, such an intention would probably have been expressed in some form. Lacking such an expression we cannot imply the interpretation urged by the defendants. \u201cIn the interpretation of a statute, a radical departure from an established policy cannot be implied. It must be expressed in unequivocal language.\u201d <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>140 Conn. 650, 667, 103 A.2d 535 (1954); <em>Gomeau </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>176 Conn. 523, 527, 409 A.2d 1006 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Moreover, it is clear from its plain language and its legislative history that the purpose of \u00a7 49-41a (b) is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>penalize a general contractor on a public works project, who, without cause, withholds payment from a subcontractor. The statute is obviously designed to expedite the payment of proper claims to prevent a general contractor from unjustifiably using funds rightfully belonging to subcontractors. This is accomplished by requiring the general contractor, after notice of a subcontractor\u2019s unpaid claim, to escrow funds, to pay above market interest rates and to pay the subcontractor\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees if funds are not escrowed and the subcontractor prevails. The notice provision of \u00a7 49-41a (b) sets in motion that statute\u2019s own remedial machinery. It is not, however, a statutory prerequisite to the initiation of suit by a subcontractor under \u00a7 49-42, a remedy that existed long before \u00a7 49-41a (b) came on the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The defendants\u2019 final claim is that the trial court incorrectly awarded the plaintiff prejudgment interest on its claim. It is the defendants\u2019 contention that compliance with the notice provision of \u00a7 49-41a (b) is a prerequisite to an award of prejudgment interest to a subcontractor on a judgment obtained as a result of a suit on a statutory payment bond under \u00a7 49-42. We disagree. For the reasons set forth in part II of this opinion we conclude that the remedies afforded subcontractors by \u00a7\u00a7 49-41a (b) and 49-42 are independent and that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to give notice of its claims under the provisions of \u00a7 49-41a (b) did not prevent the trial court from awarding prejudgment interest at the statutory rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Interest \u201cmay be recovered and allowed in civil actions ... as damages for the detention of money after it becomes due and payable.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a. The allowance of interest as an element of damages is primarily an equitable determination and a matter within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Milgrim </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>v. <em>Deluca, </em>195 Conn. 191, 201, 487 A.2d 522 (1985); <em>Bertozzi </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>164 Conn. 463, 467, 323 A.2d 553 (1973). The plaintiff\u2019s suit against the defendants obviously falls within the category of \u201ccivil actions\u201d and our review of the record reveals no abuse of discretion. The trial court, therefore, did not err in awarding the plaintiff prejudgment interest.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-16\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-42 provides: \u201csuit on bond; when and how brought, (a) Every person who has furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract in respect of which a payment bond is furnished under the provisions of section 49-41 and who has not been paid in full therefor before the expiration of a period of ninety days after the day on which the last of the labor was done or performed by him or material was furnished or supplied by him for which the claim is made, has the right to sue on the payment bond for the amount, or the balance thereof, unpaid at the time of institution of the suit and to prosecute the action to final execution and judgment for the sum or sums justly due him. Any person having direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor but no contractual relationship express or implied with the contractor furnishing the payment bond shall have a right of action upon the payment bond upon giving written notice to such contractor within ninety days from the date on which the person performed the last of the labor or furnished or supplied the last of the material for which the claim is made, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed and the name of the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>to whom the material was furnished or supplied or for whom the labor was done or performed.

In addition, the general contractor, upon written demand of its subcontractor, or the subcontractor, upon written demand of its subcontractor, shall be required to place funds in the amount of the claim, plus interest of one per cent, in an interest-bearing escrow account in a bank in this state, provided the general contractor or subcontractor may refuse to place the funds in escrow on the grounds that the subcontractor has not substantially performed the work according to the terms of his or its employment. In the event that such general contractor or subcontractor refuses to place such funds in escrow, and the party making a claim against it under this section is found to have substantially performed its work in accordance with the terms of its employment in any arbitration or litigation to determine the validity of such claim, then such general contractor or subcontractor shall pay the attorney\u2019s fees of such party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b491-6\"> Public Acts 1986, No. 86-12, \u00a7 1, amending General Statutes \u00a7 49-41a (a), changed the time limit for payment by the general contractor to the subcontractor from forty-five days to thirty days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\"> This court has determined that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-41 and 49-42 are patterned after and operate in general conformity with the federal statutes popularly known as the \u201cMiller Act\u201d; 40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 270a through 270e; <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F.W.
