The plaintiff appealed from the defendant\u2019s assessment to the Superior Court, which found the rendering of such services was subject to the sales tax, and dismissed the appeal. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The trial court found the following facts. The Berlin police department maintained a card system of all police officers, to provide names of officers for off-duty assignments. When a request was made for such services, names were taken in rotation from these cards. When a police officer was on off-duty assignment, he was in uniform. When the assignment was completed, the department prepared and mailed an invoice to the recipient of the services, which was paid directly to the police officer involved. The department followed up on any unpaid invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The court concluded that the relationship between the contracting party and the off-duty officer was that of employer-employee. In support of this conclusion the court made additional factual findings as follows: (1) the contractor designated the working conditions for the officer and paid the officer directly by check; (2) the paychecks were payable to the officer and usually mailed to the person involved in care of the police department; (3) the contracting party made all the necessary deductions for income tax and social security; (4) the plaintiff was paid nothing by the contracting parties nor did it receive any other consideration from them; (5) the assignment procedure for this work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>was provided for in the collective bargaining agreement between the plaintiff and the police union; (6) the plaintiff, in prior periods, had collected a sales tax on the services; and (7) no such tax was collected during the period in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The court further concluded that: (1) the police services came within the purview of General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 and \u00a7 12-426-27 (b) (5) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies; (2) the plaintiff town was providing the services; (3) specific terms in article VI of the collective bargaining agreement between the plaintiff and the police union governed the procedures and hourly rates for such work; (4) local citizens desiring the services of off-duty officers had to go through the police department to make the necessary arrangements; and (5) the invoice sent to the user of services described the services as \u201crendered by the Berlin Police Dept.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court erred in: (1) determining that the plaintiff rendered a service subject to the sales tax; (2) determining that the plaintiff rendered services \u201cfor consideration\u201d; and (3) ruling that the services rendered were covered by General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (E). \u201c \u2018[Tjhe burden of proving any claimed exceptions to a tax is on the taxpayers. <em>Modugno </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>174 Conn. 419, 421 [389 A.2d 745 (1978)], as is the burden of proving that an assessment is erroneous. <em>H. B. Sanson, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>187 Conn. 581, 586 [447 A.2d 12 (1982)]. <em>Magic II, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>206 Conn. 253, 256, 537 A.2d 998 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">\u201cOn appeal, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous. See Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 3060D [now \u00a7 4061], This involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous. That is the standard and scope of this court\u2019s judicial review of decisions of the trial court. Beyond that, we will not go.\u201d <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">We need not tarry on the plaintiff\u2019s first claim. The plaintiff argues that it was not rendering a service but merely complying with the collective bargaining agreement with the police union. The defendant counters that the plaintiff performed functions in the assignment of off-duty work beyond that required in the union agreement. We consider these arguments to be Immaterial. Whether the plaintiff\u2019s part in the off-duty arrangements was wholly or partly mandated by the collective bargaining contract, the plaintiff\u2019s actions in that regard are determinative of its sales tax liability. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff was rendering services to the users of its police officers finds ample support in the facts articulated in its memorandum of decision. The court relied not only on the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement concerning provision of the services, such as hours, rates of pay, assignments and supervision and control of invoicing and payment, but noted that those desiring the services of off-duty police officers had to seek those services from the police department and not from the police officers directly. Further, the invoices for the services expressly stated that the services provided were rendered by the Berlin police department. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s resolution of this issue was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Concerning the plaintiffs second claim of error, the trial court had considered the question of consideration \u201cin view of the fact that the town received no direct monetary benefit since the entire payment went to the off-duty officer.\u201d The court cited General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (10) which provides that \u201c \u2018[business\u2019 includes any activity engaged in by any person or caused to be engaged in by him with the object of gain, benefit or advantage, either direct or indirect\u201d; and subsection (11) of that statute which provides, in pertinent part, that a \u201c \u2018[sjeller\u2019 includes every person . . .rendering any services described in any of the subdivisions of subsection (2) of this section . . . . \u201d Finally, the court found adequate consideration, concluding that there was \u201ca benefit to the town, either direct or indirect, in making available extra duty police work for added compensation to its union employees.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court discounted the plaintiffs claim that, since 1978, it no longer considered its officers employees for purposes of such assignments. The court found that whatever the relationship between the plaintiff and its police officers, it was rendering services to the user subject to the sales tax when it furnished off-duty police officers to users requesting such services. We concur with the trial court that the plaintiff benefited either directly or indirectly from the off-duty arrangement. The provision for such off-duty work in the union contract is obviously an important incentive to the plaintiffs police officers, both to enter police work and to approve the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff benefited to the extent that such a contract provision contributed to labor peace with its police officers. It is reasonable to conclude further that the plaintiff also benefited from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the added police presence in the town. The court did not err in finding that the plaintiff received adequate consideration for rendering police services.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The plaintiffs third claim of error is that the court erred in finding that the services rendered were covered by General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (E). The plaintiff contends that the services rendered were not \u201cexclusive of such services rendered by an employee for his employer\u201d under the provisions of that statute. This argument avails the plaintiff nothing, for it flies directly in the face of the trial court\u2019s finding that for sales tax purposes the employer-employee relationship in this case was that between the user of off-duty police services and the police officer involved. The plaintiff further argues that the court did not find that the off-duty work involved was included within the statutory categories of \u201cprivate investigation, protection, patrol work, watchman, or armored car service.\u201d The plaintiff filed no motion to the trial court to articulate further its memorandum of decision. \u201c \u2018Where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is unclear, \u201cproper utilization of the motion for articulation serves to dispel any such ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal. \u2018It remains the appellant\u2019s responsibility to secure an adequate appellate record, and under normal circumstances we will not remand a case to correct a deficiency the appellant should have remedied.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>190 Conn. 491, 494, 460 A.2d 1302 (1983). . . . \u2019\u201d <em>Stroiney </em>v. <em>Crescent Lake Tax District, </em>205 Conn. 290, 295-96, 533 A.2d 208 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The \u201crendering of police services by an off-duty policeman\u201d is, as noted, specifically made subject to the sales tax by \u00a7 12-426-27 (a) and (b) (5) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. The plaintiff claims, for the first time in its brief on appeal, that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>regulation is invalid as going beyond the legislature\u2019s intent. It claimed at oral argument that we should consider this claim of error under the \u201cplain error\u201d proviso of Practice Book \u00a7 4185. This claimed error falls far short of the \u201ctruly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 87-88, 502 A.2d 388 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(2) \u2018sale\u2019 and \u2018selling\u2019 mean and include . . . (i) the rendering of certain services for a consideration, exclusive of such services rendered by an employee for his employer, as follows . . . (D) private investigation, protection, patrol work, watchman and armored car services . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">The parties, in their briefs, and the trial court, in its memorandum of decision, designate the applicable statute \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (E). Public Acts 1986, No. 86-397, \u00a7 7, relettered this subdivision \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (D) but did not change its substance. For the sake of consistency, we refer to the statute as \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (E).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b306-11\"> Section 12-426-27 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in pertinent part: \u201cenumerated services</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">\u201c(a) The rendering of the following enumerated services for a consideration, defined in subsection (b) of this regulation, in this state on or after July 1, 1975, shall be a sale and subject to the sales tax. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">\u201c(b) Enumerated services. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">\u201c(5) Private investigation, protection, patrol, watchman and armored car services.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-15\">\u201cSuch services mean and include providing personnel or canines to patrol or guard property; engaging in detective or investigative duties; safeguarding or maintaining a surveillance of an individual; maintaining and monitoring mechanical protective devices, such as burglar and fire alarm systems; providing armored cars for the transportation of valuables; wrapping coins; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>setting up a payroll; and the rendering of police services by an off-duty policeman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">This regulation became effective April 7, 1980, amending its predecessor. The differences between the regulation as it existed before April 7, 1980, and as it appears here are not material to our disposition of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\"> The court\u2019s conclusion that adequate consideration existed makes it clear that the earlier conclusion of the court, cited above, that the town did not \u201creceive any other consideration\u201d from the contracting parties, was either an inadvertent misstatement or was meant to refer to consideration of a monetary nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
