Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7y\">This appeal arises out of an action for indemnification filed by the plaintiff, Barbara Beaudoin, against the defendant, Town Oil Company, Inc. (Town Oil). This claim arises out of another action in which the plaintiff attempted to implead the defendant via a third party complaint requesting indemnification, but the trial court, <em>Kelly, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the third party complaint. The plaintiff then filed the instant independent action on the same theory of indemnification and the court, <em>Kelly, J., </em>granted a motion to strike that complaint. The plaintiff\u2019s appeal on the latter motion to strike is before us on this appeal. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">It is appropriate to set out the facts and procedural history as revealed by the pleadings in this case. The plaintiff and her former husband, Ronald Stavens, owned a house in Vernon in 1976, in which the defendant, pursuant to a contract signed by it and Stavens, installed urea formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI). The defendant represented in the terms of the contract that the insulation was nontoxic, harmless and safe. Stavens subsequently transferred his interest in the property to the plaintiff incident to a divorce settlement. On September 23, 1983, the plaintiff sold the house to Thomas and Barbara Shubbuck. The Shubbucks filed an action against the plaintiff and other parties on April 9,1985. In the first count of their third amended complaint, the Shubbucks alleged that Marilyn Kuhnly, individually and d/b/a Century 21, acted as the agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>in the 1983 sale of the property and, during the negotiations, had stated falsely \u201cthat the residence was insulated with a safe material and did not contain urea formaldehyde foam insulation.\u201d The second count, also against Kuhnly individually and d/b/a Century 21, alleged that Kuhnly\u2019s conduct had constituted an unfair trade practice prohibited by General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b. The third count against Barbara Beaudoin alleged that she and her former husband falsely or without knowing either the truth or falsity, while falsely assuming knowledge, had stated that the home had been insulated with materials other than UFFI. The fourth count, against Kuhnly individually and d/b/a Century 21, alleged that Kuhnly\u2019s false representations had been made wilfully or wantonly in reckless disregard of the rights of the Shubbucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In that action, Beaudoin moved to implead Town Oil as a third party defendant pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-102a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court, <em>Kelly, J., </em>granted Town Oil\u2019s motion to strike the third party complaint because the \u201c \u2018plaintiff\u2019s [Shubbucks\u2019] claim against\u2019 the defendant seller [Beaudoin] is one for misrepresentation of a material fact, while [Beaudoin\u2019s] claim against the third-party defendant [Town Oil] is one for a defective product. None of the allegations of the third-party complaint supports a claim that the third-party defendant is somehow liable for all or part of the seller\u2019s misrepresentation of material faet. Each claim is entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>independent of the other.\u201d Beaudoin\u2019s motion for permission to amend the third party complaint was denied by the trial court, which then rendered judgment for Town Oil. Beaudoin has filed a timely appeal of this decision. The Shubbucks have also filed an independent action against the defendant Town Oil, seeking damages caused by the installation of UFFI.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The plaintiff then commenced the instant action by filing a six count complaint<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>alleging that it was liable on the basis of the product liability act; General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m et seq.; strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>liability, express and implied warranties, negligence and false representations. The plaintiff claimed indemnity for all or part of the damages alleged by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Shubbucks, including the expenses incurred by her in defending the action by the Shubbucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The defendant then filed a motion to strike this action on the ground that the complaint failed \u201cto state claims upon which relief may be granted in that [it fails] to state cognizable claims for indemnification and for the further reason that the Plaintiff should be collaterally estopped from claiming otherwise.\u201d The trial court, <em>Kelly, J., </em>granted the motion to strike. The plaintiff filed a motion for articulation and the trial court\u2019s memorandum<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> opined that the plaintiff had not made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>out a legally sufficient claim for indemnification for an exception to the general rule that there is no right to indemnity between joint tortfeasors, as outlined in <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Merberg Wrecking Corporation, </em>152 Conn. 405, 412, 207 A.2d 782 (1965). The conclusory memorandum did not point out which part of the four part <em>Kaplan </em>test that the plaintiff had failed to meet. Judgment was rendered for the defendant and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The plaintiff claims on appeal that the trial court erred in holding that her complaint was legally insufficient to support an action for indemnification. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that: (1) the plaintiff and the defendant are not joint tortfeasors, and thus the general rule against indemnification does not apply; (2) even if the plaintiff and the defendant are joint tortfeasors, there are other applicable exceptions to the <em>Kaplan </em>rule, such as the one outlined in \u00a7 886B (2) of the Restatement (Second) of Torts; (3) the active/pas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>sive distinction under the <em>Kaplan </em>test is not applicable to an indemnity claim based on products liability;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (4) even if the active/passive distinction under <em>Kaplan </em>applies, the plaintiff could be held liable for misrepresentations by Kuhnly, her former husband Stavens, and the defendant, thus making her conduct passive. In its brief, the defendant counters the plaintiffs arguments on indemnification and also asserts that the plaintiff should be collaterally estopped from relitigating the claim of indemnification since the issue was resolved by the trial court, <em>Kelly, J., </em>when it dismissed the previous third party complaint. Although more properly understood as the \u201cprior pending action doctrine\u201d rather than collateral estoppel; see <em>Halpern </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>196 Conn. 647, 652, 495 A.2d 264 (1981); we agree with the defendant that the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiffs complaint claiming indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\u201cIt has long been the rule that when two separate lawsuits are \u2018virtually alike\u2019 the second action is amenable to dismissal by the court. <em>Henry F. Raab Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>J. W. Fisher Co., </em>183 Conn. 108, 112, 438 A.2d 834 (1981).\u201d <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Aberman, </em>196 Conn. 359, 382, 493 A.2d 193 (1985); <em>Halpern </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra. The prior pending action doctrine has evolved as \u201ca rule of justice and equity\u201d; <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>22 Conn. 485, 494 (1853); and retains its vital<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ity in this state in which \u201cjoinder of claims and of remedies is permissive rather than mandatory.\u201d <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Aberman, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">This rule of justice and equity is always applicable when two suits are virtually alike and are brought in the same jurisdiction. <em>Halpern </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 652-53; <em>Henry F. Raab Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 112; <em>Dettenborn </em>v. <em>Hartford-National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>121 Conn. 388, 392, 185 A. 82 (1936); <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>supra. We have explained the doctrine as follows: \u201c Tt is so, because there cannot be any reason or necessity for bringing the second [lawsuit], and, therefore, it must be oppressive and vexatious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dettenborn </em>v. <em>Hartford-National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>supra, quoting <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>supra. \u201c \u2018The rule forbidding the second action is not, however, one \u201cof unbending rigor, nor of universal application, nor a principle of absolute law . . . .\u201d <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>[supra].\u2019 <em>Farley-Harvey Co. </em>v. <em>Madden, </em>105 Conn. 679, 682, 136 A. 586 (1927); see <em>Brochin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Importing Co., </em>137 Conn. 350, 352, 77 A.2d 336 (1950); <em>Dettenborn </em>v. <em>Hartford-National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>supra, 393.\u201d <em>Henry F. Raab Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>J. W. Fisher Co., </em>supra, 113; <em>Halpern </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 653. \u201cWe must examine the pleadings to ascertain whether the actions are \u2018virtually alike.\u2019 See <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Aberman, </em>supra, 383.\u201d <em>Halpern </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In the third party complaint<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to implead the defendant in the original action brought by the Shubbucks, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the plaintiff alleged a product liability claim under General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m et seq. The complaint alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>that: the third party defendant (defendant) had failed to warn the third party plaintiff (plaintiff) about the defective insulation; the defendant had misrepresented the insulation\u2019s safety to the plaintiff and general public; the defendant had failed to disclose the dangerousness of the insulation; the defendant had been negligent in failing properly to test it; the defendant had installed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the insulation in a defective manner; the defendant had continued to distribute the insulation although it knew or should have known of its dangerous characteristics; the defendant had breached an implied warranty of merchantability; and the defendant had breached its express warranties. The relief requested by the third party plaintiff Beaudoin entails indemnification for all liability incurred by her in the action by the Shubbucks (the plaintiffs in that case) and the costs of defending that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In the instant action, the plaintiff filed a six count complaint<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> against the defendant which asserted the following theories of liability: product liability, strict liability, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, negligence and illegal representations. The plaintiff sought money damages, punitive damages and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The complaint in the instant case appears at first glance to allege a different action, as the theories of liability do not contain verbatim allegations. On closer examination, however, the pleadings in each case request the same relief on the same underlying facts. The only difference is the precise wording of the theories of liability under which the defendant would be liable to the plaintiff for her own potential liability in the action by the Shubbucks. The crux of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, as outlined in both complaints, is that any damages that she is liable to pay the Shubbucks and the costs of defending the action are the direct result of the installation of the allegedly defective insulation by the defendant. The variations in the allegations of the theories of liability are merely different ways to characterize how the defendant\u2019s actions resulted in liability to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The modern trend, which is followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>in Connecticut, is to construe \u201cpleadings broadly and realistically, rather than narrowly and technically.\u201d <em>DeMartin </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, 4 </em>Conn. App. 387, 390, 494 A.2d 1222 (1985); see also <em>Fuessenich </em>v. <em>DiNardo, </em>195 Conn. 144, 150-51, 487 A.2d 514 (1985); <em>Schenck </em>v. <em>Pelkey, </em>176 Conn. 245, 255, 405 A.2d 665 (1978). In <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Vanguard Ins. Co., </em>192 Conn. 124, 126, 470 A.2d 244 (1984), when discussing a claim that a cause of action be divided into two counts, this court said that if \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s claims for relief grow out of a single occurrence or transaction or closely related occurrences or transactions they may be set forth in a single count and it does not matter that the claims for relief do not have the same legal basis.\u201d The same reasoning applies in this context. Whether the counts are listed separately or are subsumed under the product liability count is immaterial. All of the issues raised in this appeal of the trial court\u2019s ruling were raised in the previous third party complaint that was stricken by the trial court and already preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The policy behind the \u201cprior pending action doctrine\u201d is to prevent unnecessary litigation that places a burden on our state\u2019s already crowded court dockets. See <em>Dettenborn </em>v. <em>Hartford-National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>supra, 392. We have described the policy behind the impleader statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-102a, in a similar fashion: \u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 52-102a, like that of [Federal] Rule 14 (a), is clearly to obviate the multiplicity of actions. 3 Moore, Federal Practice (2d Ed.), f 14-04.\u201d <em>Senior </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>156 Conn. 92, 96, 239 A.2d 436 (1968). This court has also noted: \u201c \u2018The object of the [impleader] rule was to facilitate litigation, to save costs, to bring all of the litigants into one proceeding, and to dispose of an entire matter without the expense of many suits and many trials. . . .\u2019 <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>7 F.R.D. 140, 142 [1945].\u201d <em>Schurgast v. Schumann, </em>156 Conn. 471, 485, 242 A.2d 695 (1968). If litigants ignore the benefits of the impleader statute and courts refuse to encourage its use, the goal of efficient administration of justice will be injured. \u201c \u2018Parties cannot be permitted to waste the time of courts by the repetition in new pleadings of claims which have been set up on the record and overruled at an earlier stage of the proceedings.\u2019 <em>Hillyer </em>v. <em>Winsted, </em>77 Conn. 304, 306, 59 A. 40 (1904).\u201d <em>Friedlander </em>v. <em>Friedlander, </em>191 Conn. 81, 89, 463 A.2d 587 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Despite these principles of policy, the plaintiff, at oral argument, asserted that considerations of judicial economy cut the other way and she urges this court to decide the issue of whether the defendant is liable to the plaintiff under indemnity principles on this appeal, rather than wait for a final judgment below and the appeal at that time. We disagree. First of all, a favorable outcome to the plaintiff in the trial court would render her appeal of the striking of the third party complaint moot. More important, even though a judicial \u201cshortcut\u201d can be tempting in a case such as this, the implications of such an action and the message it would send to this state\u2019s litigants would be unfortunate. Any party that lost a motion in the trial court would be tempted and encouraged to file separate lawsuits on the same legal theory rather than to wait for the orderly process of appeal. The plaintiff conceded at oral argument that there were no issues presented on this appeal that could not be raised in an appeal of an adverse judgment below. We conclude that all the policy reasons for the prior pending action doctrine apply in this case and the trial court therefore did not err in dismissing the action. The plaintiff had the opportunity, of which she availed herself, to protect her rights by a timely filing of her notice of intent to appeal the striking by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the trial court of her earlier motion to implead Town Oil in the original action instituted by the Shubbucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-102a provides in part: \u201cimpleading of third PARTY BY DEPENDANT.

The plaintiff alleges that on April 9, 1985, Mr. and Mrs. Shubbuck filed suit against her alleging an action sounding in misrepresentation. A copy of the April 9, 1985 complaint is annexed to plaintiffs complaint. In the April 9,1985 complaint, the Shubbucks allege that they bought a house from the plaintiff, and the plaintiff made false representations to the effect that the house did not contain urea formaldehyde foam insulation. In the present action the plaintiff brings an action for indemnification claiming that the defendant, Town Oil Company, Inc., installed the insulation and alleging a violation of the products liability act, strict liability, express and implied warranties and negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-18\">\u201cOn April 2,1987, the defendant moved to strike the complaint. The court, <em>Kelly, J., </em>granted the motion without a written opinion on May 5, 1987. The plaintiff has now filed a motion for articulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-19\">\u201cA motion to strike tests the legal sufficiency of a pleading. <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 472 [427 A.2d 385] (1980). A motion to strike admits all well pleaded allegations. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bashura, </em>37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Conn. Sup. 745 [436 A.2d 785] (1981). The court must construe the facts in the complaint most favorably to the plaintiff. <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>182 Conn. 80 [438 A.2d 6] (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">\u201cThe defendant brings the motion to strike alleging that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is legally insufficient to support an action for indemnification. Indemnity involves a claim for reimbursement in full from one where primary liability is claimed to rest. <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Merberg Wrecking Corporation, </em>152 Conn. 405, 412 [207 A.2d 732] (1965). Ordinarily there is no right of indemnity between joint tort-feasors. Id. An exception to the general rule is that one tort-feaser may seek indemnity from another if the latter was \u2018primarily\u2019 negligent and the former only \u2018secondarily\u2019 negligent. <em>See Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Jacob Ruppert, Inc., </em>135 Conn. 307 [63 A.2d 849] (1949). One seeking indemnity on the ground of \u2018primary\u2019 negligence must show: (1) the indemnitor was negligent; (2) the indemnitor\u2019s negligence (rather than the indemnitee\u2019s) was the direct, immediate cause of the injury; (3) the indemnitor was in control of the situation to the exclusion of the indemnitee; and (4) the indemnitee did not know of the indemnitor\u2019s negligence, had no reason to anticipate it, and could reasonably rely on the indemnitor not to be negligent. <em>Kaplan </em>[v. <em>Merberg Wrecking Corporation, </em>supra, 416].</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">\u201cAccordingly, the court concludes that the allegations in the complaint are legally insufficient to indemnify the plaintiff for her misrepresentations. The motion to strike the complaint is granted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b599-7\"> While this appeal was pending, this court released <em>Kyrtatas </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>205 Conn. 694, 695, 535 A.2d 357 (1988), where we held that the active/passive distinction does not apply in the context of a statutory produet liability action. We concluded that the product liability act has abrogated common law principles in this area. Id., 702. The court, however, noted that its holding applied only to situations in which all potential defendants are parties to the suit. Id., 702 n.2. It also stated: \u201cWe noted in addition that this decision does not address the question of under what circumstances a party may seek indemnification for liability imposed upon him in a product liability suit through either a statutory or express contractual claim.\u201d Id., 703. Whether <em>Kyrtatas </em>controls this case is an issue whose resolution can await another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\"> The third party complaint provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">\u201cthird party complaint</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">\u201c1.
