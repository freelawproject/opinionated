We conclude that although an assessor, absent unusual circumstances that do not exist in this case, cannot be required to make such an interim revaluation of real property, he may do so in accordance with \u00a7 12-55, under appropriate circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">This action involves a tax appeal by the plaintiff from a decision of the defendant which affirmed the town assessor\u2019s upward reassessment of the plaintiff\u2019s property for the 1984,1985 and 1986 tax years. The plaintiff claimed that the reassessment was excessive and illegal and that, as a result, the plaintiff\u2019s property bore a disproportionate share of the tax burden in the town of Rocky Hill. The plaintiff moved for summary judgment, claiming, inter alia, that as a matter of law the defendant was barred from reassessing the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>property under the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 12-62.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court denied that motion. The court, in its memorandum of decision, stated that the plaintiffs reliance on <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>182 Conn. 619, 438 A.2d 782 (1981), for its claim that \u00a7 12-62 precludes interim revaluations, was misplaced. The court noted that, despite dicta in <em>Uniroyal, Inc., </em>that pursuant to \u00a7 12-62 \u201crevaluation . . . need only be available once each decade,\u201d the <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>court did not hold that more frequent revaluations are illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The court noted that a judgment of the Superior Court in 1982 found the fair market value of the property in question for the years 1979,1980 and 1981 to be $23,820,950. It further noted that in 1984 the plaintiff purchased the property for $57,539,739, an increase in value of 141 percent. The court relied on the affidavit of the Rocky Hill tax assessor that stated that he had examined that sale \u201cin light of all other recent residential and commercial property sales in Rocky Hill and found the assessment on the subject property to be grossly out of line with other assessments in the municipality .... Therefore, on October 1,1984, he reassessed the plaintiff\u2019s property pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-55 and 12-62 in order to keep the plaintiff\u2019s assessment consistent with other property assessments in the municipality.\u201d The court then concluded that the language of \u00a7 12-55 providing that \u201c[t]he assessors may increase or decrease the valu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>ation of property as named in any of such lists or in the last-preceding grand list,\u201d when read with the language in \u00a7 12-64 providing that all property \u201cshall be liable to taxation at a uniform percentage of its present true and actual valuation . . . to be determined by the assessors,\u201d empowered assessors to make interim adjustments in assessments. Finally the court stated that \u201ca question of fact exists as to the method the assessor used in making his revaluation and whether or not it conformed to Sec. 12-64.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">The plaintiff then moved for reargument of its motion for summary judgment, claiming that the case of <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>203 Conn. 425, 439-41, 525 A.2d 91 (1987), held that assessors are \u201cprecluded\u201d from making interim revaluations based on a change in the fair market value of the property \u201cattributable solely to changes in the market conditions.\u201d The court concluded that <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>\u201cclearly holds that the decennial revaluations of real property mandated by General Statutes \u00a7 12-62 [are] the exclusive remedy for the town to deal with changes in market values, and more frequent adjustments are not permitted.\u201d The court then rescinded its earlier decision denying the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted it. The defendant appealed from the judgment granting the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, claiming that the assessor had the power under \u00a7 12-55 to adjust the assessment in the interim years between decennial revaluations on the ground that the sale of the property in question shows that the property has greatly increased in value in relation to other properties in town.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The facts as found in the court\u2019s memorandum of decision, dated June 30,1987, on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for reargument are not in dispute. The plaintiff is the owner of a 941 unit apartment complex known as Century Hills located in Rocky Hill. Pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 12-62, the town of Rocky Hill conducted a general revaluation of local real estate, effective October 1,1979. The plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title had contested the 1979 revaluation for the years 1979, 1980 and 1981, which resulted in a final judgment that the true and actual valuation of the property for those years was $23,820,950 and that the assessment should be 70 percent of that figure. The plaintiff purchased the property on March 29, 1984, for $57,339,737. After that purchase, the tax assessor revalued and reassessed the plaintiff\u2019s property, finding the true valuation of the property as of October 1,1984, to be $41,987,500 and the assessed value $29,391,250</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The assessor stated in his affidavit that he \u201creassessed the subject property in light of the sale to the plaintiff and in light of the most recent assessment ratio available on or about October 1,1984. The revaluation and reassessment was not based on any new construction, physical improvements or changes in the use of the subject property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">In <em>Ralston Purina Co., </em>the plaintiffs<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appealed to the Superior Court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-118,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from the refusal of the defendant board of tax review of the town of Franklin to reduce the October 1,1982 tax assessments on their real and personal property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>in that town. The plaintiffs had claimed that the fair market value of their property had declined substantially since the last decennial revaluation conducted by the town, as evidenced by the subsequent sale of the property in 1983 at a price significantly below its assessed value. <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 428. The trial court did not discuss whether either of the plaintiffs was entitled to an interim adjustment of its property assessment, but adopted the implicit conclusion of an earlier judge in the case that the defendant was obligated to make such adjustments. The trial court sustained the appeals and ordered a reduction in the assessed values of the properties. This court found error in the court\u2019s ruling that the board of tax review was required, as a matter of law, to adjust the plaintiffs\u2019 tax assessments in the interim between decennial revaluations of the real property. We noted that an appeal under General Statutes \u00a7 12-118 conditions relief upon proof of failure to comply with \u00a7 12-64, which in turn provides that all real estate \u201c \u2018shall be liable to taxation at a uniform percentage of its present true and actual valuation . . . to be determined by the assessors.\u2019 \u201d Id., 434. The defendant in <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 435, relied principally on the language of General Statutes \u00a7 12-62 and this court\u2019s interpretation of that statute in <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra. The defendant board conceded that, under certain circumstances, such as the destruction or expansion of property, a substantial change in its use or zoning classification, or a decision by the taxpayer to go out of business, it would be required to conduct an interim revaluation of property. <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The plaintiffs in <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>argued that although \u00a7 12-62 requires revaluation of real estate at least every ten years it does not preclude such revalu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ation in appropriate circumstances. They emphasized particularly the express language of \u00a7 12-64 which provides that all nonexempt real property shall be taxed at its \u201cpresent true and actual valuation,\u201d defined in General Statutes \u00a7 12-63 as the \u201cfair market value thereof and not its value at a forced or auction sale.\u201d The plaintiffs then claimed that an adjustment in their assessments was required pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-55 which states in part that \u201cassessors may increase or decrease the valuation of property as named in . . . the last-preceding grand list.\u201d The plaintiffs conceded that \u00a7 12-55 appeared to be permissive but that when read in context with \u00a7\u00a7 12-62 through 12-64 it mandates the reassessment they sought. <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 436-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">This court noted that the issue of whether assessors are required to conduct interim revaluations of property to account for the effect of changes in market conditions was not addressed by the pertinent statutes. The court then stated: <em>\u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the statutes, standing alone, is therefore as plausible as the defendant\u2019s interpretation. . . . </em>[Hjowever, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument directly contradicts our interpretation of \u00a7 12-62 in <em>[Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra].\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We then stated: \u201cWe held in <em>[Uniroyal, Inc.,] that the decennial revaluation of real property mandated by </em>\u00a7 12-62 is the exclusive remedy provided by the legislature \u2018for variations in the effect of market conditions on different parcels . . . . \u2019 <em>[Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 629]. Indeed, the procedure established in \u00a7 12-62 reflects the legislative judgment that the remedy of revaluation \u2018need only be available once each decade,\u2019 rather than any time property values fluctuate in response to market conditions. [Id.]; <em>see Kays, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>[170 Conn. 477, 480, 365 A.2d 1207 (1976)]; <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>141 Conn. 129, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>134-35, 104 A.2d 212 (1954). The plaintiffs\u2019 reliance upon \u00a7 12-64 is therefore misplaced because \u00a7 12-64, in contrast to \u00a7 12-62, \u2018is concerned with the manner of taxation, not the frequency of valuation, and it does not purport to require assessors to be updated on their valuations at all times.\u2019 <em>Kays, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra; <em>[Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 629].\u201d Id., 437-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">This court concluded that the legislature was aware that \u201ceven though property values may fluctuate within a ten year period, it is neither realistic nor necessarily desirable to require more frequent property revaluations.\u201d Id., 438. The court found that it was bound by the interpretation of \u00a7 12-62 in <em>Uniroyal, Inc., </em>since the plaintiffs did not provide a convincing rationale for the court to depart from that interpretation. Id., 439. \u201cSince the legislature has not amended \u00a7 12-62 subsequent to our decision in <em>Uniroyal, Inc., </em>we can discern no reason now to amend that statute judicially so as to alter the apparent intent of its drafters to preclude, as a general rule, interim revaluations of real property.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The plaintiffs in <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>attempted to distinguish <em>Uniroyal, Inc., </em>on the ground that the plaintiffs in that case claimed that they were bearing a disproportionately high burden of taxes while in <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>they claimed only that the fair market value of their property had declined in the interim period between decennial revaluations. In <em>Ralston Purina Co., </em>we declared: \u201cIn the context of this case, however, this distinction has no significance. Although the plaintiffs here rely upon different grounds in challenging their tax assessments, they seek the same relief requested by the plaintiffs and denied by this court in <em>[Uniroyal, Inc.,] </em>an interim revaluation of their property. As we concluded in <em>[Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 629], the legislature, in \u00a7 12-62, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>has precluded such interim revaluations except in unusual circumstances, which did not exist in that case and likewise do not exist here. The plaintiffs presently before us are therefore no more entitled to an interim adjustment of their tax assessments than were the plaintiffs in <em>[Uniroyal, Inc.]\u201d </em>Id., 440. The court remanded both cases with direction to render judgments for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The defendant in this case first argues that the <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>ruling denying mandatory interim revaluation does not apply to a case where the board is operating permissively under \u00a7 12-55. The defendant argues that, except for the generally recognized narrow exceptions where interim reassessment is allowed, the board and the assessors would have a greatly restricted function if they were not able to equalize assessments between decennial revaluations. It claims that just as \u00a7 12-55 states that an assessor \u201cshall equalize\u201d the lists \u201cif necessary,\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-111 states that \u201c[s]uch board [of tax review] may equalize and adjust the valuations and assessment lists of such town[s]. . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In its second briefed argument, the defendant, citing <em>Kays, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, claims that its interpretation of the effect of \u00a7 12-55 does not leave the taxpayer unprotected because he has a remedy if he shows that he has assumed a disproportionate tax burden, a claim the plaintiffs in <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>did not make. The defendant claims that the <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>majority\u2019s statement that the lack of an allegation in that case of a disproportionate burden \u201chas no significance\u201d contradicts <em>Uniroyal, Inc.\u2019s </em>pronouncement that \u201c \u2018[t]he plaintiffs would be entitled to relief under \u00a7 12-118 if [they] could prove that [their] property was bearing a disproportionately high tax burden because of the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 12-64.\u2019 \u201d <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 626. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Thus, it finally argues, the assessor\u2019s remedy under \u00a7 12-55 when a taxpayer\u2019s assessment is disproportionately low is the corollary of the taxpayer\u2019s remedy under \u00a7 12-118 when his assessment is disproportionately high.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The plaintiff in its brief relies solidly on language previously cited in <em>Ralston Purina Co., </em>which in turn cited <em>Uniroyal, Inc., </em>to the effect that an increase or decrease in the sale price of real property which reflects a change in market conditions may only be adjusted as part of a general revaluation pursuant to \u00a7 12-62. The plaintiff quotes the <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>court which stated that the average ratio of the assessed values of properties to their actual selling prices was \u201cnot applicable to discrepancies in valuation which arise during the ten-year period between valuations.\u201d <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The plaintiff stresses that the limitation on the assessor\u2019s power to make interim revaluations, only in the unusual circumstances referred to in <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 435-46, is also reflected in two statutory exceptions, General Statutes \u00a7 12-53a, permitting a reassessment where new construction is completed on property between revaluations, and General Statutes \u00a7 12-64a, authorizing a reduction in the assessed value of property upon the demolition and removal of damaged buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The plaintiff points out that the defendant\u2019s argument is exactly that raised by Justice Shea\u2019s dissent in <em>Ralston Purina Co., </em>when Justice Shea argued that \u00a7 12-55 should be read to authorize assessors to \u201cincrease or decrease the valuation of property\u201d in fulfillment of their duty to \u201cequalize\u201d the annual tax lists of a town but only \u201cwhen special circumstances pertaining only to one property result in a substantial change in its value.\u201d Id., 442. The plaintiff\u2019s conclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ing argument is that \u00a7 12-55 is no more than an administrative statute which sets forth the procedure for noticing a change in the valuation of property. It provides, the. plaintiff claims, no independent authority upon which an assessor may rely in making such a change, other than permitting the making of assessments \u201comitted by mistake\u201d or \u201crequired by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">We look first to the holding in <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra. The plaintiffs, pursuant to \u00a7 12-118, appealed to the Superior Court from the refusal of the board of tax review to reduce the valuation of its land and buildings in Middlebury. The trial court rendered judgment for the defendant on the ground that the plaintiffs were not aggrieved by the action of the board and the plaintiffs appealed to this court. Id., 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Although not explicitly articulated in <em>Uniroyal, Inc., </em>it is clear from the above facts that the plaintiffs were seeking mandatory interim revaluation. Their first argument was that the trial court erred in not concluding that their property was bearing a disproportionately high burden of taxes in Middlebury and in failing to equalize the tax burden to that of other property in the town. Id., 622. This court discussed \u00a7 12-64, providing that all nonexempt real estate \u201cshall be liable to taxation at a uniform percentage of its present, true and actual valuation to be determined by the assessors . . . . \u201d Id., 623. It then analyzed the plaintiffs\u2019 extensive expert testimony concerning the average ratio of the assessed values of Middlebury properties to their actual selling prices for certain years in question. Id. The court then discussed at length the use of average ratio analyses to establish the unfairness of assessment practices. Id. It then pointed out that the plaintiffs introduced the average ratio evidence in an effort to demonstrate that although the assessor applied a 65 percent valuation factor to their property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>they actually applied a much lower valuation to other Middlebury property. It stated that \u201c[s]uch a practice would violate the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 12-64. The plaintiffs would be \u2018entitled to relief under \u00a7 12-118 if [they] could prove that [their] property was bearing a disproportionately high tax burden because of the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 12-64.\u2019 <em>Kays, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>481, quoting <em>Lerner Shops of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>[151 Conn. 79, 86, 193 A.2d 472 (1963).] As our cases indicate, relief under \u00a7 12-118 is conditioned upon proof of failure to comply with \u00a7 12-64.\u201d Id., 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The court then found that the average ratio evidence did not prove any violation of the statutory assessment scheme. Id., 627. The court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 property most likely benefited from continued use of the 1971 valuation figures for assessment purposes throughout the 1970s and the failure of the 1971 figures to reflect property value increases in subsequent years, as much as any other property owner. Such variation accruing within ten year periods is a permissible variation under \u00a7 12-62. Id., 629. It then made the statement previously cited, that \u201cin Connecticut, the remedy for variations in the effect of market conditions on different parcels is set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 12-62. The remedy of revaluation was established by the legislature and it was the judgment of the legislature that the remedy need only be available once each decade.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">It is not necessary to consider the defendant\u2019s claim that there is a conflict between <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>and <em>Uniroyal, Inc., </em>for in the context of this case this court\u2019s quotation in <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>(p. 438) from <em>Uniroyal, Inc., </em>(p. 629) that the procedure in \u00a7 12-62 \u201cneed only be available once each decade\u201d is dicta. The language \u201cneed only be available\u201d refers to a mandatory reassessment. That case has no bearing on the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>permissive interim revaluation as a <em>power </em>of the assessors under \u00a7 12-55, nor did <em>Uniroyal, Inc., </em>on which <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>relied, concern the question involved in this case. Further, the right of a taxpayer to seek interim relief under \u00a7 12-118 on a claim of a disproportionate burden need not come into play. The resolution of the issue in this case requires only that we go directly to the plain language of \u00a7 12-55, shorn of any irrelevant judicial gloss adhering to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Section 12-55 contains three operative phrases pertinent to our inquiry: (1) \u201cWhen the lists of any town have been so received or made by the assessors, <em>they shall equalize the same, </em>if necessary\u201d; (2) <em>\u201cmake any assessment omitted by mistake or required by law\u201d; </em>and (3) \u201d <em>the assessors may increase or decrease the valuation of property as named in any such lists or in the last preceding grand list. ... \u201d </em>(There follow directions for notice to a taxpayer in the event of an increased assessment.) (Emphasis added.) There is no ambiguity in this broad grant of powers to assessors. It is a clear legislative mandate to grant to local assessors a continuing duty unrelated to decennial revaluations, to achieve administratively a fair and equal assessment for all taxpayers. The power to equalize the lists, if necessary, imports a watchtower role for the assessor to correct inequalities, whether too high or too low. The \u201cif necessary\u201d language clearly comprehends interim changes in assessments for there is no such requirement in \u00a7 12-62 which mandates decennial revaluations. The latter have obviously been legislatively deemed necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The plaintiff claims that \u00a7 12-55 only authorizes changes \u201comitted by mistake\u201d or \u201crequired by law.\u201d Such a restrictive interpretation ignores the plain language of the statute. The fact that these two additional powers are specifically set out does not in any way limit the broad power to equalize assessments provided for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>earlier in the statute. The most logical interpretation of the effect of these two additional powers is that in addition to the power to equalize assessments the assessors are also empowered to make these specified changes. Assessing property omitted by mistake is a common sense administrative duty having no relation to the \u201cequalizing\u201d function of the assessors. The same may be said of the added function of making any assessment \u201crequired by law.\u201d If it is required by law, the assessors are required to make it whether or not it is included in this section. Finally, the statute specifically gives to assessors the power to increase or decrease the value of assessed property. \u201c \u2018[Statutes should be construed so that no part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant and unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel.

The trial court declared in its memorandum of decision denying the plaintiffs first motion for summary judgment, that there existed a question of fact as to the method the assessor had used in making his revaluation and whether it conformed to \u00a7 12-64.

Healey, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Amo\">dissenting. I do not agree with the majority that \u201ca municipal assessor has the power, under General Statutes \u00a7 12-55, to increase a real property assessment between decennial revaluations on the ground that a sale of property in question demonstrates that the property has greatly increased in value in relation to other properties in the municipality.\u201d I, therefore, dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The majority reads \u00a7 12-55 as \u201ca clear legislative mandate to grant to local assessors a continuing duty unrelated to decennial revaluations, to achieve adminsitratively a fair and equal assessment for all taxpayers.\u201d This \u201cpower to equalize the lists, if necessary,\u201d the majority opines, \u201cimports a watchtower role for the assessor to correct inequalities, whether too high or too low.\u201d The \u201cif necessary\u201d language, the majority goes on, \u201cclearly comprehends interim changes in assessments for there is no such requirement in [General Statutes] \u00a7 12-62 which mandates decennial revaluations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">I do agree with the majority that \u201cstatutes should be construed so that no part of a legislative enactment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>is to be treated as insignificant and unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Kennedy </em>v. <em>Frauwirth, </em>167 Conn. 165, 168, 355 A.2d 39 (1974). Statutes relating to the same subject matter, such as the property tax assessment statutory scheme, may be looked to for guidance in reaching an understanding of the meaning of a statutory term. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 58, 392 A.2d 491 (1978). Where we have, as we do here, a statutory scheme for property tax assessments, we should \u201cmake every effort to construe a statutory scheme as a consistent whole.\u201d <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Ulichny, </em>185 Conn. 145, 149, 440 A.2d 885 (1981). Needless to say, prior decisions of this court, especially recent decisions touching on relevant statutory constructions, are entitled to weighty consideration. This is especially significant where this court interprets a statute and the legislature fails to take action to change that interpretation, thus raising a presumption that the legislature has acquiesced in that interpretation. <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>203 Conn. 425, 439, 525 A.2d 91 (1987); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 45.10. \u201cIt is fundamental. . . that departure from the literal construction of a statute is justified when such a construction would produce an absurd and unjust result and would clearly be inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the act in question.\u201d 2A J. Sutherland, supra; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 563, 429 A.2d 960 (1980). Courts are warranted in presuming that a reasonable and rational result was intended by the legislature. <em>See Norwich Land Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>170 Conn. 1, 4, 363 A.2d 1386 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">I, therefore, do not find the \u201cclear legislative mandate\u201d granted municipal assessors that the majority does in \u00a7 12-55. That statute is \u201cindeed administrative,\u201d as even the defendants specifically concede in their brief. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>entitled \u201cLists; notice of increase; public inspection; abstracts.\u201d Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 12-62, entitled \u201cPeriodic revaluation of real estate.\u201d Section 12-55 sets out the administrative procedure for the assessor to follow for giving notice of a change in the valuation of property. The first sentence of \u00a7 12-55 has been literally the same in this statute for at least seventy years. In like fashion, the language of the second sentence, \u201cThe assessors may increase or decrease the valuation of property as named in any such lists, or in the last preceding grand list...\u201d has been literally the same for at least seventy years. The only amendment to this statute over this period concerns to whom and how the notice of any increase<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in valuation is to be given. It strikes me as highly unusual, from a practical standpoint, that if the \u201cclear legislative mandate\u201d the majority finds in \u00a7 12-55 exists, no point has been made by counsel for the town that this is the manner in which assessors have treated \u00a7 12-55 at least for the last seventy years.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">In my view, \u00a7 12-55 gives assessors the authority to equalize, \u201cif necessary,\u201d because of any assessment that was either \u201comitted by mistake\u201d or \u201crequired by law.\u201d I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s interstitial judicial legislation of the \u201cif necessary\u201d language of this statute. If anything is clear in the contested portion of \u00a7 12-55, it is that the assessor equalizes the list when there are omissions or something \u201crequired by law\u201d that makes it \u201cnecessary.\u201d I note that the majority is silent about what \u201crequired by law\u201d means. I suggest that it is quite plausible that it includes, if it is not confined to, those circumstances reasonably within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>reach of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-53a<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 12-64a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 12-53a permits reassessment between decennial revaluations where new construction is completed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>property. Section 12-64a authorizes an adjusted assessment value whenever a building is damaged, demolished and removed as set out in that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">This statute, i.e., \u00a7 12-55, does not confer upon the assessor the authority that the majority grants that officer. To so hold practically turns the majority opinion in <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, on its head despite the present majority\u2019s exegesis of <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>182 Conn. 619, 438 A.2d 782 (1981).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>majority rejected the claims of the dissent in that case that \u00a7 12-55 should be read to authorize assessors to \u201cincrease or decrease the valuation of property\u201d to carry out their task to \u201cequalize\u201d the lists \u201cwhen special circumstances pertaining only to one property result[s] in a substantial change in its value.\u201d <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 442 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). In rejecting that argument, the <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>majority referring to <em>Uniroyal, Inc., </em>said that the assessor was precluded under \u00a7 12-62, from making interim revaluations absent certain circumstances which it found nonexistent in <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>439. In that case, the \u201ccertain circumstances\u201d were said to be \u201csuch as the destruction or expansion of property, a substantial change in its use or zoning classification, or a decision by the taxpayer to go out of business . . . . \u201d Id., 435-36; see generally General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-53a and 12-64a. None of those existed in <em>Ralston Purina Co., </em>none of those exist in this case, and \u00a7 12-55 cannot reasonably be interpreted in this case to accomplish here what our construction of \u00a7 12-62 in <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>and <em>Uniroyal, Inc., </em>precluded. The <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>majority properly noted that we would not reexamine our interpretation of \u00a7 12-62 set out in <em>Uniroyal, Inc., </em>because the legislature had not amended \u00a7 12-62 after <em>Uniroyal, Inc. Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 439. I submit that it is also unnecessary to do so in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Not only is this decision inconsistent with <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>on a jurisprudential basis, it raises serious concerns about fairness to the property owners of this state. Since <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>is still good law, a property owner is not required to be given any interim relief, absent special circumstances, even if his property has a drop in value. This is so even though the majority purports to assign a \u201cwatchtower role for the assessor to correct inequalities, whether <em>too high </em>or too low.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, despite the majority\u2019s claim, to borrow a metaphor from another dissent, \u201c[ajfter you have brushed the foam off the beer\u201d; <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 658, 376 A.2d 359 (1977) <em>(Loiselle, J., </em>dissenting); the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 12-55 does not truly \u201cequalize\u201d property assessments. They <em>may </em>increase an assessment whenever the present assessment is low as compared to similar properties, but <em>may </em>choose <em>not </em>to decrease the assessment of a property owner who has suffered a decrease in the value of his property such as a decrease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>of approximately 70 percent in value that we refused to recognize in <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>This unfairness highlights the flaw in the majority\u2019s analysis of the statutory scheme. I conclude that \u00a7 12-62, entitled \u201cPeriodic revaluation of real estate,\u201d is the operative statute. Under any logical and consistent reading of <em>Ralston Purina Co., </em>not only may the tax assessor not be forced to decrease an assessment on a taxpayer\u2019s property, but that officer cannot increase a taxpayer\u2019s assessment, absent certain limited circumstances, except every ten years under \u00a7 12-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">I would affirm the trial court, and, accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-5\"> It is interesting to note that although General Statutes \u00a7 12-55 does have language that says that \u201c[t]he assessors may increase or decrease the valuation of property as named in any of such lists . . . \u201d it only provides for notice to the person (presumably the taxpayer) of any <em>increase </em>in the valuation. This statute is silent on the matter of notice to be given in the event of any <em>decrease.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b283-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-53a, entitled \u201cAssessment and taxation of new real estate construction,\u201d provides in part: \u201c(a) Completed new construction of real estate completed after any assessment date shall be liable for the payment of municipal taxes from the date the certificate of occupancy is issued or the date on which such new construction is first used for the purpose for which same was constructed, whichever is the earlier, prorated for the assessment year in which the new construction is completed.
