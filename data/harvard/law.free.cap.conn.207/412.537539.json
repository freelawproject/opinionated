The petition alleged an illegal confinement in that the warden had calculated the petitioner\u2019s 120 day sentence following a third conviction for operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> without reducing the sentence by the \u201cgood time\u201d and \u201cemployment\u201d credits to which he was entitled under General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (c) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u00a7 18-98a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">The habeas court concluded that the language of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prohibited any reduction of the 120 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>day sentence and, therefore, dismissed the application. The petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The issues presented by this appeal are: (1) did the court err in concluding that those convicted of a third violation of \u00a7 14-227a are not entitled to the statutory \u201cgood time\u201d and \u201cemployment\u201d credits with respect to the first 120 days of their sentences; and (2) does the denial of these credits to the petitioner deny him the equal protection of the laws in violation of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States and article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution? We answer both questions in the negative and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Examination of the record discloses that on September 19, 1986, the petitioner pleaded guilty for a third time to the offense of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a. The court forthwith ordered him imprisoned for a term of 120 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">During his entire confinement, the petitioner served his sentence with good conduct and obedience to the rules and was, therefore, eligible for the \u201cgood conduct\u201d credit that would have reduced the length of his confinement pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (c). See footnote 2, supra. In addition, beginning on October 10, 1986, he was employed within the institution as a carpentry class aide for a period of seven consecutive days within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 18-98a; see footnote 3, supra; thus qualifying him for further reductions in the length of his confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The warden calculated the petitioner\u2019s release date as January 16,1987, i.e., 120 days from September 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>1986, the date of sentencing. If the sentence reduction credits had been applied, the release date would have been December 14, 1986.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person who violates any provision of [General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a] (a) ... shall . . . for conviction of a third violation . . . [be] imprisoned not more than two years, <em>one hundred twenty days of which may not be suspended or reduced in any manrier </em>. . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) The habeas court agreed with the warden\u2019s contention that the statute\u2019s limitation on suspending or reducing the first 120 days of the mandatory prison term operated as an absolute bar to applying the sentence reduction credits otherwise available under General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (c) and \u00a7 18-98a. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The petitioner points out that the \u201cgood time\u201d credit statute, \u00a7 18-7a (c), was initially enacted in 1976; Public Acts 1976, No. 76-358; and that the \u201cemployment\u201d credit statute, \u00a7 18-98a, was enacted in 1969. Public Acts 1969, No. 298. The amendment to \u00a7 14-227a that established the current mandatory minimum sentence was enacted in 1985. Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387. The petitioner argues that the only way to harmonize this later amendment with the earlier enactments dealing with the same subject is to construe the phrase \u201cmay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>not be suspended or reduced in any manner\u201d as a limitation only on actions by the court and not on actions by the commissioner of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The General Statutes, however, contain many provisions in which the sentencing authority of the court is limited. In each instance the statute clearly states: \u201cmay not be suspended or reduced <em>by the court.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) In view of the consistent use of the phrase \u201cby the court\u201d when imposing a sentencing limitation on the court, it logically follows that had the legislature intended that the limitation of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) apply only to actions by the court, the language would have read \u201cmay not be suspended or reduced <em>by the court. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) \u201c[T]he use of different words [or the absence of repeatedly used words in the context of] the same [subject matter] must indicate a difference in legislative intention. <em>Fritz </em>v. <em>Madow, </em>179 Conn. 269, 272, 426 A.2d 268 (1979).\u201d <em>Steadwell </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>186 Conn. 153, 164, 439 A.2d 1078 (1982) <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">There are three further principles of statutory construction that militate against the position advanced by the petitioner. First, \u00a7\u00a7 18-7a (c) and 18-98a are statutes of general applicability that provide for \u201cgood time\u201d and \u201cemployment\u201d credits in connection with all sentences. The sentence credit limitation of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>concerns one specific sentence, i.e., that following a conviction for a third violation of \u00a7 14-227a. \u201c \u2018It is a well-settled principle of construction that specific terms covering the given subject matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling. <em>Charlton Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>153 Conn. 103, 110, 214 A.2d 354 [1965].\u201d <em>Budkofsky </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>177 Conn. 588, 592, 419 A.2d 333 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Second, as we have noted, the \u201cemployment credit\u201d statute was originally enacted in 1969. Public Acts 1969, No. 198. The \u201cgood time credit\u201d became law in 1976. Public Acts 1976, No. 76-358. The limiting language of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) was appended to \u00a7 14-227a in 1985, some nine years later. Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387. \u201c[L]ater enactments are presumed to repeal [or be inapplicable to] earlier inconsistent ones to the extent of the conflict, regardless of the specific or general character of the later enactment.\u201d <em>Keogh </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>187 Conn. 53, 65, 444 A.2d 225 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Finally, we note that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them. And it is always presumed to have intended that effect which its action or non-action produces.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Staub, </em>61 Conn. 553, 566, 23 A. 924 [1892].\u2019 <em>New Haven Water Co. </em>v. <em>North Branford </em>[174 Conn. 556, 564-65, 392 A.2d 456 (1978)].\u201d <em>Beccia </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>185 Conn. 445, 458-59, 441 A.2d 131 (1981).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>We conclude that the 1985 amendment to \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) establishes a 120 day mandatory minimum sentence for third time drunk driving offenders and that the habeas court correctly construed the statute when it concluded that the sentence credits otherwise available were inapplicable to the sentences of those persons convicted of a third violation of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The petitioner next argues that the singular unavailability of \u00a7\u00a7 18-7a (c) and 18-98a to third time drunk driving offenders violates his right to the equal protection of the laws in violation of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States and article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u201c[T]he constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 20, is the state counterpart of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States. These provisions of the federal and state constitutions \u2018have the same meaning and impose similar constitutional limitations.\u2019 <em>Karp </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>156 Conn. 287, 295, 240 A.2d 845 [1968]. Both provisions therefore may be considered together. See <em>Page </em>v. <em>Welfare Commissioner, </em>170 Conn. 258, 264, 365 A.2d 1118 [1976]; <em>Tough </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 274, 292, 294 A.2d 67 [1972]; <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Sachner, </em>143 Conn. 9, 17, 118 A.2d 621 [1955].\u201d <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Killian, </em>172 Conn. 496, 500-501, 375 A.2d 998 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">\u201c \u2018Equal protection analysis must commence with a determination of whether . . . the legislation impinges upon a fundamental right. Where the legislation impinges upon [such a] right . . . then it must be struck down unless justified by a compelling state interest. . . . Where the statute does not involve fundamental rights . . . the legislation will withstand constitutional attack if the distinction is founded on a rational basis. . . .\u2019 <em>Laden </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>169 Conn. 540, 542-43, 363 A.2d 1063 (1975).\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>176 Conn. 638, 645-46, 410 A.2d 475 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has said that \u201cthe Constitution itself does not guarantee good time credit for satisfactory behavior in prison.\u201d <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 557, 94 S. Ct. 2963, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1974). In an earlier equal protection analysis of \u00a7\u00a7 18-7 and 18-7a, we concluded that one eligible for good time credits could not \u201cassert a \u2018fundamental\u2019 right to additional good time credits permitted under another statute which became effective after he was sentenced.\u201d <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 647. We see no reason to change this view in the present context of good time credits being withheld during the first 120 days of a sentence. \u201cOur opinion [then] is that the standard to be used in assessing [this] . . . equal protection claim is the traditional \u2018rational basis\u2019 test and not the more exacting \u2018strict scrutiny\u2019 test.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u201c \u2018Whatever views may be entertained regarding severity of punishment, whether one believes in its efficacy or its futility . . . these are peculiarly questions of legislative policy.\u2019 <em>Gore </em>v. <em>United States, </em>357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S. Ct. 1280, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1405 [1958].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Darden, </em>171 Conn. 677, 679, 372 A.2d 99 (1976). \u201cThe question of classification is primarily one for the legislature, and the courts will not interfere unless a classification presented by statute is clearly irrational and unreasonable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zazzaro, </em>128 Conn. 160, 166, 20 A.2d 737 [1941].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rao, </em>171 Conn. 600, 603, 370 A.2d 1310 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u201c \u2018To be constitutionally valid, a regulation made under the police power must have a reasonable relation to the public health, safety, morality and welfare.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>143 Conn. 698, 703, 125 A.2d 477 [1956].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Darden, </em>supra, 680. \u201cThe limit of the exercise of the police power is necessarily flexible, because it has to be considered in the light of the times and the prevailing conditions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>One need not be an in depth observer of our times and their prevailing conditions to detect the complex social, legal and economic burdens brought about by the confluence of alcohol and the modern motor vehicle. To maximize the deterrent effect of the drunk driving laws by imposing a mandatory minimum sentence, is <em>\u201ca </em>valid social purpose properly within the legislature\u2019s police power.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Darden, </em>supra, 681. The legislature quite properly \u201cmay impose mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for certain crimes, and may preclude the probation <em>or suspension of a sentence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) is an appropriate exercise of the legislature\u2019s police power and its effect on General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 18-7a and 18-98a does not deny the petitioner the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) operation while under the influence.

We conclude that they are not, because: (1) the issues raised are capable of repetition yet evade review because of the historically short terms of alcohol related confinements; (2) presently there are over 200 inmates identically situated and thus affected by this ongoing program of the state\u2019s penal system; (3) the petitioner could very well be affected if convicted in the future; and (4) there is significant public interest in the disposition of alcohol related offenses. <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 Conn. 434, 439 A.2d 1055 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\"> See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55a (b), manslaughter in the first degree; \u00a7 53a-56a (b), manslaughter in the second degree with a firearm; \u00a7 53a-59a (c), assault of victim sixty or older in the first degree; \u00a7 53a-60a (b), assault in the second degree with a firearm; \u00a7 53a-60b (c), assault of victim sixty or older in the second degree; \u00a7 53a-70 (b), sexual assault in the first degree; \u00a7 53a-70a sexual assault in the first degree with a deadly weapon; \u00a7 53a-71 (b), sexual assault in the second degree; \u00a7 53a-72b (b), Sexual assault in the third degree with a firearm; \u00a7 53a-92a (b), kidnapping in the first degree with a firearm; \u00a7 53a-94a (b), kidnapping in the second degree with a firearm; \u00a7 53a-101 (c), burglary in the first degree; \u00a7 53a-102a (b), burglary in the second degree with a firearm; \u00a7 53a-103a (b), burglary in the third degree with a firearm; and \u00a7 53a-134 (b), robbery in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\"> In <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>111 Conn. 281, 149 A. 840 (1930), this court was faced with the similar problem of resolving a conflict between two statutes that involved the mandatory sentencing provision of chapter 285 of the Public Acts of 1929, a predecessor to General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.
