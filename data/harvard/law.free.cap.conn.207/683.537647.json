In 1975, the Connecticut legislature passed Public Acts 1975, No. 75-213, \u00a7\u00a715 through 22, and 53, which amended General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 regarding the applicability of the state sales and use tax provisions. Prior to July 1,1975, \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) imposed, in pertinent parts, a sales tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>upon the sale of \u201ctelephone . . . services.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Public Acts 1975, No. 75-213, \u00a7 15, revised \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) by, inter alia, deleting \u201ctelephone . . . services\u201d and imposing a sales tax upon \u201ctelephone answering services.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Initially, this change became codified in \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and thereafter was recodified in \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (G).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Since 1961, the plaintiff has been engaged in various aspects of the telecommunications industry in New England, and has operated a telephone answering service, a cellular telephone business and a mobile radio telephone business. In 1970, he began a one-way pager or beeper service in Connecticut under the business name of Massachusetts Connecticut Mobile Telephone Company. In recognition of the enactment of Public Acts 1975, No. 75-213, \u00a7 15, the plaintiffs attorney forwarded a letter dated July 1,1975, to Terrance O\u2019Neill of the state tax department. The letter summarized the essential aspects of the plaintiffs portable radio telephone and radio paging businesses. In his letter, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney sought guidance with regard to the tax ramifications of the new amendment and posited the following question to the tax department: \u201c[D]oes [Public Acts 1975, No. 75-213,] \u00a7 15 (K), which taxes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>leasing or rental of tangible personal property, apply to the furnishing of a service under F.C.C. tariff and regulation?\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tax Commissioner Gerald J. Heffernan responded by letter dated November 21,1975, in which he stated: \u201cThis will acknowledge receipt of your inquiry pertaining to the taxability of the equipment rented or leased by your clients to their customers. The department has reviewed the facts of this case and it is the determination of the department that your clients are in the business of renting or leasing tangible personal property. The rental income is subject to the tax pursuant to Public Act 75-213.\u201d Pursuant to the commissioner\u2019s letter, the plaintiff began collecting sales tax on the rental and sales of the paging or beeper equipment and the mobile radio telephone equipment. The plaintiff, however, did not charge or collect sales taxes on the monthly service charges paid by the subscribers of these services, apparently because the defendant\u2019s letter was silent on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In 1985, a revenue examiner from the Connecticut department of revenue services conducted a general audit of the plaintiff\u2019s books for the period of January 1, 1982, through December 31,1984.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The examiner concluded that the revenues received by the plaintiff from the service charges for the paging or beeper services were subject to sales tax under \u00a7 12-407, as amended by Public Acts 75-213, \u00a7 15, and assessed the plaintiff back taxes in the amount of $354,557.90, exclusive of interest. Thereafter, the plaintiff petitioned for a reas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>sessment, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-418 (l);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the tax commissioner affirmed the examiner's assessment in full with interest. The tax commissioner based his decision, at least in part, upon \u00a7 12-426-27 (b) (8)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies which defines \u201ctelephone answering services\u201d to include the \u201ctransmitting of telephone messages to the clients of those engaged in the business of providing such services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Thereafter the plaintiff filed this appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-422.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>trial court, Maloney, <em>J., </em>sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and found: \u201c(1) that the plaintiff\u2019s beeper paging system is not a \u2018telephone answering service\u2019 within the commonly approved usage of that term; (2) that the defendant commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the law and regulations to the contrary in this case is inconsistent with his past practice; and (3) the legislature has not considered the paging system as taxable under the sales tax law . . . [and] that the plaintiff\u2019s beeper paging system is not a \u2018telephone answering service\u2019 as that term is used in General Statutes Sec. 12-407 (2) (i) (G).\u201d Thereafter, judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant, John G. Groppo, commissioner of revenue services, filed this appeal to the Appellate Court, which was transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The principal issue raised on appeal involves the interpretation of the phrase \u201ctelephone answering services\u201d as now contained within \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (G). The defendant argues that the wording of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (G) is clear and unambiguous, and that, by ascribing the common, everyday meaning to the term \u201ctelephone answering services,\u201d the one-way paging services provided by the plaintiff are clearly subject to the sales tax levied by General Statutes \u00a7 12-408 (1). The defendant also asserts that \u00a7 12-426-27 (a) and (b) (8) of the Regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>tions of Connecticut State Agencies support his position that the trial court erred in concluding that the service provided by the plaintiff to its subscribers \u201cfalls short of the \u2018conventional telephone answering service.\u2019 \u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The trial court, in reaching its decision, properly conducted a de novo review of the defendant\u2019s appeal which was filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-422. See <em>Kimberly-Clark Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>204 Conn. 137, 144-45, 527 A.2d 679 (1987). \u201c \u2018 \u201cOn appeal, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous. See Practice Book [\u00a7 4061].\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., 153. In this appeal, the defendant is challenging the trial court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (G) which involves a question of law. Therefore, we must determine whether the legal conclusions reached by the trial court are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision of the trial court. Id.; see also <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">At the outset, we note that taxing statutes are to be strictly construed; <em>White Oak Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue Services, </em>198 Conn. 413, 421, 503 A.2d 582 (1986); <em>Naylor </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>166 Conn. 581, 587, 353 A.2d 709 (1974); and statutory ambiguities in the imposition of such taxes must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer and against the taxing authority.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 588-89, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, 202 </em>Conn. 412, 423, 521 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>A.2d 569 (1987). In addition, courts must construe statutory provisions as they are written; <em>Orticelli </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>197 Conn. 9, 13-14, 495 A.2d 1023 (1985); <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Haynes Medical Laboratory, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 327, 334, 471 A.2d 646 (1984); and in a manner so as to give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>204 Conn. 410, 421, 528 A.2d 811(1987); <em>Beloff </em>v. <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 45, 54, 523 A.2d 477 (1987). If, however, the wording of the statute is unclear, the legislative intent must be ascertained by examining the language of the statute, its legislative history and the purpose the statute is to serve. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>203 Conn. 506, 521, 525 A.2d 509 (1987); <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The defendant argues that under the plain and ordinary understanding of a telephone answering service, common sense dictates that one-way paging or beeper services should be included within the meaning of \u201ctelephone answering services.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">In order to address this claim specifically, an understanding of the plaintiffs paging or beeper services is required. A subscriber to the plaintiffs services is assigned a telephone number. One wishing to contact the subscriber dials this number on an ordinary telephone. The transmission is sent to the telephone company by wire, and telephone company equipment in turn relays the transmission by wire to a computerized switching terminal at the plaintiffs office. The switching terminal automatically and electronically relays the signal, either by radio wave or by wire, to a transmitter located on a mountain top. From there the transmitter sends out a radio signal to the paging units carried by the subscribers. The pager, which is tuned in to a special radio frequency, is activated by the transmitted radio waves.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The plaintiff offers three types of pagers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The first is a tone-only pager. When activated, it emits a beeping sound. The tone-only pager can be programmed to emit a limited number of sequence beeps to indicate to the subscriber the identity of the caller, e.g., one beep for the subscriber\u2019s home, two beeps for subscriber\u2019s office, etc. The second is a digital display paging unit. When activated, it will digitally display up to twenty-three characters representing the telephone number of the caller. The third pager is a tone and voice unit. When activated, it emits a beep followed by a voice message from the caller. All three units are one-way communications devices. The subscriber cannot use the pager or beeper units to respond to the caller; rather he or she must go to a separate telephone to contact the caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">At oral argument before this court, the defendant argued that the computerized switching terminal\u2019s response to the caller\u2019s transmission, coupled with its subsequent relay of the signal or message to the subscriber\u2019s pager unit, is clearly an \u201canswer.\u201d Therefore, the defendant argues that the one-way paging services provided by the plaintiff are \u201ctelephone answering services\u201d under the ordinary and everyday meaning of the term. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary defines \u201canswering service\u201d to mean \u201ca commercial service that answers telephone calls for its clients.\u201d While the plaintiff\u2019s paging or beeper services are commercial services, they do not answer telephone calls for their subscribers. Rather, they merely electronically and automatically relay the transmission to the subscriber in the same way in which the telephone company relays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>the caller\u2019s signal to the plaintiff\u2019s switching terminal. The caller does not even know if his call was received, let alone answered, if the subscriber has turned off his paging unit, is not carrying it or chooses not to respond. Further, unlike the answering service business also operated by the plaintiff that utilizes operators and telephone lines only,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> when a pager is activated, the subscriber responds to the caller directly and need not first call the plaintiff\u2019s office to retrieve the caller\u2019s identity, phone number or message. The caller\u2019s telephone call is, therefore, not \u201canswered\u201d until the subscriber, through his own devices, makes contact with the caller. Accordingly, we find that the radio paging or beeper services provided by the plaintiff are not, in the ordinary understanding of the term, \u201ctelephone answering services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Even if the language of the statute were unclear, the state\u2019s expansive construction cannot be reconciled with the statute\u2019s legislative history. Prior to the adoption of No. 75-213, \u00a7 15, of the 1975 Public Acts, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) and 12-408 (1) imposed a sales tax on, inter alia, \u201cthe sale, furnishing or service of telephone . . . services\u201d <em>generally. </em>In 1975, \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) was significantly changed by Public Acts 1975, No. 75-213, \u00a7 15. Section 15 added to \u00a7 12-407 (2) subdivisions (j) (A) through (M), to which subdivisions added an enumerated list of thirteen services that the sales tax imposed by \u00a7 12-408 (1) would apply. In such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>a case, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[ujnless there is evidence to the contrary, statutory itemization indicates that the legislature intended the list to be exclusive.\u201d \u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 766, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982).\u201d <em>The B. F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>196 Conn. 1, 6, 490 A.2d 991 (1985). There can be no doubt that the legislature intended to expand the application of the sales tax but only to those services specified therein. See 18 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1975 Sess., p. 3031. This court is not at liberty to expand the list by an expansive construction of the specific services enumerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">A careful reading of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (j), as amended by \u00a7 15 of No. 75-213 of the 1975 Public Acts, reveals no indication that the legislature intended one-way radio paging or beeper services to be included in the list of enumerated services or to be read into the list through an expanded interpretation of the term \u201ctelephone answering services.\u201d In fact, the wording of \u00a7 15 indicates the contrary. While \u00a7 15 expanded the scope of the sales tax to the various services enumerated, it also significantly limited the application of the sales tax to telecommunications by substituting the term \u201ctelephone answering services\u201d for \u201ctelephone . . . services\u201d generally. This amendment also deleted references to the following telecommunications<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> services that were specifically subject to the sales tax in the pre-1975 version of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (G): \u201ctelephone, telegraph, community antenna television and cable services.\u201d Accordingly, we can find no evidence in the wording of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (G) to indicate that the legislature intended the revenues derived from the monthly service charges on one-way radio paging or beeper services to be subject to sales tax as a \u201ctelephone answering service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>This conclusion is further supported by the subsequent adoption of Public Acts 1986, No. 86-410, which totally revamped chapter 211, entitled \u201cRegulated Telecommunications Service, Express, Telegraph, Cable And Community Antenna Television System Companies Tax,\u201d and added chapter 210a, entitled \u201cTelecommunications Service Company Tax,\u201d both under title 12 of the General Statutes. In adopting No. 86-410 of the 1986 Public Acts, the legislature recognized the modem technological advances in telecommunications, the divestiture of American Telegraph and Telephone Company (AT&amp;T), and the entry of new competition into the telecommunications field. See 29 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1986 Sess., p. 2077. The legislature also recognized that the old tax laws that spoke in terms of wires, poles and the like were outdated. Therefore, the legislature enacted No. 86-410 of the 1986 Public Acts with the intent to redefine telecommunication services in modern terminology; 29 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6,1986 Sess., p. 2088; and \u201cto address the new unregulated competitive and <em>previously undefined services.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Remarks of Senator James H. McLaughlin, 29 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1986 Sess., p. 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Chapter 210a imposes a gross receipts tax and chapter 211 imposes alternatively a gross earnings tax upon companies engaged in rendering <em>any </em>telecommunications service for consideration within Connecticut. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-255b (a)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>12-256.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Both chapters specifically define telecommunications service to include, inter alia, \u201ccellular mobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>telephone or telecommunication service, <em>specialized mobile radio and pagers and paging service, </em>including any form of mobile two-way communication.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-255a (a) and 12-256a (a). Each chapter also specifically exempts from the definition of \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d those services or transactions enumerated in \u00a7 12-407 (2) that were already subject to the sales and use tax under \u00a7 12-408. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-255a and 12-256a (a) (2). In enacting No. 86-410 of the 1986 Public Acts, the legislature is presumed to have acted with knowledge of existing statutes and with an intent to create one consistent body of laws. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>198 Conn. 158, 168, 502 A.2d 880 (1985); <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Leslie-Elliott Constructors, Inc., </em>194 Conn. 129, 134, 479 A.2d 231 (1984). Therefore, at the time No. 86-410 was passed, it was clear that the legislature itself did not consider radio paging or beeper services to be encompassed within the' enumerated list of services set forth in \u00a7 12-407 (2) (j) (A) through (M). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that the term \u201ctelephone answering service\u201d was not intended to encompass the paging or beeper services of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>The defendant finally argues that \u00a7 12-426-27 (b) (8) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies clarifies and broadens the meaning of \u201ctelephone answering services\u201d \u201cby expressly providing that the transmittal of a telephone message is included in that definition.\u201d Section 12-426-27 (b) (8) includes within the ambit of \u201ctelephone answering services\u201d the \u201ctransmitting of telephone messages to the clients of those engaged in the business of providing such services.\u201d This regulation would only govern this case if we were to conclude that the electronic relay of a caller\u2019s signal by the plaintiff\u2019s electronic switching terminal constitutes the transmission of a \u201ctelephone message.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Just as we have determined that one-way paging or beeper services are not \u201ctelephone answering services,\u201d so it is our conclusion that they do not fall within the ordinary understanding of a \u201ctransmission\u201d of a \u201ctelephone message.\u201d The regulations are therefore of no avail to the defendant\u2019s argument in the circumstances of this case. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in rendering judgment for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (G) provides: \u201c \u2018Sale\u2019 and \u2018selling\u2019 mean and include . . . the rendering of certain services for a consideration, exclusive of such services rendered by an employee for his employer, as follows . . . telephone answering services . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) provides: \u201c \u2018Sale\u2019 and \u2018selling\u2019 mean and include . . . the sale, furnishing, or service of telephone, telegraph, community antenna television and cable services and the sale of water, gas, electricity, steam, coolants and atomic power, but not including the sale of any fuel for use as domestic heating fuel.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-407 (2), as amended by Public Acts 1975, No. 75-213, \u00a7 15, provides in pertinent part: \u201c \u2018Sell\u2019 and \u2018selling\u2019 mean and include . . .
