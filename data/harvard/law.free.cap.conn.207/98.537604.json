J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqcr\">The sole issue in this case is whether, despite intervening legislative changes in grand jury procedures, the statute that was in effect at the time when an investigatory grand jury was authorized governs a subsequent request for disclosure of the grand jury\u2019s report. The petitioner, the Journal Publishing Company, Inc., filed a motion for the public disclosure of the grand jury report, associated transcripts and evidentiary documentation that had been filed with the Hartford Superior Court by Judge John M. Alexander. The trial court permitted a number of interested parties to intervene, both in support of and in opposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>to the motion for disclosure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a hearing, the trial court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the motion. The petitioner has appealed. We find error and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The relevant facts are undisputed. On July 18, 1985, Judge Stoughton ordered a grand jury inquiry to determine, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 54-47,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> whether there was probable cause to believe that crimes had been committed in Enfield. Judge Shaughnessy was initially appointed to serve as grand juror, but was subsequently replaced by Judge Alexander. The grand jury filed its final report with Judge Barall in Hartford Superior Court on November 24, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Before this grand jury investigation was completed, the General Assembly enacted far-reaching reforms in the procedures governing the investigatory grand jury system. Effective October 1,1985, \u00a7 54-47 was repealed and its provisions replaced by Public Acts 1985, No. 85-611, codified as General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-47a through 54-47h.3 In 1986, the General Assembly enacted clarify<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ing legislation to ensure that the authority of investigatory grand juries duly designated prior to October 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>1985, pursuant to the repealed \u00a7 54-47, would continue \u201cuntil the conclusion of such inquiry and a final report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>has been filed with the court pursuant to said section.\u201d Public Acts 1986, No. 86-317, \u00a7 1 (a). This court accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ingly held, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 543, 522 A.2d 753 (1987), that the legislature had manifested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>its intention not to revoke the authority of, nor to alter the procedures governing, investigatory grand juries that had been properly authorized before October 1, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Although the Alexander grand jury had been duly authorized before October 1, 1985, the trial court, <em>Byrne, J., </em>concluded that the petition for disclosure was governed by the provisions of Public Acts 1985, No. 85-611, \u00a7 4. General Statutes \u00a7 54-47e. The court drew a distinction between the proceedings of the grand jury itself, and proceedings that involved questions arising after the grand jury had completed its assignment by filing its report. As to the former, the governing statute continued to be the repealed \u00a7 54-47, but, as to the latter, the court determined that the new act should govern. Since the disclosure petition was filed subsequent to the filing of the grand jury report, the court held that it had no jurisdiction to act, because under \u00a7 54-47e only a panel of judges is authorized to decide \u201cwhen . . . disclosure . . . is deemed . . . to be in the public interest.\u201d Accordingly, the court denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The petitioner\u2019s appeal asks us to resolve two specific issues: (1) did the trial court have jurisdiction to decide the motion for disclosure; and (2) what is the standard by which such a motion for disclosure should be decided? In our view, these issues must be resolved in accordance with the governing provisions of the old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u00a7 54-47, rather than the new \u00a7 54-47e. Accordingly, the trial court was in error in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to determine the petition for disclosure, and should have required the petitioner to make the showing of particularized need that this court articulated as the proper standard in <em>In re Final Grand Jury Report Concerning the Torrington Police Department, </em>197 Conn. 698, 709-12, 501 A.2d 377 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">It is common ground among the parties that the Alexander grand jury, duly constituted before October 1, 1985, was obligated to conduct its proceedings and prepare its report in accordance with the provisions of the repealed \u00a7 54-47. <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>supra. The dispositive question presented by this appeal is whether the legislature intended a different statute to govern public access to the report, transcript and other documentation that this grand jury filed with the Hartford Superior Court. We are persuaded that no such bifurcation was intended. As a matter of principle, this conclusion follows from our holding in <em>In re Final Grand Jury Report Concerning the Torrington Police Department, </em>supra, 709, that public disclosure of grand jury proceedings must be regulated with an eye to \u201cthe recognized importance of secrecy in the proper functioning of the grand jury system.\u201d As a matter of practicality, it is unlikely that the legislature would have intended to have a three judge panel authorize the disclosure of a report of a grand jury proceeding when no three judge panel had had any prior contact with the origins and scope of the grand jury investigation. Indeed, the cross-references in \u00a7 54-47e to \u00a7\u00a7 54-47c and 54-47d underscore that the legislature understood the panel that determines disclosure to have had prior oversight responsibility for all aspects of the investigatory grand jury process.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Once it is decided that the repealed \u00a7 54-47 governs all proceedings relating to the Alexander grand jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>including disclosure, the specific issues raised by the petitioner\u2019s appeal need little further discussion. Under the old \u00a7 54-47, a single judge of the Superior Court must determine whether to order disclosure of all or part of the grand jury\u2019s report, transcripts, or other documentation. In arriving at its determination, the court must apply the standard of particularized need that we articulated in <em>In re Final Grand Jury Report Concerning the Torrington Police Department, </em>supra, 711-12. See also <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>204 Conn. 609, 624-26, 529 A.2d 692 (1987). The petitioner suggests that a different standard applies because, in a footnote in <em>In re Final Grand Jury Report Concerning the Torrington Police Department, </em>supra, 713 n.10, we indicated that a petition for disclosure must be decided \u201caccording to the statute that was in effect at the time that the trial court was asked to rule\u201d on the petitions. We have, however, determined that \u201cthe statute that was in effect\u201d for this grand jury, when the trial court ruled on this petition, was the repealed \u00a7 54-47. Accordingly, any person seeking disclosure of any record of these proceedings must meet the standard of particularized need.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-5\"> The Hartford Courant Company and the Manchester Herald were permitted to intervene to join the moving petitioner in seeking public disclosure. William Boudah, John Castle, Neil Ellis, Paul Fox, Edward T. Lynch, Leonard Seader and an unidentified witness who had testified before the grand jury were permitted to intervene to oppose public disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1985)] Sec. 54-47. investigations into commission of crime, (a) Whenever it appears to the superior court for any judicial district that the administration of justice requires an investigation to determine whether or not there is probable cause to believe that a crime or crimes have been committed within the judicial district, said court may order an inquiry to be made into the matter, to be conducted before any judge, state referee, or any three judges of said court designated by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\u201c(b) The chief state\u2019s attorney and the deputy chief state\u2019s attorney may also apply to the chief court administrator for an order that an inquiry be made to determine whether or not there is probable cause to believe that a crime or crimes have been committed.
