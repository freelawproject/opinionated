At sentencing, which took place on July 25,1986, the court imposed a total effective sentence of five years suspended after two and one-half years with probation for three years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant filed a motion for modification of the sentence which was denied by the court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Thereafter, the defendant filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus claiming, inter alia, that his due process rights as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>violated as a result of the sentencing court\u2019s failure to impose a sentence of no more than three years, and as a result of the sentencing court\u2019s failure to allow him to withdraw his pleas.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The habeas court found, inter alia, that his rights had been prejudiced by the imposition of an effective sentence greater than that agreed to, and ordered the court to vacate the sentences and either impose an effective sentence of not more than three years, or allow the defendant to withdraw his pleas. The court, upon resentencing, vacated the original sentences and imposed a total effective sentence of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The defendant appealed, claiming that the increase in the term of incarceration from two and one-half to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>three years, without an articulation of the reasons for that increase, violated his due process rights under the doctrine <em>of North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969), and State v. <em>Sutton, </em>197 Conn. 485, 498 A.2d 65 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1073, 106 S. Ct. 833, 88 L. Ed. 2d 804 (1986). The issue, as framed by the defendant, is: \u201c[Wjhether the defendant was denied his rights to due process of law under the fourteenth amendment to the U. S. Constitution and article first, section eight of the Connecticut Constitution when the trial court, on remand for resentencing following a habeas corpus proceeding, resentenced the defendant to a term of three years imprisonment without articulating any objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">This court must determine whether the resentencing procedure followed by the court on remand is governed by the dictates of <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>supra, and its progeny, which were followed by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>supra.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>supra, the court examined the constitutional constraints imposed on a court which metes out a greater sentence upon retrial than that which the defendant originally received. After holding that neither the equal protection clause nor the double jeopardy provision imposes an absolute bar to a harsher sentence upon reconviction, the court considered the impact of the due process clause on such a position. Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>723-26. Where a conviction has been set aside, the action of a court in imposing a harsher sentence upon reconviction for the purpose of punishing a defendant for exercising his rights in seeking to have the conviction set aside is a \u201cflagrant\u201d violation of due process of law. Id., 723-24. Due process requires that vindictiveness must not enter into resentencing that results from a successful attack on a defendant\u2019s conviction. Id., 725. A defendant\u2019s fear of such vindictive behavior may unconstitutionally deter the exercise of the right to appeal or to attack collaterally a conviction, and thus, due process requires that a defendant be free from such apprehension. Id. To ensure that retaliatory motivation does not enter into the resentencing process, whenever a court imposes a harsher sentence following a new trial, the court must state its reasons upon the record. Id., 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The United States Supreme Court has subsequently examined the applicability of the <em>Pearce </em>presumption of vindictiveness. See, e.g., <em>Texas </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>475 U.S. 134, 106 S. Ct. 976, 89 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1986) (defendant originally sentenced by jury; judge concluded defendant entitled to new trial; upon retrial defendant chose sentencing by judge; <em>Pearce </em>presumption inapplicable and even if it were to apply, court\u2019s findings overcame presumption); <em>Wasman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>468 U.S. 559, 569, 104 S. Ct. 3217, 82 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1984) (presumption of vindictiveness applies since petitioner received greater sentence following retrial than that he had originally received; consideration by court of conviction between original sentencing and sentencing after retrial rebuts presumption); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. 368, 372-84, 102 S. Ct. 2485, 73 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1982) (pretrial decision by prosecutor to modify charges does not warrant presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness in pretrial setting); <em>Bordenkircher </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 362-64, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>98 S. Ct. 663, 54 L. Ed. 2d 604, reh. denied, 435 U.S. 918, 98 S. Ct. 1477, 55 L. Ed. 2d 511 (1978) (prosecutor\u2019s action in carrying through on statement made during plea negotiations to bring additional charges against defendant if he refused to plead guilty to offense originally charged did not violate due process clause); <em>Blackledge </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 25-29, 94 S. Ct. 2098, 40 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1974) (prosecutor may not bring more serious charge against defendant prior to trial de novo in response to defendant\u2019s exercise of statutory right to appeal); <em>Chaffin </em>v. <em>Stynchcombe, </em>412 U.S. 17, 24-28, 93 S. Ct. 1977, 36 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1973) (where resentencing occurs before a jury, potential for abuse in sentencing is minimal; <em>Pearce </em>does not apply); <em>Cotten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>407 U. S. 104, 112-20, 92 S. Ct. 1953, 32 L. Ed. 2d 584 (1972) (prophylactic rule announced in <em>Pearce </em>not appropriate in context of two-tier system which allowed for trial de novo in court of general criminal jurisdiction following trial or guilty plea in an inferior court; likelihood of vindictiveness not present).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The decision in <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>supra, \u201cwas only \u2018premised on the apparent need to guard against <em>vindictiveness </em>in the resentencing process.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Wasman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 567, quoting <em>Chaffin </em>v. <em>Stynchcombe, </em>supra, 25. \u201c[I]n certain cases in which action detrimental to the defendant has been taken after the exercise of a legal right, the Court has found it necessary to \u2018presume\u2019 an improper vindictive motive. Given the severity of such a presumption, however\u2014which may operate in the absence of any proof of an improper motive and thus may block a legitimate response to criminal conduct\u2014 the Court has done so only in cases in which a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness exists.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>supra, 373; <em>Wasman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 566. \u201cThe <em>Pearce </em>requirements thus do not apply in every case where a convicted defendant receives a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>higher sentence on retrial. Like other \u2018judicially created means of effectuating the rights secured by the [Constitution]\u2019. . . we have restricted application of <em>Pearce </em>to areas where its \u2018objectives are thought most efficaciously served\u2019 . . . . \u201d (Citations omitted). <em>Texas </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>supra, 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The violation of due process in situations such as <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Perry </em>does not arise from the possibility that a defendant may be discouraged from exercising legal rights, but instead from the \u201cdanger that the State might be retaliating against the accused for lawfully attacking his conviction.\u201d <em>Bordenkircher </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>supra, 363. \u201c[W]here the presumption applies, the sentencing authority or the prosecutor must rebut the presumption that an increased sentence or charge resulted from vindictiveness; where the presumption does not apply, the defendant must affirmatively prove actual vindictiveness.\u201d <em>Wasman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 569; see <em>Texas </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>supra, 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In the case before this court, the defendant pleaded guilty to three charges. There is no claim that the pleas, when entered, were involuntary. The agreed upon recommendation at the time of the pleas was a sentence of no more than three years, with the defendant retaining the right to withdraw his pleas if the sentencing court should exceed the agreement. The sentencing court imposed an effective sentence of five years, suspended after two and one-half years, with probation for three years, a sentence that the habeas court determined was greater than three years. The habeas court therefore ordered the sentencing court to \u201cvacate the sentences imposed, and either . . . impose an effective sentence of not more than three years, if it can do so \u2018in conscience,\u2019 or, if it cannot \u2018in conscience\u2019 impose an effective sentence of not more than three years, then in such event, it allow petitioner to withdraw each of his pleas of guilty and it order him to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>put to trial on said charges.\u201d The sentencing court vacated the sentences in accordance with the order, and imposed an effective sentence of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">This court concludes that no realistic motive for vindictive sentencing exists in the action taken by the sentencing court, and that the <em>Pearce </em>presumption is therefore inapplicable. The sentencing court\u2019s actions were within the parameters of the habeas court\u2019s order and, equally important, were in accordance with the agreement reached between the parties. Where the <em>Pearce </em>presumption does not apply, the defendant must prove that vindictiveness actually occurred in the resentencing procedure, in order to obtain relief. The record fails to support such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In view of this court\u2019s decision that the rationale of <em>Pearce </em>and its progeny is inapposite, and that actual vindictiveness has not been proved, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">In this opinion Healey, Shea and Covello, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\"> \u201c[General Statues] Sec. 53a-124. larceny in the third degree: class d felony, (a) A person is guilty of larceny in the third degree when he commits larceny as defined in section 53a-119 and: (1) The value of the property or service exceeds one thousand dollars; or (2) the property consists of a public record, writing or instrument kept, held or deposited according to law with or in the keeping of any public office or public servant; or (3) the property consists of a sample, culture, microorganism, specimen, record, recording, document, drawing or any other article, material, device or substance which constitutes, represents, evidences, reflects, or records a secret scientific or technical process, invention or forumla or any phase or part thereof.

Numerous other charges pending against the defendant in New Haven and Woodbridge were nolled at the time of the pleas. On the charge of larceny in the third degree, the defendant received a sentence of five years, suspended after two and one-half years, with probation for three years. The defendant received sentences of six months each on the charges of forgery in the third degree, criminal impersonation, drug paraphernalia and illegal possession, all to be served concurrently, for a total effective sentence of five years suspended after two and one-half years, with probation for three years. The judge who accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas also presided at sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b127-11\"> The defendant contended that the sentence he received was greater than three years and further claimed that because he had four months of jail credit time on the concurrent sentences only, he would effectively serve a sentence of three years or more.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b127-12\"> The constitution of the United States, amendment fourteen, provides: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.

The defendant was not given the opportunity to withdraw his guilty pleas when the sentence was imposed. The defendant\u2019s counsel neglected to appeal from the judgment and to inform the defendant of his right to do so. When the court denied the defendant\u2019s application for sentence modification, his counsel failed to inform him of his right to appeal the denial. The habeas court found that counsel\u2019s actions caused the defendant to refrain from withdrawing his guilty pleas and to file direct appeals. The defendant sought the following relief: (1) that he be allowed to withdraw his guilty pleas; (2) that his convictions be vacated; and (3) that he be released from custody. The defendant did not assert error in the remedy ultimately framed by the habeas court which was not in accord with that he had requested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\"> The defendant in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>197 Conn. 485, 487, 498 A.2d 65 (1985), challenged the imposition of a more severe sentence upon reconviction under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. The defendant here is seeking protection under both the Connecticut and the United States constitutions. This court is aware that it \u201ccannot afford any lesser protection than that to which a comparable right is entitled under the United States constitution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 234 n.16, 496 A.2d 498 (1985). We decline to expand upon the doctrine established in <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b133-10\">Callahan, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AeL\">concurring. I concur in the result but do not believe the <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce </em>analysis is necessary. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969), only prohibits the imposition of a <em>more severe sentence </em>on remand. The defendant cannot have it both ways. He cannot argue that five years suspended after two and one-half years and three years probation is more severe than the bargained for sentence of three years for the purpose of having the five year sentence vacated and then argue that the court imposed a more severe sentence on remand by imposing the three year sentence originally bargained for.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">This case does not concern the question of whether there was vindictiveness. The defendant simply did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>receive a more severe sentence on remand.
