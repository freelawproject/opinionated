Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG8y\">This appeal concerns the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq. The plaintiffs are Marie Castro and her minor children. The defendants are Joaquim and Mary Viera. The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner (commissioner) for the first district dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for benefits after he denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to preclude<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendants from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>\u201ccontesting liability\u201d because the defendants failed to file a \u201cNotice of Intent to Contest Liability\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-297 (b) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> within twenty days after receiving notice of their claim for benefits. The claim arose out of the death on September 30, 1983, of Rogerio Castro, the husband of the named plaintiff and father of the plaintiff children, while he had been working on premises owned by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">After an evidentiary hearing, the commissioner specifically found, inter alia, that prior to September 30, 1983, the decedent had worked for the defendants as an independent contractor and did not have an employer-employee relationship with them. The commissioner also found that, on September 30,1983, when the decedent had fallen to his death from a ladder at the defendants\u2019 building, \u201c[he] was not working as an employee of the [defendants].\u201d The commissioner, after denying the motion to preclude, dismissed the claim for benefits, essentially concluding that the defendants were not precluded under the statute from raising the jurisdictional defense of the lack of the requisite employer-employee relationship between the decedent and the defendants necessary to the application of the act. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>doing so, the commissioner determined that, although the defendants had not \u201ccontested liability on or before the twentieth day after receiving the [plaintiffs\u2019] written notice of claim,\u201d the commissioner did receive, on January 5,1984, a form 43-67, Notice to Contest Liability to Pay Compensation (form 43). The reasons, set out on this form 43, for contesting liability by the defendants were as follows: \u201c \u2018No jurisdiction under Conn. Workers\u2019 Compensation Act as there is no Employer-Employee relationship.\u2019 \u2018Injury and death not work related.\u2019 \u201d The commissioner rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the failure of the defendants to file a timely notice precluded them from contesting their right to receive benefits on any grounds, including jurisdictional grounds. The plaintiffs cited <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Quality Bakers of America, </em>2 Conn. App. 363, 373, 479 A.2d 820, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 804, 482 A.2d 709 (1984), in support of this position and cited the following language from <em>Bush: </em>\u201cBy not contesting compensability, Quality [the employer] waived any jurisdiction claim.\u201d Pointing out that the lack of an employer-employee relationship was not at issue in <em>Bush, </em>the commissioner opined that the reference of the Appellate Court to the waiver of any jurisdictional claim therefore had no applicability to the lack of an employer-employee relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Following the dismissal of their claim for benefits by the commissioner, the plaintiffs appealed the decision of the commissioner to the compensation review division. General Statutes \u00a7 31-301.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>review division decided that the commissioner had erred in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to preclude under \u00a7 32-297 (b). The compensation review division panel specifically based its finding of error on <em>LaVogue </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, Inc., </em>9 Conn. App. 91, 516 A.2d 151, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 814, 518 A.2d 72 (1986). In doing so, that panel said: <em>\u201cLaVogue </em>held, \u2018If an employer fails to file a notice contesting liability, the employer shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of the employee\u2019s injury. . . .\u2019 Id. at 93. <em>LaVogue </em>holds that where a conclusive presumption of liability arises, liability cannot be attacked on any grounds, including jurisdiction.\u201d It remanded the matter to the commissioner for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Thereafter, the defendants appealed the review division\u2019s reversal of the commissioner\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to preclude under \u00a7 31-297 (b) to the Appellate Court. The appeal was then transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">On appeal, the defendants maintain that the review division erred in reversing the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that they did not \u201cwaive\u201d subject matter jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>tion by failing to file a timely written notice of their intention to contest their liability to pay compensation to the plaintiffs under \u00a7 31-297 (b). They contend that the conclusive presumption of the act embodied in \u00a7 31-297 (b) applies only to contestability as it relates to liability and not to the basic question of whether the act applies to the matter. Subject matter jurisdiction over this matter, they argue, is not present and it cannot be conferred by waiver, consent, silence or agreement of the parties. Disputing the relevancy of the legislative history referred to by the plaintiffs as well as the case law cited by the compensation review division and the plaintiffs, they contend that the act itself, phrased in terms of \u201cemployer\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d status, speaks to the legislative intent as to the relationship that must exist to trigger potential coverage under the act. Claiming that the case law relied upon by the plaintiffs and the review division is readily distinguishable, they assert that the commissioner, confronted with the claim of lack of subject matter jurisdiction, had the obligation to decide that question before proceeding at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">On the other hand, the plaintiffs claim that, because of the language of \u00a7 31-297 (b), legislative history and the case law, the failure of one who receives a notice of claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits to file a notice contesting that claim within the twenty day period \u201cmeans that liability for the claim is accepted and there is no right thereafter to contest the claim for any reason whatsoever.\u201d Included in the plaintiffs\u2019 position is their argument that the defendants\u2019 contention that the lack of an employer-employee relationship deprives the workers\u2019 compensation commission of jurisdiction does not apply when reviewing the applicability of \u00a7 31-297 (b) in relation to \u201cthe complete jurisdictional scheme of the entire Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Although we said in <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-ManhattanEurope, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 541, 494 A.2d 555 (1985), that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was of \u201c \u2018broad humanitarian scope\u2019 . . . and is \u2018remedial\u2019 and \u2018should be broadly construed . . .\u2019\u201d we then went on specifically to say: \u201cIt is thus fair to proceed on the premise that the act was intended to be and is the exclusive remedy available <em>where it appears that the necessary employer-employee relationship exists </em>and the injury-producing transaction arises out of and in the course of <em>that employment </em>unless it is demonstrated otherwise.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 541-42.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The burden in a workers\u2019 compensation claim rests upon the claimant to prove that he is an \u201cemployee\u201d under the act and thus is entitled to invoke the act. <em>Bourgeois </em>v. <em>Cacciapuoti, </em>138 Conn. 317, 321, 84 A.2d 122 (1951); <em>Morganelli </em>v. <em>Derby, </em>105 Conn. 545, 551, 135 A. 911 (1927). This relationship is threshold because it is settled law that the \u201ccommissioner\u2019s jurisdiction is \u2018confined by the Act and limited by its provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>United Aircraft Corporation, </em>159 Conn. 302, 305, 268 A.2d 660 (1970). Long ago, we said that the jurisdiction of the commissioners \u201cis confined by the Act and limited by its provisions. Unless the Act gives the Commissioner the right to take jurisdiction over a claim, it cannot be conferred upon [the commissioner] by the parties either by agreement, waiver or conduct.\u201d <em>Jester </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>99 Conn. 236, 238, 121 A. 470 (1923). Because the act is a legislative enactment, \u201c[t]he legislative will as expressed in the [Workers\u2019] Compensation Act, is conclusive upon [a] court and gives us no alternative but to hold that the commissioner was without jurisdiction in the premises.\u201d <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>A. Waldron &amp; Sons, </em>112 Conn. 579, 586, 153 A. 298 (1931); <em>Vegliante </em>v. <em>New Haven Clock Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>143 Conn. 571, 581, 124 A.2d 526 (1956). While it is correct that the act provides for proceedings that \u201cwere designed to facilitate a speedy, efficient and inexpensive disposition\u201d of matters covered by the act; <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>165 Conn. 338, 346, 334 A.2d 452 (1973); <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>United Aircraft Corporation, </em>supra, 306; the charter for doing so is the act itself. The authority given by the legislature is carefully circumscribed and jurisdiction under the act is clearly defined and limited to what are clearly the legislative concerns in this remedial statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">With this background, we take up the issue of whether the conclusive presumption in \u00a7 31-297 (b) precluded the commissioner from deciding, as he did, that there was no subject matter jurisdiction of the proferred claim under the act and that, therefore, the matter was properly dismissed for that reason. We agree with the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In speaking of a court in general, we have said: \u201c \u2018 \u201cJurisdiction of the subject-matter is the power [of the court] to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Henry F. Raab Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>J. W. Fisher Co., </em>143 Conn. 108, 111-12, 438 A.2d 834 (1981). \u201cA court has subject matter jurisdiction if it has the authority to adjudicate a particular type of legal controversy. Such jurisdiction relates to the court\u2019s competency to exercise power, and not to the regularity of the court\u2019s exercise of that power. <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>177 Conn. 173, 185, 413 A.2d 819, appeal dismissed, 444 U.S. 801, 100 S. Ct. 20, 62 L. Ed. 2d 14 (1979) . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Malkowski, </em>189 Conn. 101, 105-106, 454 A.2d 275 (1983). In speaking of courts of lesser jurisdiction, we have said: \u201cIt is a familiar principle that a court which exercises a limited and statutory jurisdiction is without jurisdiction to act unless it does so under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>scribed by the enabling legislation.\u201d <em>Heiser </em>v. <em>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., </em>150 Conn. 563, 565, 192 A.2d 44 (1963). For example, \u201c[o]ur courts of probate have a limited jurisdiction and can exercise only such powers as are conferred on them by statute. . . . They have jurisdiction only when the facts exist on which the legislature has conditioned the exercise of their power. <em>Killen </em>v. <em>Klebanoff, </em>140 Conn. 111, 115, 98 A.2d 520 [1953]; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>120 Conn. 405, 408, 182 A. 138 [1935].\u201d <em>Heiser </em>v. <em>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., </em>supra; see <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-BC), </em>195 Conn. 344, 366 n.18, 488 A.2d 790 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">This concept, however, is not limited to courts. Administrative agencies are tribunals of limited jurisdiction and their jurisdiction is dependent entirely upon the validity of the statutes vesting them with power and they cannot confer jurisdiction upon themselves. <em>Regents of University System of Georgia v. Carroll, </em>338 U.S. 586, 597-98, 70 S. Ct. 370, 94 L. Ed. 363 (1950); <em>Gerson </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Commission, </em>188 Cal. App. 2d 735, 738-39, 11 Cal. Rptr. 1 (1961); <em>Bair v. Blue Ribbon, Inc., </em>256 Iowa 660, 663, 129 N.W.2d 85 (1964) ; <em>Soars </em>v. <em>Soars-Lovelace, Inc., </em>142 S.W.2d 866, 871 (Mo. 1940) (workers\u2019 compensation commission); <em>Fink </em>v. <em>Cole, 1 </em>N.Y.2d 48, 52, 133 N.E.2d 691 (1956); 2 Am. Jur. 2d, Administrative Law \u00a7 328. We have recognized that \u201c[i]t is clear that an administrative body must act strictly within its statutory authority, within constitutional limitations and in a lawful manner. . . . It cannot modify, abridge or otherwise change the statutory provisions, under which it acquires authority unless the statutes expressly grant it that power.\u201d <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>160 Conn. 226, 230, 278 A.2d 771 (1971); see <em>Millard </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Appeal Board, </em>170 Conn. 541, 545, 368 A.2d 121 (1976) (personnel board properly held it had no jurisdiction under statute to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>review plaintiff\u2019s dismissal). Where enabling legislation has created and authorized workers\u2019 compensation commissions or industrial accident commissions, the doctrine of subject matter jurisdiction has figured in the disposition of matters before such groups. See, e.g., <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission, </em>54 Ill. 2d 311, 318, 297 N.E.2d 154 (1973); <em>Bair </em>v. <em>Blue Ribbon, Inc., </em>supra; <em>Letterlough </em>v. <em>Alkins, </em>258 N.C. 166, 169, 128 S.E.2d 215 (1962); <em>State Accident Ins. Fund Corporation </em>v. <em>Broadway Cab Co., </em>52 Or. App. 689, 692-93, 629 P.2d 829 (1981); <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Reihart, </em>47 Pa. Commw. 602, 606, 408 A.2d 897 (1979), appeal dismissed, 498 Pa. 135, 445 A.2d 103 (1982); <em>James </em>v. <em>Arlington Board of Supervisors, </em>226 Va. 284, 286, 307 S.E.2d 900 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">We believe that the commissioner properly denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to preclude the defendants from contesting their alleged status as an employer despite the defendants\u2019 failure to file their notice of intent to contest liability within the twenty day period set out in \u00a7 31-297 (b). Moreover, we also believe that the conclusive presumption in \u00a7 31-297 (b) cannot, in this case, be construed to have prevented the commissioner\u2019s inquiry as to whether there was subject matter jurisdiction under the act. These determinations, we submit, for the reasons set out below, work no violence to the letter or spirit of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">We begin our analysis by noting that once the question of lack of jurisdiction of a court is raised, \u201c[it] must be disposed of no matter in what form it is presented\u201d; <em>Carten </em>v. <em>Carten, </em>153 Conn. 603, 610, 219 A.2d 711 (1966); <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>177 Conn. 173, 177, 413 A.2d 819 (1979); <em>Browning </em>v. <em>Steers, </em>162 Conn. 623, 625, 295 A.2d 544 (1972); and the court must \u201cfully resolve it before proceeding further with the case.\u201d <em>Valley Cable Vision, Inc. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>175 Conn. 30, 32, 392 A.2d 485 (1978); <em>Gimbel </em>v. <em>Gimbel, </em>147 Conn. 561, 566, 163 A.2d 451 (1960). Subject mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ter jurisdiction, unlike jurisdiction of the person, cannot be created through consent or waiver. <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bohart, </em>197 Conn. 34, 39, 495 A.2d 1034 (1985); <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Beresford, </em>184 Conn. 558, 562, 440 A.2d 224 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>166 Conn. 620, 627, 353 A.2d 764 (1974); <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>155 Conn. 591, 598, 236 A.2d 909 (1967). Moreover, a court must have jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction once that has been put in issue. <em>Chrysler Credit Corporation </em>v. <em>Fairfield Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 223, 227, 429 A.2d 478 (1980); <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>170 Conn. 199, 205, 365 A.2d 1202 (1976). It should be no different concerning the matter of the jurisdiction under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, where the commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction is \u201c \u2018confined by the Act and limited by its provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>United Aircraft Corporation, </em>supra, 305; <em>Jester </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra; <em>see Letterlough </em>v. <em>Alkins, </em>supra, 168 (stating that \u201c[i]n every proceeding before the [North Carolina Industrial] Commission determination of jurisdiction is the first order of business\u201d); <em>James </em>v. <em>Arlington County Board of Supervisors, </em>supra, 289 (holding that the Virginia Industrial Commission was correct \u201cin its approach\u201d in a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits that \u201cmade \u2018first things first\u2019 and ruled on its jurisdiction as a threshold matter\u201d); 100 C.J.S., Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 425 (d), p. 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Nor can the conclusive presumption of \u00a7 31-297 (b) operate to work a statutory bar to the opportunity of the alleged employer to contest liability where, as here, the question of the lack of subject matter jurisdiction has been squarely presented to the commissioner. Drawing upon the legislative history recorded when the legislature amended \u00a7 31-297 (b) in 1967, we recognized in <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>supra, 343,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that \u201c[t]he object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>which the legislature sought to accomplish [was] plain. . . . [It] was amended to ensure (1) that employers would bear the burden of investigating a claim promptly and (2) that employees would be timely apprised of the specific reasons for the denial of their claims. These effects would, in turn, diminish delays in the proceedings, discourage arbitrary refusal of bona fide claims and narrow the legal issues which were to be contested.\u201d Later, in <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>177 Conn. 107, 113, 411 A.2d 924 (1979), we again addressed the legislative history of \u00a7 31-297 (b) \u201cto determine whether it [was] necessary or appropriate to extend the \u2018conclusive preclusion of defense\u2019 provision of [\u00a7 31-297 (b)] beyond situations where an employer contests its initial liability to pay compensation, to a situation . . . where the employer disputes only the extent of the deceased\u2019s disability.\u201d In <em>Adzima, </em>we declined such an extension pointing out that \u00a7 31-297 (b) \u201citself clearly delineates a distinction between liability and disability: \u2018Whenever <em>liability </em>to pay compensation is contested by the employer,\u2019 the employer must file a specific defense. If the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>does not contest liability, it has \u2018no right thereafter to contest the employee\u2019s <em>right to receive compensation </em>on any grounds or the <em>extent of his disability. \u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)\u201d Id. We went on to say that \u201c[t]he statute clearly speaks to a threshold failure on the employer\u2019s part to contest \u2018liability\u2019 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>The entire statutory scheme of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is directed toward those who are in the employer-employee relationship as those terms are defined in the act and discussed in our cases. That relationship is threshold to the rights and benefits under the act; a claimant or his representative who is not an employee has no right under this statute to claim for and be awarded benefits. The act is not triggered by a claimant until he brings himself within its statutory ambit. The conclusive presumption of \u00a7 31-297 (b) is, accordingly, not triggered by the filing of a claim with the attendant notice by an \u201cemployee\u201d against an \u201cemployer\u201d until the \u201cemployee\u201d proves, where the requisite relationship is challenged, that that relationship existed. This requisite relationship was a jurisdictional fact to be proven in this case to bring the plaintiffs within the class that the legislature obviously intended be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We must determine, however, what is a \u201cjurisdictional fact\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in this context. In a workers\u2019 compensation case, <em>Valenzuela </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>100 N.M. 84, 87, 666 P.2d 225 (1982), affirmed in <em>Allsup\u2019s Convenience Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Valenzuela, </em>100 N.M. 84, 666 P.2d 225 (1983), the New Mexico Court of Appeals, quoting with approval from <em>Abraham </em>v. <em>Homer, </em>102 Okla. 12, 13-14, 226 P. 45 (1924), characterized a \u201cjurisdictional fact\u201d as follows: \u201cJurisdiction over the person, jurisdiction over the subject-matter, and jurisdiction to render the particular judgment are three separate elements of the jurisdiction of a court. Each element of jurisdiction is dependent upon both law and fact. Facts showing the service of process in time, form, and manner sufficient to satisfy the requirements of mandatory statutes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>that regard are essential to jurisdiction over the person. Facts showing that the matter involved in a suit constitutes a subject-matter consigned by law to the jurisdiction of that court are essential to jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the suit. Facts showing that a particular judgment is rendered in compliance with all existing mandatory law in that regard are essential to jurisdiction to render a particular judgment. All such facts are known as jurisdictional facts.\u201d Drawing on <em>Abraham, </em>the <em>Valenzuela </em>court refered to examples of jurisdictional facts relating to jurisdiction over the subject matter. It is necessary, in the administration of a decedent\u2019s estate, that the facts establish that the owner of the estate is actually dead. In court martial proceedings, it is necessary for the facts to show that the person being tried was actually in the military or naval service. <em>Valenzuelas. Singleton, </em>supra. These are jurisdictional facts relating to jurisdiction over the subject matter. Their existence is fundamental to the power to entertain and adjudicate a proceeding on the merits. In short, such facts condition the power to act. <em>In re First National Bank, </em>152 F. 64, 69 (8th Cir. 1907); <em>Valenzuela v. Singleton, </em>supra, 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The commissioner recognized this when, having heard the claims of the parties, he ruled that he could not consider the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to preclude until an evidentiary hearing on the employer-employee issue had been held. He thereupon conducted such a full hearing, at which both parties testified and were represented by counsel. Given the circumstances, the commissioner had the duty to determine whether there was subject matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., <em>Letterlough </em>v. <em>Alkins, </em>supra; <em>James v. Arlington County Board of Supervisors, </em>supra. The burden of adducing evidence to enable the commissioner to conclude that there was subject matter jurisdiction to bring this claim within the act was on the plaintiffs. <em>Bourgeois v. Cacciapuoti, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>supra, 321; <em>Morganelli </em>v. <em>Derby, </em>supra. It is the power and the duty of the commissioner, as the trier of fact, to determine the facts. <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>supra; <em>Czeplicki </em>v. <em>Fafnir Bearing Co., </em>137 Conn. 454, 457, 78 A.2d 339 (1951). \u201cThe conclusions drawn by him from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u201d <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>supra, 118. On the record before us, the commissioner could properly have concluded that the requisite employer-employee relationship had not existed and, therefore, that there had been no subject matter jurisdiction under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">We also determine that his decision did not violate the act. Speaking to the act itself, no violence is done to its humanitarian and remedial character because the plaintiffs have not brought themselves within its ambit as they were required to do. See <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Welfare Commissioner, </em>171 Conn. 630, 635, 370 A.2d 1082 (1976), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 907, 97 S. Ct. 2953, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1079 (1977). Were it to be held otherwise, then the courts would be legislating by adding a new class to the coverage of this act which proclaims its limited scope. This courts cannot do. \u201c \u2018[I]t is up to the legislatures, not courts, to decide on the wisdom and utility of legislation. . . . [C]ourts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws.\u2019 <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Skrupa, </em>372 U.S. 726, 729-30, 83 S. Ct. 1028, 10 L. Ed. 2d 93 [1963] . . . .\u201d <em>Dupont </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 213, 220, 240 A.2d 899 (1968). The expeditious method of disposing of claims by those entitled to the benefits of the act is not frustrated or abused where the act is not applicable, as here. Only last year, we said: \u201cBecause only <em>employees </em>are entitled to compensation under the act, it is clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>coverage must arise from a contract of employment, either express or implied.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Biancato </em>v. <em>Feldspar </em>Corporation, 203 Conn. 34, 38, 522 A.2d 1235 (1987). Reference has already been made to the conclusive presumptions of \u00a7 31-297 (b); the commissioner, we agree, need not have reached its time-barring character because there was no subject matter jurisdiction of the matter at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Nor is the result we reach today, premised as it is upon the necessity of proving the requisite employer-employee relationship under the act, contrary to any of our decisions as the plaintiffs argue. The same applies to those Appellate Court cases and compensation review division decisions<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to which the plaintiffs refer us. In none of these cases was the critical relationship of employer and employee, as comprehended by the act, at issue. Moreover, we cannot find, nor has either counsel directed us to, any decision by any Connecticut court or tribunal that has ruled that because of the conclusive presumption of \u00a7 31-297 (b), the right to contest the subject matter jurisdiction of a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner is waived where the employer-employee relationship does not exist.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Insofar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>as any other case of a Connecticut court or tribunal suggests that inquiry into the subject matter jurisdiction of the commissioner under the act is precluded by \u00a7 31-297 (b) because of the failure of the \u201cemployer\u201d to file a disclaimer within the twenty day period, any such decision is no longer binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In <em>Menzies </em>and <em>Adzima, </em>the existence of the employer-employee relationship was not in dispute. <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>supra, 108; <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>supra, 339. <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Quality Bakers of America, </em>supra, upon which the plaintiffs lay great stress, involved the constitutionality of the conclusive presumption of \u00a7 31-297 (b) in a case where the employer claimed that the commissioner lacked jurisdiction when he found that the decedent\u2019s death did not arise out of and in the course of his employment. While concluding that the employer\u2019s failure to comply with the twenty day requirement of \u00a7 31-297 (b) precluded the employer from contesting compensability, <em>Bush, </em>how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ever, specifically said: \u201cThe fact that Bush [the plaintiff s decedent] was an employee of Quality. . . is not contested\u201d; id., 373; as that relationship is on this appeal. This alone makes <em>Bush </em>inapposite to the issue on this appeal. In <em>Yuknat </em>v. <em>State, </em>9 Conn. App. 425, 519 A.2d 622 (1987), the Appellate Court affirmed the decision of the compensation review division (CRD No. 274, 2-83,1986) granting the plaintiffs motion to preclude because of the employer\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 31-297 (b). <em>Yuknat, </em>likewise, is inapplicable here because the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was a state employee was not in dispute. In like manner, <em>Stassola </em>v. <em>Fairfield </em>(CRD No. 328, 4-84,1986), also is inapposite; in <em>Stassola, </em>there was no question that the plaintiff police officer had been a Fairfield town employee for thirty years. An examination of the decision in <em>DeLeon </em>v. <em>Jacob Bros., Inc., </em>38 Conn. Sup. 331, 446 A.2d 831 (1981), appeal dismissed, 456 U.S. 952, 102 S. Ct. 2026, 72 L. Ed. 2d 477 (1982), indicates that the employer-employee relationship was not at issue. <em>DeLeon </em>is therefore inapposite on the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In <em>LaVogue </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, Inc., </em>supra, upon which the plaintiffs rely, as did the compensation review division in reversing the commissioner in this case, a rather unusual fact pattern was presented including the operation of \u00a7 31-297 (b) in a conflict-of-laws setting. In <em>LaVogue, </em>it would appear that a non-Connecticut employer (Ohio) had a non-Connecticut employment contract with an employee who suffered an eye injury while working in Rhode Island for that employer. The employee lived in Connecticut at his employer\u2019s request and maintained an office in Connecticut for his employer for which he was paid by that employer at the time of his injury. The plaintiff was awarded Massachusetts compensation benefits where his employer maintained a regional office, but then he also filed for compensation benefits in Connecticut. The employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>did not contest compensability or liability but claimed that Connecticut did not have jurisdiction and that, therefore, the employee was not entitled to benefits pursuant to the Connecticut workers\u2019 compensation schedule but only to the benefits payable under the Massachusetts schedule. The employer accordingly claimed that its failure to file a notice to contest under \u00a7 31-297 (b) did not prevent it from attacking the jurisdiction of the Connecticut workers\u2019 compensation commission over its employee\u2019s claims. The Connecticut commissioner denied the employee\u2019s motion to preclude and dismissed his appeal. On review of that action the compensation review division ruled that the employee\u2019s motion to preclude should have been granted. Although the review division decided that the employer had conceded \u201cboth compensability and jurisdiction\u201d when it failed to contest the employee\u2019s initial claim, it also went on to conclude that the employee\u2019s contacts with Connecticut were sufficient to give Connecticut jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s employment relationship with the defendant. The Appellate Court simply held that <em>Bush </em>\u201cis dispositive of this appeal.\u201d <em>LaVogue </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, Inc., </em>supra, 93. In doing so, it said: \u201cIt is, therefore, unnecessary for us to reach the issue of whether Connecticut had jurisdiction over the employment relationship based on the facts of this case.\u201d Id. Despite this holding, the Appellate Court went on to say: \u201cIf an employer fails to file a notice contesting liability, the employer shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of the employee\u2019s injury \u2018and shall have no right thereafter to contest the employee\u2019s right to receive compensation <em>on any grounds </em>. . . .\u2019 (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-297 (b).\u201d Id. Two circumstances relevant to our discussion emerge from the exegesis of <em>LaVogue. </em>First, and significantly, any fair reading of that case discloses that the status of employer and employee was not at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>issue. Again, that circumstance alone makes it inapposite here. Second, to the extent that the portion of \u00a7 31-297 (b) quoted by the <em>LaVogue </em>court with its emphasis of the \u201con any grounds\u201d language might be read to suggest that subject matter jurisdiction cannot be examined, we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">On an appeal from a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner\u2019s decision, the compensation review division \u201chear[s] the appeal on the record of the hearing before the commissioner\u201d unless it determines, under the statute, to take \u201cadditional evidence or testimony.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (a). No such \u201cadditional evidence or testimony\u201d was taken by the compensation review division in this case. In making its final determination of an appeal, the compensation review division \u201cshall issue its decision, affirming, modifying or reversing the decision of the commissioner.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (a). The decision of the compensation review division must stand unless it results \u201cfrom an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u201d <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>supra, 118; <em>Luddie </em>v. <em>Foremost Ins. Co., </em>5 Conn. App. 193, 196, 497 A.2d 1235 (1985). It follows from what we have held in this opinion that the compensation review division incorrectly applied the law to the subordinate facts found by the commissioner and, therefore, the compensation review division should have affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">There is error, the decision of the compensation review division remanding the matter to the commissioner is set aside and the matter is remanded to the compensation review division with direction to affirm the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-11\"> The plaintiffs\u2019 motion to preclude was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-12\">\u201cmotion to preclude</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-13\">\u201cThe Claimant hereby moves to preclude the respondents from contesting liability in the above-captioned matter in that the respondents failed to file a Notice of Intent To Contest Liability pursuant to C.G.S.

In that connection, we quoted that section as it had been amended in 1967: \u201c \u2018Whenever liability to pay compensation is contested by the employer, he shall file with the compensation commissioner, on or before the twentieth day after he has received a written notice of claim, a notice in accord with a form prescribed by the commissioners stating that the right to compensation is contested, the name of the claimant, the name of the employer, the date of the alleged injury or death and the <em>specific </em>grounds on which the right to compensation is contested, and a copy thereof shall be sent to the employee. <em>If the employer or his legal representative fails to file the notice contesting liability unthin the time prescribed herein, the employer shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of such alleged injury or death and shall have no right thereafter to contest the employee\u2019s right to receive compensation on any grounds or the extent of his disability.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The emphasized language of this statute was incorporated by Public Acts 1967, No. 842, \u00a7 7. The 1967 Public Act amended thirty other sections of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\"> In <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>177 Conn. 107, 113-14, 411 A.2d 924 (1979), in pointing out that General Statutes \u00a7 31-297 (b) addressed an employer\u2019s \u201cthreshold failure\u201d to contest \u201cliability,\u201d we said: \u201cThe statute clearly speaks to a threshold failure on the employer\u2019s part to contest \u2018liability\u2019: to claim, for example, that the injury did not arise out of and in the course of employment; see <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>[165 Conn. 338, 340, 334 A.2d 452 (1973)]; that the injury fell within an exception to the coverage provided by workmen\u2019s compensation; see <em>Draus </em>v. <em>International Silver Co., </em>105 Conn. 415, 418, 135 A. 437 (1926); or that the plaintiff was not an employee of the defendant, but an independent contractor; see <em>Biederzycki </em>v. <em>Farrel Foundry &amp; Machine Co., </em>103 Conn. 701, 704, 131 A. 739 (1926).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">A close examination of <em>Biederzycki </em>discloses that there was no issue in that case of the employer-employee relationship of the plaintiffs decedent husband and the defendant employer. Rather, the crucial issue was whether, sometime after the commissioner had made his finding and award in favor of the plaintiff against the employer, the commissioner had the power to reopen or modify the award under the act upon the motion of the employer that he do so. We held that he could not do so under the statute. In <em>Biederzycki, </em>which preceded the enactment of \u00a7 31-297 (b), we simply construed the statute as not granting the commissioner the power to reopen and modify. This was wholly consistent even then with our position that the jurisdiction of the commissioner is \u201cconfined by the Act and limited by its provisions.\u201d <em>Jester </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>99 Conn. 236, 238, 121 A. 470 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Our decision in <em>Biederzycki </em>relied upon the earlier case of <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Wallace &amp; Sons Mfg. Co., </em>100 Conn. 180, 123 A. 9 (1923). In <em>Hayden, </em>the defendant employer moved to reopen the commissioner\u2019s award sometime after it had voluntarily agreed to pay compensation to the claimants, maintaining that it had discovered more than one year after making this agreement that the claimants were not its employees but rather were employees of an independent contractor with whom it had contracted to do certain work at its factory. <em>In Hayden, </em>we advised the commissioner, who had initially denied the employer\u2019s motion to reopen, to dismiss the appeal. We did so, indicating that the employer\u2019s failure to ascertain the facts showing its nonliability was due to its own negligence, that it was estopped from abandoning the position it had deliberately taken and that the commissioner could not do so under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Accordingly, we do not no w read <em>Biederzycki </em>or its use of <em>Hayden </em>as inconsistent with or controlling our disposition of the appeal now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\"> We require the assertion of facts in a pleading which will permit a court to find jurisdiction. For example, in dissolution matters, our practice requires the stating of \u201cfacts [in a complaint] necessary to give the court jurisdiction.\u201d See Practice Book \u00a7 453.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\"> We need not address certain aspects of the compensation review division cases we refer to below including any claim that its decision in this case violated certain constitutional protections. This is so because the defendants withdrew and did not brief or argue another of their preliminary statement of issues which asked: \u201cWhether the Compensation Review Division, Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission violated the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution in its ruling that subject matter jurisdiction was waived by the respondents as a result of their failure to file a Notice of Intent to Contest Liability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\"> The plaintiffs point out that General Statutes \u00a7 31-297 (b) provides that the employer must file, within twenty days, the prescribed notice which must include \u201cthe specific grounds in which the right to compensation is contested . . . .\u201d Relying upon the dissent in <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>177 Conn. 107, 119, 411 A.2d 924 (1979) <em>(Bogdanski, J., </em>dissenting), they argue that the first word in \u00a7 31-297 (b), i.e., \u201c[wjhenever [liability to pay compensation is contested by the employer . . .]\u201d means \u201cin any or every instance\u201d and they go on to say that \u00a7 31-297 (b) \u201cdoes not state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>that this does not include a defense that there is no jurisdiction of the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Apparently to reinforce this argument, they point to later language in \u00a7 31-297 (b) that provides that if the employer does not comply with the twenty day notice provision, the employer \u201cshall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability . . . and shall have no right thereafter to contest the employee\u2019s right to receive compensation <em>on any grounds </em>or the extent of his disability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs, therefore, conclude that the \u201con any grounds\u201d language \u201cdoes not limit the grounds to anything, including lack of jurisdiction of the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">This claim is without merit. Subject matter jurisdiction is conceptually and analytically involved. We have cited authority that it is settled law that the \u201ccommissioner\u2019s jurisdiction is \u2018confined by the Act and limited by its provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>United Aircraft Corporation, </em>159 Conn. 302, 305, 268 A.2d 660 (1970). Therefore, subject matter jurisdiction must exist before the act applies. Next, the employer-employee relationship as contemplated by the act must be demonstrated for the commissioner to have the power under the act to carry out its objectives. Furthermore, the lack of subject matter jurisdiction does not, strictly speaking, address the right not to contest liability to pay compensation, but rather amounts to declaring that the act does not apply at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
