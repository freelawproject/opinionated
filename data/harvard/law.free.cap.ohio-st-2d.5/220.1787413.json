There is no dispute as to their authenticity and their accuracy. The board refused to admit this testimony, and it was proffered by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">The principal contention of the appellees is that the mandate in the case of <em>State, ex rel. Park Investment Co., </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Appeals, </em>175 Ohio St. 410, requires that the rationale of that case apply to these individual complaints only after the date upon which the judgment in that case was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">The appellees contend further that Section 5717.03, Revised Code, requires the board to assess the property at its full \u201ctrue value in money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">These questions were raised and determined in <em>Koblenz </em>v. <em>Board of Revision, </em>5 Ohio St. 2d 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals are reversed and the causes remanded to the board for a determination of assessments which will meet the constitutional requirements of uniformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\n<em>Decisions reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b268-5\">Taft, C.
