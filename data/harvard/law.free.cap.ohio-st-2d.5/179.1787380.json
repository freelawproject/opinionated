I have attempted to show in my dissenting opinion in <em>Philada Home Fund </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Appeals, </em>5 Ohio St. 2d 135, at page 140, that neither the Constitution of Ohio nor the legislative enactments pursuant thereto require that the <em>property </em>here involved be used for charitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>purposes to the exclusion of all other uses, so as to qualify it for tax exemption, unless Article I of the Constitution of Ohio is transgressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The constitutional question has not been raised by the appellees, and it is clear that the use of the property is not such as would support a conclusion that it is in competition with other dwelling units in the mainstream of the real estate market.</p>\n<judges id=\"b228-7\">Taft, C.
