And, furthermore, does the commission\u2019s order, under the allegations of the petition, show an error of law or an abuse of discretion?</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">Arthrosis is defined as a disease or a degenerative process in a joint. Blakiston\u2019s New Gould Medical Dictionary, 2 Ed. 112. See, also, Maloy Medical Dictionary for Lawyers, 3 Ed. 74; Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">In Principles of Internal Medicine (McGraw-Hill, 1958), at page 1727, it is said that degenerative joint disease is generally considered to be related to the physiological process of aging, and that the commonly held view as to the causes of these de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>generative changes is that they result from <em>ordinary </em>\u201cwear and tear, \u2019 \u2019 that is, from cumulative repeated trauma of <em>various </em>kinds.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Degenerative arthrosis is not one of the occupational diseases specifically listed in Section 4123.68, Eevised Code. If it represents a compensable occupational disease at all, it must fall within the language of subparagraph (X) of that section, which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u201cAll other occupational diseases: A disease <em>peculiar </em>to a particular industrial process, trade, or occupation and to which an employee is not ordinarily subjected or exposed outside of or away from his employment.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Here, the Industrial Commission performed its functions and exercised its judgment and determined that claimant\u2019s disability from arthrosis did not fall within the statutory provisions embracing occupational diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">As hereinbefore noted, it is the common and generally held consensus that arthrosis results \u201cfrom ordinary \u2018wear and tear\u2019 \u201d and is usually an affliction incident to aging; hence it does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (X) of Section 4123.68, Eevised Code, in being a disease <em>peculiar </em>to a particular employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">We can discover no reversible error in the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas or the Court of Appeals, and the judgment of the latter court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b133-11\">Tart, C.

The obvious purport of sub-paragraph (X) of Section 4123.68, Eevised Code, is to extend the coverage of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act to all occupational diseases not specifically mentioned in other subparagraphs of that section and to provide compensation as well for such other diseases which are caused by conditions peculiar to a particular occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">1 am persuaded that one who is otherwise covered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>act who claims that her degenerative arthrosis has been made symptomatic by repeated traumas incurred in her occupation is entitled to every reasonable inference from the language adopted by the General Assembly in enacting subparagraph (X), and that the Industrial Commission should be required to determine whether a direct causal relationship exists between the cumulative traumas and the disabling effects of the disease from which she claims to suffer. If the proof shows that relationship to exist in fact, she suffers from a disease peculiar to her particular occupation to which she is not ordinarily subjected or exposed outside of or away from her employment, hence, an occupational disease, and is entitled to be compensated to the extent of disability caused by the occurrences which she suffered in her occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">She is not entitled to <em>appeal </em>from the refusal of the Industrial Commission to perform the duty to make that determination <em>(Szekely </em>v. <em>Young, Admr., </em>174 Ohio St. 213), and therefore a writ of mandamus should issue to compel its performance.</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-6\">O\u2019Neill and Herbert, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
