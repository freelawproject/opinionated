Harold R.

Stewart, Jr., District Judge, 365 F.Supp. 1171, denying defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a complaint in an action brought to recover damages for alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j (b) (1970), Rule 10b-5 promulgated under the 1934 Act, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5 (1973), and Sections 12(2) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77J(2) and 77q(a) (1970),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in connection with the promotion and sale of shares of stock of a cooperative housing corporation, the sole issue is whether such stock is a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(1) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b (1) (1970), and Section 3(a) (10) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(10) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-17\">We affirm essentially for the reasons set forth in the well reasoned opinion of Judge Stewart below and upon the authority of our recent decision in Forman v. Community Services, Inc., 500 F.2d 1246, 1250-55 (2 Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-19\">In view of the detailed statement of facts in the district court opinion, it is sufficient for our purpose briefly to summarize only those facts necessary to an understanding of our rulings on the legal issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-20\">Plaintiffs are the 1050 Tenants Corp. (1050 Corp.), a cooperative housing corporation located at 1050 Park Avenue, New York City, and Herbert and Joan Saltzman, purchasers and holders of cooperative shares in 1050 .Corp. The Saltzmans sue on behalf of themselves and as representatives of a class consisting of all past and present 1050 Corp. shareholders. Defendants are the sponsors and promoters of the cooperative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>plan pursuant to which 1050 Corp. was organized and its shares were offered and sold to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">The gravamen of the complaint is that defendants violated various antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements and by failing to disclose material facts in connection with the offer and sale of cooperative shares of 1050 Corp. Defendants contend that the offer and sale of these shares were of interests in real estate, not of \u201csecurities\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">In 1968, defendants were the fee owners of a building at 1050 Park Avenue. They undertook a plan to convert the building to cooperative ownership. They formed 1050 Corp. Pursuant to N.Y.Gen.Bus.Law \u00a7 352-e (McKinney 1968), they made a public offering of its corporate stock by a formal prospectus (the Plan). Among other matters, the Plan set forth a detailed description of the building, appraisals of the condition of its physical plant and an outline of the corporation\u2019s capital structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-7\">The corporation has an authorized capital of 45,000 shares, $1.00 par value. Of the authorized shares, 42,400 were allotted to 60 residential apartments according to the selling price of each. Pursuant to the Plan, some apartments were not offered for residential use, but are rented out as doctors\u2019 offices. The income from these rentals is used by the corporation to offset and reduce the periodic assessments on the shareholder-tenants for maintenance of the building. Also pursuant to the Plan, the corporation was required to assume certain obligations entered into on its behalf by the promoters. These included management and service contracts and two mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-8\">Unlike a traditional business corporation, the rights and obligations of the shareholders of 1050 Corp. flow, not from their ownership of corporate shares, but from a uniform proprietary lease. Each shareholder is required to execute such a lease. In addition to the usual landlord-tenant covenants, the lease requires each shareholder-tenant to make monthly payments to the corporation of his pro rata share of the expenses of the corporation. It also imposes certain restrictions and prohibitions on the rights of the shareholders freely to sublet their apartments, to assign their leases or otherwise to transfer or encumber their interests in the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-11\">In most material respects, however, 1050 Corp. has the external indices typical of a traditional business corporation. It was formed pursuant to N.Y.Bus. Corp.Law \u00a7 402 (McKinney 1963); it has a formal corporate charter and bylaws ; ownership interests are represented by certificates of stock; its shareholders have a voice in the corporate decision making process; they elect directors on the basis of one share, one vote; and they are entitled to annual financial statements. In short, the only significant difference between 1050 Corp. and the traditional business corporation is the fact that it was formed and is operated to facilitate home ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-12\">The critical question raised by defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint is whether the shares of stock in 1050 Corp. are \u201cseeurit[ies]\u201d under the federal securities laws. The district court held that they are. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-14\">Section 3(a) (10) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(10) (1970), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1441-15\">\u201cThe term \u2018security\u2019 means any stock . . . investment contract . . . or in general, any instrument commonly known as a \u2018security\u2019 . . . . <em>\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>In Forman v. Community Services, Inc., <em>supra, </em>500 F.2d at 1251-55, we held that a share of stock in a nonprofit cooperative housing corporation, which was chartered, promoted and subsidized under New York\u2019s Mitchell-Lama Act, N.Y. Private Housing Finance Law \u00a7\u00a7 10-37 (McKinney 1974 Supp.), and was supervised by the State Housing Authority, was both \u201cstock\u201d and an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d under \u00a7 3(a)(10). In the instant case, we believe that an even more compelling showing has been made than in <em>Forman </em>for including the cooperative shares of 1050 Corp. within the ambit of \u00a7 3(a) (10) and thus making available the protection of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">First, we ground our decision on what has been characterized as the \u201cliteral approach\u201d. Forman v. Community Services, Inc., <em>supra, </em>500 F.2d at 1252, and authorities there cited. 1050 Corp., is not affected by any of the state supervisory or eleemosynary factors on the basis of which the defendants in <em>Forman </em>sought unsuccessfully to distinguish shares in that cooperative corporation from those in a traditional business corporation. The structure of 1050 Corp. is more closely analogous to that of corporations whose stock unquestionably is a \u201csecurity\u201d. Defendants have failed to persuade us why the 1050 Corp. stock should be treated differently. We hold that the shares of stock in 1050 Corp. are \u201cseeurit[ies]\u201d under the federal securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">Secondly, we hold, as we did in <em>For-man, </em>that the sale of a cooperative share constitutes the sale of an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d under the three pronged test formulated by the Supreme Court in SEC v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 298-99 (1946).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d element is too plain to warrant discussion. As for the requirement that there be an expectation of \u201cprofits\u201d or \u201ceconomic inducements\u201d, SEC v. C. M. Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U.S. 344, 353 (1943), the three elements found to have been sufficient in <em>Forman </em>are present here: (1) the shareholder-tenants of 1050 Corp. benefit directly from substantial non-residential income which is used by the corporation to reduce the monthly carrying charges;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) they are afforded an opportunity to make substantial savings on their personal income tax in the form of deductions for their payment of a proportionate share of the corporation\u2019s deductible expenses; and (3) they stand to benefit from obtaining the optimum services at the lowest possible cost. In addition, there is a \u201cprofit\u201d element here that was notably absent in <em>Forman: </em>the shareholder-tenants of 1050 Corp. have the expectation of capital appreciation on a resale of their stock. Finally, the requirement that expectations of profit derive \u201csolely from the efforts of the promoter[s] or a third party\u201d, 328 U.S. at 299,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is clearly satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-12\">In short, we hold that a share in 1050 Corp. is both a \u201cstock\u201d and an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d under the federal securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1440-14\">. The complaint also alleged violations of New York\u2019s blue sky laws and related common law claims. In view of the ground of our decision, we do not reach these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1441-9\">. The definition of \u201csecurity\u201d in the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b (1) (1970), is \u2018\u201cvirtually identical\u2019 and interchangeable with that in the 1934 Act.\u201d Forman v. Community Services, Inc., <em>supra, </em>500 F.2d at 1250-51, citing Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 335-36 (1967), and Glen-Arden Commodities, Inc. v. Costantino, 493 F.2d 1027, 1034 n. 6 (2 Cir. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1442-6\">. The <em>Howey </em>formulation is as follows:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1442-7\">\u201c[A]n investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party . . . .\u201d SEC v. W. J. Howey Co., <em>supra, </em>328 U.S. at 298-99.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1442-9\">. Non-residential use income from the rental of doctors\u2019 offices was projected in the Plan to total $24,500 annually or approximately 6% of the anticipated annual maintenance budget.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1442-14\">. Even if the shareholder-tenants of 1050 Corp. were to assume some small role in the management of the venture, that alone would not defeat the <em>Howey </em>\u201creliance\u201d requirement. E. g., Lino v. City Investing Co., 487 F.2d 689, 692 (3 Cir. 1973); Nash &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Lum\u2019s of Ohio, 484 F.2d 392, 395 (6 Cir. 1973); SEC v. Glen Turner Enterprises, Inc., 474 F.2d 476, 482 (9 Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 821 (1973).
