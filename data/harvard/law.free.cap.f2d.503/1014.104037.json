Her principal contention on this appeal is that the indictment charged her with \u201cthe actual distribution\u201d of the heroin, and therefore she could not be convicted on proof that the heroin was physically handed to the purchaser by defendant\u2019s daughter at defendant\u2019s direction. Defendant also contends that the Government\u2019s proof is deficient because it does not show that she had knowledge of the presence of the heroin and power to exercise dominion and control over it, or that she had a right to exclude others from the house where the transaction took place or the room from which the daughter obtained the heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-11\">The Government offered the testimony of an informant that on the date charged in the indictment he met the defendant at her residence, where three or four other people, including defendant\u2019s young daughter, were present. After some hesitation, defendant agreed to sell the informant six \u201cbags\u201d for $85, and she told her daughter \u201cto go get them and bring them back.\u201d The daughter left the room, returned with six bags which contained heroin, and without further instruction from her mother handed them to the informant. The informant further testified that on previous occasions he had purchased heroin from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-13\">This evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the Government, proves that the defendant did knowingly and intentionally distribute heroin. First, if more were needed than the circumstances of the transaction itself, defendant\u2019s previous dealings in heroin tend to show that she knew the bags contained heroin. Second, defendant exercised sufficient control over the transaction to be the principal in the sale. According to the evidence, she and no one else negotiated the sale and caused her daughter to deliver the bags containing heroin by her instructions to \u201cgo get them and bring them back.\u201d The Government\u2019s failure to prove that defendant exercised exclusive control over the place of sale, the storage place of the heroin, or the heroin itself is of no consequence. She had sufficient control over the heroin to cause it to be distributed to the informant, and that is all the statute requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-14\">Defendant\u2019s contention that, because she did not physically hand the heroin to the purchaser, she did not \u201cdistribute\u201d it is without merit. The defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a constructive transfer of the heroin and was therefore prohibited by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), which is a part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq. That subsection, which substitutes new language for the comparable provision of former 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174, makes it unlawful \u201cto . . . distribute ... a controlled substance.\u201d The word \u201cdistribute\u201d is defined as meaning \u201cto deliver,\u201d and \u201cdeliver\u201d is defined as meaning \u201cthe actual, constructive, or attempted transfer of a controlled substance, whether or not there exists an agency relationship.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(8) and (11). Accordingly, a constructive transfer of a controlled substance constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>distribution under section 841(a)(1). Clearly defendant constructively transferred the heroin to the informant by causing her daughter to hand it to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
