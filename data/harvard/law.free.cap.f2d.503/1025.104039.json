In United States v. Beck, 483 F.2d 203, 207 (3d Cir. 1973), Judge Rosenn explained the \u201cspecial, pragmatic standards for judging the legality of stops and searches in or around border areas or international port facilities,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-4\">\u201cInstead of the usual requirement of probable cause to believe that an individual possesses contraband or that he has committed a crime demanded by the Fourth Amendment, a customs officer need only have a reasonable suspicion of illegal activity. [Citing cases.] \u2018A customs officer has the unique power to stop a person at an international entry point to conduct a \u201cborder search\u201d without having a search warrant and even having probable cause to believe the person has committed a crime.\u2019 [Citing case.] Recognition of this diminished constitutional standard is reflected in 19 U. S.C. \u00a7 482, specifically authorizing customs officers to stop and search vehicles or persons in or on which they suspect there is merchandise illegally brought into the United States. It does not, of course, exempt border searches from the constitutional test of reasonableness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1090-14\">Based on the facts found in the district court opinion of March 11, 1974, and considering the totality of the circumstances in the record,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a \u201creal suspicion\u201d justifying a strip search was present in this case. See United States v. Guadalupe-Garza, 421 F.2d 876, 879 (9th Cir. 1970), where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-15\">\u201c \u2018Real suspicion\u2019 justifying the initiation of a strip search is subjective suspicion supported by objective, ar-ticulable facts that would reasonably lead an experienced, prudent customs official to suspect that a particular person seeking to cross our border is concealing something on his body for the purpose of transporting it into the United States contrary to law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>\u201cThe objective, articulable facts must bear some reasonable relationship to suspicion that something is concealed on the body of the person to be searched; otherwise, the scope of the search is not related to the justification for its initiation, as it must be to meet the reasonableness standard of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">See also United States v. Glaziou, 402 F.2d 8, 12 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1121, 89 S.Ct. 999, 22 L.Ed.2d 126 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">The March 11, 1974, judgment and commitment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">. The objective facts on which the customs officials formed their real suspicion of smuggling were accurately summarized in the appellee\u2019s brief, pp. 9-10, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-6\">\u201c1. The unusualness of a Latin American deboarding into the United States from an Air Jamaica flight;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-7\">\u201c2. the strange disappearance of another Latin who had entered in tire same fashion a short time earlier;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-8\">\u201c3. the circuitous route of travel to reach the ultimate destination of New York for the purpose of simply visiting friends;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-9\">\u201c4. the two one-way tickets in Zuluaga\u2019s coat pocket that were purchased in numerical sequence with the identical circuitous route;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-10\">\u201c5. The denials by both Zuluaga and Diaz that they were traveling together;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-11\">\u201c6. the large amounts of cash on each but the absence of a wallet or other form of identification other than their passports ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-12\">\u201c7. the nervousness of Defendant\u2019s companion when questioned by the Customs Officials;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-16\">\u201c8. the knowledge of the Customs Agents of the modus operandi of a man and woman smuggling team and how the actions of Zuluaga and Diaz fit this profile ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-17\">\u201c9. the fact that Zuluaga was one of the first passengers to deboard and Diaz was one of the last despite all indications that they were traveling together;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-18\">\u201c10. the small amount of luggage (one carry-on suitcase) that each had, the absence of warm clothing and the absence of trinkets for friends they allegedly were about to visit in New York;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-19\">\u201c11. the Defendant\u2019s appearance of attempting to conceal her upper chest by leaning over the Immigration counter, crossing her arms in front of her chest and grabbing both sides of her coat and pulling them together ; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-20\">\u201c12. the fact that Defendant\u2019s upper chest appeared overly large or bulky for a woman of her size and shape.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
