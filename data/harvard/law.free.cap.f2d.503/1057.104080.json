The District Court dismissed the petition, holding that at sentencing it had made \u201cimplicit\u201d, though not \u201cexplicit\u201d findings justifying failure to sentence under the Act. It is not sufficient, however, that the findings against the use of the Act in such a case as this be \u201cimplicit\u201d ; the statute, it has been held, requires \u201cexplicit\u201d findings on the record that no benefit would result from sentencing under the Act. The order of the District Court is accordingly reversed and remanded, with directions, that the appellant\u2019s sentence be vacated and his sentence reconsidered. Dorszynski v. United States (1974), 418 U.S. 424, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 41 L.Ed.2d 855; United States v. Ashby (4th Cir. 1974), 502 F.2d 1163 (Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-20\">As we said in <em>Ashby, </em>however, \u201c[Although we conclude that on this record the sentence imposed was invalid, it may validly be imposed if the district court in its discretion concludes that [the appellant] would not benefit from treatment under the Act and makes that specific finding; otherwise [appellant] should be sentenced under the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-21\">Sentence vacated; remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
