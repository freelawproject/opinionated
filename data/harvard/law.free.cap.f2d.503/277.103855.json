We determine that he may not, agreeably with the Fourth Amendment, and therefore do not find it necessary to reach the other issues argued on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-28\">In a jury trial which concluded on September 6, 1973, Cupps was convicted of possessing a pistol in violation of 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The events which led to his conviction occurred on April 29, 1971.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On that day, Kentucky state police officers Hubert Jarvis and Jerry Combs were driving up the access road to a state police barracks when they observed Cupps\u2019 white Cadillac automobile as it preceded them up the drive. Cupps\u2019 vehicle turned around and immediately went back down the road toward the City of Hazard, and the officers recognized Cupps, who they knew had been convicted 12 years earlier for the possession of untaxed alcoholic beverages, a felony. Combs testified that he \u201cimmediately turned and gave chase.\u201d He signaled Cupps to pull to the side of the road and, followed by Jarvis, left the police car and approached Cupps\u2019 automobile. Combs then asked to see Cupps\u2019 driver\u2019s license. Cupps showed him a valid license, and Combs handed the license to Jarvis and ordered Cupps out of the ear. Combs then proceeded to walk around to the other side to scrutinize Cupps\u2019 two passengers more closely. At this point, Combs testified that he spotted a Colt pistol on the front seat of the car, in a place that would have been under Cupps\u2019 leg had Cupps still been sitting in the car.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He called Jarvis\u2019 attention to it, ordered the other two men out of the car and searched them \u201c[n]ot physically, but more or less sort of went over them with a search.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cupps was asked why he had gone to the barracks, and he explained that he had been \u201croughed\u201d by a fellow in a state police vehicle the preceding night and that his attorney had advised him to go to the barracks to ascertain the license number of the police vehicle. Jarvis replied \u201cthat [Cupps] had a poor lawyer, that his lawyer would get him killed,\u201d and seized the gun. A Hazard city police officer who had stopped to offer assistance checked police records and reported that the pistol had not been stolen. Cupps claimed ownership of the gun, and Jarvis gave him a receipt for it and informed him that it would be turned over to federal agents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">Combs testified that his purpose in detaining Cupps was \u201cto check and see first if Mr. Cupps still had his operator\u2019s license, and I wanted to know the individuals that was in the vehicle also.\u201d Jarvis testified that he \u201cwanted to see what Hoyt Cupps\u2019 business was up there.\u201d He testified that Cupps might have gone up to the barracks for the purpose of dynamiting it. He believed Cupps should have stopped at the barracks and stated his business there, and that state police \u201chave a perfect right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>stop any vehicle upon any public highway for examination,\u201d without a reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Under Kentucky state law, state police are empowered to demand, without other justification, the production of a valid driver\u2019s license of any driver.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Upon challenge, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of this statute when a roadblock was set up to stop all drivers indiscriminately, but reserved judgment about selective application of the procedure. Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 355 S.W.2d 686 (Ky.1962).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The Supreme Court has said that the law governing warrantless searches and seizures of automobiles \u201cis something less than a seamless web.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the Fourth Amendment provides certain basic protections to the motorist. \u201cIt is well settled under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments that a search conducted without a warrant issued upon probable cause is <em>\u2018per se </em>unreasonable . . . subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u2019 Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357 [88 S.Ct. 507, 514, 19 L.Ed.2d 576]; Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 454-455 [91 S.Ct. 2022, 2031-2032, 29 L.Ed. 2d 564]; Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 51 [90 S.Ct. 1975, 1981, 26 L.Ed.2d 419].\u201d Schneckloth v. Busta-monte, 412 U.S. 217, 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2043, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">One of these exceptions concerns automobiles. Thus, under Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925), an unconsented search of an automobile may be conducted without a warrant and without probable cause for arrest, where the police have probable cause to believe it is carrying contraband. However, \u201cthe <em>Carroll </em>doctrine does not declare a field day for the police in searching automobiles. Automobiles or no automobiles, there must be probable cause for the search.\u201d Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cardwell v. Lewis, 417 U.S. 583, 94 S.Ct. 2464, 41 L.Ed.2d 325 (1974), extended the <em>Carroll </em>mobile vehicle exception to the warrant-less seizure of an immobile and unoccupied automobile and examination of its <em>exterior </em>in an impoundment area. <em>Card-well </em>did not, however, eliminate the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>quirement of probable cause. <em>Id. </em>589-590, 94 S.Ct. 2464.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The case before us now, however, does not involve the search of an automobile. The evidence is uncontroverted that the gun became visible to the police only after Cupps was ordered out of the automobile. If the police were rightfully in the position from which they observed the weapon, the plain view exception would have been applicable and they could have seized the gun without a warrant. Harris v. United States, 390 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 992, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1968). The question which is presented, then, is whether, in ordering Cupps out of the car, the police exceeded what we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>was their lawful authority to stop him for the purpose of examining his driver\u2019s license. In the absence of consent,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> this action was a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972), Justice Rehnquist stated the rule governing searches of persons in automobiles: \u201cSo long as the officer is entitled to make a forcible stop, and has reason to believe that the suspect is armed and dangerous, he may conduct a weapons search limited in scope to this protective purpose.\u201d 407 U.S. at 146, 92 S.Ct. at 1923 (explaining <em>Terry, supra). </em>The officer must be able to point to \u201cspecific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d <em>Terry, supra, </em>at' 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1880. In <em>Adams, </em>the officer acted on the basis of an informant\u2019s tip that the defendant was in possession of narcotics and was armed. Because the intrusion was limited to action necessary for self protection,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Court held that the protective search incident to a reasonable investigatory stop was permissible under <em>Terry, </em>even though defendant was suspected only of a possessory offense. In the case before us, when the police officers required Cupps to leave his car, they did not possess any articulable basis for suspecting criminal behavior on his part or possession of contraband, and they had no reason to fear for their own safety. There is nothing in the record to indicate that even the minimal standards of <em>Terry </em>were met. The officers\u2019 personal knowledge of Cupps\u2019 criminal record was not an irrelevant consideration; \u201c[b]ut to hold [that] that knowledge . . . constituted probable cause would be to hold that anyone with a previous criminal record could be arrested at will.\u201d Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 97, 85 S.Ct. 223, 228, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964). Knowledge of appellant\u2019s prior record was insufficient either to establish probable cause or to afford the basis for reasonable suspicion. Jarvis testified that he believed that Cupps intended to dynamite the police barracks when in midday he drove up to the facility in a white Cadillac, but this belief, expressed as a second thought, does not validate the search. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Jarvis admitted that he did not look for any dynamite after Cupps was pulled to the side of the road, and the district court made no finding crediting this assertion as justification for the seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">In determining that the seizure of Cupps went beyond any exception to the rule proscribing warrantless searches of vehicles, we have assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that the state police have, as appellee contends, under their authority to inspect licenses, an absolute right to stop any driver. Although it is unnecessary to decide the question in this appeal, we observe that the officers\u2019 claim that this was their reason for stopping appellant is refuted by other evidence. They testified that they followed and stopped Cupps because they wanted to know his business and the identity of his passengers, and not because they wanted to inspect his license. At least one of them believed that citizens could be required to state their business in a public place before being allowed to proceed. Police may not lawfully use their general inspection powers as a pretext for stopping motorists for the purpose of inquiring about their business on the public highways.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The pretextuous nature of the stop in this case is demonstrated by the fact that Cupps\u2019 driving to the police barracks was an entirely lawful act. A person acts lawfully when he enters a public place without disturbing the peace to make a record of public property openly displayed. Jarvis and Combs acted beyond their authority when they ordered Cupps out of the automobile, and, therefore, the plain view doctrine never became operative. Unless an officer has a right to be where he is, \u201cplain view <em>alone </em>is never enough to justify the warrantless seizure of evidence.\u201d Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 468, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2039, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the indictment, since the inadmissibility of the weapon as evidence precludes a conviction for its unlawful possession.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-5\">. 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">(a) Any person wlio\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">(1) has been convicted by a court of the United States or of a State or any political subdivision thereof of a felony,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">and who receives, possesses, or transports in commerce or affecting commerce, after the date of enactment of this Act, any firearm shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than two years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b343-10\">. The indictment was issued on March 20, 1972, and on March 9, 1973, the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the weapon as evidence was overruled. A trial leading to a hung jury ended on March 27, 1973, necessitating this trial, which ended on September 6, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">Cupps was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment, probated to 3 years and was fined $5,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b343-14\">. Cupps was not called as a witness at the hearing on the motion to suppress, but he testified at trial that the gun had been under an armrest in the center of the seat, and not under his leg. Since we hold that the police were not rightfully in a position ' to see the gun even if it were in plain view, as Combs and Jarvis testified, we think this discrepancy is immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b343-16\">. Cupps testified at trial that Combs asked him for his license, ordered him out of the automobile, stood him up against the car, hit him, ordered him to stand straight, searched him, opened the car door, and reached under the armrest to get the gun. Both officers denied having searched Cupps, although they admitted having searched his companions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b343-17\">. Cupps was not arrested by the state officers, because it was Kentucky practice to refrain from making arrests on federal charges without a warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\">. Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 186.510 (1971) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">The licensee shall have his license in his immediate possession at all times when driving a motor vehicle and shall display it upon demand to ... a member of the Kentucky state police ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aud\">Kentucky police are <em>not </em>empowered to inspect vehicles for possible violation of the motor Vehicle laws without reasonable cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADll\">The commissioner, uniformed officers and troopers of the department of public safety and department of motor transportation and such other officers and employees of the department and any other peace officer . . . may, at any time, <em>upon reasonable cause to believe that a motor vehicle is unsafe or not equipped as required by law, or that its equipment is not in proper adjustment or repair, </em>require the driver of \u2019 such motor vehicle to stop and submit such vehicle to an inspection ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9h\">Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 189.730(1) (1971) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b344-11\">. We do not find it necessary to express an opinion about the validity of the selective stopping of motorists for license inspections. Selective license checks were upheld in United States v. Lepinski, 460 F.2d 234 (10th Cir. 1972); United States v. Turner, 442 F.2d 1146 (8th Cir. 1971). <em>But cf. </em>Commonwealth v. Swanger, 453 Pa. 107, 307 A.2d 875 (1973); Commonwealth v.

Dombrowski, 413 U.S. 433, 440, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973) (Relinquish J.). <em>See generally </em>Amsterdam, Perspectives on the Fourth Amendment, 58 Minn.L.

That case affirmed the power of local police, charged with a \u201ccommunity caretaking\u201d function, to search an immobilized and unoccupied automobile in police custody but stored in an open lot, where there is reason to believe it may contain a dangerous weapon \u2014 another exigent circumstance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b345-6\">.

Maroney, 399 U.S. at 50, 90 S.Ct. at 1980.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Cardwell v. Lewis, 417 U.S. 583, 592, 94 S.Ct. 2464, 2470, 41 L.Ed.2d 325 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\">. Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). The burden of proof is on the state to demonstrate voluntariness. <em>Id. </em>248-249, 93 S.Ct. 2041.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b345-15\">. The informant tipped the officer that the defendant was in possession of a weapon as well as narcotics, and indicated where on the defendant\u2019s person the officer could expect to find the weapon. The officer walked over to Hie defendant, who sat alone in a parked car, and asked him to open the car door. Instead, the defendant rolled down his window. The officer reached in and removed a weapon from the precise spot on the defendant\u2019s body that the informant had described.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b346-5\">. United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973), decided after the trial of this case, is inapposite. That case established that police have authority to conduct a search incident to any lawful full custody arrest, without regard to .the nature of the offense. In short, <em>Robinson </em>presumes the existence of probable cause for arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The Court, in <em>Robinson, </em>did not directly address the problem of pretext arrests. However, a search incident to full custody arrest is permissible only if it is (1) lawful; and (2) conducted in accordance with regular departmental procedures. 414 U.S. at 221 n. 1, 94 S.Ct. 467 (1973). Presumably, should an arrest be made solely as a pretext to conduct a search, that search would not be in accordance with regular departmental procedure. Certainly, the lower courts have firmly refused to allow evidence gathered from such searches to be used against the defendant. <em>See, e. g., </em>Hill v. United States, 135 U.S.App.D.C. 233, 418 F.2d 449 (1968); Amador-Gonzalez v. United States, 391 F.2d 308 (5th Cir. 1968); Montana v. Tomich, 332 F.2d 987 (9th Cir. 1964); Taglavore v.
