S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-704), of the regulation by the Food and Drug Administration of certain drugs which were treated as \u201cnew drugs,\u201d and for a declaratory judgment pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201) that those drugs are <em>not </em>\u201cnew drugs.\u201d Such a declaration would exempt those drugs from rigid premarketing standards regarding manufacture and purity and other safety requirements prescribed by the Food and Drug Administration for all \u201cnew drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-13\">Upon motion of the defendants the district court dismissed the action without prejudice pursuant to Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court held that the matter lay within the primary jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration and that only after plaintiffs had petitioned for and obtained a formal administrative ruling on the status of the specified drugs would judicial review be available. With respect to the prayer for a declaratory judgment the court held that \u201cit should, in the exercise of its sound discretion under the Declaratory Judgment Act, refuse to take jurisdiction\u201d and should dismiss the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-14\">Upon consideration of the briefs, appendix and oral arguments of counsel we are of the opinion that the dismissal of the action by the district court was proper for the reasons set forth in its Order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1116-16\">.
