The aircraft was owned by Livingston Copters, Inc. (Livingston) and piloted by Kelly Everett Hays, one of its employees. The plaintiffs are the sole sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>viving passenger (Wyller), the adminis-tratrix of the Hays estate, and Livingston.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant, Fairchild Hiller Corporation (Fairchild), designed and manufactured the helicopter and a \u201cfail-safe\u201d mechanism with which it was equipped.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Plaintiffs brought their actions in the Superior Court for the State of Alaska. In their complaints they charged Fair-child with negligence, strict product liability and breach of implied warranty. Their common-theory was that the fail-safe mechanism malfunctioned during normal flight and in circumstances which inevitably resulted in the crash of the aircraft. Fairchild removed the actions to the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, where they were consolidated and tried to a jury. At the conclusion of the trial, which extended over a period of some three weeks, the jury returned the verdicts for plaintiffs and against Fairchild as follows: (1) Wyller, $350,000; (2) Hays\u2019 administratrix, $250,000; and (3) Livingston, $35,000. The district court denied Fairchild\u2019s subsequent motion for judgment n. o. v. or, alternatively, a new trial, and entered judgment on the verdicts. Fairchild appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">I. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Fairchild\u2019s initial contention is that the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs was insufficient to support the verdicts. We disagree. Having studied the conflicting technical theories advanced 'by the parties and having reviewed the lengthy record of the case, we are convinced that the evidence, including the testimony of Wyller and of plaintiffs\u2019 experts, the broken fail-safe unit and the unseized transmission, the absence of severe damage to at least one of the leading edges of the main rotor blades, the burnished appearance of the shear ring, and the ultimate landing point of .the helicopter, is more than sufficient to support the jury\u2019s resolution of the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">II. <em>The \u201cExcluded\u201d Testimony of Dr. Roberts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">Fairchild next contends that the district court committed prejudicial error in refusing to allow the testimony of its metallurgical expert, Dr. Roberts, concerning his examination of the surface of a shear ring which had been made to fail experimentally several months before the trial. Again we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-15\">Plaintiffs had sought to discover, by means of an interrogatory, whether Fairchild had conducted any tests on fail-safe units similar to the one which had failed during the accident so as to ascertain whether such units could fail under flight conditions;, Fairchild had answered that interrogatory in the negative. Thus when Fairchild first offered Dr. Roberts\u2019 testimony respecting the results of tests conducted subsequent to Fairchild\u2019s negative response, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel moved that the court exclude such testimony as a sanction for Fair-child\u2019s failure to supplement its answer in accordance with Rule 26(e), F.R.Civ. P.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court did not rule immediately; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>instead it requested that Fairchild\u2019s counsel discontinue interrogation on the point until it had had an opportunity to review the matter over the weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\"> On the following Monday, the trial resumed and Fairchild made no additional attempt to introduce the challenged testimony; no ruling on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to exclude the testimony appears on the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we see no reason to disregard the general rule that, where evidence offered and objected to has been temporarily excluded, the party who sought to introduce such evidence must renew his effort in that respect at a later, appropriate stage of the trial; his failure to do so precludes him from asserting on appeal that the evidence was erroneously excluded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the actions of the district court may somehow be construed as a \u201cruling\u201d excluding the challenged evidence and further assuming that such a \u201cruling\u201d was error, Fairchild has shown no prejudice. The district court permitted Dr. Roberts to testify as to his opinions concerning the burnished appearance of the shear ring and its source; while the \u201cexcluded\u201d evidence would presumably have supported his stated opinions, we do not think it would have substantially added to their weight.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">III. <em>Wyller\u2019s Hypnosis Treatments</em></p>\n<p id=\"Apcq\">After the close of discovery and some four years after the crash, Wyller underwent several treatments involving hypnosis for the purpose of improving his limited recollection of the events surrounding the crash. Prior to Wyller\u2019s testifying at trial, Fairchild moved to limit the former\u2019s testimony to that given at his deposition, or, alternatively, that before any matter recalled after the hypnosis treatments was received in evidence, the hypnotist be required to establish the reliability of the procedure employed. The district court denied the motion, and Wyller was permitted to testify as to his recollection both prior and subsequent to the treatments. Thereafter, the hypnotist, a professional psychologist experienced in both aviation psychology and \u201chypnotic age regression\u201d technique, fully elucidated the procedures employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">We cannot accept Fairchild\u2019s argument that Wyller\u2019s testimony was rendered inherently untrustworthy by his having imdergone hypnosis. Wyller testified from his present recollection, refreshed by the treatments. His credibility and the weight to be given such testimony were for the jury to determine. Fairchild was entitled to, and did, challenge the reliability of both the remembered facts and the hypnosis procedure itself by extensive and thorough cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>examination of Wyller and the hypnotist. Under the circumstances, we perceive no abuse of discretion by the district court. <em>See </em>Harding v. State, 5 Md.App. 230, 246 A.2d 302, 311-312 (1968), cert. denied 395 U.S. 949, 89 S.Ct. 2030, 23 L.Ed.2d 468 (1969); State v. Jorgensen, 8 Or.App. 1, 492 P.2d 312, 315-316 (Or.App.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Nor will we consider Fairchild\u2019s argument that the district court erred in admitting testimony from Wyller and the hypnotist concerning the contents of tape recordings made while Wyller was in a hypnotic state. The assignment is not properly raised on appeal, for the record indicates that, in each instance where such evidence was received, Fair-child failed to object to its admission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Fairchild also contends that the district court erred in permitting the hypnotist\u2019s testimony as to the reliability of the statements made by Wyller while the latter was under hypnosis. Once again, the assignment is not properly before us due to Fairchild\u2019s failure to object at trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Fairchild also contends that the district court erred in failing to give a cautionary instruction to the jury regarding Wyller\u2019s testimony insofar as it consisted of information recalled by means of hypnosis. Fairchild had attached a proposed instruction on the subject to its pretrial memorandum, in compliance with a district court order that proposed instructions on unique issues be submitted prior to trial. However, when the parties were called upon to submit their respective sets of proposed instructions near the close of trial, Fairchild submitted no such cautionary instruction. After the court had assembled the set of proposed instructions it intended to give \u2014 a set which included no cautionary instructions on hypnosis \u2014respective counsel were given an opportunity to review the proposed set and make objections. Fairchild made no objection to, nor mention of, the court\u2019s failure to include the cautionary instruction. While we believe that such an instruction would have been appropriate under the circumstances, <em>see Harding, supra, </em>at 312, 246 A.2d 302, the assignment is barred by Rule 51, F. R.Civ.P.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Monsma v. Central Mutual Insurance Co., 392 F.2d 49, 52 (9th Cir. 1968); Bertrand v. Southern Pacific Co., 282 F.2d 569, 572 (9th Cir. 1960). We give little weight to Fair-child\u2019s assertion that it had insufficient time to review the proposed instructions prior to making objection; it never made that complaint known to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>IV. <em>The Court\u2019s Refusal to Admit Evidence of the Loan Receipt Agreement between Wyller and Livingston</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In August, 1970, Wyller and Livingston entered into an agreement whereby Wyller released Livingston from any claims he might have against it arising from the crash and Livingston \u201cloaned\u201d Wyller almost $75,000 for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in Wyller\u2019s anticipated action against Fairchild. The \u201cloan\u201d was to be repaid, with six per cent interest, only to the extent that Wyller recovered from Fairchild, and it was agreed that Wyller would not settle his claim against Fairchild without Livingston\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The instant agreement bears a marked similarity to the \u201cloan receipt\u201d device by which indemnity and liability insurers sometimes settle losses by advancing to the insured the amount of his loss in the form of a loan, repayable only in the event and to the extent that the insured obtains a recovery for the loss from a third party. Such agreements insulate the insurer from the necessity of seeking to recoup its loss in its own name and from the judicially recognized prejudice of juries against insurance companies; they also enable injured plaintiffs to avoid the acceptance of unjust settlements out of necessity. See <em>generally </em>Annotation, Insurance: Validity and Effect of Loan Receipt or Agreement between Insured and Insurer for a Loan Repayable to the Extent of Insured\u2019s Recovery from Another, 13 A.L.R.3d 42 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Fairchild argues that the district court should have permitted it to cross-examine both Wyller and Livingston\u2019s president concerning the terms of the agreement in order to impeach the testimony of each by showing bias. We are not persuaded. The district court was within its discretion in concluding under the circumstances that the policy of encouraging extrajudicial settlements and the recognized danger of misleading the jury inherent in the admission of such evidence, <em>see </em>Luth v. Rogers &amp; Bab-ler Construction Co., 507 P.2d 761, 768 (Alas.1973), outweighs its probative value as impeachment. <em>Cf. </em>Hutchings v. State, 518 P.2d 767, 770 n. 8 (Alas. 1974). Both Wyller and Livingston, as parties plaintiff, had an obvious financial interest in the imposition of liability on defendant Fairchild; evidence that Livingston may have had a partial interest in Wyller\u2019s recovery is of little probative value where its financial interest in the specific outcome desired by both was already apparent to the jury. <em>Cf. </em>Breitkreutz v. Baker, 514 P.2d 17, 28-29, 29 n. 30 (Alas.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">V. <em>Red Party in Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">Fairchild asserted in the trial court and argues in its briefs on appeal that the funds which Livingston \u201cloaned\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to Wyller were actually provided by Livingston's insurer. The insurer, however, was neither a signatory to, nor mentioned in, the agreement, and there was no assignment of Wyller\u2019s cause of action to either Livingston or the insurer. Prior to trial, Fairchild moved to add the insurer as an additional party plaintiff or, in the alternative, for permission to amend the pleading to indicate that Wyller and Livingston were suing for the use and benefit of Livingston\u2019s insurer; it argued that the agreement did not evidence a true loan, but rather a payment which subrogated Livingston\u2019s insurer to the position of Wyller, thus making the insurer a real party in interest under F.R.Civ.P. 17(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The district court, relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Waterway Terminals Co. v. P. S. Lord Mechanical Contractors, 242 Or. 1, 406 P.2d 556 (1965), ruled that the agreement evidenced a true loan and denied the motion to add the insurer as a party plaintiff.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It also denied the motion to amend the pleadings, ruling that the sole purpose in Fairchild\u2019s seeking such amendment was to prejudice the minds of the jurors with knowledge that plaintiffs were insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">We express no opinion on the propriety of the district court\u2019s reasons for denial of the motions, for our review of the record reveals that there is insufficient evidence of the insurance company\u2019s involvement in the \u201cloan\u201d transaction to warrant a finding that it is a real party in interest under any theory. The agreement itself merely indicates a transaction between Wyller and Livingston, and Fairchild\u2019s affidavit in support of the motion merely indicates that the \u201cloan\u201d funds did not come from Livingston; the actual source of the funds is not disclosed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Absent some substantial showing that this particular insurer was in fact involved in the transaction, the district court would have exceeded its discretion in requiring the insurer\u2019s joinder as a real party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Fairchild\u2019s remaining contentions have no merit and are not of sufficient substance to warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"APP\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\">.

Fairchild\u2019s counsel has supplemented the record on appeal in an effort to sustain his stated belief that a ruling granting the motion to exclude was made in chambers outside the presence of a court reporter. The supplementary materials, however, are vague and conflicting, and they are simply insufficient to xiphoid the, conclusion that such a ruling was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b573-10\">. <em>tiee, e. g., </em>Bridgeport Type Engineering Co. v.

However, in view of Fair-child's extensive cross-examination challenging the hypnotist\u2019s opinion and basis thereof and the fact that Wyller\u2019s relevant testimony of the events surrounding the crash was entirely from his present recollection, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s failure to exclude the testimony was an error affecting the substantial rights of the parties, F.R.
