(Kemin) had been adopted in good faith and without prior knowledge of FCA\u2019s \u201cPESTLUR\u201d and had acquired superior common law trademark rights in ten other states prior to the registration of \u201cPEST-LUR\u201d; (4) the Lanham Act controlled in the remaining 38 states;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (5) the marks \u201cPESTLUR\u201d and \u201cLURE\u201d were so confusingly similar as to cause a likelihood of confusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the District Court enjoined Kemin \u201cfrom competing with plaintiff, Flavor Corporation of America under its \u2018LUR\u2019 [sic] trade marks in the states of Georgia and Florida.\u201d Further injunctive relief was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Kemin sought, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ. P. 59, to have the order amended to permit Kemin to continue advertising in national publications. The District Court denied the motion stating its belief that such an amendment would \u201cseverely dilute the original judgment.\u201d Kemin raised this issue on its cross-appeal but never sought anything less than an unlimited right to advertise products using the \u201cLURE\u201d mark in national publications, whether or not such publications reached the states of Georgia and Florida. We affirmed the District Court. Flavor Corp. of America v. Kem-in Industries, Inc., 493 F.2d 275 (8th Cir. 1974). In dealing with the issue of national advertising, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">The trial court properly considered the advertising factor and its conclusion that <em>\u2018Pestlur\u2019 </em>had not acquired a secondary meaning in the 38 states controlled by the Lanham Act is not clearly erroneous. Kemin, on the other hand, must accommodate its own advertising program to the District Court\u2019s injunction, in order to avoid further infringement in Florida and Georgia. Modern marketing techniques permit such accommodation in most instances; in others Kemin must suffer the burden resulting from its infringement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">493 F.2d at 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">\n<em>The Present Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">Subsequent to the original appeal, Kemin sought leave in the District Court to use its mark in connection with national advertising with a notation that <em>\u201cThese flavors available only under the trademark \u2018TREET\u2019 in Georgia and Florida.\u201d </em>The District Court refused this request, but entered an order granting Kemin permission to advertise its products in national publications, providing the marks were accompanied by an asterisk and a notation in equal type size that <em>\u201cThis product is not available in Georgia and Florida.\u201d </em>It is from this order that FCA now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">FCA contends that the effect of the District Court\u2019s order is either (1) to modify without the consent of this court an injunction in effect sealed by our affirmance or (2) to render an advisory opinion, contrary to law. We reject these contentions and affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">The original order of the District Court enjoined Kemin only from \u201ccompeting\u201d with FCA under its \u201cLURE\u201d marks in the ' states of Georgia and Florida. Kemin was therefore free to advertise in all of the remaining 48 states, at least until FCA\u2019s marks acquired a secondary meaning in one of the 38 states governed by the Lanham Act. The injunction posed a very practical problem for Kemin in planning its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>national advertising program. On the one hand, it had been denied permission to have national advertising excluded from the injunction against \u201ccompeting.\u201d On the other hand, the injunction did not expressly preclude advertising which carried a satisfactory disclaimer as to the two states covered by the injunction. Kemin therefore sought and obtained from the District Court a clarification of its ruling, rather than risking a contempt citation should its own interpretation prove to be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">We cannot agree that anything in our opinion precluded the relief sought and obtained in the District Court. We held that Kemin must accommodate its advertising program to the injunction and that \u201c[mjodern marketing techniques permit such accommodation in most instances. . . . \u201d Thus, while we upheld the trial court\u2019s refusal to exclude all national advertising from its injunction, we said nothing to preclude the District Court from considering the intended scope of its own injunction. Reliance upon Rhodes v. Houston, 258 F.Supp. 546 (D.Neb.1966), aff\u2019d, 418 F.2d 1309 (8th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1049, 90 S.Ct. 1382, 25 L.Ed.2d 662 (1970), is therefore misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\"> It is. well established that injunctions do not give rise to vested rights; they enforce only rights existing under current law and conditions. United States v. Swift &amp; Co., 286 U.S. 106, 52 S.Ct. 460, 76 L.Ed. 999 (1932). While a decree may not normally be changed in the interests of the defendants if the purposes of the litigation as incorporated in the decree have not been fully achieved, unforeseen hardships to the defendants may be considered, especially where there are (1) changes in operative facts, (2) changes in the relevant decisional law, and (3) changes in any applicable statutory law. <em>See </em>11 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2961, at 604-05 (1973); Developments in the Law \u2014 Injunctions, 78 Harv.L.Rev. 994,1080-86 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">We do not think, however, that the action of the District Court was a modification of the decree, as that term is traditionally understood. More accurately, it was a clarification of the intended reach of a briefly worded decree enjoining Kemin \u201cfrom competing with plaintiff, Flavor Corporation of America under its \u2018LUR\u2019 [sic] trade marks in the states of Georgia and Florida.\u201d While the District Court, in its separate order declined to exclude all national advertising from the reach of its injunction, it neither was asked to, nor did it, deal with the type of controlled use of national advertising submitted to it following our affirmance. It is common knowledge that advertisements in national publications are not readily susceptible of modifications to permit variations in format in the respective states. If the original injunction were read as prohibiting the use of all advertising in national publications which might find their way into the states of Georgia and Florida, it would cast an obvious hardship upon Kemin since such an order would, as a practical matter, preclude Kemin from advertising in national publications intended to reach the remaining 48 states in which it has a clear right to advertise. The trial judge, upon motion of Kemin, set out to refine his original decree to make clear a proper balancing of competing interests in fashioning an appropriate remedy. By his order, he demonstrated that he intended to foreclose Kemin from selling or advertising for sale in Georgia and Florida any of its products sold elsewhere under the \u201cLURE\u201d mark. He required the advertising to make that nonavailability in Georgia and Florida plainly evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">FCA argues that it is not enough that such advertising discloses the nonavailability of Kemin\u2019s products in Georgia and Florida; it contends that any advertising which contains the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>fusingly similar \u201cLURE\u201d mark under such circumstances will lead potential customers to believe that \u201cPESTLUR\u201d is not available in Georgia or Florida. While this argument is not without merit, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in balancing the competing interests of the parties in the manner which it selected. The bare possibility that a potential customer of \u201cPESTLUR\u201d might be misled by Kem-in\u2019s advertisement into thinking he could not obtain \u201cPESTLUR\u201d in Georgia and Florida is insufficient to justify the punitive effect of an injunction construed to prohibit <em>all </em>national advertising. The District Court did not so intend its decree and made this clear in its subsequent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">We do not intend to hold that clarification orders are appropriate in every circumstance. Clarification is largely discretionary with the trial court. <em>See </em>Regal Knit Wear Co. v. NLRB, 324. U.S. 9, 15, 65 S.Ct. 478, 481, 89 L.Ed. 661 (1945). The original injunction was terse in form. It did not attempt to come to grips with problems of competition which were apt to flow from the complex findings of the court, which gave priority to FCA in two states, priority to Kemin in ten states and made competition between the parties in the remaining 38 states subject to the Lanham Act. Just \u201cas events may shape the need\u201d for modification,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we hold that the District Court which issues an injunction has the same \u201cwide discretion\u201d to clarify or define the original injunction as it has on consideration of a motion to vacate or modify. System Federation No. 91, Railway Employes\u2019 Department, AFL-CIO v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 648, 81 S.Ct. 368, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961). There has been no showing in this case that such discretion was abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-25\">. Flavor Corp. of America v.
