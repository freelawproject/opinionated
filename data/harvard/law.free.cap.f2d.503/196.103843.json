This case is before the court on appeal from an order of the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) denying review of a decision of the Commission\u2019s Review Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) which denied the application of Lebanon Valley Radio, Inc. (\u201cLebanon Valley\u201d) for a construction permit for a new broadcast station. Finding the Commission\u2019s action erroneous, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b261-19\">The protracted administrative history of this case began in March, 1965 when hearings were commenced on Lebanon Valley\u2019s application. The hearings were conducted on various dates until February, 1968 when the record was closed. Thereafter, on February 26, 1969, Hearing Examiner Irion released his Initial Decision, in which he concluded that Lebanon Valley was financially and technically qualified, and accordingly, recommended a grant of Lebanon Valley\u2019s application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, shortly after that decision, the Board granted a petition, filed January 17, 1969 by Radio Cantonsville, Inc., a competitor of Leba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>non Valley, to enlarge the issues in the Lebanon Valley proceeding. Lebanon Valley Radio, Inc., 16 FCC2d 937 (1969). Radio Cantonsville had alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Lebanon Valley no longer intended to construct its proposed station on its initially specified site, and in fact, had purchased a different site while allowing its option on the initial site to expire. Lebanon Valley maintained, to the contrary, that it fully intended to utilize the initially specified site for its transmitter and, while its original option on that site may have expired on January 11, 1969, it had, in any event, obtained a valid one-year extension of that option on January 22, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Although the assertions of both parties were conflicting, the Board noted that: \u201cIf, as [Radio Cantonsville] contends, the land purchased by [Lebanon] Valley\u2019s principals is to be utilized as a site for its proposed station, and its presently specified site is to be abandoned, [Lebanon] Valley\u2019s failure to inform the Commission of these developments could reflect adversely on its qualifications to be a Commission licensee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938. The Board found that Radio Cantonsville\u2019s allegations also raised the following additional issues which warranted further inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">First, there is now considerable doubt as to whether [Lebanon] Valley actually proposes to construct its transmitter at the site specified in its application. Second, the allegations of the owner of the site that he was badgered and harassed into extending [Lebanon] Valley\u2019s option and that he was assured that a radio tower would not be placed on his land during the 1-year period of the extension raise a question of whether the proposed transmitter site is still available. Finally, the affidavits relied on by petitioner in its reply conflict, in all material respects, with assertions in [Lebanon] Valley\u2019s opposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 939 (footnote omitted). For the above reasons, the Board found that \u201ca substantial question is presented concerning [Lebanon Valley\u2019s] conduct and whether it has engaged in misrepresentation or conduct lacking in candor in its dealings with the Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the proceeding was remanded to the hearing examiner for resolution of the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">(1) To determine whether the transmitter site proposed by Lebanon Valley Radio, Inc., is still available for the effectuation of its proposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">(2) To determine whether Lebanon Valley Radio, Inc., proposes to construct a broadcast transmitter on the site proposed in its application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">(3) To determine whether Lebanon Valley Radio, Inc., failed to amend or attempt to amend its application within 30 days after substantial changes were made, as required by section 1.65 of the Commission\u2019s rules, and, if so, the effect on its qualifications to be a Commission licensee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">(4) To determine, in light of the evidence adduced under issues (1), (2), and (3) above, whether Lebanon Valley Radio, Inc., has engaged in misrepresentation or conduct lacking in candor in its dealings with the Commission and, if so, the effect on its qualifications to be a Commission licensee ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 939-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">On remand, Hearing Examiner French ordered that Lebanon Valley\u2019s application be denied on the grounds that: \u201c(1) Lebanon Valley has not established that its transmitter site is still available, and (2) in its dealings with the Commission Lebanon Valley has engaged in misrepresentations and conduct lacking in candor.\u201d Lebanon Valley Radio, Inc., FCC Docket No. 15835 at 19 (issued April 30, 1970), J.A. at 61. These ultimate conclusions were premised upon Examiner French\u2019s disposition of the remand issues. Issue one, site availability, was resolved against Lebanon Valley on a finding that the one-year option extension was acquired by misrepresentation and thus, Lebanon Valley would probably not prevail if it attempted to exercise the option. Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>quently, Examiner French concluded that Lebanon Valley failed to establish that the site was still available. Whether Lebanon Valley still proposed to construct its transmitter on the site, issue two, was deemed moot in light of the disposition of issue one. As to issue three, whether Lebanon Valley failed to comply with certain Commission rules, Examiner French found in favor of Lebanon Valley because there was no record evidence that Lebanon Valley intended to change its site and thus, no necessity for Lebanon Valley to amend its application. Issue four, whether Lebanon Valley made misrepresentations or engaged in conduct lacking in candor in its dealings with the Commission, was resolved against Lebanon Valley. The examiner concluded that Lebanon Valley had misrepresented to the Commission that it had obtained a valid one-year extension of its option, that much of the testimony of Lebanon Valley\u2019s principals was evasive and lacked candor and, that the one-year extension was obtained by misrepresentation and deceit, which the Commission could not condone.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Lebanon Valley filed exceptions to Examiner French\u2019s decision and also petitioned the Board to reopen the record to reflect a June 22, 1970 decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, which decreed specific performance on Lebanon Valley\u2019s one-year option agreement. After that decision was affirmed on October 15, 1970 by the Pennsylvania court, <em>en banc,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Lebanon Valley again petitioned the Board to reopen the record to reflect that action. The Pennsylvania court\u2019s decisions and their relevance to the case <em>sub judice </em>will be more fully discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">On June 7, 1972, the Board, with one member vehemently dissenting, denied Lebanon Valley\u2019s application on the sole ground that Lebanon Valley had misrepresented and engaged in conduct lacking in candor in its dealings with the Commission. Lebanon Valley Radio, Inc., 35 FCC2d 243 (1972), J.A. at 2. Although the Board did grant Lebanon Valley\u2019s petitions to reopen the record to reflect the Pennsylvania court\u2019s decisions, which in the Board\u2019s own words \u201cconclusively resolved the question of the legal validity of the option extension . . ,\u201d,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and necessitated that issue one be resolved in favor of Lebanon Valley, it nevertheless held that issue four must be resolved against Lebanon Valley and accordingly, affirmed Examiner French\u2019s denial of Lebanon Valley\u2019s application. <em>Id. </em>The Board specifically cited a few instances of allegedly inconsistent testimony by Lebanon Valley\u2019s principals in support of Examiner French\u2019s credibility findings. These instances, the Board asserted, fell \u201cfar short of the standard of integrity and truthfulness expected by the Commission from prospective licensees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260, J.A. at 25. Moreover, the Board held that its conclusion that testimony of Lebanon Valley\u2019s principals \u201cwas unworthy of belief and manifestly designed to mislead the Commission is fully sustained by the record in this proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Board concluded that the Pennsylvania court decisions, while dispositive of issue one, were irrelevant to issue four because they were merely rulings as a matter of law made without credibility findings and concerned issues and testimony not before the Commission. On March 6, 1973, the Commission ordered that Lebanon Valley\u2019s application for review of the Board\u2019s order be denied. Lebanon Valley Radio, Inc., FCC Docket No. 15835 (adopted March 2, 1973), J.A. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">We think the absence of substantial supportive record evidence compounded by an unreasonably myopic analysis of the Pennsylvania court\u2019s opinions, is fatal to the Board\u2019s decision. Consequently, the Commission\u2019s denial of Lebanon Valley\u2019s petition for review of that decision must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, not only allows, but unequivocally requires the Commission to consider an applicant\u2019s character. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 308(b) (1970). Furthermore, it is axiomatic that an applicant\u2019s misrepresentations to the Commission, indubitably a reflection on one\u2019s character, can result in the applicant\u2019s disqualification, which, <em>if reasonable, </em>will not be disturbed by the courts. FCC v. WOKO, Inc., 329 U.S. 223, 67 S.Ct. 213, 91 L.Ed. 204 (1946); WEBR, Inc. v. FCC, 136 U.S.App.D.C. 316, 420 F.2d 158 (1969); Crowder v. FCC, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 198, 399 F.2d 569, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 962, 89 S.Ct. 400, 21 L.Ed.2d 375 (1968); Lorain Journal Co. v. FCC, 122 U.S. App.D.C. 127, 351 F.2d 824 (1965), cert. denied sub nom., WWIZ, Inc. v. FCC, 383 U.S. 967, 86 S.Ct. 1272, 16 L.Ed.2d 308 (1966); Charles P. B. Pinson, Inc. v. FCC, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 106, 321 F.2d 372 (1963). Thus, the Commission contends that the Board\u2019s decision \u201cagainst Lebanon Valley is not arbitrary or capricious, that it is supported by substantial evidence and should therefore be affirmed.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br.. at 18. Ostensibly, the Commission\u2019s argument is premised upon the significant deference due Examiner French\u2019s credibility determinations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While we agree that an examiner\u2019s credibility determinations are entitled to significant weight, we do not find them controlling in this ease; nor do we find other substantial evidence warranting affirmance of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The Board found that \u201cthe conduct of Lebanon Valley\u2019s principals at the hearing [failed] to meet the standard of integrity and truthfulness expected by the Commission from its licencees and [potential] licencees.\u201d Lebanon Valley Radio, Inc., <em>supra, </em>35 FCC2d at 258-59, J.A. at 23. In support of this conclusion, the Board cited Lebanon Valley\u2019s principals\u2019 allegedly untruthful account of a meeting between them and the then owners of the site in question, a meeting which resulted in the one-year option extension. The \u201cuntruthfulness\u201d of Lebanon Valley\u2019s principals was substantiated with reference to their allegedly inconsistent statements and Examiner French\u2019s credibility findings, which, based on conduct, demeanor and manner of testifying, ultimately held the owners of the site to be more believable than Lebanon Valley\u2019s principals. As previously mentioned, the Pennsylvania court\u2019s decisions were simply disregarded as irrelevant to issue four.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">We, however, think the Pennsylvania court\u2019s decisions are relevant. The decisions resolved an action for specific performance on the option agreement brought by Lebanon Valley against the then owners of the site in question, the Martins. The Martins asserted that the option could not be enforced because they were harrassed and pressured into signing it and false representations were made to them as to what would be erected on the land. <em>Id. </em>at 265, J.A. at 33 (Board Member Nelson, dissenting).Notably, the Martins\u2019 defense was also the substance of their testimony before the Commission, testimony that Examiner French found more believable than Lebanon Valley\u2019s principals\u2019 testimony. Finding that \u201c\u2018[t]here was no harrassment on the part of plaintiff\u2019s [Lebanon Valley\u2019s] officers . . . [and] no fraud or mistake in procurement of the extension of the option,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 265-66, J.A. at 34, the court granted the requested specific performance. Subsequently, the court, <em>en banc, </em>affirmed this decision, stating, <em>inter alia: </em>The evidence leads us to the conclusion that lurking in the shadows is the established radio station which wants to prevent more competition . . . . \u201d Lebanon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Valley Radio, Inc. v. Martin, Equity No. 14 at 5 (October 15, 1970) <em>(en banc), </em>J. A. at 78. We think the Board\u2019s failure to take proper notice of the relevance of these decisions was erroneous and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The Board stated that the court did not make \u201ccredibility findings.\u201d Granted that the court did not make \u201ccredibility findings,\u201d per se, nevertheless, it did specifically address the harrassment and misrepresentation issues and concluded, based upon sworn testimony, contrary to Examiner French\u2019s \u201ccredibility findings.\u201d For the board to dismiss such findings merely because they are not la-belled as \u201ccredibility findings\u201d is to exalt form over substance. This we cannot condone.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The Board also supported its decision with reference to various allegedly inconsistent statements of Lebanon Valley\u2019s principals. Having dutifully examined those statements, we find the Board\u2019s characterization of most of them highly questionable, and the remainder of minor significance overall. Perhaps the few remaining inconsistencies were best explained by the Board\u2019s dissenting member when he stated: \u201c \u2018confusion as to details ... is not uncommon in the stories of entirely honest witnesses.\u2019 \u201d Lebanon Valley Radio, Inc., <em>supra, </em>35 FCC2d at 270, <em>quoting </em>NLRB v. Regal Knitwear Co., 140 F.2d 746 (2d Cir. 1944), aff\u2019d, 324 U.S. 9, 65 S.Ct. 478, 89 L.Ed. 661 (1945), J.A. at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">In sum, although cognizant of the deference due a hearing examiner\u2019s credibility findings,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we think the instant case presents an extraordinary situation in which substantial questions are raised concerning the validity of the examiner\u2019s credibility findings. The Board\u2019s resolution of the questions raised is not supported by substantial record evidence, and thus, the Commission\u2019s denial of Lebanon Valley\u2019s application for review is error. We reverse and remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We presume the Commission will proceed expeditiously so that this proceeding may reach a final conclusion before it enters its second decade.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-20\">.
