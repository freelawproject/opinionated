The provision is generally known as the self-help repossession provision. This case presents the issue as to whether peaceful repossession under the Tennessee statute is action under the color of state law within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and state action within the meaning of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon motion of the defendant-appellee, the District Court dismissed the suit for failure to state a cause of action and this appeal followed. District Judge Garrity has characterized this issue as \u201cone of the liveliest on the current judicial scene.\u201d Boland v. Essex County Bank, 361 F.Supp. 917 (D.Mass. 1973).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">In terms of private repossession, the facts before us offer a classic example. Plaintiff-appellant Turner purchased a 1965 Buick LaSabre in June of 1972 from the defendant-appellee Impala on a conditional sales contract. Turner executed a promissory note specifying a payment schedule of twenty-five dollars per week for twelve weeks, with the remaining balance to be paid at the rate of twenty dollars per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">The record does not indicate the circumstances of the default but the actual payments were erratic from the beginning. The contract included a provision that \u201cin default of payment of this note, or any part of it, said payee [Impala] may take possession of said property in any manner they [sic] may elect, and dispose of same without recourse to law <em>yy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-16\">Almost seven months after the purchase, Turner apparently defaulted on his note and without notice the auto was repossessed from a curbside on a public street. The incident occurred in the early afternoon of a weekday after Turner parked his auto in front of his mother\u2019s house. Turner had left his five-year-old son in the auto and the keys to the auto in his pocket, but the agent of Impala was not deterred. The young child was removed therefrom and the auto sped away. The record indicates that there was no hearing to determine either contractual obligations or the rights to possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Turner contends that the Tennessee statute is unconstitutional and that it authorizes a deprivation of property without due process. He principally relies on Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972), which held that notice and a hearing are required before the execution of a prejudgment writ of replevin. According to the appellant, the Tennessee statute allows a creditor to circumvent the requirements of notice and hearing and yet replevy his property. He contends that although the case ostensibly involves private conduct, the presence of state action is indicated by the fact that the state has intervened, authorized and encouraged repossession by secured creditors by conferring upon them special powers and exemptions from legal requirements placed on all others. Appellant also argues that the Tennessee statute, similar to the replevin statutes in <em>Fuentes, </em>deprives the debtor of his rights to notice and an opportunity to be heard. The waiver provision contained in the contract does not, appellant contends, necessarily exclude the requirements of notice and a judicial hearing on the issue of the waiver prior to the repossession. The waiver provision allows the creditor to take possession upon default.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Before we consider the constitutional dimensions of the matter before us, we must first examine the key question of jurisdictional requisites. The concept of state action as required by the Fourteenth Amendment has been found to be virtually synonymous with the \u201cunder color of state law\u201d requirement of \u00a7 1983. United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 794-795 n. 7, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 16 L.Ed.2d 267 (1966); Palmer v. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc., 479 F.2d 153, 161 (6th Cir. 1973). <em>But cf., </em>Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144, 211, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring and dissenting). Appellant would have us hold that the self-help repossession which took place upon the default on a private contract providing for such repossession is an act under color of state law and thus constitutes state action within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment. If the repossession did not constitute state action but rather only an individual invasion of individual rights, the alleged wrong cannot be remedied under the auspices of the Fourteenth Amendment. Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 11, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The presence of state action allows the invocation of the basic procedural safeguards announced in Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., <em>infra, </em>and Fuentes v. Shevin, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Instances of private conduct have been found to involve sufficient .state action<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but each such conclusion should be the product of \u201csifting facts and weighing circumstances . \u201d Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 722, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961). However, a mere finding that state action is present is insufficient. The state action must rise to the level of significant involvement. Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 173, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-17\">The constitutional attacks on creditors\u2019 tactics such as peaceful repossession or formal legal processes gained support with Mr. Justice Douglas\u2019 majority opinion in Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., 395 U.S. 337, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969). In that case a garnishment action had been instituted in a state court whose rules allowed the service of summons and complaint upon the alleged debtor\u2019s employer. The effect was to freeze the alleged debtor\u2019s wages until the merits of the case had been decided. The debtor was not required to be notified at the time of service upon the employer and there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>opportunity for the debtor to obtain a hearing or judicial scrutiny of the creditors\u2019 claims. The debtor was restricted to either showing that the suit was brought in bad faith or posting a bond in the amount of the garnishment. With Mr. Justice Black dissenting, the Supreme Court held that the Court Clerk\u2019s ex parte issuance of a summons pursuant to the state statute constituted state action and that the prejudgment wage garnishment without prior notice and opportunity for a hearing deprived the debtor of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Subsequently, the Supreme Court in Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972), speaking through Mr. Justice Stewart, held that certain state statutes providing for the summary seizure of personal property by means of a prejudgment replevin procedure involving the sheriff\u2019s execution of a writ issued by a court clerk violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment insofar as it denied a debt- or the right to notice and the opportunity for a hearing prior to the loss of any possessory interest in that personal property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">However, in the recent case of Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600, 94 S.Ct. 1895, 40 L.Ed.2d 406 (1974), it would appear that <em>Fuentes </em>has been effectively overruled. <em>See </em>concurring opinion of Powell, J., <em>id. </em>at 623, 94 S.Ct. 1895, and the dissenting opinion of Stewart, J., <em>id. </em>at 629, 94 S.Ct. 1895. In <em>Mitchell, </em>judicial sequestration procedures in Louisiana, similar to the replev-in statutes struck down in <em>Fuentes, </em>allowed a creditor to obtain, on an ex parte basis from a judicial authority, a writ of sequestration upon submission of an affidavit and posting of a security bond. Thereupon a public official, without providing notice and a hearing to the debtor, seized the property. Distinguishing judicial control over the process from the court clerk\u2019s control in <em>Fuentes, </em>the Supreme Court found the procedure was not invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Prior to <em>Mitchell, </em>the challenge to the Commercial Code\u2019s self-help repossession provisions generated considerable litigation. However, the only federal appellate courts to have met the issue to date have failed to find significant state action present. Gibbs v. Titelman, 502 F.2d 1107 (3rd Cir., filed August 1, 1974); James v. Pinnix, 495 F.2d 206 (5th Cir., 1974); Nowlin v. Professional Auto Sales, Inc., 496 F.2d 16 (8th Cir. 1974), citing Bichel Optical Laboratories, Inc. v. Marquette National Bank, 487 F.2d 906 (8th Cir. 1973); Shirley v. State National Bank of Connecticut, 493 F.2d 739 (2d Cir., 1974); Adams v. Southern California First National Bank, 492 F.2d 324 (9th Cir. 1973), rev\u2019g sub nom. Adams v. Egley, 338 F.Supp. 614 (S.D. Cal.1972), petition for cert. filed, 42 U.S.L.W. 3707 (U.S. June 25, 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">It is the district court\u2019s opinion in <em>Adams </em>that remains the most frequently cited case finding the requisite state action. In that case, the court relied upon Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U.S. 369, 87 S.Ct. 1627, 18 L.Ed.2d 830 (1967), wherein the Supreme Court found that state action existed when private housing discrimination was authorized by a provision of the California constitution. Even though the California constitution did not require discrimination in the sale and rental of housing, the Court stated that the provision in question would \u201csignificantly encourage and involve the State in private discriminations\u201d contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 381, 87 S.Ct. 1627. Similarly, the District Court in <em>Adams </em>held that the California enactments of the U.C.C. encouraged and involved the state in private repossession and sale, as demonstrated by their incorporation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>the security agreement. Appellants here have mounted that same challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">On appeal, the Ninth Circuit held that there was not sufficient involvement by the State of California to constitute state action. <em>Adams, supra, </em>492 F.2d at 329. The Court distinguished <em>Reit-man </em>as being a racial discrimination case having limited application to the self-help repossession cases and relied on the finding that the California statute merely codified the existing common law. The court also rejected the contention that the repossession was effectively a public function.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We are likewise persuaded that <em>Reitman </em>cannot be relied upon to justify a finding of state action here. Our opinion in <em>Palmer </em>notwithstanding, 479 F.2d 153 (6th Cir. 1973), we view <em>Reitman </em>as dealing with a state attempt to accomplish indirectly what it was prohibited from doing directly. We cannot ignore the fact that the context of onerous racial discrimination in which the case was set demanded special scrutiny. The injustices of racial discrimination cast a different shadow than that of the case now before us.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See Oller v. Bank of America, 342 F.Supp. 21, 23 (N.D.Cal.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Our opinion in <em>Palmer </em>likewise responded to a different circumstance. There we considered the policies of a company with monopolistic character whose business was to provide a necessity of life and whose activities and operations were pervasively and significantly regulated by governmental and quasi-go vernmental regulations and statutes. We therefore concluded that the state thereby achieved a position of joint participation with the company. <em>Id., </em>479 F.2d at 165. <em>See also </em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, <em>supra, </em>365 U.S. at 726, 81 S.Ct. 856.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">Appellant makes the principal point that the private activity before us should be viewed as encouraged by the statute and therefore a finding of state action is justified. While acknowledging that the point has a measure of merit, we do not find it persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\"> It is clear that in this case the state did not exert any control or compulsion over the creditor\u2019s decision to repossess. The private activity was not commanded by the simply permissive statute. While mere existence of the statute might seem to suggest encouragement, we conclude that the effect of the statute is only to reduce a creditor\u2019s risk in making repossessions. As a practical matter, a creditor\u2019s decision is more likely to be principally influenced by the economics of the situation than by the presence of a permissive statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">We fail to see where the creditor has sought to invoke any state machinery to its aid.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather, the creditor has simply relied upon the terms of its security agreement pursuant to the private right of contract. Compare Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948). Assuming that the statute was non-existent, the remedy of self-help repossession could still be utilized based on its common law heritage<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the private right to contract. We fail to see how the creditor is attempting to en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>force any right in reliance upon a constitutional <em>or </em>statutory provision as in <em>Reitman </em>or is even asserting any state-created right. Rather, we see a creditor privately effectuating a right which was created in advance by contract between the parties. At best, the right is one that is merely codified, but not created, in the statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Appellant also argues that the statute authorizes an individual to perform the governmental function of seizing private property. As stated previously, the statute merely codified and did not create any right or state power. Were we to rely upon the mere fact of codification, we would in part be making available to a complex matrix of human behavior, as regulated by statutes, the scope of federal remedies. We decline to establish that precedent, particularly under the circumstance of a statute that is permissive in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-9\">. 47-9-503.

In taking possession a secured party may proceed without judicial process if this can be done without breach of the peace or may proceed by action. If the security agreement so provides the secured party may require the debtor to assemble the collateral and make it available to the secured party at a place to be designated by the secured party which is reasonably convenient to both parties.
