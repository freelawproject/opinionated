Contending her discharge was for patronage purposes and thereby violated her First Amendment rights, and was without due process, she sued the West Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control Commissioner both individually and officially for affirmative injunctive relief restoring her to her former position and for actual and punitive damages. She based federal jurisdiction on \u00a7 1983, 42 U.S.C., and \u00a7 1343, 28 U.S.C. The Commissioner moved to dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment and for failure to state claim upon which relief could be granted. The District Court granted the motion on the second ground without considering the application of the Eleventh Amendment. Nunnery v. Barber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>(D.C.W.Va.1973), 365 F.Supp. The plaintiff has appealed. We affirm. 691.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aja-dedup-0\">The plaintiff\u2019s action represents a challenge to the \u201cpatronage\u201d or \u201cspoils\u201d system of public employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such an attack is not novel. For more than a century, the system has been . under attack.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Generally the attack has been directed toward legislative action as the proper source of relief. And both federal and state governments have responded with civil service laws providing a merit system for public employment and giving public employees in certain classifications protection against discharge for patronage reasons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> West Virginia has enacted such a law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When, however, resort has been had by public employees to the courts for relief independently of the legislated civil service laws or regulations, <em>(i. e., </em>by employees not within \u201cthe classified service\u201d) the claim has received scant consideration ; and this has been true whether the claim was premised on the constitutional right of free speech, equal protection or due process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As the District Court in its opinion observed, the reason generally assigned for this denial of judicial relief is that the proper forum for relief is considered to be the legislature and not the courts. A recent case, expressive of this viewpoint and representing what until that time had been the uniform answer to this claim, is Alomar v. Dwyer, <em>supra. </em>In dismissing a claim of invalidity of a discharge of a non-policy-making public employee<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for patronage reasons on constitutional grounds, the Court said (pp. 483-484 of 447 F.2d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aprp\">\u201cThe spoils system has been entrenched in American history for almost two hundred years. The devastating effect that such a system can wreak upon the orderly administration of government has been ameliorated to a large extent by the introduction of the various Civil Service laws. However, it is well understood that the victors will reap the harvest of those public positions still exempt from such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>laws. Indeed many such positions are exempt because a new administration taking office can only carry out its policies by replacing certain officeholders. If and when additional exempt positions are to be subject to civil service protection is a matter for action by the appropriate municipal and state authorities and not by a federal court.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\"> A little over a year after the decision in <em>Alomar, </em>the Seventh Circuit, in a decision \u201cwithout direct precedent\u201d, as several commentators have remarked,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> departed from the accepted rule as stated in that case and for the first time granted constitutional protection of po-</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-9\">litical association to patronage employees. Illinois State Employees Union, Council 34, etc. v. Lewis (7th Cir. 1972), 473 F.2d 561, cert. denied, 410 U.S. 928 and 943, 93 S.Ct. 1364, 1370, 35 L.Ed.2d 590, 609.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While the Court in this case accepted the premise that only the legislature may impose on the state a civil service system assuring impartiality in either the employment or retention of public employees, it held that such principle did not inhibit a court from prohibiting on constitutional grounds the dismissal of a patronage employee having no civil service status for patronage reasons.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Taking a realistic, rather than an abstract, view of the matter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>however, the Court made it clear that this was not an absolute rule applicable in all cases; it was a rule which the Court expressly held did not extend protection to all public employees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On the contrary, the constitutional principle was declared to establish a flexible rule that varied in its application with the classification of the employee and the nature of his duties. There were, and of necessity had to be, exceptions to the rule; there were, the Court freely conceded, classes of public employees who were not entitled to invoke the constitutional principle it was enunciating. Thus, it emphasized in its opinion that it did not \u201cchallenge the public executive\u2019s right to use political philosophy or affiliation as one criterion in the selection of policy-making officials. Moreover, considerations of personal loyalty, or other factors besides determination of policy, may justify the employment of political associates in certain positions. It is difficult to believe, however, that any such justification would be valid for positions such as janitors, elevator operators or school teachers. Thus, again, jurisdiction is a matter of proof, or at least argument, directed at particular kinds of jobs. The possibility of such valid justification for some positions does not afford a basis for dismissing all of plaintiffs' claims without a trial.\u201d (473 F.2d at p. 574)</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-8\">The Court stated throughout its opinion that the rule it was expounding related only to the rights of \u201cmaintenance workers, elevator operators; janitors, and comparable employees\u201d, or, as it expressed it at another point, of \u201cjanitors, elevator operators or school teachers\u201d, (473 F.2d at pp. 574-575) employees who normally cannot in their employment adversely affect the policy-making or implementation functions of government and employees \u201cperforming merely routine functions not requiring the exercise of an informed discretion or the formulation of underlying rationales for government action.\u201d Indiana State Employees Association, Inc. v. Negley, <em>supra </em>(365 F.Supp. at p. 232). In short, <em>Lewis, </em>it seems fair to assume, was intended to extend its mantle of constitutional protection only to those public employees whose duties were \u201croutine\u201d, involving the exercise of no administrative policy or public duties as broadly de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>fined, and that is the reach of the decision on this point, as we read it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">It is true, the opinion in <em>Lewis </em>may be thought to make a vague distinction between what it describes as \u201cpolicy-making\u201d employees and \u201cnon-policy-making\u201d employees and does indicate that its rule extends generally to \u201cnon-policy-making\u201d employees. But the Court attempted no authoritative or precise definition of \u201cpolicy-making\u201d and \u201cnon-policy-making\u201d; and these terms as used in the opinion, contribute little to determining with exactness or finality those employees who are or are not entitled to the protection of the rule the Court is promulgating. As the editor in 14 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev., 720 at 729-30, commenting on this case, phrased it, \u201c[A] related problem is that of defining the protected class. The most common proposal is that persons in policy making positions be excluded. Such a distinction proves simple at either end of the employment spectrum, but would be almost impossible to accomplish where the groups shade together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-9\">Judge Campbell in his concurring opinion also recognized the \u201cdefinitional problem\u201d represented in attempting to fix the application of the rule by the use of such broad, general terms as \u201cpolicy-making\u201d and \u201cnon-policy-making\u201d. He stated the problem in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1418-10\">\u201c* * * it is simple enough to say that janitors, clerk-typists and elevator operators are \u2018non-policy making\u2019 employees, but how far up in the bureaucratic echelon can the distinction be judicially drawn? What, about a janitorial supervisor, the director of a stenographic pool, a personnel manager, a deputy assistant division head, a deputy director, or even a secretary to a top echelon director or department head who may have access to confidential information? As Judge Stevens so aptly states, there may be instances when political affiliation constitutes a proper qualification for public employment, particularly in the selection and appointment of \u2018policy-making\u2019 officials. Indeed, no one has challenged the right of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>elected official to appoint to such positions and for whatever reasons he deems proper, persons in whose loyalty and competence he has the highest confidence. The difficulty arising in attempting to fashion an appropriate and workable judicial standard for distinguishing between \u2018policy-making\u2019 and \u2018non policy-making\u2019 positions. In my judgment, the constitution would permit a public official to hire or dismiss on the basis of political association any employee engaged directly or indirectly in the formulation or implementation of the policies of the particular governmental office or agency. A more precise standard is difficult to articulate and thus the true impact of today\u2019s decision must necessarily await ease by case determination.\u201d (473 F.2d at p. 578)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">Moreover, the lead opinion was at pains,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> it would seem, to indicate it was not using the term \u201cpolicy-making\u201d as an absolute criterion in the application of its rule. It unquestionably envisaged a broader basis for immunity from the rule. This was made clear by the opinion in Indiana State Employees Association, Inc. v. Negley, <em>supra, </em>where the Court, quoting from the pertinent language of <em>Lewis, </em>said (365 F.Supp. at pp. 231-232):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-6\">\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the distinction between policy-making and non-policy-making positions arises from language in <em>Lewis </em>wherein the Court stated: \u2018Plaintiffs properly do not challenge the public executive\u2019s right to use political philosophy or affiliation as one criterion in the selection of policy-making officials.\u2019 Such reliance is nearsighted in that it ignores the succeeding sentence in the opinion which states that \u2018Moreover, considerations of personal loyalty, or other factors besides determination of policy, may justify the employment of political associates in certain positions.\u2019 Though these plaintiffs clearly occupied policy-making positions, the Court foresees that many cases could arise wherein such a distinction could not practically be made. In those cases consideration of \u2018other factors\u2019 would be appropriate. If such a distinction must be made, a more useful, and more accurate, one to be drawn from <em>Lewis </em>would be the distinction between employees performing or exercising public duties as opposed to those performing merely routine functions not requiring the exercise of an informed discretion or the formulation of underlying rationales for government action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1419-9\">As we have observed, it seems fairly manifest that the majority in <em>Lewis </em>intended to restrict its holding to a particular group of employees (\u201cmaintenance workers, elevator operators, janitors, and comparable employees\u201d) and proposed to promulgate no authoritative definition of the type of other employees who were entitled to protection under its ruling. So clear is this intent that it has been remarked that, \u201c [I]t is apparent that the court of appeals intended to limit <em>Lewis </em>to its facts\u201d and to the class of employees who performed \u201croutine services\u201d. Indiana State Employees Association, Inc. v. Negley, <em>supra </em>(365 F. Supp. at p. 232). Actually, it would appear the Court was in its decision seeking to make the same distinction among employees and their rights which Justice Douglas made in his dissent in United Public Workers v. Mitchell (1947) 330 U.S. 75 at pp. 120-122, 67 S.Ct. 556, 581, 91 L.Ed. 754. There, he concluded that the Hatch Act should apply to those public employees who \u201cmay be a tributary, though perhaps a small one, to the main stream which we call policy mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>ing or administrative action\u201d, a class that could even include \u201cclerks, stenographers and the like\u201d, if so identified with \u201cpolicy making or administrative action\u201d, but should not apply to \u201ca skilled laborer or artisan whose work or functions in no way affect the policy of the agency nor involve relationships with the public\u201d. And the dissenting opinion in American Federation of State, C. &amp; M. Emp. v. Shapp, <em>supra </em>(280 A.2d at pp. 381-382), made the same point: Accepting the premise that it was \u201cconsonant with constitutional protections, to allow a new governor to dismiss, merely because of political affiliation, any employe who is engaged in a policy making position, or in a position charged with implementing or devising the means of implementing the governor\u2019s policies\u201d, it would have held such rule inapplicable to \u201cunskilled and semi-skilled employes whose daily occupations are merely to maintain the public highways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">Because of these difficulties in defining the protected class, Judge Campbell, in his concurring opinion, expressed considerable concern that the federal courts might, if the rule enunciated was given too broad an application, be converted into \u201csuper civil service commissions\u201d and voiced doubt whether for these reasons the courts were as well qualified as the legislature to define what constituted a \u201cpolicy-making\u201d or an \u201cexcepted\u201d position in the application of the constitutional principles being enunciated. (473 F.2d at p. 578) His doubts have been echoed by a number of commentators. Thus, in 26 Vand.L.Rev. 1090, 1097-8 (1973), the note editor observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aeb-dedup-0\">\u201c* * * a second definitional problem is created by the court\u2019s restriction of the decision\u2019s scope to non-policy-making employees. Perhaps, as was noted by Judge Campbell, the difficulties inherent in delineating any workable standards for making this characterization of public employees are such that they should be resolved legislatively.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1420-8\">We find convincing the point that the delineation between the employees who are and who are not protected from patronage discharge poses an issue which should be resolved legislatively, not judicially, and that the legislative determination, when made, should be overturned only if it can be said that it is palpably arbitrary or irrational. Such a conclusion, it would seem, fits in with the procedure established under the federal civil service laws, which have formed the pattern for the state civil service laws, including that of West Virginia. The Lloyd-LaFollette Act,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which supplements the Pendleton Act of 1883,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and as implemented under the Regulations of the Civil Service Commission,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> provides protection for federal employees in the \u201ccompetitive service\u201d against discharge for political reasons. But whether a federal employee is in the \u201ccompetitive service\u201d and entitled to that protection depends on federal statute and the regulations of the Civil Service Commission, acting by delegation from the President. Federal employees who occupy positions which (a) are of a confidential or policy determining character, or are, while not of a confidential or policy determining character, of a type (b) for which it is not practicable to examine, or (c) it is not practicable to hold a competitive examination, are expressly excepted from the \u201ccompetitive service\u201d and may be terminated at will for any cause. The Civil Service Commission, as the selected agency of the executive branch, is given the authority in turn \u201cto determine finally whether a position is in the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>petitive service\u201d and to \u201cdecide whether the duties of any particular position are such that it may be filled as an excepted position\u201d or patronage position. By like token, it would appear that the state legislature, subject only to the requirement that it should not act arbitrarily or irrationally, should have the same.authority to determine whether under a state civil service law a state position involves the exercise of such \u201cpublic duties\u201d that patronage dismissal therefrom would not be improper. The legislature of West Virginia has made that determination with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s position, a determination that should be given the same weight and finality accorded an exception made for federal employees by the Civil Service Commission.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It assuredly cannot be said that the designation by the West Virginia legislature of plaintiff\u2019s position as a patronage job, terminable at will as such, was either arbitrary or irrational. Liquor control is always a sensitive issue in government and requires strict supervision and control. This is well recognized. <em>Cf., </em>California v. LaRue (1972) 409 U.S. 109, 93 S.Ct. 390, 34 L.Ed.2d 342. The manager of the county liquor store is in a far more sensitive position than the holders of the several specified positions instanced by Judge Campbell in his concurring opinion; it plainly is not a \u201croutine\u201d position. It, it would seem, is the type of position that the legislature could properly exempt, and that Judge Campbell thought it could exempt, from the \u201cclassified service\u201d, just as the Civil Service Commission, under its Congressional mandate, exempted federal positions from the federal \u201cclassified service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-10\">The plaintiff argues, though, that the District Court made a finding of fact that her position was \u201cnon-poliey-mak-ing\u201d and was within the <em>Lewis </em>rule, if that rule should be considered controlling. And she contends that such a finding may be overturned only if clearly erroneous. There is no question that a factual finding made by the District Court on disputed facts is binding on appeal unless clearly erroneous. But that principle is not involved here. We do not construe the use by the District Court of the term \u201cnon-policy-making\u201d employee as amounting to a factual finding that the plaintiff was such an employee. Rather, we would read its use as a means of putting the issue within the frame of the <em>Alomar </em>rule which it proposed to follow. If, however, it is to be regarded as a finding of fact, it has no support or basis in the record. Indeed, the District Court gave no reason for such a finding, if finding it was; it made no effort to analyze the plaintiff\u2019s position in the light of the criteria discussed in <em>Lewis. </em>The plaintiff herself, though she relied on <em>Lewis </em>for her claim, nowhere alleged that her employment was in a non-policy type position. Nor did the defendant make any suggestion in the motion to dismiss to that effect. The record is accordingly barren of any basis of any kind for a finding by the District Court that the plaintiff was in a non-policy-making position. In our opinion, the record as made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>plaintiff herself and the legislative declaration fix her type of employment as one without the rule in <em>Lewis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">It should be noted, also, that, if the argument of the plaintiff is accepted, her initial employment would be as invalid constitutionally as her subsequent discharge. If political affiliation cannot be justified constitutionally as a basis for discharge, it would seem to follow that granting employment itself on such a basis is invalid. The complaint is clear that the plaintiff received her position because of her Republican party affiliation. Hers was a definite patronage appointment. Beyond this, she alleged categorically that \u201cher employment and <em>continued employment </em>as manager and cashier as described herein was conditioned upon active and partisan support, past, present and future, of the Republican Party in local, state and national elections.\u201d (Italics added)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In her brief filed in this Court, the plaintiff asserts that at the time she was offered the non-civil service position of manager as a patronage job pure and simple, she was offered the alternative of cashier, a civil service position with tenure. She voluntarily accepted the patronage postion, with a full realization of its conditions and its hazards. The question naturally arises whether, irrespective of the validity or invalidity of attaching political consideration to either the granting or the continuance of public employment, one who obtains a position knowingly and understanding^ as a purely political appointment is in any position to complain if he or she loses his or her position in the same manner, and for the same reason by which he or she originally Secured it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-7\">This problem was faced in <em>Lewis. </em>The Court recognized that it could be well argued that a public employee who \u201caccepted his job with knowledge that he would be fired if, and when, the appointing officer was replaced by a member of the opposite political party * * * waived any right to object to the fully anticipated event which has now come to pass.\u201d (473 F.2d at p. 573) The Court found, however, that there was not sufficient \u201cfactual basis\u201d for a defense of this character in the case under consideration and did not feel compelled to determine whether such defense was sound.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> However, the Court in American Federation of State, C. &amp; M. Emp. v. Shapp, <em>supra, </em>did, it would seem, resolve this issue and resolved it adversely to the plaintiff\u2019s position. In denying to patronage employees, who had obtained through political affiliation their jobs relief from discharge, the Court stated tersely that those who \u201clive by the political sword must be prepared to die by the political sword\u201d and, in dying by the political sword, acquire no constitutional right to relief. It phrased its conclusion thus (280 A.2d at p. 378):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1422-9\">\u201cWe specifically hold that State employees who obtained their positions <em>(jobs) </em>\u2014 as <em>all the parties agree they did </em>\u2014 by politics or party patronage, and complain of being fired solely on the grounds of political sponsorship or affiliation, have (1) no Constitutionally ordained right of procedural Due Process, (2) nor any other Constitutionally protected right to their jobs under (a) either the Federal or (b) the State Constitution, (3) nor any right claimed herein under any (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>Federal or (b) State <em>Statute: </em>phasis in opinion] <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> [Em-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2e\">We are of opinion the plaintiff by her own allegations disqualified herself from claiming any right to complain of her discharge. She knew from the outset she was entitled to no civil service status. In fact, she had been given, as we have observed, a choice between a civil service status and one dependent on political activity, and had voluntarily chosen the latter, knowing, as she herself alleges, the hazards of the choice she took. If there were ever a case in which it could be said an employee had waived a right of complaint, this, it would seem, is that case.</p>\n<p id=\"azr-dedup-0\">Nor do we find any support for plaintiff\u2019s contention in Perry v. Sindermann (1972), 408 U.S. 593, 93 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570, even though she places great reliance on that authority. That case involved a college teacher, who had not been employed as a patronage employee and whose initial or continued employment was in no way dependent on political affiliation or activity. The teacher specifically \u201calleged that he had <em>de facto </em>tenure under contract law due to \u2018the existence of rules or understandings\u2019 with the college which employed him,\u201d and that was the true basis on which the Court found that, if proved, he had a cause of action. Arnett v. Kennedy, <em>supra </em>(White, J., concurring and dissenting). We have no such situation here; indeed, we have the very opposite. The plaintiff concedes she had no right to tenure in her job. Though irrelevant to the issue here, it perhaps is not amiss to add that even when a public employee enjoys tenure and is as \u201ca federal employee in the competitive service, entitled, by statute, to serve in his job without fear of dismissal except for cause,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> it has been decided \u201cthat in certain situations the discharge of a government employee may be based on his speech without offending guarantees of the First Amendment.\u201d Arnett v. Kennedy, <em>supra, </em>416 U.S. at p. 160, 94 S.Ct. at p. 1647.</p>\n<p id=\"A5W\">In short, it would seem that, however plaintiff\u2019s claim be viewed, it is without validity. Unquestionably, as the plaintiff herself concedes, <em>Alomar </em>\u2014 an authority whose reasoning we find persuasive \u2014 would bar relief. But <em>Lewis </em>offers no better avenue for relief. It is difficult to fit the position of the plaintiff within the range of positions around which <em>Lewis </em>placed a protective hedge. Her position was in no way similar to that of \u201cmaintenance workers, elevator operators, janitors and comparable employees\u201d as in <em>Lewis, </em>or to the \u201cunskilled and semi-skilled employees whose daily occupations are merely to maintain the public highways\u201d, whose rights against patronage dismissal the dissenting opinion in <em>Shapp </em>would protect, or \u201ca skilled laborer or artisan whose work or functions in no way affect the policy of the agency nor involve relationships with the public,\u201d which are included within the class Justice Douglas found entitled to constitutional protection against First Amendment restraints in <em>Mitchell. </em>Moreover, her awareness that her position was a patronage job and that she accepted it voluntarily with full understanding that, granted on the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>of patronage, it was terminable on that same basis, gives her no right to complain of her patronage dismissal.

Such distinction is in a way suggestive of a modern tendency to construct novel and abstruse constitutional theories to serve as instruments with which it is hoped the judiciary, under the guise of constitutional interpretation, will correct an alleged political or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>social evil which, though properly the subject of legislative reform, the legislature has neglected to remedy or lias moved with too \u201ctardy a step.\u201d It was this tendency which Justice Harlan criticized in <em>Williams, supra, </em>and to which Chief Justice Burger perceptively referred in United States v.

The slow development of civil service is well illustrated in the federal record of legislation. At the outset, the Pendleton Act, adopted in 1883, was extended to scarcely more than ten per cent, of the federal employees, and these occupied relatively unimportant clerk-ships ranging in salary from $900 to $1,800 a year. Gradually, the coverage was extended, though at the time Cleveland began his first Presidency 88% of the federal employees were unprotected (or, as it was generally stated, held \u201cexcepted\u201d positions) and, of these he dismissed 68% in order to make way for patronage appointments. In 1953 President Eisenhower rearranged the coverage of the Act, set up the \u201cexcepted\u201d classes of employees, and, incident to these steps, transferred certain formerly competitive service positions over to the \u201cexcepted\u201d classifications. As a result 86% of all federal employees came under civil service protection. Cooke, Biography of an Ideal (Government Printing Office, 1958) pp. 57-62. But whether progress has been slow or fast, if the remedy for civil service reform lies within the jurisdiction of the legislature, the judiciary is obligated to respect that legislative jurisdiction. Legislative inaction or \u201cbenign neglect\u201d in a field committed to legislative control will not transfer jurisdiction to act to the judiciary.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1417-10\">. <em>Cf., </em>CSC v.

This, it -would appear, is the construction put on the decision by even those commentators who argue that patronage dismissals are constitutionally impermissible. They, too, conclude that the constitutional principle that would invalidate such dismissals is not to be extended indiscriminately to all public employees but, on the contrary, can be invoked by only certain groups of public employees. In the Note in 41 U. of Chi.L.Rev., <em>supra, </em>at p. 319, the author <em>concedes that </em>\u201cpersonal loyalty is sufficient to justify political dismissals at the policy-making level, and that the patronage dismissal is unconstitutional only with regard to non-policy-making employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-6\">Similarly, in the Note, Political Patronage and Unconstitutional Conditions: A Last Hurrah for the Party Faithful? 14 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. 720 (1973), the author would confine any rights arising out of refusal to hire or dismissal for patronage reasons to \u201clower level personnel, who are not considered participants in the formulation or supervision of administration policies\u201d and are \u201cunprotected by any civil service system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-8\">The author in the Note, A Constitutional Analysis of the Spoils System \u2014 The Judiciary Visits Patronage Place, 57 Iowa L.Rev. 1320, 1321, n. 12 (1972), also, would restrict his views of the rights of public employees to be protected from patronage dismissals to \u201csubordinate governmental officials, who perform mere administrative duties and exercise little or no discretion\u201d, and \u201care seldom held directly accountable to the appointing executive * * * \u201d and \u201cdo not operate in sensitive areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-13\">This limited application of Lewis was underscored in Gould v.

This, she charges, violated her rights of free political expression and association guaranteed by the first and fourteenth amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-8\">The district court conducted no evidentiary hearing. Quoting the epigram, \u201cThose who, figuratively speaking, live by the political sword must be prepared to die by the political sword,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it held that her complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. This court now affirms. I believe both courts have erred by grounding their decisions on Mrs. Nunnery\u2019s lack of tenure instead of on the constitutional rights accorded her by the first and fourteenth amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-9\">Mrs. Nunnery\u2019s lack of a property interest in her job affects her right to procedural due process. Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). It does not in itself defeat her claim that her discharge was an unlawful retaliation for her exercise of first and fourteenth amendment rights. The constitutional limitations on a state\u2019s power to discharge a person whose employment is otherwise terminable at will are clearly explained in Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 596, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2697, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-12\">\u201cThe first question presented is whether the respondent\u2019s lack of a contractual or tenure right to re-employment, taken alone, defeats his claim that the nonrenewal of his contract violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. We hold that it does not. \u2022\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-13\">\u201cFor at least a quarter-century, this Court has made clear that even though a person has no \u2018right\u2019 to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely. It may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests \u2014 especially, his interest in freedom of speech. For if the government could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to \u2018produce a result which [it] could not command directly.\u2019 . Such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-15\">\u201cWe have applied this general principle to denials of tax exemptions unemployment benefits and welfare payments . But, most often, we have applied the principle to denials of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>employment . . . We have applied the principle regardless of the public employee\u2019s contractual or other claim to a job. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-6\">\u201cThus, the respondent\u2019s lack of a contractual or tenure \u2018right\u2019 to reemployment for the 1969-1970 academic year is immaterial to his free speech claim. Indeed, twice before, this Court has specifically held that the nonrenewal of a nontenured public school teacher\u2019s one-year contract may not be predicated on his exercise of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights . . . We reaffirm those holdings here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-8\"><em>Perry </em>thus exposes the error of dismissing Mrs. Nunnery\u2019s suit simply because she lacked tenure. The defense of waiver is equally fallacious. <em>Perry </em>and its precedents teach that a state cannot condition a benefit, including a job, on the surrender, or waiver, of one\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See, e. g., </em>Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488, 495, 81 S.Ct. 1680, 6 L.Ed.2d 982 (1961); Alston v. School Board, 112 F.2d 992, 998 (4th Cir. 1940). In sum, the crux of this controversy is the nature of a public employee\u2019s first amendment rights, not lack of tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-9\">The Supreme Court has ruled that the state, as an employer, has a greater interest in regulating the speech of its employees than in regulating the speech of other citizens. This interest is confined, however, to the reasonable needs of promoting the efficiency and integrity of public service. While deference is to be paid to the public employer\u2019s judgment, the coui\u2019ts have a duty to weigh the state\u2019s needs against the employee\u2019s rights as a citizen. Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 569, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). The balance must include both the rights which the employee seeks to exercise and the responsibilities of her job. The state\u2019s requirements may include, for example, the need for loyal and sympathetic employees in positions of discretion, the need to ensure obedience to state policy, and the need to prevent impropriety or its appearance. <em>See Pickering, supra, </em>at 570 n. 3, 88 S.Ct. 1731; Note, Patronage Dismissals: Constitutional Limits and Political Justifications, 41 U.Chi.L.Rev. 297, 319-325 (1974). Thus, what would be impermissible speech or conduct in one position may be acceptable for an employee holding another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-11\">When a neutral statute, such as the Hatch Act, regulates the political activity of public employees, courts defer to the legislature\u2019s perception of the state\u2019s interest. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States Civil Service Comm\u2019n v. National Assn. of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 93 S.Ct. 2880, 37 L.Ed.2d 796 (1973); Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). But no West Virginia statute compels a public employee to undertake purely partisan tasks at variance with his political beliefs ; indeed, the constitutionality of such a statute would be dubious. If a state official commands partisan service under penalty of dismissal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I believe he should be required to demonstrate how the state\u2019s interest \u2014 as distinct from the party\u2019s \u2014 will be legitimately advanced by the suppression of the employee\u2019s first amendment rights. Illinois State Employees\u2019 Union v. Lewis, 473 F.2d 561 (7th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 928, 943, 93 S.Ct. 1364, 1370, 35 L.Ed.2d 590, 609 (1973). <em>Contra </em>Alomar v. Dwyer, 447 F.2d 482 (2nd Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1020, 92 S.Ct. 683, 30 L.Ed.2d 667 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>Therefore, I would remand the case for a trial at which Mrs. Nunnery must carry the initial burden of showing that she has been deprived of her right to free political association or speech. If the proof shows that Mrs. Nunnery\u2019s refusal to perform party chores did not arise from principled disagreement with the ideology of the party, but, on the contrary, stemmed from mere unwillingness to exert herself, the district court should dismiss her suit. She cannot complain because her party-oriented boss prefers a party stalwart who will perform party chores over one who will not. The first amendment assures her right to freedom of speech and association, but if these rights have not been placed in jeopardy, it affords Mrs. Nunnery no protection for her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">On the other hand, if Mrs. Nunnery\u2019s proof establishes that her discharge resulted from her refusal to do party chores because she disagreed with the political tenets of the party, her employer must demonstrate that the state \u2014 as distinguished from the party \u2014 had a legitimate interest in her performance of these chores that outweighed her first amendment rights. If the state lacked such an interest, the district court should find for Mrs. Nunnery on this issue. This would not, as the employer argues, impose a civil service system on the state. West Virginia is not required to give any assurances of tenure which would make the job a property right. <em>See </em>Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 155-156, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 1645, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974). It may discharge for other good cause despite an employee\u2019s first amendment claim. Kirker v. Moore, 436 F.2d 423 (4th Cir. 1971). But its power to discharge cannot trench on rights secured by the first and fourteenth amendments even though the employee may otherwise be fired at will. Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 596, 93 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 81 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231 (1960).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1424-10\">.
