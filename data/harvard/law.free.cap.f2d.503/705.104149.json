As to the latter, we conclude that Ramey complied with his duty to provide a current address through which mail \u201cmay be reasonably expected to come into his hands in time for compliance.\u201d Bartchy v. United States, 319 U.S. 484, 489, 63 S.Ct. 1206, 1208, 87 L.Ed. 1534 (1942). We therefore reverse both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-22\">Ramey registered with Local Board No. 87, Dobson, North Carolina, on June 8, 1970. Thereafter he filed with the board his Selective Service Classification Questionnaire giving his current mailing address as 713 Marshall Street, Mt. Airy, North Carolina, and designating the \u201cMember of the household who will always know my address\u201d as Mamie G. Ramey, Route 5, Mt. Airy, North Carolina (July 16, 1970). Later he changed his current mailing address to Route 5, Mt. Airy, North Carolina 27030. To this address the Board mailed, on June 30, 1972, an Order to Report for Armed Forces Physical Examination. The Or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>der required that Ramey appear at 6:30 a. m. an July 18, 1972, in Dobson, North Carolina. Instead of appearing at Dob-son, North Carolina, Ramey appeared at the local board in Downey, California, on July 18, 1972. He filled out SSS Form 6, Request for Duplicate Registration Certificate or Notice of Classification, listing as his address 8109 San Vincente, South Gate, California. He did not indicate in the space provided whether this address was <em>\u201ca </em>permanent change of address.\u201d According to testimony at trial by FBI Agent Lowe, who interviewed Ramey on March 6, 1973, Ramey stated that he also attempted to obtain his physical at that time but that he was told by an employee of the board in California that he would have to return to North Carolina.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Local Board 87 mailed a duplicate registration certificate to Ramey at the South Gate, California, address on August 22, 1972. On September 6 they sent him a Current Information Questionnaire and, on September 21, an Order to Report for Induction. The latter communication was returned on October 3, stamped \u201cMoved \u2014 Address unknown\u201d and \u201cMoved, left no address.\u201d It was then mailed to Ramey in care of Mamie Ramey, Route 5, Box 233, Mt. Airy, North Carolina, and- was not returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The local board received their September 6 questionnaire on October 17. It gave defendant\u2019s current mailing address as Prince Edward Motel, 490 Pearl, Buffalo, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">With respect to that address the government offered the testimony of FBI Agent Lowe that Ramey told the agent that during the \u201cshort period of time\u201d he was in Buffalo he was \u201cstaying in the streets, mainly,\u201d that \u201c[h]e didn\u2019t have any address,\u201d and that he sent the Prince Edward Motel address to the Board because he \u201cknew some people there and he felt like they might forward some mail to him if he received any.\u201d He did not at any time, however, check by the motel to see if mail had arrived. Agent Lowe also stated that Ramey had \u201cindicated that he always received mail at his mother\u2019s home at Route 5, Mount Airy, and that any time that he wasn\u2019t there, that she would forward his mail to him.\u201d Transcript at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">The Board had previously recognized that this was apparently true: in a letter to Ramey\u2019s mother, the Board had noted that \u201capparently you have his address, so just be sure to forward any mail that we send to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-14\">32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1628.8 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-15\">(a) Any registrant who has received an Order to Report for Armed Forces Examination (SSS Form 223) and who is so far from his own local board that reporting to his own local board would be a hardship may, subject to the provisions of this section, be transferred for armed forces examination to the local board having jurisdiction of the area in which he is at that time located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-16\">While Ramey\u2019s declaration that he requested a physical in California and was informed that he would have to return to North Carolina is clearly self-serving hearsay, it was offered by the government through the testimony of Agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Lowe and is uncontradicted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon it there arises the well established \u201cmisleading information\u201d defense. United States v. Burton, 472 F.2d 757, 758-762 (8th Cir. 1973); United States v. Jacques, 463 F.2d 653, 657-659 (1st Cir. 1972); United States v. Timmins, 464 F.2d 385, 386-388 (9th Cir. 1972); United States v. Cordova, 454 F.2d 763, 765 (10th Cir. 1972); United States v. Burns, 431 F.2d 1070, 1074 (10th Cir. 1970); <em>see </em>United States v. Davis, 413 F.2d 148, 150-151 (4th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">In the context of this ease, the defense means that the government may not burden the defendant with the ignorance or indifference of its California draft board clerk. Since Ramey presented himself to the California board on the very day he was directed to report to his local board at Dobson, North Carolina, the refusal, without reason, to grant him the benefit of the transfer regulation effectively put him in default. Ramey was entitled to correct information and advice. United States v. Cordova, <em>supra, </em>454 F.2d at 765. Instead, he was erroneously told, in effect, that he could not bring himself into compliance in California but must do the impossible \u2014 get back to North Carolina the same day. Although 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1628.8 is not self-executing, we think that where a registrant presents himself for a physical examination 3,000 miles away from his local board on the day he has been ordered to appear, and where there is no suggestion of any valid reason for denial of the transfer privilege, that a subsequent prosecution for failure to report for a physical examination cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The government\u2019s response does not challenge the sufficiency of the \u201cmisleading information\u201d defense nor its applicability, given the truth of Ramey\u2019s assertions. Instead the government relies on its assertion that Ramey has failed to establish that any such conversation occurred. Introducing no evidence to contradict the FBI agent\u2019s narrative, the government relies solely on the presumption of regularity which attaches to administrative proceedings, citing Chaney v. United States, 406 F.2d 809, 812-814 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 867, 90 S.Ct. 128, 24 L.Ed.2d 120 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\"> We do not understand the rule of evidence affording' presumptive validity to administrative acts and proceedings as meaning that a government agent is presumed always to have given correct information and advice. In <em>Chaney, </em>the registrant sought to infer from a clerk\u2019s ignorance of a regulation that the <em>board itself </em>must also have acted ignorantly and erroneously. Quite properly it was held that the registrant must overcome the presumption that the board acted in accordance with its own rules. 406 F.2d at 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">Here there is no attack upon board action or conduct. It is not suggested that either the California or North Carolina board did anything wrong but only that Ramey was misled by the California clerk into believing he could not comply with his duty to report for a physical without returning to North Carolina. We think there is no presumption as to what a draft board clerk may or may not have told a registrant. This case is like <em>Cordova, Jacques, </em>and <em>Burns, supra, </em>where, as here, other evidence tended to establish the fact that the registrant contacted the board,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <em>only the registrant\u2019s testimony </em>established the substance of the conversations and provided a basis for a finding of misinformation. Where \u201cnothing in the record casts doubt on the verity of the evidence . . . the testimony must be accepted.\u201d <em>Cordova, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number><em>supra, </em>454 F.2d at 765. Having misinformed the registrant of an important procedural right the utilization of which would have brought him into compliance with its order for physical examination, the Selective Service System cannot now seek to hold him accountable for noncompliance with that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1641.1 prescribes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">(a) It shall be the duty of every classified registrant until his liability for training and service has terminated, to keep his local board currently informed in writing of (1) the address where mail will reach him ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ad-\">The Supreme Court, in interpreting Section 1641.1 (a)\u2019s almost identical precursor,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">The regulation, it seems to us, is satisfied when the registrant, in good faith, provides a chain of forwarding addresses by which mail, sent to the address which is furnished the board, may be by the registrant reasonably expected to come into his hands in time for compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Bartchy v. United States, <em>supra, </em>319 U.S. at 489, 63 S.Ct. at 1208. The district judge apparently based his finding of guilt as to the third count on the fact that Ramey, while in Buffalo, New York, sent to his local board an address where he did not reside and at which he never checked for mail.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But Ramey was not charged with supplying the Board with a false address. Indeed, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462 delineates no such offense. All that Ramey was charged with was a failure to comply with the duty put upon him by 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462 and 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1641.1(a) to provide an address \u201cwhere mail will reach him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">That duty was fulfilled by Ramey since the Board at all times had the address, provided by appellant, of his mother in Mt. Airy. The evidence tends to establish that on at least one occasion \u2014 the order to report for preinduction physical examination \u2014 a communication mailed to this address was forwarded to Ramey in California. In a second instance, when the notice of induction sent to the California address was returned, it was remailed to Mamie Ramey\u2019s address and was not returned. Even though Ramey did not report for induction, nothing in the record establishes that he failed to receive the order. Under these circumstances <em>Bartchy\u2019s </em>requirement of \u201ca chain of forwarding addresses\u201d is met. United States v. Chudy, 474 F.2d 1069 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. Burton, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Ebey, 424 F.2d 376 (10th Cir. 1970). <em>See also </em>Ward v. United States, 344 U.S. 924, 73 S.Ct. 494, 97 L.Ed. 711 (1953), rev\u2019g per curiam 195 F.2d 441 (5th Cir. 1952). As in <em>Burton, supra, </em>\u201cthe defendant was entitled to rely on his mother\u2019s address to meet his duty of informing the board of \u2018the address where mail will reach him.\u2019\u201d 472 F.2d at 763. Here that address was obviously effective for there is nothing in the record to suggest that Ramey ever failed to get any communication from his local board.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">Moreover even though no chain of forwarding addresses is. shown, if communications mailed to various addresses furnished by the registrant reach him in time for compliance there is no violation of the duty to keep the local board informed of his current address. United States v. Ebey, <em>supra. </em>\u201cA registrant is not required to . report to the board every move that he makes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377 of 424 F.2d; United States v. Chudy, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">We conclude that the record does not support the charge that \u201cthere was deliberate purpose on the part of petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>not to comply with the Selective Service Act or the regulation issued thereunder.\u201d Ward v. United States, <em>supra, </em>344 U.S. at 924, 73 S.Ct. at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-23\">. The first of three counts \u2014 failure to report for induction \u2014 was dismissed by the district judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">. Agent Lowe testified as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-9\">Q. Continue on with what he indicated to you concerning events that transpired out in California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-10\">A. lie said that when he was in California that he had received some information that he had to report for a physical examination in Charlotte, North Carolina, and that he was in California without any money, and also about this same time had lost his draft card and went to the Local Draft Board in Yail, California, and asked about getting a physical there. And he was told that he must return to North Carolina in order to get the physical. And lie told me he decided this was ridiculous for him to have to do- that and that he had no intention of traveling back across the United States in order to get his physical.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-18\">Transcript at 67-68.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b772-6\">. We do not suggest the government was bound by <em>its </em>agent\u2019s testimony. Certainly the United States Attorney could have offered evidence, e. <em>g., </em>the clerk of the California board, to contradict what Ramey told Agent Lowe \u2014 if that were the truth of the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b772-12\">. Government Exhibit 5 shows that Ramey was present in the office of the local board in California on July 18, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b773-15\">.

The registrant in <em>Bartchy </em>also failed to check the address for mail. In <em>Bartchy </em>the defendant\u2019s omission was of greater import because the board\u2019s notice <em>was </em>forwarded'1 to that address. Here, no notice was sent or'' forwarded to the Buffalo address.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
