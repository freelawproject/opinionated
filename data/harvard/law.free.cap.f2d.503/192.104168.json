Next morning the strike began. When advised by the Union that the strike would end if Davis were reappointed assistant foreman, the employer promptly made the appointment. Wilson was subsequently discharged since two supervisors were not required for the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">The Board held that the Union, by insisting upon the reappointment of Davis, violated the proscription of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(1)(B), which prohibits a union from restraining or coercing an employer \u201cin the selection of his representatives for the purpose[s] of . . . the adjustment of grievances.\u201d At the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge the Union offered to show that the laborers struck because they objected to racially discriminatory treatment of the black laborers by foreman Wilson, and were willing to continue with him as foreman only if Mr. Davis, a black, served as his assistant and a \u201cbuffer.\u201d The Administrative Law Judge excluded the proferred evidence, ruling that it was irrelevant to a determination of the \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) violation. The Union\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the Board erroneously ruled evidence of racial discrimination irrelevant. The issue is sharpened by the concession of Union counsel at oral argument that but for the alleged racial discrimination, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>facts as the Board found them establish a \u00a7 8(b) (1) (B) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The Union argues that the prohibition of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) must yield to the right of workers to be free of racial discrimination in their employment. The Board responds that the employees may fully assert their right to non-discriminatory treatment, through legal remedies as well as self-help measures protected by Section 7 of the Act, so long as they protest the discriminatory treatment and do not demand the removal or appointment of a particular management \u201crepresentative.\u201d In short, the Board says that protest must be directed, at least in the ordinary case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at the alleged discriminatory conduct, rather than the identity of the supervisor whose conduct is challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We believe the Board\u2019s principle is a reasonable harmonization of Sections 7 and 8, and that the principle was properly applied in this case. At oral argument, the union counsel assailed the Board\u2019s approach by asserting that the Board would find a \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) violation whenever a union protested discriminatory conduct and the employer responded by replacing the offending supervisor. This does not follow, at least if the employer\u2019s replacement of the supervisor represents an independent exercise of his judgment as to the person who would best carry out the employer\u2019s obligation to refrain from discriminatory treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Our holding is fully consistent with Western Addition Community Organization v. NLRB, 158 U.S.App.D.C. 138, 485 F.2d 917 (1973), cert. granted, 415 U.S. 913, 94 S.Ct. 1407, 39 L.Ed.2d 466 (1974), which held that the mandate of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq., must be taken into account in construing the NLRA. We reaffirm that approach, see Southern Steamship Co. v. NLRB, 316 U.S. 31, 47, 62 S.Ct. 886, 86 L.Ed. 1246 (1942).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Western Addition </em>the court confronted the need to reconcile \u00a7 7 protection of \u201cconcerted activity\u201d (even by a minority of employees) with the principle of union exclusive representation embodied in \u00a7 8 of the Act; and the court, in light of the policies rooted in Title VII, held minority action protesting racially discriminatory treatment protected by \u00a7 7. Here, the Board fully permits employees to engage in \u00a7 7 concerted activity challenging alleged discrimination but holds that the specific prohibition of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) limits the demands that the employees, in the exercise of their rights of concerted activity, may make of their employer. While in <em>Western Addition </em>the court had to reconcile two rather generally-drawn statutory provisions, in the case at bar we confront a specific Congressional limitation on a union\u2019s use of coercive economic power. Its specificity limits judicial leeway.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-17\">.
