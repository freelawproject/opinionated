Accordingly, it granted a writ of habeas corpus. The Commonwealth appealed. Without reaching the Equal Protection issue, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-21\">The relevant facts were summarized briefly in Commonwealth v. Matthews, 446 Pa. 65, 285 A.2d 510, 511 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-22\">From the evidence, the jury was warranted in finding that Matthews, on February 23, 1968, acting in concert with his nephew, James Williams, and a friend, James Jackson, robbed Randolph Butts in Philadelphia and during the perpetration of the robbery Butts was stabbed four times by one of the felons, causing injury which resulted in Butts\u2019 death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We begin our analysis with the Pennsylvania substantive law of voluntary manslaughter. For federal purposes we accept Justice Pomeroy\u2019s statement of the appropriate state law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">While it is considered felonious, voluntary manslaughter is the least culpable form of homicide included with a murder indictment. Thus, when considering the degree of culpability of an individual being tried under such an indictment, a jury may return a voluntary manslaughter verdict if it finds that the killing, although intentional, was committed without malice; that is, the accused may be shown to have been acting under the influence of sudden passion which was caused by legally adequate provocation that placed him beyond the control of reason.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] See e. g., Commonwealth v. Walters, 431 Pa. 74, 244 A.2d 757 (1968); Commonwealth v. Paese, 220 Pa. 371, 69 A. 891 (1908). These elements need not always be present, however, to support a voluntary manslaughter verdict. Pennsylvania courts have long accepted the common law rule that the jury has the power to find a defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter even in the absence of passion or provocation, where the evidence is sufficient to support a first or second degree murder verdict. Commonwealth v. Hoffman, 439 Pa. 348, 266 A.2d 726 (1970); Commonwealth v. Kellyon, 278 Pa. 59, 122 A. 166 (1923); Commonwealth v. Gable, 7 Serg. &amp; R. 423 (1821). Although superficially such a rule may seem incongruous, it does have a rational basis. In essence, the rationale of the rule is founded on two considerations: (1) the legal concept that voluntary manslaughter is by definition a lesser offense than murder but one included within a murder indictment, (2) a realistic appreciation of the fact that factors such as sympathy or extenuating .circumstances may lead a jury to find a defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter even though the evidence is enough to establish guilt of murder in the second or even the first degree. Commonwealth v. Hoffman, <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">Imposed upon this conceptual framework is a second rule. . That rule gives a trial judge complete discretion in deciding whether or not to submit voluntary manslaughter to the jury as a possible verdict in a case where there is no evidence of passion or provocation.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] See, e. g., Commonwealth v. LaRue, 381 Pa. 113, 112 A.2d 362 (1955); Commonwealth v. Yeager, 329 Pa. 81, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>196 A. 827 (1938). The reason for this rule is said to be that a charge on a point or issue which is unsupported by any evidence <em>\u201c </em>. . .is likely to confuse the jury and obstruct Justice.\u201d Commonwealth v. Pavillard, 421 Pa. 571, 220 A.2d 807 (1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aps-dedup-1\">Commonwealth v. Matthews, <em>supra, </em>285 A.2d at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The genesis of the federal constitutional problem is the anomaly that although the jury has unfettered power to return a voluntary manslaughter verdict as a lesser included offense of a murder indictment, it could not do so if the trial judge refused to charge on this point. Thus, whether the jury was given this opportunity was solely dependent upon the unrestricted discretion of the trial judge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Justice Pomeroy, speaking for himself and Justice Roberts, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4D\">In my view, the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment require the abandonment of the procedure now again sanctioned by the court. Due process is violated where a state procedure denies to those subject to it the fundamental fairness required in a system of ordered liberty. Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 169, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952). The procedure here, grounded as it is upon the exercise of absolute discretion by the trial judge, without the benefit of any objective standards to guide him, is patently arbitrary and unfair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_t\">Commonwealth v. Matthews, <em>supra, </em>285 A.2d at 518.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">The majority in <em>Matthews </em>did not meet the constitutional issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-14\">Appellant next asserts the trial court committed error in refusing a specific request to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter, and also in failing to submit to the jury such a finding as a possible verdict. Since there was no evidence which pointed in the slightest degree to the offense of manslaughter, the court\u2019s action did not constitute error. Commonwealth v. LaRue, 381 Pa. 113, 112 A.2d 362 (1955); and Commonwealth v. Flax, 331 Pa. 145, 200 A. 632 (1938).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">285 A.2d at 514.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Thus, to offset Justice Pomeroy\u2019s constitutional contentions we must turn to the argument presented by the Commonwealth. It builds first on Sparf v. United States, 156 U.S. 51, 15 S.Ct. 273, 39 L.Ed. 343 (1895), which approved a jury charge given in a trial for murder on the high seas, which charge instructed the jury that it was not authorized to return a verdict of manslaughter because there was no evidence showing that crime. The Court stated: \u201cA verdict of guilty of an offense less than the one charged would have been in flagrant disregard of all the proof, and in violation by the jury of their obligation to render a true verdict. There was an entire absence of evidence upon which to rest a verdict of guilty of manslaughter or simple assault. A verdict of that kind would have been the exercise by the jury of the power to commute the punishment for an offense actually committed, and thus impose a punishment different from that prescribed by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 15 S.Ct. at 278. Moreover, the Commonwealth directs us to Government of the Virgin Islands v. Carmona, 422 F.2d 95, 101 (3d Cir. 1970), in which we held \u201cthere was no error in failing to charge as to voluntary manslaughter in the circumstances of the instant ease. As there was no evidence of a quarrel or fit of passion, the jury could not have correctly found Carmona guilty of voluntary manslaughter,\u201d citing Stevenson v. United States, 162 U.S. 313, 315, 16 S.Ct. 839, 40 L.Ed. 980 (1896).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Next, the Commonwealth argues that notwithstanding these and other cases, courts have found it necessary to uphold a defendant\u2019s conviction of a lesser included offense where a trial judge erroneously submitted the offense to the jury. The underlying rationale of these latter cases is that the Constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> barred correction of the trial judge\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">But neither <em>Sparf </em>nor <em>Carmona </em>meets the Due Process argument properly presented in these federal habeas corpus proceedings. The Supreme Court in <em>Sparf </em>and this court in <em>Carmona </em>were confronted with issues of statutory construction only;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> neither discussed the Pennsylvania practice presently under review.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">The Commonwealth then emphasizes that \u201c[n]o court has held that because jury instructions not recognized by the law and overly favorable to one defendant were given at his trial, that thereafter every defendant is entitled to those same instructions.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Underlying this argument is the assumption that, in Pennsylvania, the jury could not properly return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter on a murder indictment absent evidence of passion or provoca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>tion. However the common law<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and Pennsylvania substantive law recognize the jury\u2019s \u201cpower,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> indeed \u201cprerogative,\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to return such a verdict if the court submits the issue to them. Moreover, in upholding such verdicts, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not relied on double jeopardy grounds but on the twofold consideration stated recently in Commonwealth v. Hoffman, <em>supra, 266 A.2d </em>at 732: \u201ca realistic appreciation of the humanity of those who sit on our juries, and the legal concept that voluntary manslaughter is by definition a lesser [included] offense than murder but one included in a murder indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Our research has not disclosed a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision which unequivocally held that, on an indictment for murder, it would be error for a trial judge to charge on voluntary manslaughter where there was no evidence of passion or provocation. The court has had numerous opportunities to do so <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but instead has framed its holding in terms of what a defendant has a right to expect or whether the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct was in error. These cases still leave the final decision on whether to charge within the discretion of the trial judge. We now proceed to a consideration of the Due Process argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">At a time when the contours of procedural due process were beginning to become visible, Mr. Justice Cardozo recognized the difficulty in establishing a universal definition of due process: \u201cThe line of division may seem to be wavering and broken if there is a hasty catalogue of the cases on the one side and the other. Reflection and analysis will induce a different view. There emerges the perception of a rationalizing principle which gives to discrete instances a proper order and coherence. * * * Does it violate those \u2018fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions\u2019?\" Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325, 328, 58 S.Ct. 149, 152, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Later Mr. Justice Frankfurter would emphasize that \u201c[r]egard for the requirements of the Due Process Clause \u2018inescapably imposes upon this Court an exercise of judgment upon the whole course of the proceedings [resulting in a conviction] in order to ascertain whether they offend those canons of decency and fairness which express the notions of justice of English-speaking peoples even toward those charged with the most heinous offenses.\u2019 \u201d Ro-chin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 169, 72 S.Ct. 205, 208, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">In the decades which have followed, the Supreme Court has not formulated a bright line definition. But, in discussing the right to a jury trial in a criminal case, the Court expressed this country\u2019s historic desire to minimize arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>trary judicial activity: \u201cThe framers of the Constitution strove to create an independent judiciary but insisted upon further protection against <em>arbitrary </em>action. Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the <em>complaint, biased, </em>or <em>eccentric judge. </em>* * * Beyond this, the jury trial provisions in the Federal and State Constitutions reflect a fundamental decision about the exercise of official <em>power </em>\u2014 a <em>reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the citizen to one judge </em>or to a group of judges.\u201d Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 156, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 1451, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">To recite these broad-base principles is to reinforce the conclusion reached by Pennsylvania Justices Roberts, Pomeroy and Manderino in Commonwealth v. Jones, <em>supra, </em>that the Pennsylvania practice did 'not comport with the protections extended this appellee by the Constitution. At the time he was tried, the jury was given the option of returning a verdict of murder in the first degree calling for life imprisonment or death,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> or alternatively, a verdict of murder in the second degree, calling for a sentence of up to twenty years. Another trial judge, or the same judge on another day, could have permitted the jury to return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter, calling for a sentence of no more than twelve years. To deny ap-pellee the possibility of a lesser verdict with a lesser restraint of liberty is permissible only if the denial comports with due process. To deny appellee the possibility of a lesser restraint of liberty because of a practice which permits arbitrary trial court activity is offensive to those settled concepts of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">The opinion in support of affirmance <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> in Commonwealth v. Davis, <em>supra, </em>297 A.2d at 821, essentially acknowledged the absence of standards prior to May 2, 1974: \u201c[T]he establishment of objective standards for application in all cases must await further development of our case law. . : .\u201d A lack of any standard to guide a decision which has the capability of restricting the liberty or property of a defendant would seem to offend settled concepts of due process. Thus, in invalidating a Pennsylvania practice which failed to furnish a criminal court jury with standards to guide a decision as to whether costs should be imposed upon a defendant in whose favor a not guilty verdict was rendered, the Supreme Court found the practice \u201cvague and standardless,\u201d and therefore offensive to due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-15\">It is established that a.law fails to meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause if it is so vague and standardless that it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits or leaves judges and jurors free to decide, without any legally fixed standards, what is prohibited and what is not in each particular case. See <em>e.g., </em>Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451 [59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888]; Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360 [, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377], This 1860 Pennsylvania Act contains no standards at all, nor does it place any conditions of any kind upon the jury\u2019s power to impose costs upon a defendant who has been found by the jury to be not guilty of the crime charged against him. * * * Certainly one of the basic purposes of the Due Process Clause has always been to protect a person against having the Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>ment impose burdens upon him except in accordance with the valid laws of the land. Implicit in this constitutional safeguard is the premise that the law must be one that carries an understandable meaning with legal standards that courts must enforce. This state Act as written does not even begin to meet this constitutional requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.S. 399, 402-403, 86 S.Ct. 518, 520, 15 L.Ed.2d 447 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">It is undisputed that there are no \u201clegal standards that courts must enforce\u201d in giving or not giving the manslaughter charge in a Pennsylvania murder indictment. Accordingly, we conclude that the powerful rationale of <em>Giaccio </em>commands a similar result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">We believe that the safeguards of due process will be satisfied only when all defendants in Pennsylvania murder trials are given the same opportunity, upon request duly made, to have a jury return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter as well as first and second degree murder.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To hold otherwise is to expose a defendant to the idiosyneracies of the trial judge to whom the case has been assigned, or the \u201cwhim or caprice\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> of a given judge on a given day. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>a</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The Commonwealth advances the argument that \u201c[i]f this Court should conclude that a valid constitutional issue is presented, it would be inappropriate to reverse Matthews\u2019 conviction.\u201d (Commonwealth brief at 6 n.l.) It reasons that this defendant has suffered no prejudice because the jury in fact returned a verdict of first degree and not second degree murder. Thus, the Commonwealth argues harmless error. This contention overlooks the possibility that if a jury had three options instead of two, the jury could have compromised on the middle ground of second degree. Although of course no one can say with precision that given three alternatives, the jury has a greater probability of compromise, we do recognize that with three alternatives, at least \u201cthere is a reasonable possibility\u201d of compromise. Schneble v. Florida, 405 U.S. 427, 432, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 31 L.Ed.2d 340 (1972).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Therefore, we cannot say that failure to give the charge \u201cwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Moreover, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has long recognized and approved the compromising propensities of juries. Commonwealth v. Kellyon, <em>supra, </em>122 A. at 168; Commonwealth v. Hoffman, <em>supra, </em>266 A.2d at 732. This recognition dilutes the potency of the harmless error argument advanced by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">Cognizant of the potential pervasive ramifications of the ruling we announce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>today, Judges Rosenn, Weis and the writer of this opinion are willing to consider the retroactivity issue. A majority of the court have concluded that the issue should not be resolved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968), the Court squarely decided the retroactivity issue when it announced its ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">We have considered the suggestion that we should \u201cgive prospective application only to any new constitutional ruling in this area.\u201d [We] have concluded that neither the reliance of law enforcement officials . . . nor the impact of a retroactive holding on the administration of justice warrants a decision against the fully retroactive application of the holding we announce today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">391 U.S. at 523 n. 22, 88 S.Ct. at 1777. And in its most recent pronouncement in the area of prisoners\u2019 rights, Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), the Court had the opportunity to defer ruling on the retroactivity of its newly announced procedures. It did not. Instead, the Court followed its lead in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 490, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), and decided the retro-activity issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">The Court of Appeals held that the due process requirements in prison disciplinary proceedings were to apply retroactively so as to require that prison records containing determinations of misconduct, not in accord with required procedures, be expunged. We disagree and reverse on this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\">The question of retroactivity of new procedural rules affecting inquiries into infractions of prison discipline is effectively foreclosed by this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Morrissey </em>that the due process requirements there announced were to be \u201capplicable to <em>future </em>revocations of parole,\u201d 408 U.S., at 490 [92 S.Ct. at 2604] (emphasis supplied). Despite the fact that procedures are related to the integrity of the fact-finding process, in the context of disciplinary proceedings, where less is generally at stake for an individual than at a criminal trial, great weight should be given to the significant impact a retroactivity ruling would have on the administration of all prisons in the country, and the reliance prison officials placed, in good faith, on prior law not requiring such procedures. During 1973, the Federal Government alone conducted 19,000 misconduct hearings, as compared with 1,173 parole revocation hearings, and 2,023 probation revocation hearings. If <em>Morrissey-Scarpelli </em>rules are not retroactive out of consideration for burden on federal and state officials, this case is <em>a fortiori. </em>We also note that a contrary holding would be very troublesome for the parole system since performance in prison is often a relevant criteria for parole. On the whole, we do not think that error was so pervasive in the system under the old procedures to warrant this cost or result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-15\">418 U.S. at 573, 94 S.Ct. at 2983. Thus, we find no precedential impediment to reaching the retroactivity issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-16\">In United States v. Zirpolo, 450 F.2d 424, 431-433 (3d Cir. 1971), we set forth in detail the basic teachings of the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Basically we observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b411-17\">In passing on the question of retroactivity, the Supreme Court considers three factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-18\">(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 297, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1970 [18 L.Ed.2d 1199] (1967); Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969); Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed. 2d 882 (1966); Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 86 S.Ct. 459, 15 L.Ed.2d 453 (1966); Linkletter v.

[the foregoing] factors is the purpose to be served by the new constitutional rule.\u201d Desist v. United States, <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 249, 89 S.Ct. at 1033 (footnote omitted). In United States v. Zirpolo, <em>supra, </em>we noted that \u201c[generally, rulings not primarily designed to enhance the reliability of the fact-finding or truth-determining process have not been applied retroactively,\u201d 450 F.2d at 432 and cases cited therein. We are dealing here only with those cases in which there is <em>no </em>evidence of passion or provocation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Therefore, our ruling does not go to the jury\u2019s ability to determine the presence <em>vel non </em>of the elements of the crime but rather to the jury\u2019s ability to exercise its \u201chistorically recognized mercy dispensing power.\u201d Commonwealth v. Jones, <em>supra, </em>319 A.2d at 149 (Nix, J.) Nothing we decide today affects the fact-finding process. We also recognize with Mr. Justice Brennan that \u201c \u2018the question whether a constitutional rule of criminal procedure does or does not enhance the reliability of the fact-finding process at trial is necessarily a matter of degree.\u2019 Johnson v. New Jersey . . .

Denno, <em>supra, </em>388 U.S. at 298, 87 S.Ct. at 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">The significant extent to which the Pennsylvania trial courts relied on the prior state of the law is obvious. <em>See </em>Commonwealth v. Matthews, <em>supra; </em>Commonwealth v. LaRue, <em>supra; </em>and Commonwealth v. Pavillard, <em>supra. </em>The decision we reach today was not foreshadowed by prior cases. Stovall v. Denno, <em>supra, </em>388 U.S. at 299, 87 S.Ct. 1967. And we recognize that the application of full retroactivity could have a profound effect on the administration of criminal justice in Pennsylvania. The Supreme Court has relied on this factor in denying full retroactivity: United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), and Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967) (line-up cases) held non-retroactive in Stovall v. Denno, <em>supra; </em>McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969) (on the correct procedure for acceptance of guilty plea) denied retroactive application in Halliday v. United States, 394 U.S. 831, 89 S.Ct. 1498, 23 L.Ed.2d 16 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">All three considerations indicate that full retroactivity should not be accorded this decision.

In an equally divided court three justices (Roberts, Pomeroy and Man-derino) rested the decision on constitutional grounds. Three (Nix, Eagen and O\u2019Brien) relied on an exercise of the court\u2019s supervisory power: \u201cWe therefore, under our supervisory power, rule that henceforth a defendant under indictment of murder will be entitled, <em>upon request, </em>to have the jury advised of its power to return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.\u201d Commonwealth v.

The difference in culpability between first or second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter is reflected in the punishments which accompanied conviction of these respective offenses at the time of this offense. A conviction for first degree murder carried with it death or life imprisonment. Sanctions that were imposed upon one found guilty of second degree murder included imprisonment for a term not exceeding twenty years and a fine of up to ten thousand dollars.

Berrigan, 482 F.2d 171, 175 (3d Cir. 1973). Fundamental to the judicial system is the principle that it is the court, and not the jury, which defines the legal elements of the offense and limits the alternatives open to the jury in returning a verdict. As Justice Cohen stated in his dissent in Commonwealth v. Pavillard, <em>supra, </em>220 A.2d at 811:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">How is a jury able to exercise its power [to return a verdict of guilty of manslaughter] when it is never advised that it has such power?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\">. In Commonwealth v. Davis, <em>supra, </em>297 A.2d at 819, Justice Pomeroy again argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">[B]ecause the choice whether or not to charge is discretionary with the trial judge, and he has been furnished with no objective standards for his guidance, the challenged practice offends due process.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b406-11\">. The opinion in support of affirmance in Commonwealth v. Jones, <em>supra, </em>319 A.2d at 149, answered the due process contention thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-17\">The opinion in support of reversal predicates its constitutional objections on the assumption that under the rule existing at the time of this trial \u201cthe choice whether or not to charge [on voluntary manslaughter] is discretionary with the trial judge, and he has been furnished with no objective standards for his guidance.\u201d We cannot accept the assumption upon which these arguments are premised. The rule in question was based upon a theory of lesser included' offenses. For this purpose, manslaughter was defined in the traditional sense. Thus, it was reasoned that the right to the charge existed <em>only </em>where evidence of provocation and passion could be found. Necessarily, where there was an absence of provocation and passion there was no right to such a charge. <em>Cf., </em>Keeble v. United States, 412 U.S. 205 [93 S.Ct. 1993, 36 L.Ed.2d 844] (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-j\">This statement, however, defines the defendant\u2019s <em>right </em>to a charge on voluntary manslaughter, while still leaving to the trial judge the ultimate decision on whether such a charge should be given.

However, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has just recently ordained that, upon request, every murder defendant in the Commonwealth is entitled to a voluntary manslaughter instruction, whether in felony murder or general murder trials.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although that ruling is, by its terms, made prospective only, it indicates that Pennsylvania has abandoned whatever stake it may have had in the rule of criminal procedure that a defendant is not entitled to such an instruction absent evidence of passion or provocation. Thus, the effect worked upon Pennsylvania\u2019s criminal justice system by the Court\u2019s ruling today is not seriously at odds with Pennsylvania\u2019s own perception of its interests. In these circumstances, we generate no undue friction, or at least a minimum of exacerbation, between a state and the federal system by holding the former Pennsylvania practice unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"AHM\">I agree with the majority that the lack of any articulable criteria for the giving or withholding of a manslaughter instruction where there was no evidence of passion or provocation made for stand-ardless, <em>\u201cad hoc </em>and episodic\u201d justice,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and as such constituted a violation of due process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It would seem unwise, however, simply to accept a statement from a dissenting opinion in Commonwealth v. Matthews <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as a conclusive exposition of prior Pennsylvania practice. Rather, in my judgment, we are bound to survey all the Pennsylvania Supreme Court opinions on the subject, and to determine from them what appears to have been the Pennsylvania rule or practice. Having undertaken such an examination, I am satisfied that, in the past, trial judges in Pennsylvania had discretion to give or withhold a manslaughter instruction where no evidence of passion or provocation had been adduced. In no case that has come to my attention did the giving or withholding of the instruction lead to a reversal, or even to critical comment by the reviewing tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"aa6-dedup-0\">The dissent has pointed out that Matthews was found guilty of felony murder, as distinguished from a general murder charge, and that, whatever the situation regarding general murder, a judge under Pennsylvania law is \u201cjustified in refusing to charge upon the law of manslaughter\u201d in a felony murder prosecution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This view is grounded in the recognition that it is not logical to speak of \u201cpassion or provocation\u201d when felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>murder is involved.\u00ae Although there are cases which hold that a defendant is not entitled to a manslaughter charge when there is no evidence of passion or provocation in the record, no case has been called to my attention that has <em>mandated </em>the withholding of a manslaughter charge in a felony murder case, and, indeed, there appears to be some indication that manslaughter charges have been given, from time to time, when there has been no evidence of passion or provocation. It is apparent, therefore, that state trial judges were without standards, supplied either by the legislature or by the appellate courts, to guide them in the giving or withholding of voluntary manslaughter instructions, not only in cases of general murder but in felony murder cases as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Moreover, there is no indication that Pennsylvania trial judges, themselves, felt constrained by any standards in the giving or withholding of such an instruction, whether in general murder or felony murder cases. A review of state decisions would appear to disclose that while some juries were given the instruction, others were not,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and no explanation for giving or withholding such an instruction was required. Thus, besides fostering the potential for prejudice and arbitrariness, the prior Pennsylvania practice appears actually to have resulted in unexplicated discrimination among murder defendants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Nor can this discrimination be deemed harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, since there is no way of ascertaining how the jury in this case would have responded had it been given a manslaughter instruction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ani-dedup-0\">.

Matthews, 446 Pa. 65, 285 A.2d 510 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The majority, despite its acknowledgement that counsel for Matthews conceded at oral argument of this appeal that no evidence was adduced at the murder trial bearing on voluntary manslaughter, nevertheless holds that Matthews was denied due process when the trial judge refused for that reason to grant Matthews\u2019 request for a voluntary manslaughter instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The majority has presented three grounds for its holding that Matthews was denied his Fourteenth Amendment due process guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Stated in the order of their discussion in the majority opinion, they are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">(1) \u201c[I]n a prosecution on a murder indictment, the Fourteenth Amendment <em>requires the trial court, upon request, to give the jury the option of returning a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">(2) The Fourteenth Amendment is violated when a voluntary manslaughter instruction is denied for lack of evidentiary basis <em>because \u201calthough the jury has unfettered power to return a voluntary manslaughter verdict </em>as a lesser included offense of a murder indictment, <em>it could not do so if the trial judge refused to charge on this point.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">(3) The Fourteenth Amendment is violated when a request for a volun-tax-y manslaughter instruction is denied on the ground that it lacks evi-dentiary basis, <em>because </em>Pennsylvania judges have at times given the instruction in the absence of evidence calling for such instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that Matthews was denied due process and its stated grounds for that holding for these reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\"><em>First, </em>as to the majority\u2019s point that \u201cin a prosecution on a murder indictment, <em>the Fourteenth Amendment requires the trial court, upon request, to give the jury the option of returning a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">The sum of that point is that due process \u201crequires\u201d a voluntary manslaughter instruction in a murder trial even though there is <em>no </em>evidentiary basis for such an instruction, viz., evidence of passion and provocation \u2014 critical ingredients of the crime of voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">The majority has not cited any case, federal or state, in support of the stated point, for the very good reason that there is none.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">To the contrary, it was expressly ruled in Sparf v. United States, 156 U.S. 51, 15 S.Ct. 273, 39 L.Ed. 343 (1895), that the murder trial judge there did <em>not err </em>when he (1) refused \u201cupon request\u201d to give a voluntary manslaughter instruction because of lack of evidentiary basis for such instruction; and (2) instructed the jury that it could not properly return a voluntary manslaughter verdict in the absence of evidence establishing commission of that crime. 156 U.S. at 103, 15 S.Ct. 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">In Bird v. United States, 187 U.S. 118, 132, 23 S.Ct. 42, 47, 47 L.Ed. 100 (1902), it was explicitly held that the murder trial judge \u201crightly refused\u201d a requested instruction defining principal and accessox-y, \u201cbecause there were no facts in the case to justify it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">The vitality of the holding in <em>Sparf </em>that a trial judge is <em>not </em>required, \u201cupon request\u201d to grant an instruction lacking evidentiary basis is attested to by its recent citation and application in other contexts. Keeble v. United States, 412 U.S. 205, 208, 93 S.Ct. 1993, 36 L.Ed.2d 844 (1973); Sansone v.

Government of the Virgin Islands v. Car-mona, 422 F.2d 95, 191 (3d Cir. 1970). It may be noted parenthetically that <em>Car-mona </em>was cited by <em>Keeble </em>as being in accord with its holding. 412 U.S. at 208 n.7, 93 S.Ct. 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, too, has consistently held that a murder trial judge does not err when he fails or refuses, to give a voluntary manslaughter instruction where there is no evidence to support such an instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">The majority makes short shrift of <em>Sparf </em>and <em>Carmona </em>on the ground that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court in <em>Sparf </em>and this court in <em>Carmona </em>were confronted with issues of statutory construction <em>only; </em>neither discussed the Pennsylvania practice presently under review.\u201d (footnotes omitted) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">The plain fact is that neither <em>Sparf </em>nor <em>Carmona </em>turned on an issue of \u201cstatutory construction\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that in both the deciding courts perceived no due process issue in the trial judge\u2019s failure, or refusal, to give a voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>manslaughter instruction in the absence of an evidentiary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">It may be noted parenthetically that the federal and Pennsylvania doctrine that a trial judge is not required to give a voluntary manslaughter instruction unless the evidence calls for such instruction, is in accord with the prevailing general rule. 40 Am.Jur.2d \u00a7 485, at 737 (1968), set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> What has been said brings us to the majority\u2019s point that the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when a voluntary manslaughter instruction is denied for lack of evidentiary basis because <em>\u201calthough the jury has unfettered power to return a voluntary manslaughter verdict </em>as a lesser included offense of a murder indictment, <em>it could not do so if the trial judge refused to charge on this point.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The majority\u2019s statement that a jury <em>\u201ccould not\u201d </em>return a voluntary manslaughter verdict <em>\u201cif the trial judge refused to charge on this point\u201d </em>is difficult to understand in light of its correct statement that a jury <em>\u201chas unfettered power to return a voluntary manslaughter verdict as a lesser included offense of a murder indictment.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The majority has not cited a single Pennsylvania case in support of its statement that a jury \u201ccould not\u201d return a voluntary manslaughter verdict \u201cif the trial judge refused to charge on this point.\u201d The eases it discusses on the score of that statement afford it no nourishment whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">To the contrary, it was recently explicitly held in Commonwealth v. Cannon, 453 Pa. 389, 309 A.2d 384 (1973) that a jury <em>\u201ccan\u201d return a voluntary manslaughter verdict </em>on a murder indictment <em>even though the trial judge refused a request for a voluntary manslaughter instruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">In <em>Cannon </em>the defendant was convicted of first degree murder. He contended on his appeal that the trial judge erred in refusing his request for a voluntary manslaughter instruction for lack of evidentiary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">In affirming the refusal of the requested instruction the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-15\">\u201cWhere a defendant is indicted for murder, <em>he can of course be convicted of manslaughter. </em>See Commonwealth v. Dennis, 433 Pa. 525, 252 A.2d 671 (1969). But where there is no evidence of the elements of manslaughter, it is not error for the trial judge to refuse to submit manslaughter as a possible verdict. [citing cases]. Without evidence of a sufficient cause for provocation, a state of rage or passion and an inadequate time to cool, the trial court is justified in denying the request for a manslaughter instruction.\u201d 453 Pa. at 396-397, 309 A.2d at 389. (footnote omitted) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">It may be noted parenthetically that Mr. Justice Roberts, in dissenting in <em>Cannon </em>on the ground that the trial judge erred in refusing the defendant\u2019s request for a voluntary manslaughter instruction, cited <em>\u201cthe salutary and well-settled rule\u201d </em>that <em>\u201cthe jury may find the accused guilty of the less offense </em>[voluntary manslaughter] . . . <em>and a conviction . . . will be sustained.\u201d </em>453 Pa. 399, 309 A.2d at 390. (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-19\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has in recent years, time and again, affirmed a jury\u2019s absolute \u201cprerogative\u201d to return a voluntary manslaughter verdict where there is evidence to support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>conviction for murder even though there is no proof justifying the voluntary manslaughter verdict. Commonwealth v. Butcher, 451 Pa. 359, 364-365, 304 A.2d 150 (1973); Commonwealth v. Hoffman, 439 Pa. 348, 356-357, 266 A.2d 726, 731 (1970).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">In <em>Butcher </em>and <em>Hoffman, </em>the defendants were found guilty of voluntary manslaughter on indictments charging them with murder. In both cases defendants challenged their conviction on the ground that there was no evidence of passion and provocation, the critical ingredients of the crime of voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In rejecting that contention, the court in <em>Butcher </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">\u201cAppellant\u2019s last argument is that a verdict of voluntary manslaughter should not be permitted when the evidence does not support such a verdict. However, this Court has consistently held that <em>a jury may in a murder prosecution return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter even where there is no evidence of passion or provocation. </em>As stated in Commonwealth v. Hoffman, 439 Pa. 348, 356-357, 266 A.2d 726, 731 (1970): \u2018Few propositions are better established in the criminal law than the doctrine that where the evidence would be sufficient to support a conviction of murder, <em>the return of a verdict of voluntary manslaughter is strictly within the jury\u2019s prerogative </em>even in the absence of provocation and passion.\u2019 \u201d 451 Pa. at 364, 304 A.2d at 153. (emphasis supplied) .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The \u201cpower\u201d of a jury in a murder case to convict of a lesser offense or to acquit in disregard of the evidence was succinctly epitomized, almost a century ago, in McMeen v. Commonwealth, 114 Pa. 300, 9 A. 878 (1886), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">\u201cIt is true the jury have the <em>power </em>even in cases of murder by poison <em>to convict of a lesser grade of crime. </em>So they have the <em>power </em>in such cases <em>to acquit altogether in the face of the clearest evidence.\u201d </em>114 Pa. at 305-306, 9 A. at 879. (emphasis supplied) .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">Coming now to the majority\u2019s point that the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when a request for a voluntary manslaughter instruction is denied on the ground that it lacks evidentiary basis, <em>because </em>Pennsylvania judges have at times given the instruction in the absence of evidence calling for such instruction :</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">The sum of the majority\u2019s position is that while a murder trial judge does not err when he denies a voluntary manslaughter instruction for lack of eviden-tiary basis, the circumstance that judges have at times given the instruction in the absence of evidentiary basis, demonstrates that <em>\u201cthere are no \u2018legal standards that courts must enforce\u2019 in giving or not giving the manslaughter charge in a Pennsylvania murder indictment,\u201d </em>and consequently the refusal of the instruction must be held to be a violation of due process under <em>\u201cthe powerful rationale\u201d </em>of Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.S. 399, 86 S.Ct. 518, 15 L.Ed.2d 447 (1966) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s stated position for these reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\"><em>First, </em>we are here concerned with a felony-murder \u2014 a homicide committed in the perpetration of a robbery,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, a half-century ago, announced the \u201clegal standard\u201d that in the commission of such a homicide evidence of existence of passion and provocation \u2014 critical ingredients of voluntary manslaughter \u2014 is of no relevance. Commonwealth v. Males-kie, 278 Pa. 387, 123 A. 310 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\"><em>Second, </em>and independently so, a defendant in a murder trial felony or otherwise, is <em>not </em>denied due process when he is correctly refused a voluntary manslaughter instruction for lack of eviden-tiary basis simply because <em>in some instances </em>judges have <em>incorrectly </em>given the instruction in the absence of eviden-tiary basis. Otherwise stated, a murder trial defendant is not deprived of due process when he is refused an instruction to which he is not entitled by law just because a similarly situated defendant has been <em>incorrectly </em>accorded an instruction to which he is not entitled by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\"><em>Third, </em>Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, <em>supra, </em>is inapposite on its facts and does not point to the result reached by the majority nor afford it an iota of support.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Elaboration of my foregoing views must be prefaced by these observations:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The majority\u2019s denial of due process holding, insofar as it is premised on its \u201cno legal standards\u201d theory, echoes and adopts the view of Mr. Justice Pomeroy in his dissent to the affirmance of Matthew\u2019s conviction by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and in his subsequent dissent to the affirmance of the defendant\u2019s murder conviction in Commonwealth v. Davis, 449 Pa. 468, 479-480 (1972).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">It must immediately be noted than an application for <em>certiorari </em>was denied in the <em>Davis </em>case, <em>sub nom. </em>Davis v. Commonwealth, 414 U.S. 836, 94 S.Ct. 183, 38 L.Ed.2d 72 (1973). The application, in its \u201cReasons for Granting the Writ,\u201d urged almost <em>verbatim </em>the reasoning of Justice Pomeroy\u2019s dissent in <em>Davis </em>(and <em>Matthews) </em>to which the majority here subscribes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It also invoked Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952) and Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, <em>supra, </em>here relied on by the majority. Moreover, it cited the subscription of the district court in the instant case to the Pomeroy position.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">It cannot be gainsaid that while the denial of certiorari in Commonwealth v. Davis, <em>supra, </em>is not here of dispositive dimension it <em>is </em>nevertheless of illuminating significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">What has been said brings me to a <em>se-riatim </em>discussion of my earlier stated three reasons for my disagreement with the \u201cno legal standards that courts must enforce\u201d phase of the majority\u2019s denial of due process holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">The first of these reasons is that we are here concerned with a felony-murder \u2014a homicide committed in the perpetration of a robbery, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, a half century ago, <em>did </em>announce the <em>\u201clegal </em>standard\u201d that in the commission of such a homicide evidence of passion and provocation \u2014 the ingredients of voluntary manslaughter \u2014is of no relevance. Commonwealth v. Meleskie, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">In <em>Meleskie, </em>the defendant killed a woman he was attempting to rape. He was tried and convicted of felony murder in the first degree after the trial judge instructed the jury that there was no evidence of manslaughter in the case. He contended on his appeal that the trial judge erred in his instruction in light of the testimony that after the defendant had thrown the murder victim to the floor in his rape attempt \u201c \u2018she hit him in the face . . . she bit his finger, and <em>then he got mad </em>and . . . shot [her] two times and shot himself once.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-17\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention and affirmed his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-18\">In doing so it said at pages 386 and 387 of 278 Pa., at pages 311 of 123 A.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-19\">Barbarous indeed would be a law permitting the plea of provocation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>hot blood to a man who, when attempting rape, flies into a frenzy and kills his victim because she forcibly defends herself against his criminal purposes; but no such rule exists in our criminal jurisprudence. This grave offense would not be mitigated because, at the time of the killing, defendant\u2019s wrath was kindled by the forcible endeavors of his victim to protect herself, and, under the circumstances, the trial judge was justified in refusing to charge upon the law of manslaughter: Com. v. Spardute, 278 Pa. 37 [122A. 161].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\"><em>Meleskie </em>was cited and followed in 1972 in Commonwealth v. Davis, <em>supra. </em>There the defendant was found guilty of murder in the first degree in the killing of a nine-year old girl in an attempt to commit rape or sodomy, after the trial judge had refused to give a voluntary manslaughter instruction and instead instructed the jury that it could <em>not </em>consider manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In doing so the trial judge told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">\u201cNormally, when the charge is murder, the jury may also consider the charge of voluntary manslaughter. <em>However, I instruct you as a matter of law in this case that manslaughter could not be considered. It would not be, under the facts in this case, an appropriate verdict. So, therefore, I instruct you to confine your consideration to the charge of murder in the first degree, or the charge of murder in the second degree, or not guilty. You have three possibilities.\u201d </em>449 Pa. at 473, 297 A.2d at 821. (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The defendant in <em>Davis </em>contended on his appeal that the trial judge erred in his binding instructions to the jury that \u201cmanslaughter could not be considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">The Supreme Court, by a four to three vote, rejected the defendant\u2019s contention and, citing <em>Meleskie, </em>affirmed on the ground that the defense of manslaughter is unavailable to a defendant in a felony-murder trial, viz., homicide in an attempt to commit the felonies of rape or sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">In doing so the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-12\">\u201cAlthough the establishment of objective standards for application in all cases must await the further development of our case law, we believe that the instant case presents an excellent example of that type of case where <em>it is perfectly proper for a trial judge to eliminate completely the jury\u2019s consideration of the possibility of a voluntary manslaughter verdict. </em>This is not a case where the court may be arrogating to itself the jury\u2019s fact-finding function by telling the jury that it believes there is no evidence of passion and provocation such as would reduce a murder to manslaughter. <em>Nor </em>is this a case where a defendant may be penalized because he completely denied an intentional killing rather than claim mitigating circumstances surrounded it. <em>Instead, it is a case where any evidence of passion or provocation would be irrelevant. The record clearly shows that whoever committed this murder did so pursuant to an attempt to commit rape or sodomy on the victim. Since rape is one of the enumerated felonies, a homicide committed in the perpetration of this crime is a first-degree murder. </em>Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, \u00a7 701, as amended December 1, 1959, P.L. 1621, \u00a7 1, 18 P.S. \u00a7 4701. <em>The malice necessary to make a homicide murder is implied from the presence of the intent to commit the felony. The presence of passion or provocation cannot negate this malice. The fact that, at the time the killing was committed, the rapist may have been in a state of passion, perhaps out of rage at his victim\u2019s resistance or fear that his felony would be discovered, would make no difference. </em>If he had the culpability to commit the rape, then when he killed in the furtherance of that felony, he is deemed to have killed with malice. See - Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>wealth v. Meleskie, 278 Pa. 383, 123 A. 310 (1924).\u201d 449 Pa. at 475, 297 A.2d at 821. (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The majority has failed to take into account that we are here concerned with a felony-murder and sequentially overlooked the existence of the settled Pennsylvania \u201clegal standard\u201d pertaining to the non-availability of a voluntary manslaughter defense in a felony-murder trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Standing alone, and independently so, a defendant in a murder trial, felony or otherwise, is not denied due process when he is refused a voluntary manslaughter instruction to which he is not entitled under the evidence simply because defendants in other murder trials have been accorded a voluntary manslaughter instruction in the absence of any evidentiary basis for such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The Pennsylvania courts, in murder cases aside from those within the felony-murder category, have consistently held that <em>both </em>\u201c \u2018sufficient cause of provocation and a state of rage or passion, without time to cool\u2019 \u201d must be established by the evidence in order to sustain a voluntary manslaughter charge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">As earlier stated, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has repeatedly specifically held that the failure or refusal to charge on voluntary manslaughter in non-felony murder cases is not error where there is no evidence to support a voluntary manslaughter verdict.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The majority holds that albeit the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has consistently ruled that failure or refusal to charge on voluntary manslaughter in the absence of evidentiary basis, it has <em>not </em>\u201cunequivocally held that ... it would be error for a trial judge to charge on voluntary manslaughter where there was no evidence of passion or provocation,\u201d and it therefore follows that \u201cthe final decision on whether to charge [is] within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">The ready answer to the majority\u2019s reasoning is that errors favorable to a defendant are considered harmless and are therefore disregarded on appeal. Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391, 396-397, 77 S.Ct. 963, 1 L.Ed.2d 931 n. 9 (1957).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">The majority has not cited <em>any </em>case in any jurisdiction in which an appellate court has reversed a conviction because the defendant was given a favorable instruction not justified by the evidence. Nor has the majority cited <em>any </em>holding by an appellate court that due process is violated where defendant is properly denied an instruction for lack of eviden-tiary basis just because another defendant has been accorded a favorable instruction to which he was not entitled under the evidence. The district court\u2019s holding in the instant case is without precedent at either the trial or appellate level.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-17\">Coming now to my view that Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, <em>supra, </em>is inapposite on its facts and does not point to the result reached by the majority nor afford it any support:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-18\">In <em>Giaccio, </em>a jury acquitted the appellant on a misdemeanor indictment but assessed \u201ccosts\u201d against him under a Pennsylvania statute permitting jurors to \u201cdetermine by their verdict, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>the [acquitted] defendant shall pay the costs,\u201d and providing for his commitment to jail in default of payment or security. The jury had been instructed that it could impose the costs on appellant even though it acquitted him if it found him guilty of \u201csome misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AQa\">The Court held that the statute was unconstitutional under the due process clause <em>\u201cbecause of vagueness and the absence of any standards </em>sufficient to enable defendants to protect themselves against arbitrary and discriminatory impositions of costs.\u201d In so holding the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">\u201cThis 1860 Pennsylvania Act <em>contains no standards at all, nor does it place any conditions of any kind upon the jury\u2019s power to impose costs upon a defendant </em>who has been found by the jury to be not guilty of a crime charged against him.\u201d 382 U.S. at 402-403, 86 S.Ct. at 521.

California, 402 U.S. 183, 207 n. 18, 91 S.Ct. 1454, 28 L.Ed.2d 711 (1971), where the court cautioned against <em>federal ex cathedra </em>imposition of standards in the conduct of state murder trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">In so doing it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">\u201cOur function is not to impose on the States, <em>ex cathedra, </em>what might seem to us a better system for dealing with capital cases. Rather, it is to decide whether the Federal Constitution proscribes the present procedures of these two States in such cases.\u201d 402 U.S. at 195-196, 91 S.Ct. at 1461.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\">\u201c[T]he Federal Constitution, which marks the limits of our authority in these cases, does not guarantee trial procedures that are the best of all worlds, or that accord with the most enlightened ideas of students of the infant science of criminology, or <em>even those that measure up to the individual predilections of members of this Court.\u201d </em>402 U.S. at 221, 91 S.Ct. at 1474.

Commonwealth, 414 U.S. 836, 94 S.Ct. 183, 38 L.Ed.2d 72 (1973), parallels the reasoning of the majority and Judge Adams in his concurring opinion, as evidenced by the following statements in the <em>Davis </em>\u201cReasons\u201d :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">\u201cHighlighting the arbitrary and unequal application of the law to defendants charged with the crime of murder is the fact that some trial courts in Pennsylvania <em>always </em>give a charge on voluntary manslaughter, whether requested or not, and regardless of whether a factual basis for such a finding exists while other trial courts <em>never </em>give a charge on voluntary manslaughter, even when so requested, unless a factual basis for such a charge exists. See dissenting opinion in Commonwealth v. Kenney, 449 Pa. 562 [297 A.2d 794] (1972).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">\u201cBecause the choice whether or not to charge is discretionary with the trial judge, and he has been furnished with no objective standards for his guidance, the existing state of Pennsylvania law offends due process; and because the practice denies the same treatment to similarly situated defendants who happen to stand before differently disposed judges, it violates the equal protection of the laws. In allowing the trial judge complete discretion in deciding whether or not to submit voluntary manslaughter to the jury as a possible verdict in a case where there is no evidence of passion or provocation with absolutely no standards to guide him and no safeguards to militate against the exercise of whim or caprice, there is sanctioned by the court a procedure which violates due process in denying to those subject to it the fundamental fairness required in a system of ordered liberty.

The court is not bound, and should not be bound, to instruct the jury respecting the abstract rules of the law for homicide, but only respecting the principles applicable to the evidence of killing in the case at bar, although the giving of an abstract instruction is a cause for reversal only when it is reasonably apparent that the jury has been misled.\u201d (footnotes omitted) .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\">.
