WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"Anz\">Van Hoomissen sued Xerox, his former employer, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)], alleging that Xerox fired him and engaged in other acts of retaliation because of his efforts to recruit minorities. The Equal Opportunity Commission sought leave to intervene under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b). In its proposed complaint in intervention, EEOC alleged that Xerox both engaged in discriminatory hiring practices and had unlawfully retaliated against Van Hoomissen. The district court granted EEOC leave to intervene, limited to the issue of retaliation, EEOC appealed, claiming that it should have been permitted to challenge Xerox\u2019s alleged discriminatory hiring practices in its complaint in intervention. We dismissed the appeal in Van Hoomissen v. Xerox Corp., 497 F.2d 180 (9th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-9\">Xerox now petitions this court, pursuant to \u00a7 706(k) of the Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k)], for an award of attorney\u2019s fees as part of its costs on appeal. Section 706(k) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-10\">In any action or proceeding under this subehapter the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the Commission or the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs, and the Commission and the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-11\">On its face, this section authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the Commission. The word \u201ccosts\u201d is used twice. In its first occurrence, it is clear that it includes attorney\u2019s fees, since the latter is explicitly denominated \u201ca part of the costs.\u201d In the second reference, \u201ccosts\u201d are assessable against the Commission. Unless the meaning of \u201ccosts\u201d changes during the eleven words which separate its two usages, it is clear that attorney\u2019s fees can be assessed against the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-12\"> The Commission makes an ingenious and indeed persuasive argument, based on the legislative history of the section, that Congress did not intend the second occurrence of \u201ccosts\u201d to include attorney\u2019s fees even though it did intend attorney\u2019s fees be included in the first provision for \u201ccosts.\u201d The Commission starts with the generally accepted premise that the government is exempt from liability for costs and attorney\u2019s fees except as specifically and unequivocally authorized by Congress. <em>See </em>United States v. Chemical Foundation, 272 U.S. 1, 20, 47 S.Ct. 1, 71 L.Ed. 131 (1926); Georg Jensen, Inc. v. United States, 185 F.Supp. 251, 253 (S.D.N.Y.1960); Aycrigg v. United States, 124 F.Supp. 416, 417-418 (N.D.Cal.1954); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (1970); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(a) (1964). The Commission also points out that the term \u201ccosts\u201d has a well defined technical meaning that does not normally include attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See, e. g., </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1920, 1923; Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Goldwyn, 328 F.2d 190, 222-224 (9th Cir. 1964). Thus, the Commission would have us decline to deviate from this technical meaning in the interpretation of the second reference to \u201ccosts\u201d since attorney\u2019s fees are not specifically and explicitly included.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-14\">The legislative history of Section 706 (k) supports the Commission\u2019s contention that Congress did not necessarily intend \u201ccosts\u201d to have the same meaning each time it was used. Without belaboring the analysis, the legislative history indicates that the portion of Section 706(k) dealing with attorney\u2019s fees was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>added after the portion authorizing' \u201ccosts\u201d against the government had been drafted. <em>See </em>110 Cong.Rec. 12819 (1964). Thus, it can be persuasively-argued that the drafters of the provision dealing with \u201ccosts\u201d assessed against the Commission were referring ,to the normal meaning of \u201ccosts,\u201d not to the special meaning of \u201ccosts\u201d including attorney\u2019s fees that was later used when the provision dealing with attorney\u2019s fees was added. The argument is strengthened by the fact that the Commission cannot recover attorney\u2019s fees: Congress might not, therefore, have intended the Commission to be liable for such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">As useful as legislative history is as an aid to statutory construction, however, it should not be used to torture the plain meaning of the words of the statute as finally enacted. Whatever the subjective intent of the drafters, which is far from clear, we are not persuaded that under these circumstances proper statutory construction calls for a change in the meaning of a technical word over the bare space of eleven intervening words. As Justice Frankfurter stated in Greenwood v. United States, 350 U.S. 366, 374, 76 S.Ct. 410, 415, 190 L.Ed. 412 (1956):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0s\">[T]his is a case for applying the canon of construction of the wag who said, when the legislative history is doubtful, go to the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">We conclude that the plain meaning of Section 706 (k) authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the Commission. <em>See </em>United States v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 316 F.Supp. 567, 623 (M.D.Fla. 1970), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 451 F.2d 418 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied 406 U.S. 906, 92 S.Ct. 1607, 31 L.Ed.2d 815 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">Having concluded that we have the power under \u00a7 706 (k) to assess attorney\u2019s fees against the Commission, we must decide whether to exercise our discretion to do so. The Commission argues that the attorney\u2019s fees provision of \u00a7 706 (k) was designed to encourage private enforcement of the Act and to remove financial obstacles from the path of private litigants of limited means who could not otherwise afford to pursue their rights. <em>See </em>110 Cong.Rec. 12724 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Humphrey). Although this is a factor to consider in exercising our discretion, we do not conclude that Xerox\u2019s ability to pay its own way is necessarily a bar to an award in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">The Commission also argues that Section 706 (k) authorizes an award only to the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Although Xerox \u201cprevailed\u201d on this interlocutory appeal, it might still lose the principal case and thus not \u201cprevail.\u201d We agree that litigation should not be dissected to the point that the losing party be permitted to recover attorney\u2019s fees connected with every procedural motion on which it prevails. But this interlocutory appeal is sufficiently significant and discrete to be treated as a separate unit. Thus, the fact that Xerox prevailed on this appeal qualifies it as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d eligible for an award of attorney\u2019s fees connected with the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-10\">Having considered all the circumstances of the case, we exercise our discretion and award Xerox an attorney\u2019s fee of $3,000.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
