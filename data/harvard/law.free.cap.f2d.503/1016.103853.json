Freeman, an inmate of the Cummins Unit of the Arkansas Department of Correction, appeals from the dismissal of his complaint, brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the Superintendent and the prison physician, alleging that defendants had denied him ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>quate medical care. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> addressed an inquiry to the prison and thereafter, upon being informed that Freeman would be receiving treatment in the infirmary, dismissed the complaint without prejudice. In a subsequent petition for rehearing, Freeman revised his contentions to assert permanent injury to his eyes. The district court, while observing that the complaint was one for money damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, found nothing additional in the petition for rehearing and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">Viewed in the light most favorable to Petitioner, Remmers v. Brewer, 475 F.2d 52 (8th Cir. 1973); <em>see </em>Jenkins v. Mc-Keithen, 395 U.S. 411, 89 S.Ct. 1843, 23 L.Ed.2d 404 (1969), the factual allegations are as follows: In 1969, Freeman was placed in special confinement with a man who was known by the prison officials to have tuberculosis. Shortly thereafter Freeman contracted the disease. It was treated medicinally. After an eye examination in 1973, the prison optometrist determined that the tuberculosis had settled in Freeman\u2019s eyes and constituted a hazard to his vision. The optometrist suggested that surgery might correct the problem. Freeman made repeated attempts to see the prison physician in order to follow-up on the optometrist\u2019s advice, but was denied access to the physician by the prison paramedic, who gave Freeman eye drops. Freeman now contends that his vision has been permanently impaired and seeks monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\"> As a general rule, \u201callegations of mere negligence in the treatment of a prisoner\u2019s condition or claims based on differences of opinion over matters of medical judgment fail to state a federal constitutional question.\u201d Jones v. Lockhart, 484 F.2d 1192, 1193 (8th Cir. 1973); <em>see </em>Cates v. Ciccone, 422 F.2d 926 (8th Cir. 1970). Any suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against a state official must be based upon a claim arising out of a clear violation of the complainant\u2019s constitutional or other federally protected rights. Cole v. Smith, 344 F.2d 721 (8th Cir. 1965). Here, the claimed inadequacy of treatment must be predicated on obvious neglect or intentional misconduct by the prison officials, <em>see </em>Cates v. Ciccone, <em>supra, </em>422 F.2d at 928, and must be so heinous as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment as that term is used in the Eighth Amendment or so endanger the prisoner\u2019s physical well-being that his Fourteenth Amendment right to life is violated. <em>See </em>Martinez v. Mancusi, 443 F.2d 921 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 983, 91 S.Ct. 1202, 28 L.Ed.2d 335 (1971); Gittlemacker v. Prasse, 428 F.2d 1 (3rd Cir. 1970); Church v. Hegstrom, 416 F.2d 449 (2d Cir. 1969); Hirons v. Director, Patuxent Institution, 351 F.2d 613 (4th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-12\">In Jones v. Lockhart, <em>supra, </em>we cited with approval the holding of the Second Circuit that \u201ca charge of deliberate indifference by prison authorities to a prisoner\u2019s request for essential medical treatment is sufficient to state a claim.\u201d Corby v. Conboy, 457 F.2d 251 (2d Cir. 1972). Petitioner\u2019s pleadings are somewhat inartfully drawn and it is difficult to tell exactly what the gist of his action is. However, <em>pro se </em>complaints are to be liberally construed, Cruz v. Cardwell, 486 F.2d 550 (8th Cir. 1973); <em>see </em>Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U.S. 249, 92 S.Ct. 407, 30 L.Ed.2d 418 (1971). From the pleadings reviewed by the district court, taken together, it may reasonably be inferred that Freeman contends that appellees, having sanctioned through negligence conditions of confinement which resulted in his illness, failed and refused to arrange for specialized treatment required to correct the damage to his eyes, with resulting physical impairment. Viewing the complaint and petition for rehearing in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>light, we cannot say that \u201cit appears \u2018beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u2019 \u201d Haines v. Kerner, <em>supra, </em>404 U.S. at 520-521, 92 S.Ct. 594, 596, <em>quoting </em>Conley v. Gibson, 855 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s complaint and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. <em>See </em>Jones v. Lockhart, <em>supra, </em>484 F.2d at 1194.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1081-13\">. The Honorable J.

The District Judge\u2019s investigation into Freeman\u2019s condition may have prompted the kind of medical attention Freeman sought.
