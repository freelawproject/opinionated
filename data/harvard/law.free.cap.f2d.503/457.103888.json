App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) which makes it a crime for a convicted felon to possess a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-17\">This case was consolidated for argument with United States v. Roberts, 503 F.2d 453. Opinion has been filed in that case on this date. Roberts and McGraw were represented by the same counsel. The constitutional attack here made is identical to that made in <em>Roberts. </em>For the reasons stated in <em>Roberts, </em>we reject defendant\u2019s constitutional attack upon \u00a7 5861(d) and affirm the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
