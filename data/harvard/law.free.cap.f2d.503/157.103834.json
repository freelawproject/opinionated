J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The Commission approved the acquisition agreement on condition that the subsidiaries remain independent companies in competition with each other, except as the Commission might otherwise authorize.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-27\">The dispositive issue is whether the Commission has jurisdiction to approve such an agreement under section 15 of the Shipping Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 733, as amended, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 814,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which requires all persons subject to the Act to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>file with the Commission <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> every agreement within specified categories reached with any other person subject to the Act. The statute empowers the Commission to disapprove, cancel or modify any agreement which it finds to be unjustly discriminatory, detrimental to the commerce of the United States, contrary to the public interest, or violative of the terms of the Act, and directs the Commission to approve all other agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Of primary importance in the present case is the express provision in section 15 that agreements approved by the Commission are exempt from the antitrust laws. If the agreement in this case is within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction, then the acquisition is effectively shielded from antitrust attack. See FMC v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., 411 U.S. 726, 728-729 &amp; n. 3, 93 S.Ct. 1773, 36 L.Ed.2d 620 (1973); Transamerican Trailer Transport, Inc. v. FMC, U.S. App.D.C., 492 F.2d 617, 624 (1974). We conclude that the acquisition agreement in this case is not the type of agreement encompassed by section 15 and that the Commission therefore lacked jurisdiction to approve the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">United States Lines, Inc. (USL) and Sea-Land Service, Inc (Sea-Land) are the two largest eontainership operators in the world.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> USL, the second largest eontainership operator, is wholly owned by Walter Kidde &amp; Company, Inc. (Kidde), a conglomerate. USL owns 16 modern containerships and 14 modern breakbulk ships, maintains the largest eontainership operation between Atlantic ports and Western Europe, and also provides through-service between Europe, the Atlantic coast, the Pacific coast, Hawaii and the Far East. Despite this extensive operation, there is some evidence that the company has experienced liquidity problems in recent years.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Sea-Land, the largest eontainership operator in the world, is wholly owned by McClean Industries, Inc., which is wholly owned by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (Reynolds), which in turn is a subsidiary of R. J. Reynolds, Inc., a conglomerate. At the time of the Commission hearing Sea-Land either owned or chartered 61 containerships and had 10 modern containerships under construction. Sea-Land services the Atlantic coast, Northern Europe, the Mediterranean, the Pacific coast, the Far East, Alaska and the Caribbean. USL is its only direct competitor in total United States foreign commerce. However, many of Sea-Land\u2019s ships are converted World War II vessels and Sea-Land needs more modern containerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In 1969 Sea-Land and USL agreed to a 20-year charter of USL\u2019s entire con-tainership fleet to Sea-Land, with an option to purchase at the end of the charter period. Related equipment would be similarly leased and certain terminal facilities would be transferred from USL to Sea-Land. The parent corporations guaranteed the obligations of their subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">In November 1970 the transaction was restructured into a merger-charter agreement. This agreement provided that RJI Corporation, a corporation wholly owned by Reynolds, would merge with USL and that RJI would cease its corporate existence, leaving USL as a wholly owned subsidiary of Reynolds. In return for delivering all outstanding stock of USL to Reynolds, Kidde would receive a promissory note for $65 million. A Supplemental Agreement provided that if the transaction were disapproved by a federal agency, Reynolds would find a substitute purchaser. After the merger, USL would lease its con-tainerships to Sea-Land as in the 1969 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">In December 1970 the Department of Justice filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey seeking to enjoin this transaction on the ground that it violated the antitrust laws. United States v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 325 F.Supp. 656 (D.N.J.1971). The FMC intervened, seeking a stay or dismissal of the court\u2019s action pending completion of the FMC\u2019s consideration of the transaction, but on April 7, 1971 the court declined to stay the action, concluding that the FMC lacked jurisdiction over the merger embodied in the November 1970 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">In March 1972, during final oral argument before the Commission on the November 1970 agreement, the attorney for Reynolds proposed a modified plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>which the Commission eventually approved. Under this plan USL would merge with RJI Corporation as in the November 1970 plan, but USL would continue to operate independently of Sea-Land in all respects. The Commission reopened the proceeding and received comments on this new proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">On February 12, 1973 the Commission approved Reynolds\u2019 acquisition of USL upon the condition that USL and Sea-Land operate as independent carriers in all respects in competition with each other, except as the Commission might otherwise approve. The Commission expressed concern over USL\u2019s financial condition, found that the public interest would be served by maintaining USL as a viable domestic shipper, and concluded that acquisition by Reynolds offered the best opportunity to restore USL\u2019s financial strength. With a nod toward the anticompetitive effects of the acquisition, the Commission imposed certain restrictions designed to insure that Reynolds would operate USL and Sea-Land as separate carriers in competition with each other. These restrictions are set forth in the Appendix to this opinion and are further discussed in part III of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Petitioners challenge the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction under section 15 to approve an acquisition of this type. They also contend that the Commission\u2019s procedure in approving the plan suggested at oral argument was insufficient and that neither the evidence nor the Commission\u2019s reasoning supports its decision. We find the jurisdiction issue dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The first decision to consider the Commission\u2019s section 15 jurisdiction over mergers or acquisitions was Matson Navigation Co. v. FMC, 405 F.2d 796 (9th Cir. 1968), which upheld the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction to approve a merger between American Mail Line, Ltd., American President ' Lines, Ltd. and Pacific Far East Lines, Inc. Under the terms of the merger American Mail Line would remain either a subsidiary of the new corporation or a separate division for steamship operations. The <em>Matson </em>decision asserted reliance primarily on the earlier Supreme Court decision in Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellsehaft v. FMC, 390 U.S. 261, 88 S.Ct. 929, 19 L.Ed.2d (1968), in which the Supreme Court refused to adopt an \u201cextremely narrow view of a statute [section 15] that uses expansive language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 88 S.Ct. at 936. Noting that <em>Volkswagenwerk </em>gave section 15 \u201cthe broadest of readings,\u201d the <em>Matson </em>court concluded that a broad interpretation of the statute would include merger agreements. The <em>Mat-son </em>decision not only was the first decision to uphold section 15 jurisdiction over mergers, it was also the last.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">The first of several decisions to reject section 15 jurisdiction over mergers or acquisitions was United States v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 325 F.Supp. 656 (D.N.J.1971), discussed in section I of this opinion. That case involved the November 1970 merger-charter which preceded the agreement at issue here. After a thorough study of section 15 and its legislative history, Judge Garth concluded that mergers or acquisitions are conceptually different from the types of agreements which Congress intended section 15 to regulate and disapproved Commission jurisdiction over the proposed merger-charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">In Seatrain Lines, Inc. v. FMC, 148 U.S.App.D.C. 424, 460 F.2d 932 (1972), aff\u2019d, 411 U.S. 726, 93 S.Ct. 1773, 36 L.Ed.2d 620 (1973), we held that the statute does not confer jurisdiction over transactions where one shipping company acquires all the assets of another. After carefully examining section 15 and its legislative history, we concluded, as did the court in <em>Reynolds, </em>that the statute was designed to regulate types of agreements which were fundamentally distinct from mergers and acquisitions. Both the <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Seatrain </em>decisions found the <em>Matson </em>court\u2019s reliance on <em>Volkswagenwerk </em>misplaced. Unlike a merger or acquisition, the agreement in <em>Volkswagenwerk </em>was a cooperative work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ing arrangement similar to the agreements discussed in section 15\u2019s legislative history,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the <em>Volkswagenwerk </em>decision therefore did not suggest that section 15 jurisdiction includes mergers or acquisitions. See also FMC v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., 411 U.S. 726, 731, 93 S.Ct. 1773, 36 L.Ed.2d 620 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The Supreme Court granted certiorari in our <em>Seatrain </em>case to resolve the conflict between <em>Matson </em>and the <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Seatrain </em>decisions. Affirming the interpretation of the <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Sea-train </em>decisions, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">We conclude that in enacting \u00a7 15, Congress did not intend to invest the Commission with the power to shield from antitrust liability merger or acquisition of assets agreements which impose no ongoing responsibilities. Rather Congress intended to invest the Commission with jurisdiction over only those agreements, or those portions of agreements, which created ongoing rights and responsibilities and which, therefore, necessitated continuous Commission supervision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">FMC v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., 411 U.S. 726, 729, 93 S.Ct. 1773, 1777, 36 L.Ed.2d 620 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Most of the legislative history of the Shipping Act is contained in the Alexander Report which culminated a comprehensive investigation into the shipping industry by the House Committee on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries chaired by Congressman Alexander.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is unnecessary at this point to review the legislative history in detail because a thorough analysis appears in <em>Reynolds </em>and the two <em>Seatrain </em>decisions. It suffices to say that while Congress recognized that shipping conferences had some anticompetitive effects, Congress feared that their abolition would further decrease competition by forcing outright acquisitions or mergers among the shipping companies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Congress therefore decided to allow cooperative arrangements to continue but to subject such arrangements to government supervision and regulation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus it was primarily to avoid the greater evil of outright mergers and acquisitions that Congress permitted cooperative working arrangements to exist at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The legislative history of section 15 evidences a sharp recognition of the differences between cooperative working arrangements which are subject to the Act and mergers and acquisitions which are not. As Judge Garth stated in the <em>Reynolds </em>decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-11\">The catalog or \u201cfull classification of these agreements\u201d (i. e., the \u201cagreements\u201d to which the Alexander Committee\u2019s attention was primarily directed and to which its recommendations were exclusively directed) does not include a single agreement of merger or other form of corporate reorganization. The \u201cagreements\u201d represented in the Report are all \u201congoing\u201d in nature. Most of these \u201cagreements\u201d are cooperative working arrangements. These \u201cagreements\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>describe practices or regular activities in which two or more shipping companies have agreed to participate over a considerable period of time. None of the \u201cagreements\u201d studied by the Alexander Committee bears the slightest resemblance to an agreement of merger, which is essentially a single, discrete event, which transforms the relationship of the merging parties at the instant of merger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">325 F.Supp. at 658-659 (footnotes omitted). Indeed the Alexander Report expressly distinguished acquisitions from the cooperative arrangements to which the Committee\u2019s recommendations were directed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">The numerous methods of controlling competition between water carriers in the domestic trade referred to in the preceding pages, may be grouped under three headings viz, (1) control through the <em>acquisition </em>of water lines or the <em>ownership </em>of accessories to the lines; (2) control through <em>agreements </em>or <em>understandings; </em>and (3) control through <em>special </em>practices-.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Alexander Report at 409 (emphasis added). This distinction between cooperative working arrangements and acquisitions by merger or other cooperative reorganizations lies at the heart of the <em>Reynolds </em>and two <em>Seatrain </em>decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Seatrain </em>decisions use the words \u201congoing\u201d and \u201ccontinuing\u201d as one basis for distinguishing agreements subject to section 15 from those that are not. For example, summarizing its discussion of section 15 jurisdiction, the Supreme Court characterized section 15 agreements as those which \u201ccreated ongoing rights and responsibilities and which, therefore, necessitated continuous Commission supervision.\u201d 411 U.S. at 729, 93 S.Ct. at 1777. And the <em>Reynolds </em>decision noted that \u201c[t]he \u2018agreements\u2019 represented in the [Alexander] Report are all \u2018on-going\u2019 in nature.\u201d 325 F.Supp. at 659. Mergers and acquisitions, on the other hand, were described as \u201cone-time agreements creating no continuing obligations,\u201d 411 U.S. at 734, 93 S.Ct. at 1779, and as \u201cessentially a single, discrete event,\u201d 325 F.Supp. at 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">However, it does not follow from these decisions that a transaction necessarily is subject to section 15 merely because it embodies or is coupled with some ongoing or continuing aspects. The transactions in the <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Sea-train </em>decisions were single discreet events \u2014 a merger and a sale of assets, respectively.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The terms \u201congoing\u201d and \u201ccontinuing\u201d were all that were necessary to distinguish the transactions in those cases from cooperative working arrangements subject to section 15. But the courts\u2019 language does not require that every agreement which includes some ongoing characteristic is subject to section 15. Whereas all agreements subject to section 15 must be ongoing and continuing in nature, not every ongoing and continuing agreement, or agreement with such consequences, is necessarily subject to the statute. Otherwise, an outright merger or sale of assets could be structured to include some ongoing aspect for the sole purpose of obtaining antitrust shelter under section 15.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For example, a merger or sale of assets agreement could provide that the transaction would occur in installments over a period of years. This arrangement would be ongoing and continuing, but it would not necessarily be a section 15 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">When confronted with a transaction that is arguably subject to section 15, the court must determine whether the agreement is a cooperative working arrangement which Congress intended to regulate by section 15 or whether the agreement involves, in substance, an outright merger or acquisition beyond the scope of section 15. The agreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>expressly enumerated in section 15 illustrate the types of continuing understandings which that section was intended to include. Section 15 specifies agreements\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">[1] fixing or regulating transportation rates or fares;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">[2] giving or receiving special rates, accommodations, or other special privileges or advantages;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">[3] controlling, regulating, preventing, or destroying competition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">[4] pooling or apportioning earnings, losses, or traffic;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">[5] allotting ports or restricting or otherwise regulating the number and character of sailings between ports;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">[6] limiting or regulating in any way the volume or character of freight or passenger traffic to be carried;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">[7] or in any manner providing for an exclusive, preferential, or cooperative working arrangement.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">The <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Seatmin </em>decisions emphasize one important characteristic of section 15 agreements: the agreement must impose ongoing obligations which require continuous Commission supervision. But this is not the sole characteristic which distinguishes section 15 agreements from other transactions. Another important distinguishing feature of section 15 agreements is that they do not affect ownership of the parties to the agreement but \u201cenvision the continued existence of the parties.\u201d Seatrain Lines, Inc. v. FMC, <em>supra, </em>at 531, 460 F.2d at 939. In other words, section 15 does not apply to mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, either separately or in conjunction with other agreements. While the parties to a cooperative working arrangement may surrender control over a particular matter for the duration of that agreement, their separate identity and original independence continues in all other respects. Instead of creating conglomerates, cooperative working arrangements leave the parties separate and free to compete in areas not regulated by the cooperative agreement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>A merger or acquisition, on the other hand, \u201ctransforms the relationship of the merging parties,\u201d United States v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., <em>supra, </em>325 F.Supp. at 659, and \u201ceffectively destroys one of the parties to the agreement.\u201d FMC v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., <em>supra, </em>411 U.S. at 732, 93 S.Ct. at 1778. Throughout the Alexander Report, \u201ccontrol through agreements\u201d is carefully distinguished from \u201ccontrol through <em>acquisition </em>of water lines or the <em>ownership </em>of accessories to the lines.\u201d E. g., Alexander Report at 301, 409 (emphasis added). Indeed the Committee feared that elimination of cooperative working arrangements would \u201cnecessarily\u201d lead to \u201crate wars\u201d or to consolidation \u201cthrough <em>common ownership.\u201d Id. </em>at 416 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A natural result of such a change in corporate ownership would be a permanent alteration of the competitive structure of the industry.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">A third distinguishing characteristic of section 15 agreements is suggested by the statutory language. The statute requires \u201c[e]very common carrier by water, or other person subject to this chapter\u201d to file with the Commission \u201cevery <em>agreement with another such carrier </em>or other person subject to this chapter.\u201d Thus section 15 agreements must be agreements between parties subject to the Act. A unilateral undertaking by a single party does not constitute a section 15 agreement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> -</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Having identified some of the characteristics of section 15 agreements, we must determine whether the acquisition at issue is in substance a transaction which Congress intended the Commission to regulate under section 15. The transaction originated in 1969 as a 20-year Charter Agreement by Sea-Land of USL\u2019s eontainership fleet, with an option to purchase at the end of the charter period. This agreement was later amended to a merger-charter agreement in which Reynolds attempted to acquire USL under the terms of the November 1970 merger agreement so as to insure USL\u2019s viability throughout the charter period. While approval of this merger-charter agreement was pending before the Commission, Reynolds suggested that it would drop the charter portion of the agreement and operate USL and Sea-Land independently. It is clear from this suggestion that the parent, Reynolds, possessed and was prepared to exercise extensive power to control USL and Sea-Land if the Commission approved the agreement as so amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Finally, the Commission did approve Reynolds\u2019 acquisition of USL upon certain stated conditions which it designed to insure competition between an independent USL and Sea-Land. See Appendix. Primarily, the conditions require that USL and Sea-Land exist as separate corporate entities and continue to compete, except as otherwise authorized by the Commission. These conditions, argues the Commission, remove the transaction from the realm of ordinary mergers and transform the acquisition into a cooperative working arrangement under section 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>However, we find that the merger is a substantial and principal feature of the transaction. Regardless of what label may be attached to the remainder of the so-called agreement (or undertaking), and regardless of the Commission\u2019s possible jurisdiction over that remainder, the merger portion of the agreement is not within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction under the present provisions of section 15. Whether it is desirable for Congress to vest such jurisdiction in the Commission is not for us to determine.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Our task is at an end once we conclude that Congress has not conferred merger jurisdiction on the Commission and that the transaction at issue is in substance a merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">It is significant here that after the acquisition a single corporation will own and control both USL and Sea-Land, whereas prior to the acquisition ownership of these companies was separate. Before the acquisition two independent intercorporate structures existed \u2014 USL under the ultimate control of Kidde and Sea-Land under the ultimate control of Reynolds. No ties existed between these two corporate families and they necessarily competed with each other. In fact, the Commission found that USL was Sea-Land\u2019s only direct competitor in total United States foreign commerce. Jt. App. at 94. After the acquisition only one intercorporate structure would remain. Sea-Land and USL would be subsidiary corporations under the ultimate control of a single company, Reynolds. As the Alexander Report indicates, \u201cconsolidations . . . through stock control of subsidiaries\u201d was one of the evils which Congress sought to avoid by regulating cooperative agreements.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">The conditions proposed by the Commission would do little to counteract the effect of USL and Sea-Land belonging to the same corporate family. The Commission seems to suggest that Reynolds\u2019 agreement not to sell, dispose of or encumber USL\u2019s stock or assets without Commission approval means that Reynolds would not enjoy all the attributes of complete ownership of USL. See Appendix, Condition I. However, the proposed conditions themselves suggest that Reynolds would possess virtually unlimited ownership and control over USL. For example, under Condition II Reynolds assumes all of USL\u2019s present expenses, debts and financing, and agrees to provide future financing without taking a security interest in USL\u2019s existing assets or future revenues. See Appendix. Additionally, under Condition VII, it is Reynolds rather than USL that is .responsible for registering new vessels in the United States when they are delivered to USL.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is unlikely that Reynolds would undertake such responsibilities if it did not consider itself possessed of essentially complete ownership of USL.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>The Commission contends that the agreement is a cooperative working arrangement because the proposed conditions impose substantial ongoing responsibilities requiring continuous Commission supervision. We are unable to accept this view of the transaction. Condition III provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">USL is to be operated as an independent carrier in all respects in competition with Sea-Land. Upon the adoption by USL and/or Sea-Land of any alteration in their competitive relationship, the FMC on its own motion or on petition of a party or person having an interest, may institute a proceeding to determine whether such alteration is consistent with the terms and conditions herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Following this general statement the agreement lists six specific conditions (A through F) which purport to insure competition between USL and Sea-Land. See Appendix. The Commission emphasizes' this \u201cagreement to compete\u201d as a prime illustration of the ongoing nature of the transaction, but it ignores the change of ownership which results in a single corporation controlling both carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">In our <em>Seatrain </em>decision we indicated that an acquisition of assets coupled with an agreement <em>not </em>to compete might be within the Commission\u2019s section 15 jurisdiction.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Our dictum in that decision suggests only that when two existing carriers agree not to compete, they should file their agreement with the Commission. We did not decide that under such circumstances the Commission would have jurisdiction to approve or disapprove an accompanying merger or acquisition of assets. In fact, our <em>Seatrain </em>decision made very clear that we agreed with Judge Garth\u2019s <em>Reynolds </em>decision and disagreed with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s <em>Matson </em>decision, in holding that a simple sale of all ships and assets is not within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Regardless of the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction over agreements <em>not to compete, </em>it does not follow that section 15 confers jurisdiction over the undertaking <em>to compete </em>in this case. An agreement <em>not </em>to compete is precisely the type of arrangement which Congress intended to regulate by section 15. It is an agreement among carriers, which are otherwise in competition, to work together to lessen competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">The undertaking <em>to compete </em>in this case is fundamentally different because the Shipping Act and the antitrust laws already require competition between the carriers. The conditions proposed by the Commission to augment the instant merger would prohibit USL and Sea-Land from establishing a cooperative working arrangement \u201cexcept as otherwise authorized by the FMC.\u201d We perceive no difference between these conditions and the general requirement of section 15 that all carriers submit cooperative working arrangements for Commission approval. Section 15 would apply to USL and Sea-Land as separate corporate entities, even if they were commonly owned. Thus the \u201cagreement to compete,\u201d which the Commission characterizes as imposing ongoing responsibilities, in reality imposes no additional obligations on USL and Sea-Land that are not already imposed by section 15 and the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Condition III.A. prohibits USL and Sea-Land from sharing an interlocking directorate. Like the agreement to compete, this condition constitutes a voluntary agreement <em>not </em>to engage in cooperative, noncompetitive activity. Condition III.A.l. requires one director of each company to be a \u201cpublic member\u201d who will report to the FMC.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This condition amounts to a unilateral undertaking by USL and Sea-Land individually and separately with the Commission, and is not a cooperative working arrangement which would confer section 15 jurisdiction over the entire agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Condition I regulates the manner in which Reynolds will handle USL\u2019s stock and assets. Not once is Sea-Land mentioned in Condition I. If we were to assume <em>arguendo </em>that Reynolds, in this instance, could be considered an entity subject to the Act,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> this condition might be construed as an agreement between Reynolds and USL. But in essence this condition is no more than a unilateral undertaking by Reynolds. No similarity exists between the restrictions on Reynolds\u2019 possible sale of USL stock and the cooperative working arrangements contemplated by section 15. Although these restrictions might be appropriate condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>tions ancillary to a section 15 agreement, they do not in and of themselves confer section 15 jurisdiction over the acquisition by merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The Commission nevertheless contends that Condition I brings the agreement within section 15 by imposing ongoing obligations which require continuing Commission supervision. For example, the Commission asserts, Condition I.C. expressly subjects the acquisition to \u201creview by the Commission at least every 5 years,\u201d and under Condition I.D. Reynolds acknowledges the Commission\u2019s power to require divestiture of USL stock. However, since section 15 empowers the Commission to disallow or modify an agreement at any time even though the agreement is initially approved,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the conditions impose no additional obligations but simply restate the Commission\u2019s continuous jurisdiction that is already prescribed by the statute. Indeed the Commission itself recognized that Condition I adds no additional obligations to the statutory scheme. In discussing the proposed conditions, the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">What we are doing is modifying the proposed agreement and approving the acquisition of USL by Reynolds upon certain conditions to permit continued Federal Maritime Commission surveillance over the acquisition reserving to ourselves the <em>authority the Commission has over all agreements </em>approved by us under section 15 of the Shipping Act, 1916.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">* * *x* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">Although our general obligation to exercise continuing Commission surveillance is required by the Shipping Act under section 15, we nevertheless <em>restate that obligation </em>in Condition I.C. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Jt. App. at 82, 175 (emphasis added). Nothing could be clearer than that the Commission was merely restating its statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">We recognize that the Commission intended Condition I as an attempt to avoid some of the problems inherent in unscrambling a merger once it has been consummated.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> What Reynolds has done in this case is to volunteer to subject itself to the Commission\u2019s power under section 15. However, as a statutory entity, the Commission cannot acquire jurisdiction merely by agreement of the parties before it. Weinberger v. Bentex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 412 U.S. 645, 652, 93 S.Ct. 2488, 2493, 37 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973) (\u201cParties . . . cannot confer jurisdiction; only Congress can do so.\u201d); <em>cf., </em>e. g., California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 112-113 n. 3, 93 S.Ct. 390, 34 L.Ed.2d 342 (1972); People\u2019s Bank v. Calhoun, 102 U.S. 256, 260-261, 26 L.Ed. 101 (1880).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">Under Condition II Reynolds undertakes to finance USL. Condition IV relates to the submission of reports to and inspection by the Commission. Under Condition V the Commission retains jurisdiction to modify the conditions. Condition VI requires that the parties not obstruct the performance of the conditions. Condition VII requires the parties to operate vessels registered in the United States. We have no difficulty concluding that these conditions are not cooperative working arrangements with another carrier or other person subject to the Act, and therefore, that they do not confer jurisdiction under section 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">One final argument by the Commission must be considered. The Commission contends that since it had jurisdiction over the 1969 charter agreement originally submitted by USL and Sea-Land <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and since the Commission is authorized to modify an agreement sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>mitted under section 15, it retains jurisdiction over the acquisition at issue. Notwithstanding the complete elimination of any charter provision in the present agreement and the addition of a corporate reorganization, the Commission apparently views this agreement as simply a modified version of the 1969 charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The difficulty with this argument is that it would allow the Commission to take jurisdiction over one agreement, transform the agreement into an outright merger and then approve the outright merger. .This circuitous procedure would enable the Commission to escape the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Seatrain </em>that the Commission lacks jurisdiction over outright mergers.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In our view the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction must be measured by the agreement actually approved, not by an agreement which was proposed but discarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The decision of the Commission approving Agreement No. 9827-1,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> as modified by the Commission\u2019s decision dated February 12, 1973, is accordingly vacated, and the Commission is directed to remove this agreement from its docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">[Conditions imposed by the Commission on Reynolds\u2019 acquisition of USL.]</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">I.

It is important to remember that shipping conferences are not combines linked by shareholdings or any other form of common ownership. It will be recalled that the Imperial Shipping Committee described them as follows: \u201cA shipping conference is a meeting in which competitors face one another with the object of achieving that minimum of co-operation which will suffice to prevent such chaotic competition as might render impracticable the liner system of working ships. Each member of a conference is seeking the minimum surrender of his competitive freedom which is compatible with this object; his attitude in debate is determined by the sources of strength which lie behind his diplomacy.\u201d [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">.

Counsel replied :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-16\">Well, sir, there\u2019s some question here, without this independent structure, whether or not Reynolds, since they already chartered into the Sea-Land organization, the charter would have become effectuated, it would all be over. <em>We only have one entity.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Transcript at 40 (emphasis added). This statement should be contrasted with the same counsel\u2019s statement shortly thereafter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">You have a merger of the stock interest, yes, that is correct, sir. That interest up on top, we do not deny that. But what we do say, sir, is you do not have a consolidation of two different shipping companies. They are still held as <em>independent corporate entities.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Transcript at 47 (emphasis added). These statements illustrate the transparency of the Commission\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b232-9\">. We recognize that there is a certain apparent inconsistency (more apparent than real) in holding that the parties are not required to file with the Commission and the Commission is -not required to approve or disapprove a simple contract for the sale of ships and all assets, and yet a similar contract coupled with an agreement not to compete, which may involve more complicated antitrust issues than the more simple sale contract, is required to be filed and the Commission may have jurisdiction to pass on all questions, including antitrust issues. The explanation lies in (1) the wording of Section 15, (2) its legislative history, (3) the fact that the degree of antitrust complexity is not what determines the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction, and (4) perhaps in a caveat.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">148 U.S.App.D.C. at 437, 460 F.2d at 945.

The Supreme Court in their <em>Seatrain </em>decision also suggested that the Commission has jurisdiction over \u201conly those agreements, <em>or those portions of agreements, </em>which created ongoing rights and responsibilities.\u201d 411 U.S. at 729, 93 S.Ct. at 1777 (emphasis added). The Department of Justice suggests that the Commission could exercise jurisdiction over an ancillary agreement not to compete after the courts determine the validity of the underlying acquisition under the antitrust laws. Brief for the Bnited States of America at 46 n. 9. We do not reach this question in the present case. It is interesting to note, however, that in <em>Seatrain </em>the FMC argued to the Supreme Court that \u00a7 15 jurisdiction over mergers should not hang on such a slender thread as the existence of a covenant not to compete.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-15\">The Court below also suggested that the Commission can be ousted from jurisdiction and the aims and objectives of the Shipping Act frustrated by the simple expedient of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>omitting \u201con-going\u201d or \u201ccontinuing\u201d arrangements in drafting agreements of sale or merger in the shipping industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">sfc ifc S\u00a1S <em>% </em>sj\u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">Thus, if instead of an outright purchase of Oceanic\u2019s vessels in the case at bar, PFEL had entered into a long term charter (10-15 years), or coupled the acquisition agreement with a covenant not to compete, the agreement, according to the court below, would have been subject to the Commission\u2019s Section 15 jurisdiction. Such an \u201con-going\u201d arrangement would have little or no different effects under the shipping and antitrust statutes. Therefore, by altering the actual mechanics of an acquisition or merger, the form rather than the substance of the transaction would control the ultimate disposition of any administrative or judi-dicial preceding [sic]. <em>Such a result is both unsound and undesirable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Brief for FMC at 44-45, FMC v.

This discussion assumes that the agreement is between the two carriers, USL and Sea-Land. If the conditions are construed as an agreement between Reynolds and the Commission or between Reynolds and USL, then there might not exist an agreement between two entities subject to \u00a7 15. In the present case we need not resolve whether Reynolds is subject to \u00a7 15 by virtue of its involvement with its shipping company subsidiaries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b233-15\">.

It is unnecessary to express our opinion on whether the original charter was within \u00a7 15 jurisdiction.
