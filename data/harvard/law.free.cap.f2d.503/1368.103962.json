Tyson reported for induction on June 17, 1971. Tyson was referred to a civilian psychiatrist, Dr. Charles Beall, whose report stated in part: \u201cHe is correctly oriented. No hallucinations or delusions can be elicited. Memory, insight and judgment are good.\u201d Dr. Beall concluded that Tyson was \u201cQualified.\u201d Tyson was then ordered to submit to induction on June 22, 1971, but he refused. He was indicted and arrested; but because of negotiations between his attorney and the United States Attorney, he again reported for induction on July 12, 1973. Tyson submitted a letter from Dr. Lawrence Brannon, a psychiatrist, stating that he suffered from, a schizo-affective disorder and was unfit for military service. He was at this time declared unfit by the Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station. Tyson was then prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-16\">Because a question arose as to Tyson\u2019s mental capacity to understand the proceedings against him', the trial court appointed Dr. E. Marston Rascoe to conduct a psychiatric examination. Although Dr. Rascoe found schizoid traits, Tyson was found competent to stand trial. The trial court ruled that testimony of Drs. Brannon and Rascoe to the effect that Tyson was not qualified for military service was inadmissible. Tyson was convicted of refusing to submit to induction, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462, and was given a probated sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-17\">Factfinding for purposes of Selective Service classification is committed to the administrative process, and judicial review is limited to determining whether there is a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for the administrative finding. McGee v. United States, 402 U.S. 479, 91 S.Ct. 1565, 29 L.Ed.2d 47 (1971); Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946). Such a strict standard is likewise applicable to the analogous situation of factfinding for purposes of qualification for induction. Absent usual circumstances the courts will not inquire into an inductee\u2019s physical fitness. United States v. Shunk, 438 F.2d 1204 (9th Cir. 1971); United States v. Haifley, 432 F.2d 1064 (10th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-18\">In United States v. Wilson, 478 F.2d 475 (9th Cir. 1973), the court held that arbitrary action by AFEES will warrant a court\u2019s taking corrective action. In that case the government conceded that the examining psychiatrist was unaware of medical standards controlling the acceptability of registrants. However, Tyson has shown no such unawareness on the part of Dr. Beall. Ty<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>son shows simply that two psychiatrists who examined him two years later found him to be unqualified at that time, and one of those suggested that he might have been unqualified for military service in 1971. Such a showing falls short of Tyson\u2019s burden to show arbitrariness on the part of Dr. Beall.. A mere difference of medical opinion is not sufficient. The government showed that there was a basis in fact for finding Tyson qualified for induction in 1971 when the offense was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
