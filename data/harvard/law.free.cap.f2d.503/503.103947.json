Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6, 78 S.Ct. 514, 518, 2 L.Ed.2d 545 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-20\">According to plaintiff-appellees, the illegal conduct claimed here arose when Barber-Greene refused to continue to sell Brand\u00e9is its dominant asphalt products line (the tying product) unless Brand\u00e9is agreed to distribute exclusively Barber-Greene\u2019s less popular Telsmith line of stone-crushing equipment (the tied product). When Brand\u00e9is, a multi-products distributor who had handled the Telsmith line for Barber-Greene since 1964, chose to take on the distributorship of Rexnord products, a line of stone-crushing equipment competitive with Telsmith, Barber-Greene terminated its entire dealer agreement with Brand\u00e9is and State.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Barber-Greene\u2019s principal challenge on appeal is to the district court\u2019s determination that Brand\u00e9is had shown sufficient likelihood of ultimate success on the merits to warrant the issuance of the preliminary injunction. Barber-Greene relies upon the right of termination reserved to it in its agreements with appellees, and claims that it engaged in no more than a simple refusal to deal, held not actionable in United States v. Colgate, 250 U.S. 300, 39 S.Ct. 465, 63 L.Ed. 992 (1919). Brand\u00e9is, on the other hand, relies upon that line of more recent cases which hold the Colgate doctrine not to be applicable where the manufacturer\u2019s actions \u201cgo beyond mere announcement of his policy and the simple refusal to deal, and he employs other means to effect adherence\u201d to his demands. United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co., 362 U.S. 29, 44, 80 S.Ct. 503, 512, 4 L.Ed.2d 505 (1960). See also Federal Trade Commission v. Beech-Nut Packing Company, 257 U.S. 441, 42 S.Ct. 150, 66 L.Ed. 307 (1921); Osborn v. Sinclair Refining Company, 324 F.2d 566 (4th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Before reaching a decision to grant preliminary injunctive relief, the district judge heard three days of testimony, and in addition considered numerous depositions and received 47 exhibits. That record has been reduced on appeal to an appendix consisting of three volumes and over one thousand pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In determining whether sufficient likelihood of success exists as one of the necessary conditions to preliminary injunctive relief, the trial court was required to \u201csatisfy itself, not that the plaintiff certainly has a right, but that he has a fair question to raise as to the existence of such a right.\u201d American Federation of Musicians v. Stein, 213 F.2d 679, 683 (6th Cir. 1954), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 873, 75 S.Ct. 108, 99 L.Ed. 687 (1954). Similarly in an antitrust action, Judge Jerome Frank held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">\u201c[I]t will ordinarily be enough that the plaintiff has raised questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them a fair ground for litigation and thus for mere deliberate investigation.\u201d Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., 206 F.2d 738, 740 (2nd Cir. 1953).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-8\"> Our function on appeal is to make a careful examination of the record to satisfy ourselves that the findings of the trial judge are not clearly erroneous, and that he has not abused the broad discretion which is his in determining whether to grant or withhold interlocutory relief. Corn-Share, Inc. v. Computer Complex, Inc., 458 F.2d 1341 (6th Cir. 1972). We believe it is important that we refrain from unnecessary comment on the evidence, in recognition of the fact that the case is yet to be heard in full on its merits.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">\u201cOrdinarily, an appellate court, upon an appeal from an order granting or denying a temporary injunction, will not go into the merits of a case further than is necessary to determine whether the trial court exceeded a reasonable discretion in making the order, and this is especially true where the rights of the parties can be better determined upon full proof of the facts.\u201d American Federation of Musicians v. Stein, <em>supra, </em>213 F.2d at 683.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">Upon a careful review of the record, we conclude that the findings of the trial court are not clearly erroneous, and that it did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">Affirmed. Costs to appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
