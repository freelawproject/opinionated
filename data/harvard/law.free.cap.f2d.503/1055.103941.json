The Board cross-petitions for an order of enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-22\">The only question presented for review is whether the producer-directors are excluded from the protection of the Act as \u201csupervisors\u201d or \u201cmanagerial employees.\u201d We find that the Board\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. For reasons stated in the opinion of the Regional Director, Case No. 4-RC-10351 (July 23, 1973), it is evident that the employees in question are not \u201csupervisors.\u201d <em>See </em>Post-Newsweek Stations, 203 N.L.R.B. No. 91, 83 LRRM 1081 (1973). Nor is there any ground to question the Regional Director\u2019s finding that the producer-directors lack the discretion and responsibility required to mark them as \u201cmanagerial employees.\u201d Bell Aerospace Co. v. NLRB, 475 F.2d 485 (2d Cir. 1973), aff\u2019d in relevant part, 416 U.S. 267, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-23\">Petition for review dismissed.
