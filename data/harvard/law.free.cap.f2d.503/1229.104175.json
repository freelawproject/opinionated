(Peko), Sav-Co., Inc. d/b/a Sav-Mart (Sav-Co.) and Philip Sachs and Michael Sachs d/b/a Phil\u2019s Sav-Mart Service (Phil\u2019s) had violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) &amp; (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(1) &amp; (3). See 199 NLRB No. 96; 202 NLRB No. 48. The Board\u2019s determination was based upon its findings that respondents had coer-cively interrogated an employee concerning his union membership, instituted more onerous work rules in retaliation for the employees\u2019 union activities and discriminatorily laid off four employees. Pursuant to \u00a7 10(e) of the Act, 29 U.S. C. \u00a7 160(e), the Board has applied to this court for enforcement of its orders. We enforce as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-19\">Phil\u2019s is a relatively small service station located in Collinsville, Illinois. It was the \u201cmanagement\u201d of Phil\u2019s, i. e., the Sachs brothers, who actually imposed the \u201cmore arduous\u201d working conditions and laid off the four service attendants. Peko and Sav-Co.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> thus contend that the Sachs brothers were independent contractors and that they are not responsible for the brothers\u2019 labor practices. The administrative law judge agreed with this contention, but the Board reversed, concluding that the brothers were agents of Peko and Sav-Co. and not independent contractors. See App. 8 &amp; n. 6. If the record as a whole contains substantial evidence supporting the Board\u2019s conclusion, it must, of course, be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-20\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-21\">The record demonstrates that Sav-Co. owns a building in Collinsville which is operated as a retail discount department store under the name \u201cSav-Mart.\u201d All of the departments within the store and the automotive store (located in a nearby building) are managed by enterprises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>other than Sav-Co. pursuant to lease or license agreements. Sav-Co., however, coordinates all of their advertising, furnishes building maintenance and provides utility, guard, custodial and check cashing protection services. According to the administrative law judge, the entire enterprise \u201cgives the appearance of being a single department store.\u201d App. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\">Located in one corner of the parking area surrounding Sav-Mart is the retail gasoline station which eventually became \u201cPhil\u2019s.\u201d The station was constructed jointly by Sav-Co. and Mid West Petroleum Co. in 1967 and then leased to Mid West; the lease was assigned to Peko on January 2, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">On the same day Peko entered into a written contract with Ben Sachs,/the father of the Sachs brothers. In consideration of a $100 per week salary, Ben Sachs agreed to: 1) \u201csupervise\u201d the Peko stations located at the four Sav-Mart locations; 2) \u201cadvise\u201d Peko \u201cof the condition of the repair of its equipment and machinery and the condition of the gas service stations, the conduct and manner of operation of said service stations by the personnel operating the same and also as to the quantity, quality and types of the various products sold at said stations\u201d; 3) \u201cadvise\u201d Peko \u201cas to the need for and make recommendations to [Peko] as to changing of equipment and/or products and keep [Peko] informed as to all trends and developments in the trade and business\u201d; and 4) \u201cmake all necessary recommendations to the operators of the various stations supplied by Peko concerning their handling of credit cards and cash collection systems together with payment of accounts due from the operators to [Peko].\u201d Ex. No. LTD-1. Although the contract referred to Ben Sachs as an \u201cindependent contractor,\u201d the Board properly concluded that he was an agent of Peko and Sav-Co.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-12\">Upon the recommendation of Ben Sachs, Peko subleased its Collinsville station to and entered into a \u201cconsignment contract\u201d with Philip Sachs, Ben Sachs\u2019 eldest son. Pursuant to the sublease, Ex. No. GC-4, Phil Sachs was required, <em>inter alia, </em>to: 1) pay a rental of $500 per month or one cent per gallon of gasoline sold, whichever was greater; 2) maintain the station in good repair; 3) paint the station whenever Sav-Co. \u201cdeemed necessary\u201d; 4) keep \u201cthe outside area of said premises in a neat condition and free of any objectionable debris, and reasonably free of snow, ice and water\u201d; 5) refrain from erecting certain types of advertising and making certain alterations to the property without written consent; 6) indemnify Sav-Co. against certain claims; 7) give a two cent per gallon discount to \u201cmembers of Sav-Mart\u201d; 8) allow Sav-Co. to inspect all of its records upon demand; 9) \u201cuse reasonable diligence in the courteous and efficient sale and dispersing of products for sale on said premises with sufficient capable personnel\u201d; 10) have a sufficient reserve supply of products to reasonably fill demands therefor\u201d; 11) \u201chave said station open for business daily from at least 6 A.M. each morning until at least 11 P.M. each night\u201d; 12) \u201chave sufficient number of pumps of recent design to properly service the reasonably foreseeable demand\u201d; and 13) refrain from doing anything \u201cwhich might in any way damage or injure the credit and/or business reputation of Sav-Mart.\u201d Failure to perform any of these requirements would, of course, allow Sav-Co. to terminate the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-15\">Pursuant to the consignment contract, Ex. No. GC-5, Philip Sachs was required to: 1) sell only those products <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>consigned to him by Peko; 2) deposit all receipts in a bank account insured by FDIC; 3) \u201crender diligent and courteous service to the public\u201d ; 4) operate his station \u201cin a sanitary, clean and presentable manner daily during reasonable hours\u201d; 5) \u201cfurnish such personnel as are able to sufficiently render reasonably prompt and competent service to [his] customers\u201d; 6) accept, maintain an accurate inventory of and remit daily reports on all products consigned; and 7) assume liability for losses due to the use of credit cards and bad checks. Once again, failure to satisfy these requirements could have resulted in termination of his lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">The consignment contract further provided that Peko would: 1) \u201crender merchandising management and administrative advice and assistance\u201d to Phil Sachs; 2) \u201cfurnish such advertising and sales promotion from time to time as it deems proper\u201d; 3) keep an account of all Sachs\u2019 sales; 4) pay all of the station\u2019s \u201crentals, utility bills, taxes, and all other occupational costs, other than labor and wages, and render a monthly account therefor\u201d; 5) protect the consigned products \u201cfrom harm resulting from fire, wind and storm, and from other hazards\u201d; 6) have the rights to inventory all consigned products whenever it desired and to demand and receive compensation for any missing goods; and 7) have the right to change any of the trade names on the consigned products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">Peko compensated Phil Sachs at the rate of three cents per gallon of gasoline sold. However, in return for certain services, he was required to pay Peko four cents per gallon. (Presumably this one cent per gallon differential satisfied the rental requirement under the sublease.) Peko guaranteed Phil Sachs \u201cprofits\u201d of $8,000 per annum. His only investment in the enterprise was $52 in petty cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-7\">Subsequent to signing the agreements with Peko, Phil Sachs entered the Navy and the management of the station was entrusted primarily to Sachs\u2019 brothers. On various occasions Ben Sachs came to the station and \u201cdirected\u201d the employees \u201cto do particular work assignments,\u201d such as \u201cto make announcements\u201d in the Sav-Mart store, \u201cto clean the lot, how much gas to order.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> App. 25-26. As one employee testified, he regarded Ben Sachs as his \u201cboss.\u201d App. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-8\">Ben Sachs played an active role in the station\u2019s labor affairs. He was responsible for the allegedly unlawful interrogation of one employee. When the union complained of another employee\u2019s (Templeman's) discharge, Ben Sachs alone met with the union\u2019s representative, Lester Baum, and said, \u201c[I]f you say we have to put him back, we are going to put him back.\u201d App. 98. Shortly thereafter Templeman was reinstated. When the station\u2019s employees went on strike because of a contract dispute, Ben Sachs told the brothers that Peko wanted the strike settled. He, along with the brothers, met with Baum to discuss the contract. One of the brothers told Baum that there would be no discussion unless the employees left the meeting room. The agent then called a director, officer and substantial stockholder of Peko and Sav-Co., Sidney Katz. After Ben Sachs talked to Katz, the contract was signed in the employees\u2019 presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-9\">Peko and Sav-Co. also played an active role in the station\u2019s labor affairs. When Templeman was discharged, Baum called Katz, who then set up the meeting between Baum and Ben Sachs. When the contract dispute arose, Baum called Katz and Ben Pessin, another director, officer and substantial stockholder of Peko and substantial stockholder of Sav-Co. Pessin \u201cassured\u201d him that \u201csomebody would be in the office to sign the contract . . . . \u201d App. 101. When the Sachs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>refused to meet in the presence of the employees, Baum once again called Katz; shortly after Ben Sachs talked to Katz, the contract was signed with the employees present. As one of the Sachs brothers testified, the decision to meet with Baum and sign the contract was made because \u201cit was felt that Philip would not be able to keep the station if a contract had not been signed and this strike would have continued.\u201d App. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">Whether the Sachs brothers were \u201cindependent contractors\u201d depends upon whether Peko and Sav-Co. had the right to control the way the brothers managed Phil\u2019s:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-7\">In determining the status of persons alleged to be independent contractors, the Act requires the application of the \u201cright to control\u201d test. Where the person for whom the services are performed retains the right to control the manner and means by which the result is to be accomplished, the relationship is one of employment. On the other hand, where control is reserved only as to the result sought the relationship is that of independent contractor. The resolution of this question depends upon the facts of each case and no one factor is determinative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APez\">Frito-Lay, Inc. v. NLRB, 385 F.2d 180, 187 (7th Cir. 1967). It is, of course, the <em>right </em>to control and not the actual exercise of that right which is the decisive element. United Insurance Co. of America v. NLRB, 304 F.2d 86, 89 (7th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">In our opinion, the evidence detailed above provides substantial support for the Board\u2019s determination that Peko and Sav-Co. had the right to control the way the Sachs brothers managed Phil\u2019s. Indeed, the sublease and consignment contract, which covered everything from the condition, equipment and the hours of the station to the products available for sale and the number and attitude of employees, were obviously drafted with this right in mind. And the actual intervention of Ben Sachs, Sidney Katz and Ben Pessin in the station\u2019s affairs confirms the existence of this right.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Where petroleum companies have reserved such extensive controls, the courts have generally refused to find that the service station operators were independent contractors. <em>See, e. g., </em>Burriss v. Texaco, Inc., 361 F.2d 169 (4th Cir. 1966); Gulf Refining Co. v. Brown, 93 F.2d 870 (4th Cir. 1938).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">Peko and Sav-Co. have called our attention to the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Site Oil Co. of Missouri v. NLRB, 319 F.2d 86 (1963). Although we are not bound by this authority, it might be noted that the case is distinguishable. The Eighth Circuit recognized that whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>substantial evidence supported the Board\u2019s determination that the station operator did not occupy the status of independent contractor was a close question. It was persuaded, however, by the existence of facts which clearly are not present in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">The only objection which has been raised to the Board\u2019s determinations concerning the \u201cmore arduous\u201d working conditions and discriminatory lay-offs is the lack of responsibility of Peko and Sav-Co. Since there is no other objection, we will enforce that part of the Board\u2019s order dealing with these violations. <em>See </em>NLRB v. National Mineral Co., 134 F.2d 424, 425-426 (7th Cir. 1943), cert. denied, 320 U.S. 753, 64 S.Ct. 58, 88 L.Ed. 448; <em>cf. </em>NLRB v. Ochoa Fertilizer Co., 368 U.S. 318, 322-323, 82 5. Ct. 344, 7 L.Ed.2d 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">On October 2 or 3, 1971, Harvey Sachs discharged one of the station\u2019s four part-time employees, David Templeman, allegedly because of excessive shortages in his accounts. At the union\u2019s demand,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> however, Templeman was reinstated. On October 4, 1971, when Gary Waligorski, another employee, arrived at the station for his shift, Ben and Harvey Sachs told him that he was laid off because they had to reinstate Templeman.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Waligorski then went into the back room of the station to collect his belongings. Ben and Harvey Sachs followed Waligorski and a conversation ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-13\">Q. What did he [Ben Sachs] state to you [Waligorski], again, so \u25a0 we might have everything clear on the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-14\">A. \u201cWho made you join the union?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-15\">Q. And you answered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-16\">A. \u201cNo one made me join the union, it was under by free will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-17\">Q. . . What did he state then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-19\">A. He said, \u201cSpeaking friends to friends, why did you join the union?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-21\">Q. Did you make any response to this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-23\">\u00c1. Yes, I said, \u201cThe union has more to offer, the only way I would get anything would be through the union.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-24\">Q. What happened then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-25\">A. Then he said, \u201cLook where the union got you, you have a $25 initiation fee and you are out of a job.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-27\">Q. Did you make any response to this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-28\">A. I said I had another job lined up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-29\">Q. What happened then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-30\">A. I gathered my stuff and I left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-31\">Tr. 31-32. The administrative law judge concluded that the questioning of Waligorski violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), and the Board affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">We do not believe that Sachs\u2019 questioning of Waligorski concerning his motivation for joining the union constitutes a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1). In NLRB v. Associated Dry Goods Corp., 209 F.2d 593, 595 (1954), the Second Circuit correctly concluded that such innocuous questions are improper only if they could reasonably be interpreted as containing a threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit. <em>Cf. </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c); NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 617, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547; Utrad Corp. v. NLRB, 454 F.2d 520, 525 (7th Cir. 1971); Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. NLRB, 435 F.2d 668, 669 (9th Cir. 1970). There is nothing in the record to indicate that Sachs\u2019 isolated, informal and brief questioning, which came after the employees had already unionized, could be so interpreted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, Waligorski never testified that the \u201cinterrogation\u201d had any effect whatsoever upon him. And, since shortly after the \u201cinterrogation\u201d Waligorski and the other three employees protested Phil\u2019s failure to sign the union contract by going on strike, such an effect can hardly be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">Sachs\u2019 statement that \u201cLook where the union got you, you have a $25 initiation fee and you are out of a job\u201d also is not violative of \u00a7 8(a)(1). The administrative law judge apparently concluded that Waligorski was being told that \u201che had been laid off because of his Union membership . . . .\u201d App. 31. Waligor-ski, however, testified that, when he arrived at the station, Tr. 30. When both of Ben Sachs\u2019 statements to Waligorski are considered, it is clear that he was not being told that his union activity resulted in his discharge. Sachs\u2019 latter statement was merely a summary of what had happened.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is nothing in Waligorski\u2019s testimony to indicate that he thought otherwise. Nor is there any contention that laying off Waligorski was in any way violative of the Act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-8\">Ben Sachs said that they have to take Dave [Templeman] back on days again and ... I asked \u201cWhat are my hours?\u201d and Harvey said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have any hours.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-12\">In sum, we do not believe that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s determination that there was an unlawful interrogation. Accordingly, we decline to enforce paragraph 1(b) of the Board\u2019s order. The Board has argued that, since only Peko and Sav-Co. have challenged its orders in this court, it is entitled to complete enforcement against Phil\u2019s. However, as the Board determined, Phil\u2019s, Peko and Sav-Mart constituted an integrated enterprise and must be treated jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-13\">With the exception of paragraph 1(b), the Board\u2019s order is enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1294-14\">. There is no contention on appeal that Peko and Sav-Co. should be treated as separate entities. Moreover, the administrative law judge found that Peko and Sav-Co. \u201care so integrated in ownership, management and operation that they comprise a single identity for purposes of the Act.\u201d App. 15. The Board adopted this finding, \u201c[njoting the absence of any exceptions\u201d to it. App. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1295-7\">. In reaching this conclusion, the Board observed :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-8\">[Tjhere is no record evidence that Ben Sachs was employed by anyone else or had any other clients; that he had any capital invested in the position, any chance of capital loss, or any chance of obtaining any profits; or that lie had any other in-dicia of being an independent contractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"acx-dedup-0\">App. 7-8. The administrative law judge also indicated that Ben Sachs was an agent. App. 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Ben Sachs gave these directions only during the short period when none of the Sachs brothers was able to manage the station.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1297-8\">. We are aware of the administrative law judge\u2019s finding that Ben Sachs acted out of a \u201cfatherly interest.\u201d App. 16. This finding, however, was based upon Harvey Sachs\u2019 testimony; Ben Sachs was never called as a witness. Harvey testified simply that, during the short period when it was impossible for any of the brothers to manage the station, Ben Sachs managed it \u201csolely as a father-son relationship.\u201d Tr. 134. There is no testimony that Ben Sachs gave orders to the employees and intervened in the station\u2019s labor affairs solely during this period. Furthermore, in light of the terms of the sublease and consignment contract and the activities of Sidney Katz and Ben Pessin, the Board could properly infer that Ben Sachs acted pursuant to his contractual duty \u201cto supervise\u201d Phil\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">Peko and Sav-Co. also contend that Katz and Pessin acted out of a concern for the effects of a picketline on Sav-Mart. Br. at 16-17. The agreements with Phil Sachs, however, gave them the right to terminate his lease if lie did anything \u201cwhich might in any way damage or injure the credit and/or business reputation of Sav-Mart.\u201d Ex. No. (JO-4. Given this concern and this power, tlie Board could properly infer that Katz\u2019 and Pessin\u2019s activities were manifestations of their right to control.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1297-14\">. Respondents contend that such cases, which generally involve tort liability, have no applicability in the labor context. In each case, however, the court considered the common law test of agency. Congress has made clear that this same test is utilized in cases arising under the National Labor Relations Act. NLRB v.

Upon that basis he found that Ben Sachs and Philip Sachs were independent contractors and that the service station in question was not part of the integrated Sav-Mart enterprise of Sav-Co. and Peko Ltd.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-16\">I agree with the trial examiner\u2019s appraisal of the evidence and the result he reached and would therefore deny enforcement of the Board\u2019s .order as to Sav-Co. and Peko Ltd. I accordingly respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
