Metzner, J., dismissing after an admiralty trial La Fortune\u2019s claim against defendant shipowner, Irish Shipping, Ltd., for cargo damage to coils of bright basic wire. In an unreported memorandum opinion, the judge based his decision upon two clauses in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act. The first provides that the carrier shall not be responsible for damage to goods \u201cif the nature or value thereof has been knowingly and fraudulently misstated by the shipper in the bill of lading.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(5). The second clause similarly relieves the carrier of liability if the damage results from \u201cInsufficiency of packing.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2) (n).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-20\">Appellant attacks the district court\u2019s findings applying these exceptions. As to the former, the goods were inaccurately described in the bill of lading, thus reducing the freight, rate from $35-$40 a .ton to approximately $15 a ton. That document by its terms contained the \u201cShipper\u2019s Description of the Goods,\u201d and there was testimony from which the judge could conclude that it is customary for the shipper or his agent to prepare the bill of lading. In addition, while the judge did not use the word \u201cfraudulent,\u201d it is clear in context that his finding that \u201cthe shipper knowingly misstated the nature and value of the shipment,\u201d amounted to a finding of \u201cknowingly and fraudulently misstated.\u201d As to the second exception, at least one witness examined pictures of the original binding and testified that it was inadequate while the opposing evidence offered by plaintiff was inconclusive at best. In sum, none of the judge\u2019s key findings was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-21\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
