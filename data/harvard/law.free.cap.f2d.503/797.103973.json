In each case employees of the appellees had their wages garnished one or more times prior to July 1, 1970. When their wages were again garnished after that date for different debts, they were dismissed from employment pursuant to company rules permitting discharge for multiple wage garnishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">The Secretary of Labor brought suit to reinstate the employees claiming the discharges violated \u00a7 304 of Title III of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1674. It provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-12\">No employer may discharge any employee by reason of the fact that his earnings have been subjected to garnishment for any one indebtedness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">The basis of the Secretary\u2019s complaint was that only garnishments which occur after Title Ill\u2019s effective date of July 1, 1970 may be taken into account for purposes of \u00a7 304. So viewed, the discharges here were occasioned by garnishments for but a single indebtedness and thus prohibited by \u00a7 304. The district courts rejected the Secretary\u2019s claim in holding that pre-July, 1970 garnishments may also be considered. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b862-17\">Appellee Consolidated Freight-ways challenges the district court's jurisdiction. The Secretary had asserted there was jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345 which supplies jurisdiction over all actions \u201ccommenced by the United States, or by any agency or officer thereof expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress.\u201d The only jurisdictional issue which concerns us here is the presence of an express congressional grant of power to sue, and the Secretary argues that \u00a7 306 of Title III, mandating that the Secretary of Labor \u201cshall enforce the provisions of this subchapter,\u201d is such a grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-18\">Consolidated responds that \u00a7 306<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> cannot be taken literally. Under \u00a7 304 criminal penalties are prescribed for its willful violation; no criminal penalties attach to violation of Title Ill\u2019s other substantive enactment, \u00a7 303,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which limits the proportion of a worker\u2019s wages that may be garnished. From this, Consolidated concludes that the scheme of the Act was impliedly for exclusive criminal penalties for \u00a7 304 violations and civil enforcement of \u00a7 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">We do not agree. Section 306 uses the plural \u201cprovisions of this subchap-ter.\u201d Since there are only two substantive sections in Title III, that must mean the power to sue extends to both \u00a7\u00a7 303 and 304. The legislative history confirms that conclusion. The Senate version of the Consumer Credit Protection Act had no restrictions on garnishment, but the House version contained the predecessor to \u00a7 303 and a section prohibiting discharge for only one gar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>nishment. In each of these provisions was a separate subsection authorizing the Secretary to civilly enforce. <em>See </em>114 Cong.Rec. 1856 (1968). In what was a drafting simplification \u2014 as indicated by the lack of comment in the Conference Report<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the use of the term \u201csub-chapter\u201d in \u00a7 306 \u2014 the separate powers were consolidated by the Conference Committee in the final version of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Section 306, therefore, empowers the Secretary to sue in this class of discharge cases, and that is all that is necessary for \u00a7 1345 jurisdiction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">\n<em>Effect of Pre-July, 1970, Garnishments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">We turn now to the central issue in this case: whether an employer may consider pre-July, 1970 garnishments under \u00a7 304. In prohibiting discharge of an employee by reason of a garnishment \u201cfor any one indebtedness,\u201d we think the language of the statute clearly comtemplates that an employer may consider other garnishments for different debts regardless of whether they occurred before or after Title Ill\u2019s effective date. <em>See </em>Brennan v. General Telephone Co., 488 F.2d 157, 158 (5th Cir. 1973). In the legislative background to Title III, there is no indication that Congress intended any differently. Title III was a controversial portion of the Consumer Credit Protection Act. <em>See </em>114 Cong.Rec. 1830-41, 14388 (1968). If Congress had intended to wipe the slate clean of pre-July, 1970 garnishments, that surely would have been noticed in the debates or reports on the bill. Yet Congress nowhere expressed what the Secretary now urges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Still, the Secretary argues that general legislative statements pointing to the harshness of garnishment and the need for a congressional remedy <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are a sufficient index that Congress wished \u00a7 304 to accomplish a garnishment amnesty. However, these statements, reflective of the rhetoric of debate, are equally consistent with the view that Congress chose to adopt a compromise guaranteeing job security to an employee with one indebtedness and consequent garnishment, but not outlawing discharges premised on garnishment altogether. In any case, the statements are far too general to weigh for a sweeping result inconsistent with the plain wording of the statute. If it had been desired to grant this supposed amnesty, it would have been reasonable for Congress to make the wish explicit, and not to leave such an easily accomplished end to be gleaned from the vague generalized objectives of the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-16\">In light of the statute\u2019s plain meaning, it would require very convincing reasons for us to adopt the Secretary\u2019s interpretation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> None of the reasons he offers is of such a convinving character.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-17\">The Secretary relies primarily on a rather ingenious use of statutory definitions. Since Title Ill\u2019s definition of \u201cgarnishment\u201d in \u00a7 302 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> became effective only when Title III itself came into force, he argues, there were no \u201cgarnishments\u201d prior to July 1, 1970. But this misconceives the purpose of statutory definitions. They are normally not keyed to a cutoff date like regulatory provisions. Moreover, to accept this contention would mean an employer could dismiss a worker for a single pre-July, 1970 garnishment because it was not a \u201cgarnishment\u201d within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>The Secretary also points to his administrative interpretations of \u00a7 304 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in accord with his position here and urges on us the notion that such interpretations are to be given judicial deference. Granting that administrative expertise warrants that courts give some weight to agency interpretations, \u201c[t]he deference owed to an expert tribunal cannot be allowed to slip into judicial inertia. . . . \u201d American Shipbuilding Co. v. NLRB, 380 U.S. 300, 318, 85 S.Ct. 955, 967, 13 L.Ed.2d 855 (1965).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-5\">The weight of such [an administrative] judgment in a particular case will depend on the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). The Secretary\u2019s interpretation is simply not persuasive enough to outweigh the clear import of \u00a7 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Finally, our reading of \u00a7 304 does not give it an impermissible retroactive effect. \u201cA statute is not made retroactive merely because it draws upon antecedent facts for its operation.\u201d Cox v. Hart, 260 U.S. 427, 435, 43 S.Ct. 154, 157, 67 L.Ed. 332 (1922). Counting pre-July, 1970 garnishments permits an employer to do what was allowed prior to Title III \u2014base job retention on the avoidance of garnishments \u2014 though limiting that right by the new prerequisite of a previous debt and garnishment. Indeed, to rule an employer cannot consider pre-Ti-tle III garnishments would accord the statute an even greater retroactive effect by negating the meaning of events that had some effect before the statute came into force. <em>See </em>Brennan v. General Telephone Co., 488 F.2d at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">We therefore agree with all but one of the courts that have confronted this issue and hold that \u00a7 304 permits consideration of pre-July, 1970 garnishments.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-20\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1676.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b862-21\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b863-9\">.
