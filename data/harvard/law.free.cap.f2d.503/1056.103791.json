App. \u00a7 465(a) (1970). The section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8DG\">(a) Every person shall be deemed to have notice of the requirements of this title upon publication by the President of a proclamation or other public notice fixing a time for any registration under section 3 [50 U.S. C. App. \u00a7 453],<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1120-18\">The Government asserts that by operation of this section of the Selective Service Act it was relieved of the burden of proving that defendant knowingly failed to register under 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a). We need not decide the correctness of this interpretation, for, in point of fact, the Government tried its case and briefed the appeal' without in any way relying upon this section of the statute. It can not now, after failing to prevail on its original theories, invoke an entirely new theory in support of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-19\">Had the Government proceeded to trial in reliance on this section, the defendant may very well have made a different election in the presentation of his defense, choosing instead, for example, to take the stand. Moreover, had the Government raised this section on appeal, the defendant could have prepared a reply for the court\u2019s consideration. As it is, the petition has all the appearances of an afterthought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-20\">Because the Government\u2019s resort to 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 465(a) is not timely, we have no occasion to consider its application to the conviction before us. <em>See </em>Carr v. FTC, 302 F.2d 688, 691-692 (1st Cir. 1962). Accordingly, the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-21\">ROSS and STEPHENSON, Circuit Judges would grant a rehearing en banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1120-13\">. Seven proclamations, beginning with Proclamation No. 2799, July 20, 1948, 13 Fed. Reg. 4173, 62 Stat. 1531, have been issued by the President pursuant to this section.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
