At the November term, 1883, the case was again tried, and judgment was rendered for the company as if the amount of gas furnished had been only that required by the last ordinance of the village (the value of which the parties agreed to), but without interest or costs.

The question .is one of construction and not of estoppel. The instrument to be construed, when stripped of its unessential and its executed parts, does not require us to ask the court to sustain an exclusive grant, or <em>to urge </em>that the term of the grant is perpetual, or to argue that the council had the right to barter away legislative power. Those features are totally irrelevant, because: (1) So far as they exist they are severable from the other parts of the contract, and may, with propriety, be eliminated and restricted; (2) the grant to construct the gas plant, although exclusive in form, was merged in the performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>of tlie covenant of the village to purchase the plant; (3) after the merger, if the expression be allowed, a contractual relation remained between the parties, which iuvolved only the power of the village to receive and use, and of the company to convey, gas through this plant in specified quantities for an agreed price, during a period involving at least ten years from the date of the contract; and, (4) every principle of justice requires that this contract shall be treated as having continued inviolable, at least to the end of the time that the gas sued for was furnished; and, indeed, that it shall be so treated until the whole contract is renounced.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-5\">Stallo, <em>Kittreclge \u00a7 Wilby, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-6\">The first section of the contract attempts to vest the plaintiff and its successors <em>\u201c </em>with the full and <em>exclusive </em>privilege of extending its gas pipes and mains through the avenues, roads, lanes, alleys, and public grounds of said village.\u201d But this court held, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Gas L. &amp; C.

Nothing is better settled than the doctrine that there is no estoppel against the defense of <em>ultra vires. </em>To say that municipal bodies can estop themselves by acts <em>in pais </em>from denying the validity of contracts, which it was beyond their power to make, is to say that thejr can do indirectly what they have no power to. do, or are forbidden to do, directly; that the powers of a municipal corporation can be enlarged by the corporation itself. The simple statement of such a claim is its own refutation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-5\">See Bigelow on Estoppel, 466 ; <em>Schaeffer </em>v. <em>Bonham, </em>95 Ill. 368 ; <em>McPherson </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>43 Iowa, 48; <em>South Ottawa </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>94 U.

When a contract is susceptible of two different constructions, one of which would render it valid and the other void, the latter must be adopted. <em>James </em>v. <em>Pruden, </em>14 Ohio St. 251; 5 West.

The plaintiff claims that by the terms of the contract of April 27, 1871, the defendant must permit its street lamps to burn plaintiff\u2019s gas from sunset to sunrise, and must pay plaintiff for the same. The defendant claims that, under the statutes of Ohio, it may require the burning of these lamps to cease at one o\u2019clock in the morning, and that it need not pay for the gas consumed against its wish and in violation of its ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Whatever contract the council of Avondale legally made is binding on the defendant and must be performed ; but if the council that entered into the written agreement exceeded its authority and had no power to make the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>tract set out, the defendant is not bound by the illegal ' terms of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Whatever may have been true of municipal corporate charters in mediaeval times as to their being treaties between feudal lords and commercial communities, in this country a municipal corporation isa public corporation created by the state for political purposes, and it has subordinate and local powers, and such powers only as are expressly granted or necessarily implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Its legislative powers can not be delegated or bargained away. \u201cSuch corporations may make authorized contracts, but they have no power, as a party, to make contracts or' pass by-laws (ordinances) which shall cede away, control, or embarrass their legislative or governmental powers, or which shall disable them from performing their public duties.\u201d Dill.

(Rev.

Gas-works are extended when the mains and pipes are prolonged into a village so as to supply the village and its inhabitants with the gas of such works.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">If gas-works used only for manufacturing gas do not include the mains and pipes that convey the gas to the lamp posts and to the consumer (as perhaps they may not), gas works for supplying gas \u201c at the lamp posts in the village \u201d do include the mains and pipes through which the gas is furnished by a company that owns the whole <em>plant, </em>including the rights of way where the same are laid, as in this case. It is admitted that the <em>council </em>of the city or village, where the gas company has its whole plant established, is within the provisions of section 2478; and no principle or reason has been shown why the same provisions should not apply, and do not apply, to the council of a city or village in which the company has one-half of its plant, or any smaller part thereof, when contracting with such company to supply gas to such city or village. In each case the same principles apply, and the same rights are sought to be secured, and similar wrongs are provided against. Sections 2478 and 2485 and their pi*ovisions do apply to these parties and to this agreement. Hence we see that the council exceeded its powers in agreeing to grant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>company an <em>exclusive </em>privilege <em>(The State </em>v. <em>The C. G. L. &amp; G. Co., </em>18 Ohio St. 262), and in agreeing to place beyond the control of the village the <em>price </em>and the <em>quality </em>of gas, as well as the <em>quantity </em>the village would require in future; and the agreement is <em>ultra vires </em>and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The company was bound to know the law and the powers of the council, and there is shown no principle or act of <em>estoppel </em>that prevents the village from now setting up such want of power in that former council, or that es-topped the village from disregarding, <em>in future, </em>and after due notice, any part or all of that contract. The council had power to pass the ordinance of Eebruary 13, 1879, specifying the quantity of gas required by the village for the street lamps.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">It is admitted that the village paid for all the gas it received up to March 1, 1879, under the contract, and now the village must pay a reasonable price for the gas received and used by it under that ordinance of February 13, 1879, not because of the <em>contract, </em>but because the village has <em>used </em>the <em>gas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The amount of gas so used under this ordinance has been agreed upon by the parties, and its value has been fixed by them at $6,331.29. This sum we regard as correct, but it is subject to a credit of $2,000, paid December 2, 1879.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The answer avers that at all times the defendant has been ready and willing to pay for the gas furnished the village up to one o\u2019clock in the morning, as specified in the ordinance of February 13, 1879. But that was not a tender of what was due, and did not stop or prevent interest;\u201c and interest should be allowed on any sum due from the time the same became due.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The plaintiff is also entitled to costs in the case (Rev. Stats., \u00a7 1319).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">There was error in the judgment as to the interest and costs, and for such error the</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">\n<em>Judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded, with instructions.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
