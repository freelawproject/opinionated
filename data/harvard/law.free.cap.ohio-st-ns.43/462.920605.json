His property consisted of one hundred and forty-one acres of land in Morrow county, a few hundred dollars\u2019 worth of live stock and farming implements, etc., and about $7,000.00 in promissory notes. There were thirty-eight notes, of various amounts, from $5.00 to $750.00, and interest, and bearing divers dates, from August 7, 1867, to July 20, 1830, as set forth. He left surviving him his widow, Elizabeth A. Gano, the plaintiff in error; Chloe J. Eisk, who intermarried with I. J. Eisk, the administrator; Caroline O. Pearson, who intermarried with B. J. Pearson; and Sarah A. Coomer, who intermarried with C. D. Coomer, children of his first wife; and Erank ~W. Gauo by his second wife and present widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-7\">On June 14,1880,1. J. Eisk was appointed administrator of decedent\u2019s estate, and entered upon the discharge of his \u2022trust. Appraisers wore appointed, and on July 9,1880, the personal property of the deceased, including the notes, was duly appraised as assets of his estate. The administrator collected a large part of the notes. On November 23,1881, the children of the first wife filed a petition in the court of common pleas of Morrow county against I. J. Eisk, as administrator of Samuel Gano, Elizabeth A. Gano, the widow, and Erank <em>W. </em>Gano, setting up ownership in themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>and Prank <em>W. </em>Gano to all the promissory notes; and they asked that on the final hearing of the cause I. J. Pisk be by the court ordered to deliver up to. the plaintiffs and Prank <em>W. </em>Gano all the notes and claims that remain uncollected, and also to deliver in like manner all the moneys that have been by him collected on the same, and that the notes and claims, with the money collected on the same, may be adjudged by the court to be the money and-property of the plaintiffs and Prank <em>W. </em>Gano, or that they may have judgment for the same and for such other further and different relief as is equitable in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\">To the petition the administrator answered \u201c that he can not deny the statements and allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s petition; that he has collected a portion of the claims, and now holds the same, and those claims that are uncollected are also in his hands ; that he is ready and willing to pay the moneys so collected and to deliver the claims as the court shall direct, and he asks that the court make such order and judgment and decree in this action as will fully protect him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-6\">Prank <em>W. </em>Gano did not answer.

J. Fisk was appointed administrator of the estate of said deceased; that at the same time appraisers wei\u2019e appointed, who, after being qualified on the 9th day of July, 1880, on the premises of said deceased, inventoried and appraised the personal property of said decedent, including said notes; that the box containing said notes was brought back by Mrs. Fisk, and by the administrator turned over to the appraisers as assets of said decedent, to be inventoried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>and appraised as part of his estate; that Mrs. Fisk and the other heirs at law of said decedent never relinquished their claim upon said notes, claiming the notes as a gift from their father.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">And thereupon the court said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-6\">\u201cWe find and declare the law to be upon the findings of fact aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-7\">\u201c1.

But in the case at bar no question of fraud is made. Eor aught that appears upon the record, the wife was well and amply provided for.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b493-6\">Eollett, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATD\">These promissory notes are claimed as gifts <em>causa mortis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The principles and laws that govern the rights of ownership and control of property are fundamental to man\u2019s enjoyment and civilization. The rules and laws for the transfer or \u2022 transmission of such rights are carefully guarded, and should be strictly enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Gifts <em>causa mortis </em>are not favored, and such gifts must be clearly proved. The civil law sought to prevent fraud in such gifts, and required their execution in the presence of five witnesses, to render them valid. Great strictness and clear proof to establish such gifts have been required by the English courts, and litigation as to them has been extensive and hostile.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Such a gift can be upheld only when the intention of the donor is definite and certain, and such intent is expressed as to a proper matter of such gift, and such gift is executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Whatever property Samuel Gano had <em>at his death </em>could be disposed of only by his will or by the law. <em>Needles </em>v. Needles, 7 Ohio St. 433; <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Doty, </em>1 Ohio St. 283.</p>\n<p id=\"AQl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>This court held, in <em>Phipps </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>16 Ohio St. 586, that \u201c directions by an owner in respect to a disposition of his property, to take effect after his death, and different from such as the law would prescribe in case of intestacy, are of no validity unless made through the medium of a last will and testament.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Directions alone are not sufficient. A gift <em>causa mortis </em>has the nature of a legacy. It is a gift in prospect of death, and it may be revoked before death, and it is not complete during the donor\u2019s life, but takes effect only upon his death. Such a gift is liable to the debts of the donor. Such is the holding of both English and American courts. '</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>1 P. Wins. 441, a husband upon his death bed gave to his wife a purse of 100 guineas and bid her apply it to her own use, and the court held, \u201c This is a <em>donatio causa mortis </em>and a good <em>legacy </em>to the wife, and shall not go to the executors or administrators of the husband if there is sufficient to pay his debts.\u201d But we need not cite other decisions, as the statute 8 and 9 Yictoria, c. 76, declares, that such a gift is a legacy within the meaning of the acts in England and Ireland, which impose duties on legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u201c A <em>donatio causa mortis </em>is of .the nature, of a legacy.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>84 N. H. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u201c Gifts <em>causa mortis </em>are of a mixed nature, resembling gifts <em>inter vioos, </em>in the essential requisite of delivery, and resembling legacies in being subject to the debts of the deceased, and in being ambulatory or revocable, and contingent on death.\u201d <em>Bloomer </em>v. <em>Bloomer, 2 </em>Brad. 340. Also see <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>64 Pa. St. 18, Rop. Leg. <em>2 ; </em>3 Red.

Decedent left a widow, three girls who were children of a first wife, and a boy the son of his widow. These promissory notes constituted the larger part of his estate. Before his last sickness he had <em>expressed a desire </em>that his son Frank should have his <em>farm, </em>and that \u201c his children aforesaid\u201d should have the notes. Do the words \u201chis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>children aforesaid\u201d include <em>only the </em>\u201cchildren of his first wife,\u201d or do they include his son Frank? Give the words either meaning, and his <em>expressed desire </em>was not carried out, and is not asked to be carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">At his death bed, though boarding with his son Frank, there were present only two of his children, the married daughters of his first wife, and I. J. Fisk, the husband of one of these children; and on the morning of the day he died, in the presence of this husband, and Caroline Pearson, her sister, \u201che <em>called </em>Mrs. Fisk, and said to her, my notes are in <em>a </em>little box on the bureau <em>there ; </em>I want you to take them and divide them equally among you children.\u201d There was but one person present who is not a beneficiary of this claimed gift, and he is the husband of the chief actor, who got the key and tried it in the box, and, \u201c for fear she might los\u00e9 it,\u201d gave the key to this husband. It does not appear that a word was'said to the other daughter, or that he told her to take any thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\"We will not stop to consider whether this husband should testify in such a case, or what effect should be given to his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The father died the same evening, on Friday, and was buried the next day, on Saturday.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\u201cAfter her father\u2019s death, Mrs. Fisk took the box containing the notes home with her.\u201d What else was in the box we do not know. The notes were never divided. On the next Monday, I. J. Fisk was appointed administrator, and took these notes, and they were appraised as part of the estate, and have ever been so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">The validity of each gift, <em>causa mortis, </em>depends upon the facts of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">\u201c The gift of the maker\u2019s own note is the delivery of a promise only, and not of the thing promised; and upon the death of the maker, leaving the promise unfulfilled, the gift fails.\u201d <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Starr, </em>9 Ohio St. 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">\u201c The drawer of a cheek delivered it to the payee, intending thereby to give to the payee the fund on which the cheek was drawn. <em>Held, </em>that until the check was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>either paid or accepted, the gift was incomplete, and that, in the absence of such payment or acceptance, the death of the drawer operated, as against the payee, as a revocation of the check.\u201d <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Savings Society, </em>31 Ohio St. 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In each above case there was something more to be done, either by the donor or by the donee, before the gift could be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\"><em>\u201c </em>To constitute a vailid gift the transfer must be consummated, and not remain incomplete, or rest in more intention ; and this is so whether the gift is by delivery only, or by the creation of a trust in a third person, or in the donor; enough must be done to pass the title.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Funk, </em>75 N. Y. 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The words, found by the court to constitute the gift of the notes, were, \u201c I want you to take them and divide them eqnally among you children.\u201d Suppose he thus intended <em>the four </em>children, what was Mrs. Eisk to do ? Was she to collect the money due on the notes, and then divide the proceeds equally among them ? If so, the gift was not complete, and no title passed. His death revoked the gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Or was Mrs. Eisk to divide the notes into <em>four </em>equal amounts in value, and then deliver to each child a definite parcel of these thirty-eight notes ? This was never done, and these notes, it seems, could not be so divided. So there never was a separation of the notes made so as to vest in each donee an ownership in particular notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">But, had the notes been so that they could be equally divided, how could the doubtful or worthless notes be disposed of? Who would take them ? Or should she disregard them ? Gano did not hand the notes to Mrs. Eisk, and say, \u201c I give these notes to you four children;\u201d neither did he say, \u201c I give these notes to you children equally, one-fourth part to each.\u201d Something more must be done to complete the gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">But the delivery must be as perfect and complete as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>nature of the thing given will admit of. Par. Con. *326, and cases cited; 3 Wait. Act. &amp; Def. 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><em>\u201c </em>To establish a gift, <em>causa mortis, </em>the common law requires clear and unmistakable proof, not only of .an intention to give, but of an actual gift perfected by as complete \u00e1 delivery as the nature of the property will admit of.\u201d <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>56 Me. 324. See also 3 Red. Wills, 348 (20).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The facts found by the district court show there was no delivery of the alleged gifts; and the court erred in holding, upon such finding of facts, that there was such a delivery of the promissory notes as constitutes a good gift, <em>causa mortis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">We need not examine how far the courts will protect a widow from an intended fraud upon her rights as such widow, neither to what extent a father may disinherit his children by gifts made during the last few hours or days of his life. Our laws relating to written and nuncupative wills, and our laws of descent, should not be defeated by such gifts, unless in a very clear case.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Cases of donations, <em>causa mortis, </em>are exceptions not to be extended by way of analogy. <em>Headley </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>18 Pa. St. 326; also cited in 1 Am. Law Reg. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">This attempt to make a will for the father, and to dispose of his property, \u201c different from such as the law would prescribe in case of intestacy,\u201d is \u201c of no validity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
