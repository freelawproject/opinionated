Teeters &amp; Son, for a valuable consideration, executed, in the name of said firm, and delivered to the plaintiff their promissory note of that date, for the payment of the sum of $9,858 to the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>or order, one year after date, with eight per cent, interest, to be paid semi-annually.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-5\">\u201cBefore the maturity of said note the plaintiff assigned the same to Lydia B. Clayton; and, on the 2lst day of November, 1871, while she was the owner thereof, the defendant, Richard <em>W. </em>Teeters, executed and delivered to her, to secure the payment of said note, his mortgage deed of that date, whereby he conveyed to her, her heirs and assigns forever, lots numbered sixty and sixty-one, in E. Teeters\u2019 addition to the incorporated village of Alliance, in said county of Stark, which mortgage was left for record on the 12th day of December, 1871, and duly recorded on the 30th of the same month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-6\">\u201cPrior to the 14th day of July, 1873, the said Lydia B. Clayton, for a valuable consideration, reassigned said note and transferred said mortgage to the plaintiff. Said mortgage was subject to a prior mortgage on the same real estate, executed and delivered to one Patrick C. Hull on the 1st of June, 1870, and duly recorded, to secure the payment of a promissory note, of the same date, for the sum of $4,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-7\">\u201c On the 14th day of July, 1873, the plaintiff, being then the owner of said note and mortgage first described, made and entered into a written contract of that date with the defendants, which was signed by the plaintiff, and by him delivered to the defendants, who accepted and assented to the same, whereby the defendants agreed, in consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s part thereof, to remove and discharge the priority of said Hull\u2019s mortgage, so that the one held by the plaintiff, as aforesaid, should come in as a first lien upon said real estate, for the purpose of payment in case of a foreclosure. In consideration of which agreement of the defendants, and for no other or further consideration, the said plaintiff, by said contract, agreed to look for the satisfaction of his said note to the said mortgaged premises, a copy of which written contract is hereto attached and herewith filed and made a part of this petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-8\">\u201cThe plaintiff further says he was always ready and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>willing and offered defendants to duly perform the conditions of said contract on his part to be performed, but the defendants were unwilling and failed and refused, in any manner, to remove or discharge the priority of said Hull\u2019s mortgage, so that said mortgage of plaintiff' should, or could, come in as a first lien on said premises in case of foreclosure, for the purpose of payment. On the contrary, on the 11th day of October, 1873, the said Hull commenced an action in this court to foreclose his said mortgage ; in which action the plaintiff, the defendants and others were made defendants, and duly served with a summons; and such proceedings were had in said action that both mortgages were foreclosed therein, and that of said Hull was adjudged to have priority over that of the plaintiff, and said real estate was ordered to be sold in said action, and the sheriff was ordered, out of the proceeds of sale, to pay : first, the costs; second, the amount of the decree on the said mortgage of said Hull, to wit, the sum of $4,030.50, with interest from September 17, 1874; and, third, the amount found due the plaintiff on his said mortgage, to wit, the sum of $9,506.22. 'Afterward, one William P. Martin was, on his own motion, made a defendant in said action, and set up a lien on said premises arising out of a purchase of the same at tax sale ; and the court ordered tbe said sheriff, out of the proceeds of the sale of said real estate to pay to said Martin, the sum of $1,328.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-5\">\u201c The sheriff, under said order, sold said real estate for the sum of $8,667, out of which he paid, first, the costs, amounting to $317.90; second, said sum of $1,328 to said Martin; third, on the 27th of August, 1878, in full of said Hull decree, the sum of $4,943.37; and, fourth, on the 23d of July, 1878, to the plaintiff, on his said decree, the sum of $1,318.16; and on the 6th of December, 1878, the further sum of $620 on the same, making together the sum of $1,938.16, which is the entire sum the plaintiff has received or can realize on his said claim out of said premises ; and, after giving defendants credit for said sum, and also for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>other payments made on the same, there still remains due to the plaintiff thereon a sum exceeding $8,500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-5\">\u201c If the defendants, within a reasonable time after making said contract, had removed or discharged the priority of the said Hull mortgage, as by said contract they were bound to do, the said mortgage owned by plaintiff\" would have been full security for his said claim; but, in consequence of the failure and refusal of defendants to do so, thereby violating and breaking their said contract, the plaintiff'has only been able to and can realize out of said mortgage property, on his suit claimed, said sum of $1,938.16, to the damage of plaintiff in the sum of $9,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-6\">\u201c Wherefore, plaintiff demands judgment against defendants for said sum of $9,000, his damages sustained, as aforesaid; or, if necessary and effectual, to give the plaintiff an adequate and full remedy for defendants\u2019 said breaches of contract, that the court may adjudge and declare said contract rescinded and annulled, and for other proper relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-7\">\u201c S.

Teeters\u2019 addition to Alliance, Ohio, as will more fully appear by reference to the mortgage lien records of Stark county ; and that whereas, since said 21st day of November, 1871, the said L. L.

The right of the plaintiff, Lamborn, to recover on the writing, even if the writing had been signed by the Teeters, depended not on Lamborn\u2019s willingness and readiness to perform his agreements therein specified, but also on the condition that he absolutely discharged' the defendants from any liability on the note of May 31, 1870.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"An_\">Ve will first consider the questions raised by the demurrer to the petition in case No. 970. The cause of action contained therein may be stated thus: The defendants, in consideration that plaintiff would release them from personal liability on the note held by him against them, and look to the mortgage security solely for his pay, promised the plaintiff to remove and discharge the prior lien of Hull upon the mortgaged premises, so that the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage would become the first lien thereon. The debt for which Hull held a lien was the defendants\u2019 debt, and they were the owners of the equity of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The plaintiff released the personal liability of defendants in writing, but the defendants failed to perform their promise. Hull\u2019s mortgage was foreclosed and was held to be a prior lien to that- of plaintiff. Of'the proceeds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>mortgaged premises Hull received $4,9-13.37, leaving a balance insufficient to satisfy plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">We can see no defect in tbe cause of action thus stated. It is contended by plaintiffs in error that the petition did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, inasmuch as it did not aver \u201cthat defendants had agreed in <em>writing </em>to pay the debt due to Hull.\u201d It was not necessary to so aver. The debt to Hull was their own debt and not the \u201cdebt of another.\u201d The case was not within the \u2022statute of frauds. It was sufficient to allege a verbal promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">It is also contended that it was not alleged that Lam-born had released defendants from personal liability on the note. We understand from the petition that such release was actually made.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Eor error in sustaining the demurrer to this petition, we think the judgment of the court of common pleas was rightfully reversed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">If the facts be as stated in the petition in case 970, or as stated in <em>thq first </em>defense in the answer in case 699, as they are admitted by the demurrer to be, the personal liability of defendants below' on the note sued on in case 699 can not be maintained, and as such personal liability is the only contention in 699, it would follow that the matter set up in the <em>second </em>defense in the answer in case 699 would be wholly unimportant and immaterial betw\u2019een the parties. True, the demurrer to the <em>first </em>defense was sustained, but as final judgment in the case was rendered for the defendants, no complaint as to that.ruling on the demurrer was made in the district court and none is made here, yet it follow's from what has been said above as to the sufficiency of the petition in 970, that the demurrer to the <em>first </em>defense in 699 ought to have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">The admission of the facts by the demurrer, however, is to be regarded only for the purposes of the demurrer, and if it turn out that the facts so pleaded be not true, the matters set up in the <em>second </em>defense, upon which issue was taken by reply, become material in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The matters relied on in the <em>second </em>defense raise this question : Where a mortgagor sells the mortgaged premises to a third person who, as part of the price, assumes and agrees with the mortgagor to pay the mortgage debt, of which assumption the mortgagee has notice, does an agreement with the purchaser by the mortgagee to extend the payment of the mortgage debt, without the consent of the mortgagor, discharge the mortgagor from personal liability to pay the debt?</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The question raised here does not involve the element of novation of the debt, as it is clear from the testimony that the mortgagee did not agree to accept the purchaser as his sole debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The point relied on by plaintiffs in error is, that after such assumption by the purchaser he becomes the principal debtor, and the maker of the note is his surety merely, so that the familiar doctrine applies, that the giving of additional time for payment by the creditor to the principal debtor, by a valid agreement between them, without.the knowledge or consent of the surety, releases the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The solution of this question, we think, depends upon another. It may be admitted that as between mortgagor and purchaser, the relation of principal and surety exists, but, whether the creditor is effected thereby is another question. We are aware that decided cases differ upon this point. <em>Boardman </em>v. <em>Larrabee, </em>51 Conn. 89; <em>Murray v. </em>Marshall, 94 N. Y. 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">In our own state, the general doctrine is discussed in <em>Ide </em>v. Churchill, 14 Ohio St. 372, but the exact point is not decided. It is, however, laid down that \u201cany material alteration of the terms of the agreement to which the surety acceded, made by a valid agreement between the principal parties, without his consent, will work his entire discharge from all liability; but where the original obligation remains unchanged, and only his equitable rights or remedies have been invaded by the wrongful act or omission of the creditor, he will be relieved only to the extent of his actual injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>At the time the <em>note </em>in suit was executed, Teeters &amp; Son became absolutely and in all events bound to Lamborn for the payment thereof. This obligation was without condition, and no alteration has been since made by the contracting parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Teeters &amp; Son afterward, for a valuable consideration, obtained a promise from a third person to pay the note, whereof the payee had notice, but he was not a party to this contract. True, he consented to receive payment if tendered from the third person, but he did not consent to look to such third person as his sole or even principal debtor. The obligation of the makers of the note as to him remained as it was when the note was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The fact that the creditor could enforce the promise of the purchaser by action in his own name does not change the legal relations between the parties. The right to such remedy on collateral securities held by the creditor would also exist, but the relation of creditor and principal debtor existing between the parties to the note is not thereby changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">No doubt any loss sustained by the debtor by reason of the extension of the time of payment given by the creditor to the purchaser would, <em>pro </em>tanto, discharge the debtor, but we can find no good reason for holding that the mere facts of such extension should, <em>ipso facto, </em>discharge the debtor from, his liability to pay the whole or any portion of the debt,-whether or not any loss resulted from such extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The second defense does not allege auy loss or damage to the defendants by reason of the extension. We are of opinion, therefore, that it did not state facts sufficient-to constitute a defense to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
