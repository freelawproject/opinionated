After such proof the insurer served notice of its intention to rebuild, \u201c acting jointly with other insurance companies claiming to be interested.\u201d At the time of the fire and of this notice, there were ten separate policies, in as many different companies, upon the same building; eight of which served like notices, severally signed by the company serving them. Before the time expired to rebuild, but while these insurers were taking steps for that purpose, the plaintiff compromised and settled with all said companies so electing to rebuild, except defendant, and released each of them from all liability, receiving for such release an amount of money in the aggregate much less than the amount of these policies. The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ant\u2019s policy had this condition: \u201c In no case shall the claim be for a greater sum than the actual damages to or cash value of the property at the time of the fire; nor shall the assured be entitled to recover of this company in a greater proportion of the loss or damage than the amount hereby insured bears to the whole sum insured on said property, whether such other insurance he by specific, or by general, or floating policies, and without reference to the solvency or liability of other insurance.\u201d <em>Held:</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-5\">1. That the liability of the defendant on its policy as a money indemnity for loss or damage by fire was by above quoted condition in its policy, <em>several </em>and not <em>joint.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-7\">2. That the service by defendant of its intention to rebuild, acting jointly with the other companies, having like concurrent insurance, and serving like notices, converted the respective policies from contracts for a money indemnity into contracts of indemnity, payable in repairing or rebuilding, to be performed in the time named in the policy, but if no time is specified, then within a reasonable time.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-9\">3. Upon such conversion by the election of the insurers, their'liability for failure to rebuild is several, and not joint, unless this several liability was, by agreement with plaintiff, converted into a joint liability. The service of the notices did not operate to change the terms of this policy. Hence the plaintiff may recover on this policy such share of the whole damage as the sum insured bears to the whole amount insured without reference to the solvency or liability of other insurance.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-11\">4. That after the policy has been thus converted into a building contract, the insured might settle and compromise with any of the companies thus bound to rebuild without releasing the others from such proportionate share of such loss as their policies bore to the aggregate insurance.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-13\">5. That in ascertaining defendant\u2019s proportionate share of the entire loss, reference must be had to the aggregate insurance without regard to the fact that some of the companies had been settled with for a less sum than they were liable for, or that others did not elect to rebuild, or were insolvent or not liable.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-15\">Error.

Although a reasonable time had elapsed, nothing whatever was done toward performing such contract, and on October 23, 1878, it notified the plaintiff that it did not intend to, and would not rebuild.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-6\">On the same day the parties mutually agreed that certain persons named \u201c should appraise and estimate at the true cash value the damages by fire to said property which appraisement and estimate in writing by them, or any two of them, should be binding on both parties so far as regards such appraisement of loss or damage to said building.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-7\">On the 24th of October, these appraisers made their report that such damage amounted to f32,990, of which de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>fendant had due notice, but has failed to pay the same on any part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\">Wherefore he prays judgment for $10,000, with interest from October 24, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-6\">The answer admits a <em>partial </em>loss not exceeding $20,000, of which it had due notice; that it served upon plaintiff as alleged notice of its intention to repair, but has not done so by reason of the following state of facts: That at the time the fire occurred, plaintiff had other insurance in nine other companies, aggregating $32,000, making the total insurance $33,000; that eight of said companies, including this defendant, having $29,000 of insurance, gave notice of their intention to repair the building; that two companies which gave no such notice, and which had $4,000 insurance, did not elect to rebuild; that the several companies representing $29,000 of insurance, including this defendant, advertised for bids, and let the same, and were about to enter into a contract with the successful bidder, when the plaintiff, without the knowledge or consent of the defendant, compromised and settled with said several companies, except the two who had not elected to rebuild, for about $20,650, and released said companies from all claims upon them to rebuild and restore said building; that when this settlement came to the knowledge of defendant, this defendant and plaintiff \u201c waiving all acts done or rights accruing under said notice to rebuild and repair \u201d (except as to defendant\u2019s share of expense to plaintiff for preparing plans and specifications for rebuilding, amounting to $37.50, which it has always been ready and willing to pay), the parties entered into an agreement in writing, to submit the amount of loss and damage according to the provisions of said policy to appraisers, as stated in the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-7\">The reply admits that there was $33,000 of insurance, but that $3,000 thereof was in favor of one Hall, a mortgagee, to secure his interest in said property. It admits that the eight companies carrying insurance to the amount of $29,000 did, on July 24, 1878, give notices which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>were several and not joint of their intention to repair and rebuild, each of which notices was severally signed by -the respective companies so electing.

It appears that after the settlement and compromise with the seven companies, which, with the plaintiff, had elected to rebuild, the parties to this action attempted to compromise. Upon this point Eoust, the general agent of the company, testifies as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">\u201cOn the 19th day of October, 1878, S. 8. Bloom, president of the company, received a letter from J. J. Hall, requesting the company to settle the loss ; Bloom answered that I would be there Tuesday or Wednesday following; Tuesday, October 22, 1878, at five o\u2019clock p. m., I arrived at Akron for the purpose of settling Good\u2019s loss; soon after coming there I went from the Sumner House to Good\u2019s building, where the fire occurred ; I saw that they had already commenced preparatory work for rebuilding the same. Wednesday, October 23, 1878, p. m., I met Messrs. Upson and Hall, attorneys for Good, in Hall\u2019s office; they claimed one thousand dollars and damages of the Buckeye; I refused to settle in- this way, and made them two propositions : first, to compromise on same basis as other companies; or, second, to have an appraisement by two or three disinterested competent persons; they said they would consult with Good. October 23d, in the evening, I met J. J. Hall and Jacob Good, in the office of the former, and we then entered into an agreement in writing. The following persons were selected as appraisers: Frank Lukesh, D. W. Thomas, and William H. Smith, architects, who were to appraise the damage by fire to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>property insured under the policy. Before Good consented to sign said agreement he wanted me to pay our share of damages for not rebuilding; this I had first refused to do. We finally, agreed that the company would pay the sum of thirty-seven and 50-100 dollars as its proportion of the cost of the plans and specifications. Good then signed the agreement to leave it to appraisers. At Shelby, Ohio, Tuesday, October 29, 1878, report of appraisers on the Good loss came to hand from Akron. The appraisement was not satisfactory to me for several reasons, one of which was, they counted in plate-glass, not covered by our policy, and on which I understood Good had separate insurance. I ordered the secretary to say to Good that we would pay him ($834.83) eight hundred and thirty-four and 83-100 dollars, including thirty-seven and 50-100 dollars, the amount of damages for not rebuilding, as agreed upon; also, dis'count for ninety days at ten per cent per annum.

But even if the contract was evidence tending to prove a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>waiver by the plaintiff, it should have been, left to the jury to determine whether it was a waiver or not. <em>Short </em>v. <em>Home Ins.

Co., supra; </em>3 Am. Law Reg. (N. S.) 414. The court, in substantially charging the jury that the plaintiff, by a settlement with the other companies, released his claim upon the defendant, based its theory upon the form of the notice served by the defendant declaring its intention to rebuild. But the plaintiff had nothing to do with either the form or the substance of the notice served upon him. The notice is signed by the <em>defendant. </em>The defendant gives notice that <em>it </em>intends to <em>rebuild </em>\u2014 it demands plans and specifications of the destroyed building.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-6\">The plaintiff neither directly nor indirectly interfered with the defendant executing its contract to rebuild. By the settlement with the other companies they were not released from their obligation to the defendant, if there were any.

After the several notices of intention jointly to rebuild, the companies became jointly liable to the plaintiff to replace the injured property, irrespective of cost.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-9\">Here are eight companies undertaking, with $29,000, to erect a building which may cost more or less than that sum. So far as the assured is concerned it makes no difference to him. He is entitled to have the building restored for which he has paid the contractors in advauce. He can not sue the companies separately on their contract to rebuild, because each one has agreed with him \u201cjointly with the others \u201d to do the work. Each one is liable to do the whole work in the sense in which each partner is liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>for the obligations of the firm, and as between the plaintiff and any one of the companies there is no measure of liability short of the cost of the entire job. The amount \u00f3f the policy would furnish no guide, because the policy, by the notice to rebuild, has been converted into a building contract, where the consideration is all paid in advance. <em>Morrell </em>v. <em>Irving Fire Ins.

As there could, in the nature of the case, be no other way than to pay in money, that method of indemnity was contemplated. The appraisers were directed, not to find what a new building would cost, but were \u201c hereby directed to exclude from the amount of damages any sum for previous depreciation from age, location, ordinary use, or cause whatever, and simply arrive at the damage actually caused by said fire.\u201d If replacing the old building by a new one was intended, why get at \u201c the actual damage,\u201d making the deductions specified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-9\">4.

The original obligation of the defendant under the policy of insurance was several and entirely independent of any other. The preliminary negotiations were with the defendant, and not with any meeting or coalition of companies. The premium was paid to the defendant individually, and not as a member of any association. No other company derived any benefit from that premium, directly or indirectly. The policy was a separate instrument; its stipulations were, on the one side, those of the plaintiff alone, and on the other, those of the defendant alone, and it was signed by no other party. No provision contemplated making any one else a party, or allowing any other person to be brought in to share the burdens or benefits of the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-6\">On the contrary, the defendant took special care effectually to exclude even those mutual relations and duties which the law would otherwise have implied, by limiting its liability to its <em>pro rata </em>share of the loss. It has been held, and it is clearly the law, that when the policy contains that clause, the company must look out for itself. If it pays more than its share of the loss, it can call for no contribution; nor, on the other hand, can it shield itself from responsibility by alleging that others have already paid more than their portion, or even that the plaintiff has been fully indemnified. It is to be presumed, also, in the absence of proof, that all the policies contained the same provisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-7\">In the case of <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Jefferson Ins. Co., </em>6 Cowen, 685, it was held that the defendants have no concern with the amounts paid by the other insurers, and to constitute a defense it must be shown \u201c that the companies in fact paid a sum of money, which was received in full satisfaction of all the insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-9\">In this case, the several amounts paid by the other companies were received in satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s claims against these companies only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-10\"><em>2. </em>It is claimed that the notice given by the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>rebuild changed its several obligation into a joint obligation with others, who are not however, named in the notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-5\">The notice of an election to rebuild has, according to the best authorities, the effect of changing an agreement to indemnify in money, subject to the conditions of the policy, into a building contract, subject to no conditions. <em>Morrell </em>v. <em>Irving Fire Ins. Co., </em>33 N. Y. 429-449.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-6\">It is true that the learned judge in <em>Morrell </em>v. <em>Irving Fire Ins. Co. </em>says, that in his opinion the assured might have an action against both insurers jointly, but the point did not arise, for the action was brought against one alone, and it was held to have been well brought. It may also be observed that the two companies <em>united in one notice </em>of their intention to rebuild. See, upon this point, the reasoning of the eminent jurist Prof. Theo. W. Dwight, 3 Am. Law Reg. (N. S.) 414.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-7\">The defendant relies upon the words in the notice* \u201c acting jointly with other insurance companies claimed to be interested.\u201d \u25a0 But it takes\u201d two make a bargain, and the plaintiff never agreed to enter into a contract with the defendant and any other company. The notice refers to the general conditions of the policy as the authority for giving the notice, and those conditions give the absolute right of election to rebuild. The consent of the plaintiff was neither required nor requested, but the notice was given as a matter of right. The claim that the building contract is a joint contract can not in any view of the case be sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-8\">If the other insurance companies violated any agreement made by them with the defendant, it has a plain and adequate remedy for such violation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-9\">3. Was the agreement to submit to an estimate and appraisal of the damages to the insured property by arbitrators a waiver of any claim against the defendant for not rebuilding ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-10\">As this agreement, which was in the usual printed form used by insurance companies, did not mention or refer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>any claim against the defendant upon a contract to rebuild, it certainly did not expressly waive such claim, or rescind such contract. The most that can be claimed is that the making of such an agreement, if unexplained, would tend to prove that the parties regarded the policy as still in force. It did not, as matter of law, rescind the building contract, and the other evidence showed clearly that it was not in fact so intended, but was signed by the plaintiff under a mistake as to its terms and object. This question should have been left to the jury.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b434-5\">Johnson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIJ\">Two questions are presented as grounds for reversal of this judgment: First, as to the construction by the court below of the agreement to appraise the damages made on October 23, 1878; second, as to so much of the charge of the court as relates to the effect of the several notices given by the eight different companies to restore the building, and the effect of the compromise with seven of the companies electing to z\u2019ebuild upon plaintiff\u2019s right to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">1. As to the effect of the agreement to arbitrate the value of the loss or damage sustained by the fire: upon this point the charge is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u201c In this connection I will say to you that, under the provisions of the policy, it was optional with the insuz\u2019ance company to indemnify the plaintiff for his loss, either in money or by rebuilding the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">\u201cIf this agreement had been entered into prior to the notice to rebuild, I should Bay to you that it related to any subsequent acts of the parties, and that is so because its provisions relate to both modes of indemnifying the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">\u201c But having beezz entered into after serving the notice to rebuild, it must be considered as having reference to that provision of the policy relating to paying money as indemnity for paying the loss, and as waiving the contract to rebuild. Such portion of it as relates to other acts of the parties must be considered as irrelevant in the construction of the contract. The proper construction to be given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>this agreement is, that it relates to the question of the loss under the policy originally, and the payment of that loss in money. This is the view in which I feel compelled to require you to consider this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">To which charge, commencing with the word \u201c But,\u201d at the beginning of the last paragraph, the plaintiff' then and there excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">2. As to the effect of the notices to rebuild, the duties and obligations created by the parties, and also the effect of the settlement with seven of the eight companies upon the right of the plaintiff to maintain an action against the eighth, the charge is as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u201c Under the policy the defendant had the right to indemnify the plaintiff by paying in money the damages by reason of the fire to the extent of the amount of its policy, or by electing to rebuild and repair the building, in which latter case it must give notice of its intention to repair and rebuild, in which event, on giving such notice, the relation of the parties changed, and it becomes the privilege and duty of the company to reconstruct the building substantially in the same condition as it was when destroyed, and this without reference to the amount of the policy, and the measure of damages for the breach of such a contract would be the cost of restoring the building to its former value and condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\u201c If there was but one policy, and consequently but one notice to rebuild, there would be but little difficulty in determining the rights and liabilities of the company; but iu this case there were several companies which gave notice of their intention to repair, and those notices were not independent of each other, but were all to the effect that the companies, acting jointly with the others, intended to repair and rebuild the building. This defendant gave no notice of its intention, alone and independent of the other companies, to rebuild. It did not say, with its $1,000 policy, it alone would restore the building that would cost more than $30,000, and upon which there was other insurance to an amount of some $30,000 or more, wfithout the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>assistance of such, other companies. But its notice was that it is the intention of this company, acting jointly with other insurance companies claimed to be interested, to repair and rebuild the premises. Its undertaking was to rebuild jointly with the other companies representing $28,000 of insurance on the damaged building, which companies had served like notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">There being no objection to the form or substance of those notices, the plaintiff must be held to have accepted them with all the obligations they imposed upon him, and all the rights they gave the defendant, and duties they imposed upon it and the other companies acting jointly with the defendant. Among these were the duty and liability of each and all of these companies to aid in and contribute \u25a0to the repairing of this building, and in the event that the defendant should be compelled to rebuild alone, it could compel contribution proportionately from all the other companies joining in the enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u201c It imposed upon the plaintiff the duty of not interfering with these obligations and rights of the defendant, and thereby preventing it from performing its obligations to him. He was not authorized to settle with the other companies and take from them the money which they had pledged. Both the defendant and plaintiff should be used jointly with that of the defendant in repairing the building, and to keep the money without offering it to defendant, as the companies were bound to do in furtherance of the common object, and in doing which to prevent the defendant from the right of enforcing contribution from such other companies. It was his duty to permit the defendant to repair the building pursuant to its notice, and not by his act to put it beyond its power to do so. The defendant claims he did this; the plaintiff denies it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">To which charge, commencing with the words, \u201c If there was but one policy,\u201d etc., the plaintiff then and there excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The court, by request of defendant, further charged the jury on the same point as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u201c The plaintiff in this action, not claiming the right to recover upon the policy, but solely upon the notice of the intention of the defendant to rebuild and for damages resulting from defendant\u2019s failure to rebuild under and pursuant to its notice, I say to you, if you find from the evidence the fact to be that other companies, having concurrent insurance with the defendant upon said building to the amount of twenty-eight thousand dollars, served upon the plaintiff notices, the same as served by the defendant, of their intention, acting jointly with this defendant and other insurance companies having such insurance on said building, to repair and rebuild the same, and that after such notices were so served, the plaintiff settled with those.other companies and released them from all claim he had upon them or either of them, and also from all right to any claim he had upon them or either of them, and also from all right to any claim under said notice to rebuild, 'and retained the money thus received, without offering to aid the defendant with the same to the extent that such companies were bound to aid it in rebuilding; then I say to you, the plaintiff forfeited his right to require the defendant to rebuild under its notice, and he can not maintain this action, and your verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Asy\">To which charge, as so given, the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The court, by the request of the defendant, further charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u201c If you find from the evidence the facts to be that other insurance companies than the defendant had, with the defendant, concurrent insurance on said building to the amount of twenty-eight thousand dollars, and the said companies served upon the plaintiff like notices of that served by the defendant, of their intention acting jointly with the defendant and the other companies, they intended to rebuild and repair said building, and that after such notices were served, the plaintiff settled with all of said companies, except the defendant, and released said companies and each of them from all obligation or claim of the plaintiff upon them, or either of them, to repair or rebuild said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>building by reason of said notices or otherwise, and this defendant, after such settlement and release, notified the plaintiff that it could not and would not alone rebuild because of such settlement and release by him, and he then proceeded to repair and rebuild it himself, and then entered into an agreement in pursuance of the conditions of said policy, to have an appraisement of the damages to said building by reason of the fire, and said appraisement in pursuance of said policy and agreement was had, I say to you that such facts would constitute a waiver of any claim against the defendant for not repairing or rebuilding said building, and he could not sustain this action, and your verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AEk\">To which charge the plaintiff then and there excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The plaintiff requested the following charge touching the agreement submitting the loss and damage to appraisers :</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u201c That, in determining whether the plaintiff waived his claim under the agreement to rebuild, the jury may consider any testimony that has been given to them tending to show that the plaintiff, on signing the agreement which has been offered in evidence appointing David W. Thomas, William H. Smith, and Frank Lukesh as appraisers, understood it to be an agreement submitting to said appraisers to determine the amount of damages to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff on account of the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with its agreement to rebuild.\u201d Which request the court refused to give; to which refusal to so charge the jury, as requested, the plaintiff exc\u00e9pted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">As the conclusion we have reached upon the second point above stated will aid in determining the first, we will consider these questions in the reverse order of their statement. Upon this point the charge of the court was, in substance, that though the several notices to rebuild, were severally signed by the respective companies, yet the contract to rebuild was a j oint contract with respect to the rights of the plaintiff, and that the settlement by plaintiff with seven of the eight companies so electing to rebuild, and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>leasing them from all liability, defeated plaintiff\u2019s right of action against the other electing companies. Independent of statute, and of the provisions contained in this policy, this result, upon common-law principles, would follow; but, in determining whether this election by defendant to rebuild, acting jointly with other companies, created a joint obligation as respects the plaintiff\u2019s rights, reference must be had to the terms of the policy itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">This policy was but one of several covering the same property. It contemplated other insurance: it stipulated that, in case of such insurance, the assured should not \u201c be entitled to recover of this company any greater portion of the loss or damage than the amount hereby insured bears to the whol\u00e9 sum insured on said property . . . without reference to the solvency or liability of other insurance.\u201d This stipulation is one in favor of the insurer, and makes its liability several and not joint. It gave to the plaintiff, in case of loss or damage, a right of action against this company for its proportionate share of the damages sustained for not rebuilding, prorated with reference to the amount of concurrent insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The words of the condition are: \u201cIn no case\u201d can the insured recover more than said <em>pro rata </em>share. There is another limitation to the amount of the recovery: the assured can not recover beyond his actual loss. After the insured has elected to rebuild, and has entered upon the performance of his contract, the contract of indemnity may be discharged by rebuilding. If there is a failure to rebuild, the insurer becomes liable for the damages sustained by the plaintiff for such failure. Whether the plaintiff, in case of such failure, is restricted to his action for damages for not rebuilding, or may elect to treat this electiou to rebuild as abandoned, and may sue upon the policy as an indemnity contract payable in money: that is, whether the right to treat it as a money indemity, the same as if no election had been made to rebuild, was merely <em>suspended </em>until such failure, as is held in some states, or became <em>extinguished, </em>leaving a right of action on the building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>contract as plaintiffs sole remedy, we need not now determine. As a contract of indemnity payable in money, it was clearly several in its nature, though there was concurrent insurance. We think that the same provisions of the policy,'which requires several actions thereon to recover a money indemnity, are equally applicable to the liability of this company for damages for failure to rebuild. Each company would, in such case, be severally liable for its <em>fro rata </em>share of the loss and damage, not exceeding the \u00a1interest of the assured in the property. In case of concurrent insurance, and no election to rebuild, the action must be against each for its <em>pro rata </em>share of the loss, not exceeding plaintiffs loss. If any of the companies are insolvent, this loss must fall on the insured. Defendant did not undertake to share any loss to the plaintiff, whether arising from insolvency, or non-liability of other insurance, or by compromise on other policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Plaintiff could insure in as many companies as he chose. By the terms of this policy he could only recover defendant\u2019s <em>pro rata </em>share. This is equally true, whether in an action for failure to rebuild or in one to recover indemnity in money. If the action is for not rebuilding, the damages may exceed those if the suit is for money, where there is no election.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Where the aggregate loss exceeds the insurance, and the insurer elects to rebuild, the damages, unless limited by the terms of the policy, must equal the cost of restoring the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">In case of concurrent insurance, and some of the companies elect to rebuild and others do not, and there is no prorating clause, there is a separate cause of action against, each for failure to rebuild, when there is no subsequent agreement converting the policies into a <em>joint </em>contract. The giving of these notices was the sole act of the insurers. Plaintiff had no option. This did not operate to convert |a <em>several </em>into <em>&amp; joint </em>obligation as against plaintiff, whatjever its effect as between the insurers themselves. If there was no prorating clause, such as is found in this policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>and no limitation on the amount of liability to rebuild, each of several companies electing to rebuild would be liable to rebuild, and several actions for a failure could be maintained, but there could be but one satisfaction for the amount of actual loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Where several elect to rebuild and one only does so, the plaintiff\u2019s claim is satisfied as to all, and the one so performing is left to his right of contribution, whatever that may be, against the others electing or non-electing.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Under this policy, the election to rebuild did not defeat plaintiff\u2019s right to recover.of those not electing, when the building contract was not performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">If those non-electing paid in money before the building was replaced to plaintiff, it would diminish the amount of recovery for a failure to rebuild, as plaintiff\u2019s right extends only to an indemnity for his actual loss. If paid after the building was replaced as before the fire, it in equity belongs to those rebuilding.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">In the policy before us, the liability of defendant is expressly limited' to its pro <em>rata </em>share of the amount lost. Hence, plaintiff\u2019s recovery of other companies by compromise, or otherwise, does not affect the amount to be collected of defendant. And where one of the several policies is for the benefit of a mortgagee of the insured property, upon a mortgage made by the insurer, this is other insurance, to be taken into the account in ascertaining defendant\u2019s pro <em>rata </em>share of the loss. Payment to the mortgagee is payment pro <em>tanto </em>of plaintiff\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">In the case at bar, eight of the ten companies having concurrent insurances, elected to rebuild. This did not defeat the right of plaintiff to recover of those not electing, upon their respective policies, for the amounts for which they were liable; but, as the insured can have but one satisfaction for his actual loss, and as there is a separate contract with this defendant limiting his liability to his pro <em>rata </em>share, without regard to the solvency or liability of any other insurer, this defendant is liable only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>to prorate with, other insurers for damages resulting from a failure to rebuild. To illustrate: The damages, as found by the appraisers, was $32,990 The aggregate insurance was $33,000; and the defendant\u2019s, policy was $1,000. Prorating this loss according to the terms of the policy, defendant would be liable for $999.69. The option to rebuild was a mode of payment of the damages covered by the policy reserved for the benefit of the insurer. And damages for failure to rebuild is as much indemnity, payable in another form, for the loss covered by the policy, as if the same was payable in money where no election had been made. The terms of the policy are explicit. \u201c In no case shall the claim be for a greater sum than the actual damages. . . . Nor shall the assured be entitled to recover of this company any greater proportion of the loss or damage than the amount hereby insured bears to the whole sum insured on said property.\u201d This clause follows that which gives the election to rebuild, and in express terms applies to claims for damages arising from a failure to rebuild. It follows, therefore, that while these notices to rebuild, served by the respective companies on July 24, 1878, may, as between such companies, create a joint obligation, yet as to this plaintiff, his right of action and the amount of his recovery for failure to rebuild is several against the several companies who were liable in damages, and the amount of his recovery is to be prorated in each case accordingly, as provided in the policy. In such prorating the aggregate insurance, including the two companies not electing to rebuild, is to be taken into the account in ascertaining defendant\u2019s proportion of such loss. If we assume, however, that the court below was correct in charging that this was a joint building contract, still there was error in charging that the settlement made by the plaintiff with seven of the joint contractors discharged the other. This was so at common law, but is not so under our statute (Revised Statutes, secs, 3162 to 3166). These sections authorize a composition or compromise with one or more joint debtors, without discharging the others, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>without impairing the right of action against such others. In such, case, the settlement of the joint debtor is equivalent to a payment of his proportionate share of the debt. It leaves the right of action against the other debtor intact for its proportionate liability on the obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">As to the effect of the agreement to arbitrate the damages. This agreement was entered into October 23, 1878. The plaintiff had compromised with seven of the eight companies after they had converted their policies into building contracts. The testimony shows that Foust, the agent of the company, then visited Akron for the purpose of settling the controversy between plaintiff and defendant. He had heard of this release of the other seven companies before he left home, and had been notified to fulfill his contract. He went for the purpose of adjusting his company\u2019s liability. He then did not claim that defendant was dischai\u2019ged from all liability by reason of the release of the other seven companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The plaintiff had already resumed possession and had made some preparations to rebuild. He (Foust) made two propositions for a settlement: first, to compromise on the same basis as plaintiff' had compromised with the other seven companies; or second, to have appraisers to assess the actual loss occasioned by the fire. The parties being unable to agree to the first, this agreement of submission to appraisers was entered into. The court charged the jury that this of itself was a waiver of all right to recover in an action for damages for failure to rebuild ; that as matter of law it related solely to au adjustment of the loss under the policy, and did not relate to a loss for failure to rebuild. In this we think the court erred. Before entering into this agreement the company was distinctly informed that the plaintiff was not claiming under the policy for money indemnity, but for not rebuilding. Under these circumstances the parties agreed to submit to appraisers the sole question of the actual cash value of, or damage to such property, and the award of the appraisers was to be binding on both parties so far as regards such appraisement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the other matters of difference between the parties within the terms and conditions of the insurance being left for adjustment by the parties. In view of the matters in difference at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s claiming his right to damages for failure to rebuild, the defendant offering to compromise, and not denying his liability in some amount, this agreement may be regarded as referable to the controversy between the parties, namely, the <em>amount </em>which defendant should pay, whether based upon the contract to rebuild or on the policy as an indemnity. There is nothing in the agreement showing the intention of the parties to limit such appraisement to a claim upon the policy as a contract of indemnity. They were to ascertain the amount of loss or damage to the property. This mode of ascertaining the loss and damage is expressly provided for in the policy, and independent of this provision of the policy it was competent for the parties to refer .this question to arbitrators and make their award binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">As we have adjudged that at the time this agreement was entered into, there was an existing liability of defendant in damages for failure to rebuild proportionate to its <em>fro rata </em>share of insurance, the appraisement made under the agreement would become a material factor in determining its share of such damage. That amount known, the amount of defendant\u2019s liability would become a mere matter of calculation. The plaintiff by entering into this agreement can not, as a matter of law, therefore be said to have waived an existing right of action. The agreement had the same force and effect as a method of adjusting the loss and of settling that question, whether his suit was on the policy or upon the contract to rebuild. The facts and circumstances clearly show that it was not the intention of plaintiff to waive or abandon his right under the policy as a contract to rebuild. He was simply agreeing to a mode of assessing the loss or damage by fire, which, when settled, would be binding on both parties, unless set aside, leaving all other questions to be determined by the parties themselves or by litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>The amount of damages when ascertained, by whatever mode, was a necessary factor in arriving at the <em>pro rata </em>share of defendant\u2019s liability, whether the action was upon the contract regarded as an indemnity payable in money, or as a rebuilding contract. It was error, therefore, in the court to leave out of view the circumstances under which this agreement for an appraisal of damages wa&amp; made, and to charge that it was solely referable to the contract of insurance payable in money, and was therefore a waiver of an existing claim or demand for damages for failure to rebuild.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
