J.</author>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">The husband appeals from an interlocutory judgment of dissolution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the notice of appeal purports to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>appeal from the entire judgment, only the portion thereof involving disposition of community property is argued in the brief on appeal. We treat the case as involving only the portion of the judgment so attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The parties were married for a little over two years. The record indicates that it had not been a happy association, involving periods of separation. The trial was devoted primarily to the issue of community property. The evidence, to say the best for it, was confusing, partly because some of the property involved was located in Mexico and the documents concerning that property were in Spanish which no one could translate with any accuracy. What the record does disclose is that, at most, the community property consisted of the following items:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">(1) A parcel of land, in Mexico, identified as No. 6735, on which a house in bad repair was located;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">(2) Another parcel of land, in Mexico, identified as No. 6739, on which several rental units were located; .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">(3) A house in Los Angeles County; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">(4) The furniture in the Los Angeles house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Although the parties were not very clear as to the values involved, the record supports the trial court\u2019s statement, made at the close of the trial, that the community liabilities exceeded the value of the community property. The decree herein attacked gave to the wife parcel No. 6735 in Mexico and one-half of the household furnishings; it gave to the husband parcel No. 6739 in Mexico, the house in Los Angeles and one-half of the household furniture. The husband was ordered to pay all community obligations and the cost of transporting the wife\u2019s share of the furniture to her new abode. No spousal support was ordered but the judgment granted custody of three children<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the wife, with provision for support payments by, and visitation rights in, the husband. As we have said, no objection is here made to the child custody or support provisions, nor to the. dissolution of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">The record shows that, after a conference in chambers, the trial court announced its determination concerning child custody and support. The court then announced its further decision as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>\u201cThe Court makes no order for spousal support in view of the fact that the assets of the parties are less than the obligations and the nature of the assets make it impossible for the Court to make any division other than the Court is about to order.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">\u201cThe parties have agreed that their property shall be divided and distributed to them as follows:\u201d followed by the division hereinabove set forth. Admittedly, the husband was then in court; admittedly the court\u2019s order was clearly and slowly announced; admittedly the husband voiced no objection to the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">On his present appeal the husband contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">(1) That the trial court erred in dividing the community property without making and entering express findings regarding the values of the assets and liabilities involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">(2) That the division made by the court was not one that divided the assets equally; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">(3) That the stipulation relied on by the court is not binding on the husband because he did not expressly agree to it in open court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">It is clear from the record that, even accepting the husband\u2019s valuations of assets and liabilities, the division made resulted in giving to him at least half of the net community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">Section 4800 of the Civil Code does not require either findings of value or an equal division if the judgment is based on a stipulation made in open court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">While an attorney may not bind his client to a stipulation regarding the division of community property without the client\u2019s knowledge and assent, a litigant cannot sit idly by, in open court, while a stipulation is read and approved by the court, and later deny the authority of his trial counsel to enter into the stipul\u00e1tion thus announced. While it may be better practice for the trial court to inquire into the litigant\u2019s assent to the stipulation, we know of no rule that makes such an omission fatal where, as here, the litigant, by his silence, gave every appearance of assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Dunn, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-14\"> The notice of appeal also purports to appeal from an order denying a motion for a new trial. That is not an appealable order. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-11\"> There was some evidence as to the obligation of the husband for support of another child of the mother. The effect of the judgment was to relieve the husband from any duty toward that child. The wife has not attacked the judgment in that particular, or at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b729-13\"> In his brief, the husband argues that the court\u2019s division was based on the fact that, as stated in the portion of its remarks above quoted, \u201cthe assets of the parties are less than the obligations and the.nature of the assets make it impossible for the court to make any division other than the Court is about to order.\u201d That is a misreading of the language. The quoted language does no more than to explain why the court was not giving spousal support (a ruling which the wife has not here attacked) and why it was approving the stipulated division of the community property. The division was based on the stipulation and on the stipulation only.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b730-7\">JEFFERSON (Bernard), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">The major issue involved on this appeal is whether the parties had entered into a valid oral stipulation with respect to the division of their community property; there was no written agreement. The question at issue, therefore, is whether Civil Code section 4800, subdivision (a), was satisfied in terms of the parties\u2019 having entered into an \u201coral stipulation of the parties in open court.\u201d The majority finds that the proceedings below resulted in a valid \u201copen-court\u201d stipulation within the meaning of Civil Code section 4800, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">The basis of the majority\u2019s opinion is that appellant husband became bound by the court\u2019s division of the community property because, as a litigant, he sat idly by in open court while a stipulation was read and approved by the court. The majority opinion takes the view that the husband\u2019s subsequent denial of the authority of his trial counsel to enter into the alleged stipulation came too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">The definition of a stipulation is well established in the law. \u201cA stipulation is an agreement between counsel respecting business before the court [citation], and like any other agreement or contract, <em>it is essential that the parties or their counsel agree to its terms\u201d (Palmer </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1948) 33 Cal.2d 134, 142 [199 P.2d 952].) (Italics supplied.) It is equally clear that an attorney has authority to bind his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>client in any of the steps of an action or proceeding by entering into a valid stipulation. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 283.) \u201c \u2018Such a stipulation . . . when made in open court... constitutes not only an agreement between the parties, but also one between them and the court, which the court is bound to enforce for the benefit of those interested and for the protection of its own honor and dignity.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Barendregt </em>v. <em>Downing </em>(1959) 175 Cal.App.2d 733, 736 [346 P.2d 870].)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">The record of the proceedings in the trial court upon which the majority relies, in holding that there was a valid \u201coral stipulation of the parties in open court.\u201d is as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">\u201cMr. Levy: I have nothing further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">\u201cThe Court: I am going to ask the witness a question and I am going to ask her for the interpretation of the meaning of the following: Under the column which is spelled F-E-C-H-A, what does fecha mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">\u201cThe Witness: Date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">\u201cThe Court: Now, I am telling you to look at something written in Mexico and then tell me what date that would be in the United States.

Although there are no magic words which counsel or the court must use to effectuate a stipulation in open court, nor is any particular formality required, the language and conduct must be such as to indicate an assent to the terms of the alleged stipulation. Thus, a colloquy of counsel in open court may be sufficient to constitute an assent to a stipulation. (See <em>Wangenheim </em>v. <em>Garner </em>(1919) 42 Cal.App. 332 [183 P. 670] but cf. <em>Back </em>v. <em>Farnsworth </em>(1938) 25 Cal.App.2d 212 [77 P.2d 295].)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">The proceedings below in the instant case are to be compared with those of <em>In re Marriage of Carter </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 479 [97 Cal.Rptr. 274], in which counsel for one of the parties stated the stipulation in open court. The stipulation was assented to by counsel for the opposing party and then the trial judge, with painstaking care, made inquiries of the parties as to whether they understood, and agreed to, the stipulation which was being made and recited by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>In the case at bench, however, it is to be noted that the testimony of a witness was interrupted and, apparently, the court and counsel then conferred in chambers. When proceedings were again held in open court, the trial judge simply rendered and pronounced a notice of intended decision which covered all of the elements involved in the controversy between the parties. Sandwiched in the middle, and set forth as a part of the court\u2019s rendition of its intended decision, is the trial judge\u2019s statement of an alleged oral agreement between the parties as to the division of their community property. It is this statement of the trial judge which the majority opinion considers a valid, oral stipulation of the parties, entered into in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">We can only <em>surmise </em>and <em>speculate </em>that the attorneys of the two parties advised the trial judge in chambers that they so stipulated for their respective clients. At no point in the trial judge\u2019s oral announcement of his intended decision in open court did he inquire of counsel for either party, or inquire of either party, as to whether such counsel or party considered the court\u2019s statement to constitute an accurate portrayal of an oral agreement or stipulation to which the parties were assenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">To hold that appellant husband should have been listening to the trial judge\u2019s rendition of his intended decision with the ear of a trial attorney and should have known when the trial judge reached that portion of his intended. decision which constituted a stipulation of the parties, and should then have made an objection, or should have made an objection after the trial judge had completed the rendition of his intended decision, constitutes a failure to recognize the actualities of a contested trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The majority\u2019s holding that the record in the instant case establishes \u201can oral stipulation of the parties in open court,\u201d as required by Civil Code section 4800, subdivision (a), puts a stamp of approval upon a trial court procedure which makes a mockeiy of the <em>Palmer </em>court\u2019s statement that, \u201c[ujnless it is clear from the record that both parties assented, there is no stipulation.\u201d <em>(Palmer, supra, </em>33 Cal.2d 134, at p. 143.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">It is my view that in order for a stipulation to meet the test of an \u201coral stipulation of the parties in open court,\u201d the trial judge, if he states for the record in open court a stipulation which he believes was made in a chambers conference, is under a clear-cut obligation to ask counsel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>the parties present in open court whether the court\u2019s statement of the stipulation represents the agreement of the p\u00e1rties. I see no justification for approving the procedure of the trial judge in the instant case rather than requiring the procedure carried out in <em>In re Marriage of Carter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Consequently, I would reverse the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
