Arndt, from a claimed occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">In the proceedings before the Board petitioner established, or offered to establish, the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The deceased had been employed for many years until April 28, 1967, at an occupation in which he was exposed to minute asbestos components in the air. He then changed to a different type of employment at which he worked until August 11, 1970. On February 3, 1971, his death was brought about by a cancerous tumor of the lung called mesothelioma, a disease, at that time, of unknown etiology. Petitioner learned during April of 1973 that mesothelioma was an occupational disease of persons who in the course of their employment are exposed to asbestos dust or related substances in the air. Until then she had no knowledge or information that deceased\u2019s death, or the mesothelioma, was related to his employment. She filed her application for workers\u2019 compensation death benefits with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board three months later, on July 5, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Mesothelioma is a rare disease, and only recently had \u201cresearch scientists [begun] noting the frequency of this disease in asbestos workers.\u201d Tumor specialists were only in the \u201cearly Seventies\u201d becoming \u201caware of the relationship between asbestos and mesothelioma.\u201d This knowledge was even then \u201cfar from common among most physicians, not the least because the disease itself was so rare.\u201d The deceased\u2019s attending physician \u201chad no knowledge that Mr. Arndt\u2019s death was directly attributable to his occupational exposure to asbestos until early 1973, despite [the doctor\u2019s] exposure to current medical events as a practicing internist,\u201d and he opined that \u201cneither Mr. or Mrs. Arndt [was] aware of the occupational nature of his illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">For reasons which will hereafter appear, we emphasize the fact that petitioner\u2019s application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits was filed more than <em>one year </em>after the date of her husband\u2019s death, and more than <em>240 weeks </em>after he had last been exposed to the toxic asbestos substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The Board dismissed petitioner\u2019s application for the stated reasons that it was filed (1) more than one year after Mr. Arndt\u2019s death, and (2) more than 240 weeks after the date of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The ruling was purportedly based upon Labor Code section 5406 which, as here relevant, provides: \u201cThe period within which may be commenced proceedings- for the collection of [workers\u2019 compensation death benefits] is one year from: (a) The date of death where death occurs within one year from date of injury; . . . [1\u00cd] <em>No such proceedings may be commenced more than one year after the date of death, nor more than 240 weeks from the date of injury.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">It will be noted that section 5406\u2019s several statutes of limitations have two commencement points; one is the <em>\u201cdate of death\u201d </em>and the other, the <em>\u201cdate of injury. \u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We first consider the validity of the Board\u2019s conclusion that the application was barred because it was filed more than 240 weeks after the \u201cdate of injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The Board had obviously considered the \u201cdate of injury\u201d to be the last day of deceased\u2019s exposure (Apr. 28, 1967) to the disease-causing asbestos substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">In <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1933) 217 Cal. 338 [18 P.2d 933, 86 A.L.R. 563], three workers had become disabled through illness and had terminated their employment. Thereafter two of them died as a result of their illness. At a time beyond the fixed periods of the appropriate statutes of limitations for workers\u2019 compensation, the survivor of them, and the dependents of those who were deceased, learned that the workers\u2019 illness was a disease of the lungs due to silica dust, called pneumoconiosis silicosis, or silicosis, which had been caused by the inhaling of such dust by the workers in the course of their employment. The surviving worker, and the dependents of the others, then promptly filed applications for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The applicable statutes of limitations of <em>Marsh </em>provided, as does the present Labor Code section 5406, that proceedings for workers\u2019 compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>sation death benefits were permitted only where the \u201cdeath ensued within one year from the date of the injury,\u201d and where proceedings were commenced \u201cwithin <em>one year from the date of death, and in any event within two hundred forty weeks from the date of the injury. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The claim of the widow of one of the deceased workers, Marsh, was made within one year of his death, and within 240 weeks of his last exposure to silica dust. However, his death had not \u201censued within one year from the date\u201d of such last exposure.. At issue was the question whether that date was the statute\u2019s \u201cdate of injury.\u201d If it was, the claim was barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">After exhaustively reviewing broad authority on the subject the <em>Marsh </em>court concluded (p. 351): \u201c\u2018[I]n the case of a latent and progressive disease, such as pneumoconiosis, it cannot reasonably be said that the injury dates necessarily from the last day of exposure to a dust-laden atmosphere and that the prescriptive period begins to run from that day. <em>Rather, according to our view, should the date of the injury be deemed the time when the accumulated effects culminate in a disability traceable to the latent disease as the primary cause, and by the exercise of reasonable care and diligence it is discoverable and apparent that a compensable injury was sustained in performance of the duties of the employment. </em>\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">This rule was applied to the application of the widow of Marsh. It was held that if, upon remand, it should appear that the applicant neither knew, nor reasonably should have known, the cause of her husband\u2019s disability until after his death, the <em>date of such discovery, </em>for the purpose of the statute of limitations, should be fixed as the statute\u2019s \u201cdate of injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>This rule of <em>Marsh </em>has been uniformly followed throughout the years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It disposes of the Board\u2019s conclusion, and the instant respondents\u2019 contention, that the date of Mr. Arndt\u2019s last exposure to the mesothelioma-causing substance was the \u201cdate of injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">More difficulty is encountered in resolving the question whether petitioner\u2019s claim was barred, as found by the Board, by Labor Code section 5406 in that it was filed more than one year after the \u201cdate of death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">On this question also, <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>217 Cal. 338, has spoken.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">As has been pointed out, the court in that case, as to the worker Marsh\u2019s widow, applied the rule that the date on which it became known, or reasonably should have, that the death was of industrial causation, was for the purpose of death benefits the \u201cdate of injury.\u201d The claim had been filed within one year of the \u201cdate of death,\u201d so there was no issue on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">However, in <em>Marsh </em>the claim of the widow of the other deceased worker, Woods, was filed more than one year after the \u201cdate of death.\u201d As to that application, and without further discussion, the court said (p. 352): \u201cThere is therefore no escape from the mandatory provisions of section 11 (b), subdivision (2), of said act and the action of the Commission in denying relief was clearly correct. The order in this case is affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Implicit in this ruling of <em>Marsh </em>is the holding that an application for compensation benefits following a worker\u2019s death from disease of industrial causation must, in any event, be filed within one year of the death. And this requirement was held to exist even though, as in the case before us, the dependent neither knew, nor reasonably should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>known, of the death\u2019s industrial causation until after the expiration of the one-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Unlike the previously discussed ruling of <em>Marsh, </em>we find no appellate decisions of this state following, or even considering, the unelaborated ruling instantly under discussion. On the other hand, we observe that a recent decision of the same court casts considerable doubt upon the ruling\u2019s current validity. That case is <em>Fruehauf Corp. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><em>Fruehauf </em>says (p. 577): \u201cIt would be unreasonable to hold that although an employee who has suffered an injury resulting from several minor traumas is deemed not to be injured for the purposes of the statute of limitations until the minor traumas result in disability, once the injury has ripened into disability he is required to know immediately that such disability was caused by his employment.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] As <em>Marsh </em>and other authorities have held, an employee is not to be deprived of compensation merely because he fails to make a correct medical diagnosis. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\"><em>\u201cLimitations provisions in the workmen\u2019s compensation law must be liberally construed in favor of the employee unless otherwise compelled by the language of the statute, and such \u00e9nactments should not be interpreted in a manner which will result in a right being lost before it accrues. </em>[Citations.] <em>To hold that an employee who has suffered an injury due to a series of latent, insidious, minor traumas is to be denied compensation even though he neither knew nor in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that his disability was of industrial origin would do violence to these rules and the beneficent spirit underlying the enactment of the workmen\u2019s compensation law. </em>[Citations.]\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\"><em>Fruehauf, </em>as the above quotation indicates, concerned a disabled <em>worker </em>(as distinguished from a deceased worker\u2019s dependent) who did not know, and who had no reasonable means of knowing, the. industrial causation of his disability, until after the statute of limitations appeared to have run. But the court\u2019s significant comments\u2014that the claimant \u201cis not to be deprived of compensation merely because he fails to make a correct medical diagnosis\u201d; that the statutes of limitations should \u201cnot be interpreted in a manner which will result in a right being lost before it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>accrues\u201d; and to hold that \u201can employee ... is to be denied compensation even though he neither knew nor in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that his disability was of industrial origin would do violence\u201d etc.\u2014are logically of equal to similarly caused late claims of workers\u2019 dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Our instant inquiry then, turns to whether <em>Fruehauf </em>requires a holding that the Board\u2019s second reason for rejecting Mrs. Arndt\u2019s application, i.e., that it was not filed within one year of the \u201cdate of death,\u201d is also invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">As pointed out, <em>Fruehauf </em>concerned a late compensation claim of a disabled worker. But no process of reason will permit a conclusion that the law does not have at least equal concern for a deceased worker\u2019s wife and children or other dependents who, through no fault of their own, learn too late of the industrial causation of their bereavement. And equally unacceptable to reason would be a conclusion that the law should, in a proper case, aid a deceased worker\u2019s dependents by the fiction of an \u201cinjury\u201d occurring after death, while the same dependents must be held strictly to a timely filing within a year , of the \u201cdate of death,\u201d the industrial causation of which they had no reasonable means of knowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">It must be presumed in enacting Labor Code section 5406\u2019s \u201cwithin ... one year from . . . the date of death\u201d provision, the Legislature intended a reasonable statutory purpose and not one which, in the language of <em>Fruehauf </em>would result in a \u201cright being lost\u201d before it was reasonably known to have accrued. It is the duty of a court to interpret statutes so as to make them reasonable <em>(Regents of University of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 529, 537 [91 Cal.Rptr. 57, 476 P.2d 457]); and where \u201c \u2018two constructions are possible and interpretation becomes necessaiy, the court will follow the rule of finding that construction which leads to the more reasonable result\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hidden Valley Municipal Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Calleguas Municipal Water Dist. </em>(1961) 197 Cal.App.2d 411, 419 [17 Cal.Rptr. 416]).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">As has by now been made clear, both Labor Code section 5406, and the earlier statutes of limitations of <em>Marsh, </em>required filing of death benefit claims within \u201cone year from . . . the date of death\u201d and, within \u201c240 weeks from the date of injury.\u201d A logical reason\u2014for fixing the \u201cdate of injury\u201d as the time (even though it be after the worker\u2019s death) when the dependent knew, or reasonably should have known, of the <em>injury\u2019s industrial causation, </em>but not applying the same rationale to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>time the dependent knew, or reasonably should have known, of the <em>death\u2019s industrial </em>causation\u2014is most elusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Of aid to us is Labor Code section 3202, commanding that workers\u2019 compensation statutes \u201cbe liberally construed by the courts with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.\u201d This statute is construed, not as narrowly applying only to \u201cpersons injured in the course of their employment,\u201d but rather to \u201cclaimants\u201d generally (State <em>Employees\u2019 Retirement System </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 611, 615 [73 Cal.Rptr. 172]), and in \u201cfavor of awarding compensation\u201d <em>(Greydanus </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 490, 493 [47 Cal.Rptr. 384, 407 P.2d 296]). It covers \u201call aspects of workmen\u2019s compensation\u201d <em>(Davison </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 15, 18 [50 Cal.Rptr. 76]), <em>including a deceased worker\u2019s dependent\u2019s application for death benefits (Munoz </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 144, 149 [96 Cal.Rptr. 394]), <em>and the statutes of limitations of Labor Code section 5406, here at issue (Bianco </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 584, 588-589 [150 P.2d 806]).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The principle\u2014that the stated commencement date of the running of a statute of limitations may be inoperative in cases where the claimant neither knew, nor in the exercise of reasonable diligence would have known, that, the act or omission of another was the cause of the claimant\u2019s injury or damage\u2014is by no means alien to our law. It has been variously applied, as follows: <em>Urie </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1949) 337 U.S. 163, 170 [93 L.Ed. 1282, 1292, 69 S.Ct. 1018, 11 A.L.R.2d 252] (disability from insidious and creeping disease); <em>Alter </em>v. <em>Michael </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 480, 483 [50 Cal.Rptr. 553, 413 P.2d 153] (medical malpractice); <em>Huysman </em>v. <em>Kirsch, supra, 6 </em>Cal.2d 302, 306-313 (medical malpractice); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. </em>(1960) 183 Cal.App.2d 513, 516-519 [6 Cal.Rptr. 924] (negligence of insurance broker); <em>Twomey </em>v. <em>Mitchum, Jones &amp; Templeton, Inc. </em>(1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 690, 723-729 [69 Cal.Rptr. 222] (negligence of stockbroker); <em>Moonie </em>v. <em>Lynch </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 361 [64 Cal.Rptr. 55] (negligent breach of oral contract by accountant, Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 339, subd. 1). According to <em>Warrington </em>v. <em>Charles Pfizer &amp; Co., supra, </em>274 Cal.App.2d 564, 568, the strict commencement of the running of statutes of limitations has been judicially \u201crelaxed for a variety of reasons, such as implicit or express representation; fraudulent concealment, fiduciary relationship, continuing tort, continuing duty, and progressive and accumulated injury, all of them excusing plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>unawareness of what caused his injuries and all applying the <em>rule of </em>discovery.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\"><em>Warrington </em>v. <em>Charles Pfizer &amp; Co., supra, </em>274 Cal.App.2d 564, concerned the strict language of Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision 3, that an action for damages for personal injuries shall be commenced: \u201cWithin one year.\u201d Nevertheless the court applied the \u201crule of discovery\u201d which it defined (pp. 569-570) as follows: \u201c[W]hen personal injury is suffered without perceptible trauma and by silent and insidious impregnation as a consequence of the act or omission of another, who knows, or is charged with the responsibility of knowing that such act or omission may result in personal injury, and the injured person is unaware of the cause of his injury, and as a reasonably prudent and intelligent person could not, without specialized knowledge, have been made aware of such cause, <em>no action for tort resulting from such cause begins to accrue until the injured person knows or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the cause of such injury.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Each of the parties places some reliance on Labor Code section 5412, which recites: \u201cThe date of injury in cases of occupational diseases is that date upon which the employee first suffered disability therefrom and either knew, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, that said disability was caused by his present or prior employment.\u201d This section was enacted about 14 years after <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>217 Cal. 338. It appears to implement that case\u2019s well-supported rule that the \u201cdate of injury,\u201d from a worker\u2019s industrially caused disease, is the time that he or, upon his death, his dependents, first knew or reasonably should have known of its industrial causation. It has scant application to the issue presently before us, except perhaps that it appears to be a legislative recognition of the principle so well expounded by <em>Fruehauf Corp. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 569, 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Nor is it alarming, as suggested by respondents, that the interpretation sought by petitioner will result in a mass of stale workers\u2019 compensation death claims. Such an interpretation would affect only what must be a relatively low incidence of workers\u2019 deaths from diseases, the occupational causation of which is not reasonably known to them during their lifetimes. And the law seems not to find unreasonable, or unacceptable, occasional long-delayed claims for disability finally resulting from a much earlier exposure to causatives of an industrial disease. (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>Argonaut Mining Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.2d 27\u201420 years; <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Commission </em>(1937) 2 Cal.Comp. Cases 69\u201416 years.)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">The case of <em>Ruiz </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 409 [289 P.2d 229] extends no aid to respondents\u2019 contention. There the court found mandatory the requirement of Labor Code section 5406 that no proceeding for a death benefit may be commenced more than one year after \u201cthe date of death,\u201d or more than 240 weeks after \u201cthe date of injury.\u201d But the court had before it no contention, or issue, or evidence, that the industrial causation of the worker\u2019s death was not known, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence would not have been known, to the petitioner within those statutory periods. \u201cIt is elementary that the language used in any opinion is to be understood in the light of the facts and the issue then before the court.\u201d <em>(McDowell &amp; Craig </em>v. <em>City of Santa Fe Springs </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 33, 38 [4 Cal.Rptr. 176, 351 P.2d 344].)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The foregoing considerations impel us to hold that Labor Code section 5406, subdivision (a), is to be construed as requiring that a dependent\u2019s compensation claim, arising out of a worker\u2019s death from an industrially caused disease, must be commenced within one year from the \u201cdate of death,\u201d or the date that the applicant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, that the death was of industrial causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">It follows that the Board also erred in ruling that claims such as petitioner\u2019s must necessarily be filed within one year of the worker\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The Board\u2019s dismissal of the instant proceedings appears to have been based upon conceded dates and time periods. It is not clear that a full factual inquiry was made concerning the issue of when petitioner knew, or reasonably should have known, of the industrial causation of her husband\u2019s death or, indeed, whether such death was of industrial causation. The case will be set at large for such further proceedings as the Board shall deem proper. We have, of course, not passed upon the admissibility, or weight, or credibility, of such evidence as may hereafter be offered by any of the parties. Nor have we here passed upon petitioner\u2019s entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation benefits accrued and unpaid during the lifetime of deceased (see Lab. Code, \u00a7 4700); that issue was not briefed by the parties and has not been considered by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>The order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board dismissing the application of petitioner Erla M.
