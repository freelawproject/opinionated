Freddie L. Persons and Charles A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Scott (No. 91484) which granted a motion by Persons and Scott for a post-indictment preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Persons and Scott were jointly charged with murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187) by indictment filed on December 10, 1975. Additional counts of the indictment charged Persons with assault with a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)) and possession of a concealable firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12021); Scott was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a loaded firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12031). A motion by Persons and Scott to dismiss the indictment under Penal Code section 995 was denied. Thereafter, they moved the court for an order setting a post-indictment preliminary hearing. Respondent court issued the following order:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u201cThe proceedings in the superior court are hereby stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u201cThe matter is referred to the Municipal Court for the purposes of holding a post-indictment preliminary hearing to determine whether there is reasonable and probable cause to hold the defendants (or either of them) to answer before the superior court for the offenses charged in the criminal complaint before that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u201cIf the district attorney does not comply with this order, the stay of proceedings before this court shall become permanent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The People correctly maintain that there is no constitutional, statutory, or case authority which permits a superior court to order a post-indictment preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The California Constitution, article I, section 14, states: \u201cFelonies shall be prosecuted as provided by law, either by indictment or, after examination and commitment by a magistrate, by information.\u201d It has long been established in this state that a preliminary hearing is not required where the defendant has been indicted. (Greenberg v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 319, 321 [121 P.2d 713]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Goldenson </em>(1888) 76 Cal. 328, 345 [19 P. 161]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Newton </em>(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 359, 388 [87 Cal.Rptr. 394]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dale </em>(1947) 79 Cal.App.2d 370, 374 [179 P.2d 870]; <em>Kitts </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1907) 5 Cal.App. 462, 465 [90 P. 977].) The order of respondent court to the contrary appears to have been based on the concurring opinion in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 248 [124 Cal.Rptr. 32, 539 P.2d 792],</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>The holding of the majority in <em>Johnson </em>did not alter the general rule stated above.  A concurring opinion does not constitute authority under the doctrine of stare decisis. The majority opinion, not the minority, states the law and constitutes the decision of the court which binds lower courts. <em>(Wall </em>v. <em>Sonora Union High Sch. Dist. </em>(1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 870, 872 [50 Cal.Rptr. 178].) The statements in the dissenting or concurring opinions of individual justices which do not have the concurrence of a majority of the justices are not precedent, and constitute only the personal views of the writer. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">The trial court\u2019s order that the municipal court hold a postindictment preliminary hearing was an act in excess of its jurisdiction, and is subject to restraint by writ of prohibition. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937]; <em>Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 291 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715].)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">A writ will issue commanding respondent court to vacate its order of January 23, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-16\">Caldecott, P. J., and Emerson, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-17\">The petitions of the real parties in interest for a hearing by the Supreme Court were denied May 6, 1976. Wright, C. J., Tobriner, J., and Mosk, J., were of the opinion that the petitions should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-18\"> Retired judge of the superior court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
