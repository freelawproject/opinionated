Plaintiff appeals from a summary judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Plaintiff was president of Automotive Lodge No. 1186 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, and was a candidate for secretary-treasurer in the union\u2019s December 1970 election.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the campaign defendants French and Crago distributed a letter in opposition to plaintiff\u2019s candidacy. The letter exposed the fact that between 1943 and 1958 plaintiff suffered six criminal convictions for rape, conversion, forgery, impersonating a naval officer, and bigamy, and served various terms in prison.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is admitted that the facts stated in the letter concerning plaintiff\u2019s criminal record are true. Plaintiff was defeated in the election for secretary-treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Plaintiff brought this action for invasion of priv\u00e1cy, alleging that since the last criminal incident he had led a virtuous life, had become rehabilitated, had lived a quiet life avoiding the curiosity of the public, and had gained the respect of friends, associates and co-workers who were not aware of the criminal incidents. He alleged that defendants wrongfully and maliciously sought to injure plaintiff by thrusting upon him undesired notoriety of private affairs long past, for the purpose of harming plaintiff and defeating him in the election. Upon review of the pleadings, points and authorities, and appropriate - declarations and depositions, the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, finding that \u201cthe action has no merit and that Plaintiff has presented no triable issue as to any material fact, and that Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c.) In its memorandum of intended decision, the trial court commented in part, \u201cIn the court\u2019s opinion when the plaintiff sought union office, he entered the public forum and therefore the right of privacy . . . gives way to the voter\u2019s right to know.\u201d We hold that the trial court was correct and properly granted judgment for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">A candidate for public office has no right of privacy as to the flow of truthful information which may be relevant to his qualifications for office. <em>(Kapellas </em>v. <em>Kofman, </em>1 Cal.3d 20, 36-37 [81 Cal.Rptr. 360, 459 P.2d 912].) By volunteering his services for office, a candidate waives much of his right to privacy, and almost any truthful comment on his qualifications for office, no matter how serious an invasion of privacy, will be privileged. <em>(Briscoe </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Association, Inc., 4 </em>Cal.3d 529, 535 fn. 5 [93 Cal.Rptr. 866, 483 P.2d 34, 57 A.L.R.3d 1].) A charge of criminal conduct, no matter how remote, is relevant to a candidate\u2019s fitness for office. <em>(Monitor Patriot Co. </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>401 U.S. 265, 274-277 [28 L.Ed.2d 35, 42-44, 91 S.Ct. 621]; see also <em>Ocala Star-Banner Co. </em>v. <em>Damron, </em>401 U.S. 295, 300 [28 L.Ed.2d 57, 62, 91 S.Ct. 628].)</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Here plaintiff was a candidate not for government office but for the most important elective office in his labor union, a full-time paid position involving the handling of the members\u2019 funds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The role of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>labor union in the lives of many workers is not unlike a system of government, and strong policies favor the full exercise of the right to free speech in union election campaigns. (See <em>Linn </em>v. <em>Plant Guard Workers, </em>383 U.S. 53 [15 L.Ed.2d 582, 86 S.Ct. 657]; <em>Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>418 U.S. 264 [41 L.Ed.2d 745, 94 S.Ct. 2770]; <em>Jeffers </em>v. <em>Screen Extras Guild, Inc., </em>162 Cal.App.2d 717, 729 [328 P.2d 1030]; <em>Krause </em>v. <em>Bertrand, </em>159 Cal.App.2d 318, 321 [323 P.2d 784].) Plaintiff\u2019s criminal record was relevant to his fitness for this office, and by offering himself as a candidate he must be held to have voluntarily acceded to a searching inquiry into his fitness. (Kapellas v. <em>Kofman, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at pp. 36-37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Plaintiff misplaces reliance on <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Association, Inc., supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 529, 543, for the proposition that triable issues of fact remained to be determined in the instant case. In <em>Briscoe </em>there was \u201cminimal social value\u201d in the publication of Mr. Briscoe\u2019s <em>identity </em>in a magazine article discussing crime, and Mr. Briscoe \u201cin no way . . . voluntarily consented\u201d to the publication. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 541-542.) Here, on the other hand, there was a strong social value in the facts published, the union members\u2019 legitimate right to know plaintiff\u2019s fitness for and plaintiff voluntarily acceded to publicity by seeking the office.  As a matter of law, no reasonable trier of fact could find in plaintiff\u2019s favor under those circumstances, even if plaintiff could prove that he had become rehabilitated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-18\">The parties have also raised several technical procedural issues, but these arguments lack merit and require no extended discussion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Kaus, P.

Sentenced to five to fifty years. Paroled January 1963. Discharged from parole 6-30-64.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\"> The incumbent secretary-treasurer submitted a declaration that at the time of the election Local Lodge No. 1186 had over $112,000 in its checking account and over $492,000 in its savings accounts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b741-19\"> At oral argument plaintiff raised for the first time on appeal the contention that the privilege was abused by excessive publication. This contention is without merit. It is based on' a declaration submitted by plaintiff in support of his \u201cmotion for reconsideration\u201d presented to the trial court, in which he claimed to have \u201cdiscovered\u201d at the time of the incident that the letter was in some cases handed out to union members in such manner that other noninterested persons might see it. Defendants pointed out to the trial court numerous defects in plaintiff\u2019s motion. Plaintiff\u2019s declaration was based on hearsay and provided no supporting facts to show the method of distribution or that any noninterested person actually saw the letter, and thus did not set forth admissible evidence in support of the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c.) Even if the conclusions alleged in the declaration were believed, the fact that a communication is incidentally read or overheard by a noninterested person will not result in liability if the method adopted is reasonable under the circumstances. (Prosser, Torts (4th ed. 1971) \u00a7 115, pp. 793-794.) The motion for reconsideration did not set forth allegations which could not have been presented earlier at time of the motion for summary judgment. Finally, plaintiff filed the notice of appeal before his motion for reconsideration had been acted upon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b741-20\"> Plaintiff has abandoned his contention that certain depositions were never filed with the trial court. Plaintiff\u2019s contention that certain matters in the Edwards and Hubert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>declarations were inadmissible makes no difference since those matters were not relevant to the trial court\u2019s ruling. Defendants\u2019 contention that certain arguments should be stricken from plaintiff\u2019s reply brief is without merit because they constituted legitimate rebuttal to defendants\u2019 arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
