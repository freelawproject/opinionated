J.</author>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">International Association of Fire Fighters Union Local 1974, AFL-CIO, a labor union (hereinafter \u201cappellant union,\u201d or \u201cunion\u201d) appeals from a judgment entered in its action against respondents (the City of Pleasanton, its city manager, and the members of its city council). The appeal challenges the judgment insofar as it reflects the trial court\u2019s determination that legislative action taken by the city council, affecting city personnel represented by the union, is valid despite the city\u2019s previous failure to have complied with certain provisions of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (hereinafter the \u201cM-M-B Act,\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">The issues in the cause were joined upon the union\u2019s complaint, respondents\u2019 answer, and extensive declarations filed by both sides. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>stipulation, it was submitted for decision upon these documents and other evidence, both oral and documentary, received at a hearing upon the union\u2019s application for a preliminary injunction. That evidence supports the following summary:</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">At all pertinent times since 1970, the union has been the \u201crecognized employee organization\u201d representing all of the city\u2019s fire service employees, except for the fire chief, pursuant to sections 3501, 3502, and 3503 of the M-M-B Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By formal action taken on April 5, 1971, the city council adopted a three-part legislative package entitled \u201cPersonnel Manual,\u201d or \u201cPersonnel Rules.\u201d Part I was City Ordinance No. 626 (entitled \u201cPersonnel Ordinance\u201d). Part II was Council Resolution 71-73 (\u201c. . . Personnel Rules and Regulations\u201d). Part III consisted of Resolutions 71-74 (\u201cEmployer And Employee Relations Procedures\u201d) and 71-75 (\u201cRules Supplementing Those In Resolution 71-74 Relating To Employer and Employee Relations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Following the adoption of the \u201cPersonnel Manual,\u201d and pursuant to procedures prescribed therein, representatives of the city and the union negotiated an agreement relating to the salaries of the fire service employees represented by the union (including fire captains and the fire prevention officer), and other matters affecting such employees, for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>two-year term covering the fiscal years 1971-1972 and 1972-1973. The agreement was reduced to writing in the form of a \u201cMemorandum Of Understanding\u201d which was executed on behalf of the parties, accepted by the city council, and took effect July 1, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">On and after April 25, 1973, meetings were held between representatives of the union and the city for the purpose of negotiating a new agreement for the upcoming 1973-1974 fiscal year which was to commence July 1, 1973. The meetings resulted in an agreement between the union and the city on the wages, hours and working conditions of all of the city\u2019s fire service employees, including fire captains and the fire prevention officer, for the new fiscal year. The agreement was to take effect July 1, 1973, thus succeeding the aforementioned two-year agreement in point of time. It was similarly reduced to writing in the form of a \u201cMemorandum Of Understanding.\u201d It was executed by union representatives and the city manager, and was accepted by the city in a resolution adopted by the city council, in late June 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Meanwhile, the city had developed proposals for amendment of its 1971 \u201cPersonnel Manual\u201d in certain respects. The substance of the proposed amendments was drafted into a memorandum prepared by a member of the city manager\u2019s staff. (We hereinafter refer to this document as the \u201cstaff memorandum.\u201d) A copy of the staff memorandum was delivered to the union. Its contents were subsequently discussed, between representatives of the union and the city, on at least two occasions. (See fn. 8,post.) The union expressed its approval of some of the proposals on these occasions, and its disapproval of others, but the city did mot at any time submit the proposals to them' as subjects for negotiation; the city\u2019s stated position was that its unilateral adoption of the proposed amendments was in order because they were strictly \u201cmanagement prerogatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The amendments were included in Resolution 73-111, which was presented for action at a meeting of the city council held on June 25, 1973. Union representatives appeared at the meeting and objected to the resolution upon the grounds subsequently asserted by the union in this action. The council, adhering to the city\u2019s \u201cmanagement prerogative\u201d position, adopted Resolution 73-111 over the union\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">As adopted, and as now pertinent, Resolution 73-111 amended provisions of the 1971 \u201cPersonnel Manual\u201d relative to (1) the definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>of an employee \u201cgrievance,\u201d (2) pay for sick leave earned by an employee but not actually taken, (3) \u201ceducational incentive pay,\u201d (4) the procedure whereby the city announced competitive examinations for employment, (5) the time at which an employee serving an initial 12-month probationaiy period would be eligible for a nonautomatic \u201cmerit pay increase\u201d and (6) the reclassification of employees holding the positions of \u201cFire Captain\u201d and \u201cFire Prevention Officer\u201d as \u201cMiddle Management\u201d employees of the city. (Some specifics of the last three of these amendments, and of their respective factual contexts and effects, are hereinafter recited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">\n<em>The Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The union thereupon commenced the present action against respondents, seeking injunctive and mandatory relief against the six provisions of Resolution 73-111 enumerated above. After the issues had been joined, heard and submitted, the trial court filed a detailed memorandum decision (\u201cStatement Of Intended Decision\u201d) indicating that injunctive relief would be granted in some of the respects prayed by the union and that relief would be denied in others. The court thereupon entered a judgment, without making formal findings of fact and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Pursuant to the court\u2019s memorandum decision, paragraph \u201c1.\u201d of the judgment enjoins the city from implementing Resolution 73-111 in the first three respects challenged by the union (the amendments relative to the definition of \u201cgrievance,\u201d payment for unused sick leave, and \u201ceducational incentive pay\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Paragraph \u201c2.\u201d of the judgment denies relief in the fourth, fifth and sixth respects (the amendments affecting the city\u2019s announcement of examinations for employment, the timing of \u201cmerit pay increases\u201d for probationary employees, and the reclassification of the positions of \u201cFire Captain\u201d and \u201cFire Prevention Officer\u201d as \u201cMiddle Management\u201d employees of the city).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">' Appealing from the judgment insofar as it denies relief as to the last three amendments (see fn. 15, <em>post), </em>the union contends that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>unilateral adoption in Resolution 73-111 was void for the city\u2019s failure to have complied with the provisions of the M-M-B Act next identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Section 3504.5 of the M-M-B Act required the city to give \u201creasonable written notice\u201d to the union, as a \u201crecognized employee organization,\u201d of any proposal for legislative action \u201cdirectly relating to matters within the scope of representation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The first paragraph of section 3505 further required the city to \u201cmeet and confer in good faith\u201d with representatives of the union, concerning \u201cwages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment\u201d of the personnel represented by the union; according to the section\u2019s second paragraph in which the term \u201cmeet and confer in good faith\u201d is defined, the city\u2019s obligation to do this- extended to \u201cmatters within the scope of representation.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The recurrent term \u201cscope of representation\u201d is defined in section 3504 to include\u2014with a specified exception not pertinent here\u2014all matters affecting the employeremployee relationship, \u201cincluding, but not limited to, wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number> It first appears that the trial court sustained the union\u2019s contentions that the city had <em>in fact </em>failed to give notice to the union in compliance with section 3504.5, and to \u201cmeet and confer in good faith\u201d with the union\u2019s representatives as contemplated in section 3505, concerning any of the above-enumerated amendments proposed for adoption in Resolution 73-111.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It further appears that, having determined this fact, the court denied relief against the fourth and fifth amendments thus adopted (relative to the announcement of \u201cexaminations\u201d and the eligibility of probationary employees for \u201cmerit pay increases\u201d) upon the ground that neither of them pertained to \u201cwages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment\u201d (\u00a7 3505), or to matters within \u201cthe scope of representation\u201d <em>{id., </em>and \u00a7 3504), or either, so as to require the city to engage in a \u201cmeet and confer\u201d procedure with the union, pursuant to section 3505, before adopting either amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">The standards controlling our review of the trial court\u2019s action in these respects have been established. In the first place, the courts have not been reluctant to intervene \u201cwhen a public agency has taken unilateral action without bargaining at all. In such situations; courts have been quite zealous in condemning the unilateral action and in granting appropriate relief.\u201d (Grodin, <em>Public Employee Bargaining in California: The Meyers-Milias-Brown Act In The Courts </em>(1972) 23 Hastings L.J. 719, 753-754.) Moreover:</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">\u201cSection 3503 establishes the right of recognized employee unions directly to represent their members in \u2018employment relations with public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>agencies.\u2019 This right to representation reaches \u2018all matters of relations,\u2019 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3502; italics added) and encompasses \u2018but [is] not limited to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment\u2019 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3504).\u201d <em>(Social Workers\u2019 Union, Local 535 </em>v. <em>Alameda County Welfare Dept. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 382, 388 [113 Cal.Rptr. 461, 521 P.2d 453] [Original italics; fn. omitted. For the texts of the M-M-B Act sections cited, see fn. 2, <em>ante].) </em>The M-M-B Act thus \u201cdefines the <em>scope </em>of the employee\u2019s right to union representation in language that is broad and generous.\u201d <em>(Ibid. </em>[Original italics].)  The phrase \u201cwages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment\u201d is to be liberally construed, consistent with the \u201cgenerous interpretation\u201d which has been accorded it in decisions dealing with the federal law. from which it has been incorporated into the M-M-B Act. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-19\">The Act is also to be construed in light of its purposes, which are stated in section 3500 as follows: \u201cIt is the purpose of this chapter [i.e., of the Act] <em>to promote full communication between public employers and their employees </em>by providing a reasonable method of resolving disputes regarding wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment between public employers and public \u00e9mployee organizations. It is also the purpose of this chapter to promote the improvement of personnel management and employer-employee relations within the various public agencies in the State of California by providing a uniform basis for recognizing the right of public employees to join organizations of their own choice and be represented by such organizations in their employment relationships with public agencies....\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-20\">\n<em>The Amendment Relative to the Announcement of \u201cExaminations\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b866-21\">The original provision of the \u201cPersonnel Manual\u201d on this subject appeared in section 601 (entitled \u201cAnnouncement\u201d and hereinafter cited as \u201csection 601\u201d) of the \u201cRules and Regulations\u201d adopted in Resolution 71-73. The original text of section 601 read: \u201cAll examinations for classes in the competitive service shall be publicized by posting announcements a minimum of 15 days in advance in the City Hall, on official bulletin boards, and by such other methods as [the city\u2019s] Personnel Officer deems advisable. The announcements shall specify the title and pay of the class for which the examination is announced, preparation desirable for the performance of the work of the class, the manner of malting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>application, minimum requirements and qualifications for the class, conditions of employment if any and other pertinent information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">Section 2 of Resolution 73-111 amended section 601 to read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">\u201cAll examinations for classes in the competitive service shall be publicized by the Personnel Officer by whatever means and for whatever duration of time the Personnel Officer deems advisable prior to the holding of an examination. The Personnel Officer in making his determination as to the manner and duration of announcing an examination shall take into consideration the position to be filled, the number of applications on file with the City and such other factors as will insure a sufficient number of applicants for the position. . . . [The third and final sentence of the amended section reiterated its original second sentence, quoted above, without change.]...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">In its memorandum decision (see fn. 8, <em>ante), </em>the trial court discussed and disposed of the section 601 amendment in this language: \u201cPlaintiff [union] says the safety of fire fighters is involved, that hiring and filling of vacancies at any level relates to conditions of. . . employment. Basic to this argument is the premise expressed by plaintiff that the changed method \u2018inevitably results in the hiring of employees who are unqualified.\u2019 Safety is surely of prime importance but no evidence convinces the Court that the premise that unqualified employees will be hired is true. The uncontradicted evidence was that many more than required take the examinations. Reasonable steps to reduce that number without lowering employee quality seem proper.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]... [II] The Court finds the City\u2019s action proper re announcement of examinations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">The court thus rejected the union\u2019s arguments that the amendment portended the \u201chiring of employees who are unqualified\u201d and that it was accordingly within \u201cthe scope of representation\u201d as defined in section 3504 (see fn. 7, <em>ante) </em>and subject to the \u201cmeet and confer\u201d requirements of section 3505 (fn. 6), because it pertained to the represented employees\u2019 \u201csafety\u201d conceived as a pertinent \u201ccondition[] of employment.\u201d (\u00a7 3504.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>The court also determined that the amendment was \u201c[Reasonable.\u201d (See the text at fn. 9, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">We first conclude that the latter determination does not command validation, of the amendment of section 601, because it is irrelevant. The question is not whether the amendment is \u201creasonable\u201d or was effected for good cause, nor even whether the city was empowered to adopt it over objections expressed by the union in a \u201cmeet and confer\u201d procedure. The issue is whether the M-M-B Act permitted the city to adopt it, unilaterally, <em>in the absence </em>of such procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">It appears that the trial court properly rejected the union\u2019s \u201csafety\u201d argument, and the \u201cunqualified employee\u201d consequences claimed for the amendment of section 601, as unsupported by the evidence. We nevertheless conclude that the amendment has further consequences that brought it within the \u201cscope of representation\u201d (\u00a7 3504) and, accordingly, within the \u201cmeet and confer\u201d requirements of section 3505. The reason for the amendment as stated in the city manager\u2019s staff memorandum, and the trial court\u2019s review of it, were addressed exclusively to the announcement of \u201cexaminations\u201d to be given prospective employees who propose to enter the employ of the city for the first time and whose numbers had become unmanageable for examination purposes. (See fn. 9 and the' accompanying text, <em>ante.) </em>The \u201cexaminations\u201d actually involved are not limited to applicants for first-time employment. We refer to the following sections of Resolution 71-73, none of which was amended by Resolution 73-111 (and all of which were apparently overlooked below):</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Section 111 defines four different types of \u201cExamination[s]\u201d: \u201cOpen Competitive,\u201d \u201cPromotional,\u201d \u201cContinuous,\u201d and \u201cOpen-Promotional.\u201d Eligibility to take at least two of these (the \u201cPromotional\u201d and \u201cOpen-Promotional\u201d types) is expressly limited by section 111 to <em>present employees </em>of the city (\u201cpermanent employees\u201d who \u201cmeet the qualifications\u201d for the prospective position in the one case, \u201cpermanent and probationary employees\u201d with the requisite \u201cqualifications\u201d in the other), who seek <em>promotion </em>as distinguished from initial employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Section 118 defines \u201c[promotion\u201d as \u201c[t]he movement of an employee from one class to another class having a higher maximum rate of pay.\u201d Section 105 defines a \u201c[c]lass\u201d as an identifiable \u201cgrouping\u201d of employees. All of these sections pertain to positions in the city\u2019s \u201ccompetitive servicefsj,\u201d which section 107 defines to include all city employees except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>a limited number whose positions are \u201cexcluded\u201d from the definition, by section 107 itself, and are named among the few \u201cexempt services\u201d positions listed in section 1912. Section 1302 provides that \u201c[ijnsofar as consistent with the best interests of the service <em>all </em>vacancies in the competitive service shall be filled <em>by promotion from within the competitive service after a promotional examination has been given. </em>...\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">In sum, these provisions of Resolution 71-73 establish that \u201cexaminations\u201d of the \u201cPromotional\u201d and \u201cOpen-Promotional\u201d types, at least, are of vital interest to <em>present </em>city employees who may advance in class by \u201cpromotion\u201d and who are given preference in the filling of positions higher in \u201cclass\u201d than those they hold. Such employees are included among those represented by the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The amendment of section 601 abolishes the 15-day, bulletin board announcement of <em>all </em>\u201cexaminations,\u201d without distinction, and commits the manner and duration of <em>all </em>announcements thereof to the unfettered discretion of the personnel officer. The prospect that examinations of such importance to present employees of the city might be conducted after wholly ineffective \u201cannouncement\u201d may or may not be a real likelihood. However, the importance of the \u201cannouncements\u201d to the employees represented by the union, in light of the above-summarized sections of Resolution 71-73 which were not amended, is such that a substantial change in the procedure to be followed is an equally important \u201ccondition of employment\u201d according to the broad meaning of the term as used in the M-M-B Act and the liberal judicial construction required of it. (Social <em>Workers\u2019 Union, Local 535 </em>v. <em>Alameda County Welfare Dept., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 382 at pp. 389-392.) We therefore conclude that section 3505 of the M-M-B Act (see fn. 6, <em>ante) </em>obligated the city to \u201cmeet and confer in good faith\u201d with representatives of the union, and to discuss the proposed amendment, before proceeding with its adoption in Resolution 73-111.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">\n<em>The Amendment Relative to Probationary Employees\u2019 Eligibility for \u201cMerit Pay Increases\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The original provision of the \u201cPersonnel Manual\u201d on this subject appeared in section 1203 (entitled \u201cAdvancement\u201d and hereinafter cited as \u201csection 1203\u201d) of the \u201cRules and Regulations\u201d adopted in Resolution 71-73. Section 3 of Resolution 73-111 amended section 1203, by adding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>third sentence to its original two-sentence text, to make it read as follows (amendatory language italicized):</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">\u201cNo salary advancement shall be made so as to exceed any maximum rate established in the pay plan for the class to which the advanced employee\u2019s position is allocated. Advancements shall not be automatic but shall depend upon increased service value of an employee to the City as exemplified by recommendations of his supervising official, length of service, performance, record, special training undertaken, or other pertinent evidence, within the advancement policy established by the pay plan. <em>Any employee subject to a twelve month probationary period shall not normally be eligible for advancement in pay until he has successfully completed said probationary period, or any extension thereof, as provided in Section 1001 of these Rules and Regulations </em>[i.e., of Resolution 71-73],\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">The obvious effect of the amendment of this section is to make a new employee of the city \u201cnormally\u201d ineligible for any increase in pay during the 12-month probationary period he must serve under his \u201coriginal appointment\u201d to employment. (See fn. 10, <em>ante.) </em>Disposing of the amendment in its memorandum decision (see fn. 8, <em>ante), </em>the trial court stated in part: \u201cNothing <em>previously enacted provided for any shorter period before a pay increase. </em>Section 1203 as it read before the amendment said, and still says, that advancement [in pay] is not automatic. . . . Since it does not change an existing agreement or rule and does not change the probationary period, [the] City can properly adopt the . . . [amendment] . . . without notice.\u201d (Original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">The court was correct in concluding that the amendment did not \u201cchange an existing agreement or rule,\u201d neither of which is shown in the evidence. However, the.staff memorandum (in which the amendment was recommended) unconditionally stated that a new city employee was and had been, at the time of the recommendation, \u201celigible for a merit increase [in salary] <em>after six months employment with the City, </em>assuming his performance warrants said increase.\u201d (Italics added.) No evidence has been cited, nor have we perceived any, which controverts this statement. It thus appears that, although the amendment did not \u201cchange an existing agreement or rule,\u201d it halted an existing and ' acknowledged <em>practice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>Because the practice was of material significance to 12-month probationary employees (some of whom are represented by the union), the amendment which terminates it is equally significant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, its subject matter\u2014the timing of eligibility for a prospective if not automatic, salary increase\u2014pertains directly to the affected employees\u2019 \u201cwages\u201d as that term is used in sections 3504 and 3505. (See fns. 7 and 6, <em>ante.) </em>We again conclude that section 3505 of the M-M-B Act (see fn. 6, <em>ante) </em>required the city to \u201cmeet and confer in good faith\u201d with representatives of the union, and to discuss the proposed amendment, before adopting it in Resolution 73-111.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">\n<em>The Amendment Classifying \u201cFire Captain\u201d and \u201cFire Prevention Officer\u201d as \u201cMiddle Management\u201d Positions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">As adopted in 1971, Resolution 71-74 included a page labelled \u201cExhibit \u2018A\u2019.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It designated the city\u2019s \u201cManagement And Confidential Employees\u201d by showing their positions in two lists respectively captioned \u201cManagement and Confidential Position Class\u201d and \u201cConfidential.\u201d The only position in the city\u2019s fire service shown on either list was that of \u201cFire Chief,\u201d which appeared in the \u201cManagement and Confidential Position Class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Section 10 of Resolution 71-74 (entitled \u201cAppropriate Unit[s]\u201d) pertained to the establishment of \u201cunits\u201d for the representation of specific employee groups. In section 10(D), the city \u201crecognized,\u201d as \u201cappropriate units,\u201d (1) its fire service employees and (2) all other employees. Section 10(B) provided in part that \u201cmanagement and confidential employees who are included in the same unit with non-management or non-confidential employees may not represent such employees on matters within the scope of representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>It is undisputed that the designation of the city\u2019s \u201cManagement and Confidential Employees\u201d in Exhibit \u201cA\u201d to Resolution 71-74, and the above-quoted provisions of section 10(B) thereof, were effected by the city upon the authority of section 3507.5 of the M-M-B Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Resolution 73-111, adopted in 1973, did not amend sections 10(B) or 10(D) of Resolution 71-74. It did amend Exhibit \u201cA\u201d thereto so as to break down the listing of the city\u2019s \u201cManagement And Confidential Employees\u201d into three categories respectively designated \u201cTop Management,\u201d \u201cMiddle Management,\u201d and \u201cConfidential.\u201d In the amended lists, the position of \u201cFire Chief\u2019 appeared in the \u201cTop Management\u201d category. Two more positions in the city\u2019s fire service were shown on the \u201cMiddle Management\u201d list.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">It is again undisputed that these amendments were adopted upon the authority of section 3507.5. (See fn. 13, <em>ante.) </em>It is also undisputed that the effect of the classification of the \u201cFire Captain\u201d and \u201cFire Prevention Officer\u201d positions as \u201cMiddle Management,\u201d in light of the unamended provisions of sections 10(B) and 10(D) as quoted or summarized above, was to bar individuals holding these positions from personally representing \u201cnon-management or non-confidential employees\u201d in the fire service on matters within the scope of representation.\u201d (We here quote \u00a7 10(B) of Resolution 71-74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">In both defining and resolving the question whether the nature of the classification amendment required the city to engage in a \u201cmeet and confer\u201d procedure with representatives of the union before adopting it, the trial court read section 3505.5 with section 3507<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and stated in its memorandum decision (bracketed numerals added for reference):</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>\u201c[1] Section 3507 provides for certain things which can be adopted only after \u2018consultation in good faith\u2019 with the Union. [II] Section 3507.5 then seems to provide that in addition to the rules and regulations a public agency may adopt under [section] 3507, it may adopt reasonable rules and regulations as therein provided. Why the words \u2018... and in the same manner .. .\u2019? The placement of commas and the words used do <em>not </em>indicate that the rules and regulations concerning classification of employees are to be enacted pursuant to Section 3507. Had it been the legislative intent to include the classification authority as requiring [section] 3507 procedures the Legislature could have said so. [If] The Court cannot add what the Legislature did not provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">\u201c[2] In addition to the authority granted under Section 3507, the Legislature granted the authority to reclassify employees reasonably. The new authority does not call for its exercise pursuant to the procedures of Section 3507. Clause (i) of the subject matter of Section 3507 (i.e., \u2018(i) such other matters as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.\u2019) which may be contained in rules and regulations adopted following consultation in good faith does not include the designation as management employees. Had it been so included Section 3507.5 would not have been needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">\u201cThe Court finds that the authority to classify employees as management or confidential employees is not required to be exercised pursuant to the provisions of Section 3507.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">We respectfully disagree with point No. 1 because it ascribes no meaning at all to the phrase \u201cand in the same manner as in Section 3507,\u201d as used in section 3507.5. The prefatory clause of section 3507.5 is concededly ambiguous, but the words are there.  We must presume that \u201cevery word, phrase and provision employed in a statute is intended to have meaning and to perform a useful function.\u201d <em>(Clements </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>v. <em>T. R. Bechtel Co. </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 227, 233 [273 P.2d 5]; <em>California State Employees\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 1009, 1013 [108 Cal.Rptr. 57].) In our view, the ambiguity of the prefatory clause is to be attributed to inartful draftsmanship. This means that the clause must be interpreted consistent with the purpose of the entire act (cf. <em>Gibbons &amp; Reed Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1963) 220 Cal.App.2d 277, 286 [33 Cal.Rptr. 688]), which is \u201cto promote full communication between public employers and their employees . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 3500, quoted <em>ante.) </em> Accordingly, and while it is true that a \u201ccourt cannot add what the Legislature did not provide,\u201d as the trial court put it (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858), we conclude that the Legislature <em>did </em>provide in section 3507.5 that the \u201crules and regulations\u201d it authorizes are to be adopted \u201cafter consultation in good faith\u201d: i.e., \u201cin the same manner as in Section 3507.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">We further disagree with the trial court\u2019s second conclusion (quoted <em>ante) </em>to the effect that the comprehensive language of section 3507, subdivision (i), should be deemed controlling in the interpretation of the prefatory clause of section 3507.5. The former, read in its full context, is a general provision; the latter is specific. Both are therefore to be given effect if possible, and the specific will control against the general only if they are essentially inconsistent. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1859.) The two provisions are not inconsistent as they read: the reference to \u201cSection 3507,\u201d in the prefatory clause of section 3507.5, reflects an attempt\u2014 however inartful\u2014to reconcile them by requiring a procedure common to both. Our interpretation of section 3507.5 also reconciles both provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">We perceive no basis for distinguishing between the term \u201cconsultation in good faith,\u201d as used in section 3507, and the \u201cmeet and confer in good faith\u201d process defined in section 3505. It therefore appears that the city was obligated to engage in the process with representatives of the union, concerning the classification amendment, before adopting it in Resolution 73-111.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-15\">Having reached this conclusion as to all three amendments challenged on the appeal, reversal of the judgment in all three respects is required.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>(Cf. <em>Dublin Professional Firefighters, Local 1885 </em>v. <em>Valley Community Services Dist. </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 116, 118-119 [119 Cal.Rptr. 182].)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">The parties have ranged much further afield in their briefs, debating such additional questions as whether the classification amendment was adopted in violation of the city\u2019s \u201cPersonnel Rules,\u201d whether it is \u201creasonable\u201d on its merits, and the effect of a companion resolution which pertained to the same \u201cMiddle Management\u201d subject matter. As we have concluded that all of the challenged amendments adopted in Resolution 73-111 are void for procedural violation of the M-M-B Act, we need not consider these additional questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">As to those matters covered in its paragraph \u201cL,\u201d the judgment is affirmed. As to those matters covered in its paragraph \u201c2.,\u201d the judgment is reversed.

There was also evidence that all of the proposals were discussed at a meeting which was called for that purpose and which was attended by representatives of the union and a representative of the city; and that the proposal for reclassification of \u201cFire Captain\u201d and \u201cFire Prevention Officer\u201d as \u201cMiddle Management\u201d positions was discussed at one of the meetings which produced the \u201cMemorandum Of Understanding\u201d covering the 1973-1974 fiscal year. It also appears that the latter meetings were conducted for the purpose of negotiating that agreement, as \u201cmeet and confer\u201d sessions pursuant to section 3505. (See fn. 6, <em>antel) </em>The possibility that the city <em>did </em>give notice of the various proposals to the union, and that it <em>did </em>\u201cmeet and confer in good faith\u201d with union representatives concerning them, was accordingly suggested to the trial court. Despite the absence of findings on either subject (see fn. 3 and the accompanying text, <em>ante), </em>it is clear from the memorandum decision that the court determined to the contrary in both respects. We have resorted to the memorandum decision, as we may do, for the purpose of ascertaining the process by which the trial court reached its decision. (See <em>Niles Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>Alameda County Water Dist. </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 924, 933 [fn. 10] [112 Cal.Rptr. 846] and authorities there cited.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b867-8\"> These two sentences obviously refer to the reason for the proposed amendment as stated in the staff memorandum. \u201cIn recent years, the number of qualified applicants for most positions in the competitive service has become astronomical. For example, for positions of Policeman or Fireman we will administer examinations to normally 250 to 300 individuals. Testing these many individuals is of no real value to the City.\u201d The author of the memorandum therefore recommended the amendment later adopted, for the stated reason that \u201cthe number of applicants tested could be reduced to a more appropriate and workable number.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b870-9\"> Section 1001 of Resolution 71-73 states in pertinent part: \u201cAll <em>original </em>appointments shall be tentative and subject to a probationary period of <em>twelve months </em>actual service.

The amendment could therefore affect a \u201cnew employee\u201d who was then serving the first six months of his 12-month probationary period. The amendment contains no future operative date which would defer its effect to \u201cnew employees\u201d <em>hired </em>in the future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b871-8\"> In an aside to the parties, we note that the exhibit actually appears in evidence as the last numbered page of Resolution 71-75.
