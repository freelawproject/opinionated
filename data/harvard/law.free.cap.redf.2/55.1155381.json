Elizabeth Case and George M. JSFewman qualified as executrix and executor therof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">He left him surviving Jane Case, his widow, who died on the ninth day of August, 1871, Elizabeth Case, above named, his daughter, Sarah Jane Moore, a daughter who has since died, and Sarah J. Dickinson, daughter, and William C. Young, a son by a daughter then deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">William 0. Young died within the county on the eighth day of August, 1871, intestate and unmarried, leaving him surviving his father James A. Young (who is a lunatic now confined in a lunatic asylum, for whom Silas 0. Young is the committee) his only heir at law, and next of kin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">William Case gave all his property, real and personal, to Jane his wife, during the term of her natural life. After the death of his wife, he gave his <em>real estate </em>to his daughter Elizabeth, and his grandson, William C. Young; and the <em>personal estate </em>he gave as follows : \u201cI give and bequeath all my personal estate of what \u201c kind soever to my said daughter Elizabeth, and my \u201c said grandson William 0. Young, (after the death of my \u201c wife) to have to their own proper use share and share \u201c alike.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-8\">William C. Young having died before Jane Case, the widow, (some 24 hours before her) the question arose as to whom the share given to him went, or whether by reason of his death, before the death of Jane Case, the gift to him <em>lapsed.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-9\">Dill &amp; Eoyce, <em>for the Executors.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-10\">Dus yea, Bacon &amp; Duryea,/o&gt;- Silas C. Young.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b64-11\">The Subrogate.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah\">The general rule is well settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>that where the legatee dies before the testator, the legacy will lapse (2 <em>Redfield on </em>Wills, 484 ; 2 <em>Williams on </em>Executors, 1084).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">But the statute of this state saves the legacy given to a child or other descendant who shall die in the lifetime of the testator leaving \u00e1 child or other descendant (2 <em>R. S. </em>66 \u00a7 52; <em>Van Beuren </em>v. <em>Dush, </em>30 <em>N. Y. </em>393.) William 0. Toung did not die before William Case the testator. He was a descendant, but the statute has no application to the case, as he died after William Case and left no child or descendant him surviving, so that the question rests upon the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">It seems to be well settled that a gift to one for life and after his or her death.to another, vests in both immediately upon the death of the testator. The life tenant will enjoy the gift for life, and upon the death of the life tenant, the remainderman comes into possession; it is the enjoyment only that is posponed. (2 <em>Redfield on Wills, </em>506. (32); 1 <em>Jarman on Wills, </em>750: 4 <em>Madd. R., </em>411; <em>Hulme </em>v. <em>Hulme, </em>9 <em>Sim., </em>644; <em>Conklin </em>v. <em>Moore 2 Bradf., </em>179; <em>Arcularies </em>v. <em>Geisenhainer, </em>3 Id., 75; <em>Laroque v. Clark, </em>1 <em>Redfield, </em>471.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">In <em>Williams on Executors </em>this rule is laid down: \u201c When a person bequeaths a sum of money or other personal estate to one for life, and <em>after his </em>decease to another, the interest of the second legatee is vested, and his personal representatives will be entitled to the property, though he die in the lifetime of the person to whom the property is bequeathed for life.\u201d (2 <em>Williams on Ex., </em>776 ; <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>1 <em>Sandf. Ch., </em>131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">This rule I find sustained by every reported decision I have met with, and the same rule must be applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">William 0. Toung, died after the testator (William Case), and the share given to him by the will of William Case became vested in him immediately upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>death of William Oase, but the enjoyment thereof was postponed until the death of Jane Case, widow of William and although William 0. Young died before Jane (the widow) and could not enjoy the testator\u2019s bounty, still it belonged to him, and upon the death of Jane Case, his father James A. Young as heir at law, and next of kin, became entitled to the possession of his share.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">A decree must therefore be entered directing the share given to William 0. Young, to be paid to Silas 0. Young, the committee of the said lunatic James A. Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Decree accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
