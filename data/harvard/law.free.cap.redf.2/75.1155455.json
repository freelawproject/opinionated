The power of the Surrogate in this proceeding, and at this stage of it at least, is limited to passing on such claims as are contested by the heir or devisee, and does not extend to deciding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>upon claims which an disputed or rejected by the administrator (2 <em>R.

Vedder, 6 <em>Barb., </em>352.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">For this reason, without reference to the merits of the claim, the order to open the hearing is vacated, and the administrators allowed to proceed with the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
