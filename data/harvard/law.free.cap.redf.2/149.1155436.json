The counsel for Mr. Howie, proposed to cross-examine his client with a view to showing that the clock was given to him by the deceased; in other words, to prove the title to it in himself. To this the counsel for the administrator objects on the ground that it is not competent for this court to adjudicate upon the question of title to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The object of the statute is, apparently, to furnish a speedy and summary mode of enabling legal representatives to obtain possession of property alleged to belong to estates they represent, where the same is concealed or possessed by others. It provides for the examination of no witnesses other than the person or persons alleged to conceal or withhold it. Hence, it is plain that this court has no power to try the question, of title. This becomes more apparent on examining the sixth section, in which the condition of the bond to be given, is prescribed to be, that the obligor will pay the legal representative the value of the property, if in any suit to be brought by him, it shall be determined that the property belongs to the estate of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">I regard it as the duty of the Surrogate, in case he is satisfied from the testimony of the person examined, that there is any reasonable ground to believe that the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>erty belongs to the estate, to issue his warrant as directed by the act, unless the requisite bond be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The objection sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
