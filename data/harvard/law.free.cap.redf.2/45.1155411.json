Goodrich, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-14\">The only questions arose upon the construction of the following clauses in the will of the decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-15\">After giving some specific articles and two small legacies, he proceeds: \u201c I direct that my executor do sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>all my real estate and personal property not hereinbefore bequeathed, and after paying my legal debts incurred during my life and by my death, and settling my estate, the residue to be equally divided between my two sons, John K. and Ariel E. Goodrich. Should the two sons die before they become twenty-one years of age, then I do \u201c give and bequeath to my niece Caroline V. Golden, five hundred dollars ($500). And in aforesaid' case for sister Laura\u2019s benefit, one thousand dollars ($1,000), to be controlled by David Crawford Houston, for her benefit, according to his best judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\"><em>Sixthly </em>:\u2014-And in said case, I give and bequeath to my two sisters, Amanda Selliek and Harriet if. feet the sum of five hundred dollars ($\u00bf00) each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-6\">\u201c All the rest and residue to go for religious purposes, part for the Bible Society, part for the Home of the Friendless, part to educate poor who wish to be evangelical ministers of the Gospel when they are thought to be qualified, and bid fair for usefulness, and for such religious purposes as the conference thinks best to appropriate it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-7\">She then appointed her executor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b54-8\">D. F. Gedftey, <em>for the executor.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b54-9\">The Surrogate.</author>\n<p id=\"A1i\">The two sons take all the property when they respectively become twenty-one years of age. If they both die before attaining to the age of twenty-one years, then the legacies will go to the niece and sisters, and for religious purposes, unless the clause in relation to religious purposes is void for uncertainty or indefiniteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Before the niece, sisters, and the religious objects can possibly take, both John B. and Ariel E. Goodrich must have died before either had attained to the age of twenty-one years. (1 <em>Jarm. on Wills, </em>756 ; 1 <em>Redfield on Wills, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>439-440,488-489; <em>Dillon </em>v. Harris, 4 <em>Bligh, R. N. S., </em>321.) In case one of the sons attains the age of twenty-one years, he is then absolutely vested with the gift, and entitled to be paid his half of the rest and residue so given to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">If one dies before attaining the age of twenty-one years, and the other attains to that age, the share of the one dying will go to his personal representatives. The share of the one so dying will not lapse because the event in which he could not take, has not happened, to wit, the death of both sons. <em>(Willard\u2019s Eq. Jur., </em>513; <em>Beekman </em>v. <em>Bonsor, </em>23 <em>N. Y., </em>298).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">I do not find any authority for holding a lapse in case of the death of one of the sons before 21 years of age, when the other son attains that age.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The gift is absolute to the two sons, to be equally divided. Ho time is fixed for the payment. The law fixes that, making it payable upon their respectively attaining the age of twenty-one years. There is only one condition which will subject the legacies to lapse, and that is \u201c should the two sons die before they become twenty-one years of age.\u201d They are vested legacies, subject to be divested by the death of both sons under 21 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The next question is, what becomes of the estate in the case of the death of both sons before 21 years of age f This question as to part of the estate is easily answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Five hundred dollars is to be paid to Caroline Y. Golden or her personal representative. One thousand dollars is to be paid to Daniel Crawford Houston, as trustee for Laura. Five hundred dollars each to her sisters Amanda Sellick, and Harriet H. Peet, or to their personal representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">The balance of estate will lapse by reason of uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>The bequest to the Bible Society is void for uncertainty, for who shall say what part it shall take. The same remark will apply to the bequest to the Home of the Friendless, moreover it does not designate the institution nor its location. (1 <em>Jarm. on Wills, </em>316-317; <em>Jubber vs. Jubber, </em>9 <em>Sim., </em>503; 1 <em>Redf. on Wills, </em>671, <em>Pl. </em>5. <em>and cases.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">That the bequests \u201c part to educate the poor who wish to he evangelical ministers of the gospel, where ' they are thought to be qualified and bid fair for usefulness\u201d; \u201c and for such religious purpose as the conference thinks best to appropriate it\u201d are void for uncertainty, I need hardly ague or cite authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The balance of the estate, then, after taking out the legacies of $500 to the niece, $1,000 to her sister Laura, and $500 each to her sisters Amanda Selleck and Harriet FT. Feet, will go to the testatrix\u2019 next of kin in the same manner and proportions as if she had died intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Decree accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
