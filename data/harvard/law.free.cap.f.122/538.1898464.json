Such ores are found in various parts of Europe, South America, and the United States. Their primary extracted product, taking the form of tungstate of soda, is used as a mordant in dyeing cloth and for various other commercial purposes. Another of their extracted products is \"used to make high-grade steel, and imparts thereto extreme hardness, density, weight, and durability. The proofs in this case (and in that they are confirmed by standard authorities on metallurgy and chemistry) show that the ore does not contain particles of metal, but these are obtained by chemical treatment. The powdered ore is treated with soda and some saltpeter in a reverbatory furnace. The melted material is subjected to acid, and on evaporation, crystallizes into tungstate of soda. On adding muriatic acid to the latter, tungstic acid is precipitated. By igniting tungstic acid with charcoal or in a current of hydrogen, metallic tungsten can be obtained, in the form of a powder. Tungsten iron or ferro-tungsten is made from tungsten or wolframate by roasting it, freeing it from sulphur and arsenic by treatment with muriatic acid, and strongly igniting it with charcoal in a closed crucible. This gives a sintered or scaly mass, which is fusible with iron ore. Dammer\u2019s Handbuch der Chemischer, Stuttgart (1895). \u201cTungsten, in the metallic state, is one of the rare elements, occurring neither in nature nor in the arts.\u201d Article \u201cTungsten,\u201d 2 Mineral Industry, p. 614. \u201cIn the pure metallic state the metal' is considered only as a curiosity.\u201d Title \u201cTungsten,\u201d 3 Mineral Industry, p. 484. \u201cMetallic tungsten is obtained by reducing.\u201d Bloxem\u2019s Chemistry, p. 397. The question here involved is whether this ore should be classified under section 614 (free list) of the tariff of 1897 (Act July 24, 1897, c. 11, 30 Stat. 199 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1683]), which embraces \u201cminerals, crude or not advanced in value or condition by refining or grinding, or by other process not specially provided for in this act,\u201d or under section 183, which covers \u201cmetallic mineral substances in a crude state and metals unwrought, not specially provided for in this act, twenty per cent, ad valorem.\u201d In determining that question the canon of construction is that tax laws, being in derogation of common right, must be construed strictly. Hartranft v. Wiegmann, 121 U. S. 615, 7 Sup. Ct. 1240, 30 L. Ed. 1012. The burden of' showing the ore is covered by section 183 is upon the government, and, if its classification is open to a construction which would as well place it on the free list, the course most favorable to the importer must be adopted (American Co. v. Worthington, 141 U. S. 468, 12 Sup. Ct. 55, 35 L. Ed. 821), \u201cas duties are never imposed on the citizen upon vague or doubtful interpretations\u201d (Hartranft v. Wiegmann, supra). In Marvell v. Merrill, 116 U. S. 11, 6 Sup. Ct. 207, 29 L. Ed. 550, the court, in construing a prior tariff law, accepted Webster\u2019s definition of a mineral as \u201cany inorganic species having a definite chemical composition,\u201d and an ore as \u201cthe compound of a metal and some other substance, as oxygen, sulphur, or arsenic, called its mineralizer, by which its properties are disguised or lost.\u201d Presumably with this decision in view, when Congress subsequently placed \u201cminerals, crude,\u201d under section 614, it used a term of ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>tained scope in tariff legislation. Now it is clear that tungsten ore is embraced and described under the terms \u201cminerals, crude, or not advanced in value or condition by refining or grinding, or by other process not specially provided for in this act.\u201d It is inorganic. It has, as we have seen, a definite chemical composition. Its properties as a metal are disguised and lost in its mineralizer compound. Obviously, therefore, it falls within the broad generic term \u201cminerals, crude,\u201d etc., of section 614. Indeed, it was admitted of record by the government \u201cthat the article in question is a mineral substance.\u201d' If, therefore, it is not specifically described elsewhere in the law, it is covered by this section; and, being thus descriptively enumerated therein, the burden is upon the government to show conclusively it should be taxed under section 183 as a \u201cmetallic mineral substance.\u201d' It is a familiar principle that where articles have a well-known, popular meaning, such meaning, rather than technical, scientific terms, will be adopted in the construction of tariff laws. Lutz v. Magone, 153 U. S. 107, 14 Sup. Ct. 777, 38 L. Ed. 651; American Co. v. Worthington, supra; Two Hundred Chests of Tea, 9 Wheat. 430, 6 L. Ed. 128. If, therefore, the term \u201cmetallic mineral substance\u201d has any common, well-recognized commercial or trade meaning, it should be adopted. But the proofs disclose none. Now, as said in Robertson v. Salomon, 130 U. S. 415, 9 Sup. Ct. 560, 32 L. Ed. 995, \u201cif the commercial designation fails to give an article its proper place in the classification of the law, then resort must necessarily be had to the common designation\u201d; and for that common designation we must seek the dictionaries, which are evidences of common understanding. Marvell v. Merrill, supra; Nix v. Hedden, 149 U. S. 304, 13 Sup. Ct. 881, 37 L. Ed. 745. The Standard Dictionary defines \u201cmetallic\u201d as \u201cbeing, containing, or having characteristics of a metal;. as a metallic mineral.\u201d Admittedly, there are certain mineral substances wherein metal is found \u2014 gold, silver, copper; and a number of other metallic minerals were instanced hy counsel at the argument. But whether the number is large or small, sure it is that Congress has seen fit in this section to specify, not \u201cmineral substances\u201d\" generally, but a particular kind thereof, to wit, \u201cmetallic mineral substances,\u201d as subject to this 20 per cent. duty. Does tungsten ore answer this definition, as \u201cbeing a metal\u201d? As we have seen, no metal,, as such, is found in it. It is not a metal, but an oxide, and the tungsten is mineralized. Tungsten metal is not found in it. It is two degrees or processes removed from metal. Its change thereto is not by grinding process, but by chemical effects on its particles. The proof is that \u201cit undergoes a chemical process to decompose it.\u201d' The process \u201cis absolute transformation.\u201d \u201cYou change its character absolutely.\u201d It is \u201can expensive and intricate process.\u201d It is \u201cbrought from its oxide condition into a metallic condition by a process before-it becomes a metal.\u201d In the case of ferro-tungsten, where it is compounded with iron, it first displays metallic characteristics; tungsten ore is first changed to tungstate of soda, then into tungstic acid, and' then alloyed with iron to produce tungsten metal; and it should be noted that the proofs show such ferro-tungsten is classified and assessed under section 183 as \u201cmetals unwrought.\u201d The proofs show\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>\u25a0and there is none to the contrary \u2014 that tungsten ore has none of the characteristics of metal. It has neither elasticity, ductility, malleability, resonance, nor luster. In the Century Dictionary it is said the term \u201cmetallic\u201d is used to indicate the condition of <em>a </em>metal in which it exists by itself, and is not mineralized or combined with \u2022those substances which take away its metallic character and convert it into an ore \u2014 characteristics the very opposite of tungsten <em>ore. </em>It will be noted, also, that the government, in its official publications, has adopted this definition of \u201cmetallic\u201d and \u201cnonmetallic\u201d as applied \u2022to and descriptive of minerals. In the geological surveys of 1899 and of 1901 in evidence, manganese and chromic iron ores are listed as nonmetallic. Yet ferro-chrome and ferro-manganese, which are used for the same purpose as ferro-tungsten, viz., as a steel hardener, are obtained by direct process from the ore, while, as we have seen, it takes two intermediate processes before tungsten is alloyed with iron to form ferro-tungsten.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\">Finding, therefore, as we do, that tungsten ore is aptly described by the term \u201cminerals, crude,\u201d of section 614, and that it does not \u2022answer the description \u201cmetallic mineral substances in a crude state,\u201d used in section 183, the decree of the court below is reversed, with \u25a0direction to enter one in favor of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
