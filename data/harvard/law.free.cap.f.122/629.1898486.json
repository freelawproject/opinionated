It is therefore ordered that the cause be remanded to the District Court, with instructions to require all the facts connected with the failure to prove and prosecute the claim of the estate of John M. Orem, deceased, against the bankrupt estate of W. Morris Orem, prior to the petition of the appellee, to be inquired into and reported to it, and, when such facts are so reported, to pass upon the same. All the costs in this case to be in the discretion of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
