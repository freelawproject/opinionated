The defendant answered, admitting the recovery of the judgment, and setting up these defenses: (1) That, being a resident and citizen of the state of Colorado, he was on the 29th day of January, 1900, duly adjudged a bankrupt by the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, and that on the 17th day of April, 1900, he was duly discharged as a bankrupt by the order of that court from the payment of all debts provable against his estate on the 26th day of January, 1900; (2) that the plaintiff, prior to the 11th day of August, 1900, appeared before the referee in bankruptcy having charge of the defendant\u2019s estate in bankruptcy, and filed for allowance against the defendant\u2019s estate a claim founded on the identical judgment sued on in this action, which claim was, upon due hearing and consideration, disallowed by the referee, and that the plaintiff filed a petition for a review of the order and judgment of the referee by the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, whereupon the referee^ on the petition of the plaintiff, duly certified the claim and his ruling thereon to the District Court for review, and upon full hearing and consideration that court, on the 25th day of February, 1901, confirmed the ruling of the referee and entered judgment disallowing the plaintiff\u2019s claim based on the judgment. The plaintiff\u2019s replication admits that it filed for allowance against the estate of the bankrupt its claim, based on the judgment in suit, and that the same was disallowed by the referee, and upon review was also disallowed by the District Court; but it alleges the ruling of the referee in the cause, and the judgment of the District Court affirming the referee\u2019s ruling, proceeded upon the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action on the judgment was barred by the statute of limitations of the state of Colorado, and avers that it was not barred by the statute of limitations of the state of Texas, wherein the judgment was rendered, or of the state of Missouri. The replication further set up that the debt which was the foundation of the judgment sued on was created by fraud. On motion of the defendant the portions of the replication which we have epitomized were stricken out; the \u201cmotion to strike\u201d seemingly performing the office of a demurrer. By agreement of the parties a jury was waived, and the cause tried before the court, which made a general finding in favor of the defendant and rendered judgment (C. C.; 111 Fed. 361), accordingly, and the plaintiff sued out this writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-5\">Charles Claflin Allen (J. D.

It is not material upon what ground that court rested its judgment. It unquestionably had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject-matter, and, if either party conceived its judgment was for any reason erroneous, the remedy was by appeal, and not by a suit on the same cause of action in another jurisdiction against the bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">But if, as is claimed by the plaintiff in error, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado disallowed the claim upon the ground that it was barred by the statute of limitations of that state, that court committed no error in so doing. The bankrupt was a resident and citizen of the state of Colorado. If he had been sued on the record of the judgment here in suit before he was adjudged a bankrupt, either in the state or United States court in Colorado, he could have successfully interposed the statute of limitations of that state as a defense to the action. And when he was adjudged a bankrupt, and the plaintiff filed its claim before the referee, it was open to that officer in like manner to interpose the statute of limitations of the state of Colorado as a defense to the claim. There is no support in reason or authority for the contention that no debt barred by the statute of limitations of the state where the bankruptcy proceeding -is pending is provable in bankruptcy, or discharged by a discharge in bankruptcy, if by the laws of any other state the debt would not be barred. For the purposes of the administration and settlement of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, and determining its liabilities, the statute of limitations of the state where the bankrupt proceedings are pending is applicable, and is the statute of limitations by which the rights of creditors must be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">It comes to this: Can the trustee in bankruptcy plead the statute of limitations to a claim against the bankrupt\u2019s estate that was barred by the law of the state of the bankrupt\u2019s residence before he was adjudged a bankrupt? It is clear the trustee cannot plead the statute of limitations of any other state, and, if he cannot plead the statute of the state in which the debtor resided and was adjudged a bankrupt, then there is no bar to claims against a bankrupt\u2019s estate. The statute of limitations of the state of the bankrupt\u2019s residence, and in which he was adjudged a bankrupt, like the exemption laws of the state, governs and determines the rights of creditors in the administration of the bankrupt\u2019s estate. So far forth as relates to the statute of limitations, the rights of a creditor of the bankrupt are not in any manner changed or abridged by allowing the trustee in bankruptcy to plead in bar of the creditor\u2019s claim the very same statute of limitations that the bankrupt himself could have successfully pleaded, if an action on the claim had been brought against him before he was adjudged a bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The judgment of the District Court against the plaintiff on the plea of the statute of limitations is as effectual for all purposes as if it had been rendered on a plea of payment. The plaintiff\u2019s claim was barred before the adjudication in bankruptcy, and we have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>occasion, therefore, to inquire whether the statute would continue to run after the adjudication, and the appointment of the trustee. Richmond v. Irons, 121 U. S. 27, 7 Sup. Ct. 788, 30 L. Ed. 864; McDonald v. State of Nebraska, 41 C. C. A. 278, 101 Fed. 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\">But it is contended that the debts of the bankrupt, barred by the statute of limitations of the state in which he was adjudged a bankrupt, are not provable debts, and are not, therefore, affected by the bankrupt\u2019s discharge. This is rather a startling proposition. We are not surprised that no authorities are cited to support it. If this were the law, it would result in this curious anomaly: that, while all recent and live debts of the bankrupt would be discharged, no outlawed debts would be discharged, because they -could not have been successfully proved if the trustee had chosen to plead the statute of limitations. This would be giving to stale and outlawed claims a preference over live debts, and would leave the creditors free to sue and recover on these outlawed claims in any jurisdiction where the bankrupt could not for any reason successfully plead the statute of limitations, which is precisely what the plaintiff is seeking to do in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Debts are not the less provable, within the meaning of the bankrupt act, because the statute of limitations may be successfully pleaded against their allowance. As well say that a debt was not suable because the statute of limitations might be pleaded to an action upon it. The plaintiff\u2019s judgment was a provable debt, and the fact that a recovery upon it might be defeated by the plea of payment, or a plea of the statute of limitations, or any other plea in bar, did not take it out of the class of provable debts. The term \u201cprovable debts\u201d does not mean only such debts as are valid, and against the allowance of which no defense can be successfully interposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">A discharge in bankruptcy, that discharges the debts of the bankrupt in one state, discharges them in all the states. The Constitution of the United States empowers Congress to establish \u201cuniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States.\u201d The very purpose of a national bankrupt act is to give force and effect to the proceedings in bankruptcy, including the bankrupt\u2019s discharge, \u201cthroughout the United States.\u201d Its efficacy is not dependent on the varying statute of limitations of the several states.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The allegation in the replication that the debt which was the foundation of the judgment sued on was created by fraud is unavailing. Whether, after suing and recovering judgment on its promissory notes, and afterwards suing the bankrupt\u2019s estate in the bankrupt court on the record of that judgment, and afterwards bringing this action on the same record, it is now open to the plaintiff to say the original debt was created by fraud, we do not stop to consider. The provision of the present bankrupt law applicable to the point now under consideration is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">\u201cSee. 17a. A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts except * * * (2) judgments in actions for frauds. * * *\u201d Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 550 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3428].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">By this provision it is only \u201cjudgments in actions for frauds\u201d that are excepted from the operation of a discharge. The judgment here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>sued on was rendered on promissory notes, and no suggestion _ of fraud was ever made or heard of until the filing of the replication in this case, more than n years after the giving of the notes, and more than io years after the rendition of the judgment thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Decisions construing the bankrupt act of 1867 (Act March 2, 1867, c. 176; 14 Stat. 517) have no application to the present act on this subject. The language of that act was: \u201cNo debt created by fraud. * * *\u201d This act left the question of fraud in the creation of the debt open to inquiry after the bankrupt obtained his discharge, and proved to be a fruitful source of bitter and protracted litigation. In the light of that experience Congress has limited the exception to \u201cjudgments in actions for frauds.\u201d This language leaves no room for construction. It is as plain as the English language can make it.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u00b6\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b264-16\"> 2.
