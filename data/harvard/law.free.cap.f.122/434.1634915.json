Sittel, the plaintiff in error, against Allen Wright and others, the defendants in error, to recover the possession of a lot, and the improvements thereon, in the town of South McAlester, in the Indian Territory. The first paragraph of the complaint sets out the conveyances *by which the plaintiff acquired his right to the property. The second alleges, in substance, that in 1889 the plaintiff entered into a contract with the Choctaw Coal &amp; Railway Company, under and by virtue of which the plaintiff delivered to the corporation named the possession of the property in controversy, and the corporation, on its part, agreed to build cottages on the leased property, and was to have the use and occupation of the same until the rents thereof should be sufficient to repay the corporation the cost of building the cottages, when it was to deliver the possession of the same to the plaintiff, and avers the sums received by the corporation and its grantees or assignees as rent for the cottages built on the land under the contract are largely in excess of the cost of the cottages, and that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the property. The third paragraph alleges the plaintiff is the owner and entitled to the possession of the property. The answer of the defendants, among other things, alleges the contract between the plaintiff and the Choctaw Coal &amp; Railway Company set up in the second paragraph of the complaint \u201cwas an agreement made in violation of the law with an agent of the Choctaw Coal &amp; Railway Company, acting without the knowledge of said- company, and expending its money for a- purpose which said company had not \u00bfuthorized, and which the law prohibited; that said agreement between said Chaddick and plaintiff and Fritz Sittel, being in violation of law, as aforesaid, was illegal and void, and conferred no rights upon plaintiff in and to the premises in controversy; and defendants say that the equity of the Choctaw Coal &amp; Railway Company in said property acquired by the defendant Allen Wright, as aforesaid, existed and had protection by reason of the fact that said company\u2019s money was expended in said improvements\u201d\u2014and also pleads the statute of frauds and the statute of limitations. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the second cause of action set out in the complaint, and, at the trial of the cause, instructed a verdict for the defendants upon the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations. The plaintiff appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Indian Territory, and that court, considering no other question, held the instruction of the lower court to the jury to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>effect that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations was right, and affirmed the judgment, and thereupon the plaintiff sued out this writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-4\">Samuel A.

That \u25a0 paragraph, in legal effect, sets up that the Choctaw Coal &amp; Railway Company obtained possession of the property under a lease from the plaintiff, and that the right of possession of the company and its grantees or assignees under the lease has expired, and the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the leased premises. This paragraph stated a good cause of action. To hold otherwise would be to say that a landlord could not recover possession of the leased premises from his tenant or assignees after the expiration of the lease. It does not lie in the mouth of the defendants to say that the plaintiff could not make a valid lease of lands in the Indian Territory. It will be time enough to consider that question when it is raised by the proper authorities of the' Indian Territory. After having obtained the possession of the property under a lease from the plaintiff, neither the Choctaw Coal &amp; Railway Company, nor its assignees or grantees, will be heard to say that the lease is in violation of the laws of the Indian Territory, and that they are therefore entitled to keep the property, the possession of which they obtained from the plaintiff. Such a contention is opposed to a familiar and fundamental principle of the law of landlord and tenant. A tenant will not be permitted to deny the title of his landlord, though.the lease is void or the lessor had no title. 2 Wood on Limitations, 664-667, and notes; 2 Taylor on Landlord &amp; Tenant, \u00a7 705, and notes; Rector v. Gibbon, 111 U. S. 276, 4 Sup. Ct. 605, 28 L. Ed. 427<em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">The third paragraph of the defendants\u2019 answer, in addition to the allegation that the lease was in violation of the laws \u2022 of the Indian Territory, alleges the lease was made by an agent of the Choctaw Coal &amp; Railway Company without its authority, and from that fact deduces the extraordinary conclusion that the corporation, or its assignees or lessees, have acquired good right to keep the plaintiff\u2019s property. Such a defense does not merit serious consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">The lower court clearly erred in directing judgment for the defendants on the plea of the statute of limitations for two reasons: In the first place, there is abundant evidence in the record from which a jury might well find that there was a constant recognition of the tenancy by the defendants; which would, in any state of case, prevent, the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">And in the second place, the notice to quit, dated February 23,. 1892, did not have the legal effect attributed to it by the defendants, in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>It is contended the notice terminated the tenancy, and that the statute of limitations began to run from its date. This contention is not tenable. Assuming the notice to quite terminated the original tenancy, it did not make the tenant\u2019s possession adverse to the landlord in the sense that it would enable the tenant to deny the landlord\u2019s title, or start the statute of limitations to running in favor of the tenant and against the landlord. The tenant was none the less a tenant after the notice to quit than he was.before. Before notice was given, he was a tenant under the lease. After the notice was given \u2014if it was effective to terminate the tenancy\u2014he became a tenant at will or on sufferance, or a periodical tenant, as the case may be. Taylor on Landlord &amp; Tenant, \u00a7 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">A tenant cannot set up a title acquired by adverse possession while he was occupying the premises either as tenant or licensee. He must first disclaim the title of his landlord, and surrender the possession, before be will be heard to assert a right acquired by adverse possession. 2 Wood on Limitations, \u00a7 265, and notes. Until that is done, in contemplation of law, the landlord is in possession of the premises through his tenant. In other words, the possession of the tenant is the possession of the landlord, and the landlord\u2019s own possession cannot be pleaded against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">It is now the settled doctrine in this country that the estoppel continues after the expiration of the term, and until the lessee or his assignees or grantees redelivers the possession to the landlord. 18 American &amp; English Encyclopaedia of Law (2d Ed.) 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals in the Indian Territory and the judgment of the United States court for the Central District of the Indian Territory are each reversed, and this cause is remanded to the last-named court, with instructions to grant a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u00b6\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b466-14\"> 3.
