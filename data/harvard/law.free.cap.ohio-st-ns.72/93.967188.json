Even though a grant was made on the first day of the fifty-year period, nevertheless after the first twenty years, it would leave <em>only one fifteen-year period </em>within the fifty years for the fixing of rates, etc. The use of the language <em>\u201cevery fifteen years thereafter,\u201d </em>shows that even after the fifty-year grants have expired, in case of any renewal of grant, such renewal would be subject to those provisions as to how rates of fare, terms and conditions, should periodically be fixed, <em>as to these particular corporations, thus forming an arbitrary class of corporations with extraordinary perpetual powers. </em>After the fifty year period even those companies thereafter purchasing, leasing or consolidating would be excluded from availing themselves of the provisions of 2505i.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-6\">Counsel for the company referred to the <em>\u201clittle </em>word \u2018now\u2019 \u201d in the act. The little word \u201cyes,\u201d and the little word \u201cno\u201d have often decided the destinies of men and nations. And the word \u201cheretofore,\u201d which has a somewhat analogous meaning to that of \u201cnow,\u201d has been the cause of a number of statutes being held to be unconstitutional. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>claim that section 3239 confers all corporate powers on street railroads, and that all other sections only limit snch powers, is novel. Section 3239 creates the corporations so that they may receive powers, which are conferred by many varying sections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-5\">The limitation of the operation of this law <em>in part </em>to fifty years, is virtually a. provision for a'repeal of the statute within the enacting statute. It will be observed, however, that <em>as to the refixing of rates of fare, and the right of appeal to the courts, the statu,te makes a perpetual provision, </em>applicable at least for so long a time as the grants may be renewed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-6\">This act is a special act conferring corporate power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-7\">It will be observed that section 2505a gives power to lease or purchase only street railroads operated by <em>certam motive powers. </em>What is to be embraced under the description <em>\u201crapid transit\u201d </em>is very uncertain. It is certain, however, <em>that street railroads not </em>operated by electric, cable or other rapid transit motive power are not provided for by said section. <em>How rapid </em>the transit must be to entitle the company to the benefits of said section cannot be determined. Presumably it was intended to discriminate against the old-fashioned mule cars. The language of the section seems to hav\u00e9 reference to the present tense, or to existing railroads, only. The limitation of the act to roads operated by certain hinds of motive power is an arbitrary classification without reference to the purposes sought to be accomplished by the consolidations authorized by said sections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-8\">Section 2505d <em>limits </em>the right to receive grants for fifty years to companies <em>in existence, </em>and leased, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>purchased or consolidated prior to April 22, 1946, because it provides that the extension of grants thereunder shall not exceed fifty years from the passage of the act. It also <em>limits </em>the operation of said act and the right to receive grants for fifty years to corporations which have brought two or more lines of road within their control or ownership <em>by lease or sale or consolidation, </em>so that any street railway, even though in all other physical respects it be like the former road which has leased, purchased or consolidated, cannot receive a fifty-year franchise nor avail itself of any other provision of said act. This also is an arbitrary discrimination and classification, having no appropriate reference to the subject-matter or purposes of the enactment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-5\">The language of section <em>2505d </em>throughout also incates that it has reference to <em>existing </em>companies, or a present tense, as is shown by the language \u201cfifty years from and after the passage of this act,\u201d and the language \u201cpercentage tax on gross earnings <em>now </em>required to be paid\u201d and the language \u201cshall have the power at the end of twenty years from the passage of this act.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-6\">Section <em>2505d </em>applies only to <em>roads brought within the control of one company under sections 2505a and 2505b, </em>which roads are held and operated under grants providing <em>different terms, </em>and does <em>not apply to roads brought under one control if the original grants provide the same terms and conditions. </em>This also is an arbitrary classification and discrimination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-7\">An act which is not general is special. That is to say, the fact that an act applies to more than one or even a hundred corporations, does not prevent its being special. In order to not be special it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>apply to all corporations of its class, and the class distinctions must not be arbitrary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>20 Ohio St., 18; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>23 Ohio St., 445; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>31 Ohio St., 592; State v. <em>Pugh, </em>43 Ohio St., 112; <em>Pittsburg, Ft.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIM\">The controlling question in this case is whether \u201cAn act to amend and supplement sections 2505a and 25056 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, as enacted May 1,1891, and amended April 18, 1892\u201d (92 O. L., 277), is constitutional or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The defendant in error maintains that the act is unconstitutional and it was so held by the court below. The theory upon which this contention is based is that the act is special and that it confers corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>powers, thus infringing section 1 of article 13 of the constitution; and also that it is a law of a general nature which does not operate uniformly throughout the state, violating section 26 of article 2 of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Section <em>2505d </em>contains the legislation which is especially assailed here, and it does not require a critical reading to disclose the fact that it operates throughout the state upon every municipal corporation therein, and upon every street railway corporation or company of the class defined in that section. If it be true, as argued by the defendant in error and as held by the court below, that it is possible that some street railway companies may be excluded from the class, section 26 of article 2 of the constitution would not thereby be violated. This was the precise point decided in <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>52 Ohio St., 88. In that case it was remarked in the opinion: \u201cOf late years an effort has frequently been made to claim for this section of t the constitution a wider scope than to guard against the evils resulting from legislation of the character mentioned by Thurman, J., in <em>Cass </em>v. <em>Dillon; </em>Scott, J., in <em>Lehman </em>v. <em>McBride; </em>Boynton, J., in <em>McGill </em>v. <em>State, </em>and Okey, J., in <em>Falh, Ex parte, </em>but such efforts have uniformly failed. The only statutes which have been declared in conflict with this section of the constitution, are statutes making different classes of different parts of the territory of the state, such as cities, villages,\u201d etc. That remark is just as true now as it was when it was made, a little more than ten years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The proposition that because some individuals were not included in a class defined in a law of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>general nature, the law was for that reason repugnant to section 26 of article 2 of the constitution, was distinctly advanced in <em>Senior </em>v. <em>Ratterman, </em>44 Ohio St., 661, 665, and was denied by the court, both in the syllabus and at length in the opinion by Spear, J. It was there held that the constitutional rule of uniformity of operation throughout the state' was not violated, notwithstanding the contention of counsel that \u201cthe uniformity of operation required applies as well to individuals and occupations as to geographical limits.\u201d The law then under consideration was of a general nature, but it did not operate alike on all liquor dealers. The court said: \u201cThe principle of uniform operation requires simply that the law shall bear equally in its burden upon persons standing in the same category. * * * We are not prepared to say that the classification is not warranted.\u201d It was truly and forcibly said by Burket, J., in <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Spellmire et al., </em>67 Ohio St., 77, that \u201cwhen a law is available in every part of the state as to all persons and things in the same condition or category, it is of uniform operation throughout the state.\u201d See also <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Craig et al., </em>66 Ohio St., 75, at page 79. This, act, as we have already said, operates throughout the state upon every municipal corporation therein, and upon every street railway corporation or company of the class defined; and therefore it is not in conflict with section 26 of article 2 of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u25a0 But it is insisted that the act in question is not only a special act, but that it confers corporate powers, - in violation of section 1 of article 13 of the constitution. If it shall appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>that the act is not special, bnt on the contrary is a general law, it will not be necessary to determine whether it confers corporate powers either upon municipal corporations or street railway corporations, or both, or whether it does not do so. Adopting the language of the superior court, it is argued on behalf of the defendant in error, that corporate power is conferred in this act \u201cnot generally but specially according to the particular circumstances of each particular case;\u201d and that \u201cthe law is therefore a special law conferring corporate power.\u201d This conclusion is reached through the following propositions: <em>First, </em>That the classification of street railways in section <em>2505d </em>is arbitrarily and unreasonably limited to such railroad companies as come into the control of the different lines <em>by lease or purchase </em>from other railroad companies or <em>by the consolidation </em>of different companies into a single company; and that it excludes from the enjoyment of the powers therein granted street railroad companies which may have come into the control of the lines <em>by original or renewed </em>grants from the municipal corporation itself. <em>Second, </em>That section <em>2505d </em>does not confer equal powers upon all the municipal or private corporations within the classes respectively described, in that municipal corporations immediately exercising the power of extending the unexpired grants, or franchises to fifty years from the passage of the act have a different power as to time from that of a municipal corporation exercising the power twenty years later, and conversely there is an unequal power to receive grants on the part of the street railroad companies, and so likewise as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>readjustment of rates, etc., at the end of twenty years and every fifteen years thereafter; and <em>Third, </em>That section <em>2505d </em>does not grant the same powers to all corporations which act under the law at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">We do not accept without qualification the postulate of the court below, that <em>\u2018\u2018 </em>Classification cannot be made arbitrarily by the general assembly by seizing upon any incident or characteristic that may-suit its purpose.\u201d The legislative authority of this state is vested in the general assembly in the broadest terms, by section 1 of article 1 of the constitution, subject only to the limitations elsewhere found in the constitution. It is therefore not within the province of any court to declare void, and annul, a statute by reason of a supposed violation of the principles of justice and common reason, if it be within the bounds of constitutional power. The courts have nothing whatever to do with the policy, the justice, or the wisdom \u00f3f a statute so long as it cannot be said that it contravenes some constitutional provision. It is true enough that many courts, including this court, have said that classification must be fair, that it must be just, that it must be reasonable, that it must not be arbitrary, that it must not be a sham; but such expressions have ' uniformly been used in cases where the plainly evinced legislative purpose has been defeated or prevented from reaching all of its objects by an imperfect classification, or more frequently, where a false and unnatural classification has been resorted to for the purpose of giving a special law the appearance of a general law, to evade some constitutional limitation. Accordingly this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>court said in a recent case: \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>Classification is' often proper and sometimes necessary in legislation, in order to define the objects on which a general law is. to take effect and in order to effectuate the purposes of the legislation; but when classification is unnecessary, arbitrary, fictitious or otherwise faultily made, and is used to evade the constitutional limitations, under the form of general legislation, such legislation in relation to a class may be both special and unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Gentsch et al. </em>v. <em>State ex rel., </em>71 Ohio St., 151. Now, putting aside the utter improbability of a case arising in which a company had' accepted and had been granted by the same municipal corporation different franchises, all differing in time, rates of fare and other terms or conditions (for it is not pretended that such a case now exists), what, constitutional limitation is violated? The defendant, in error answers: \u201cThe general assembly shall pass no special act conferring corporate powers.\u201d But the conferring of corporate powers does not render1 the act invalid if it be not a special act. The act operates over the whole territory of the state and it does not exclude any individual corporation of the1 class defined. How can the non-inclusion of an individual corporation which is <em>not </em>of the class defined, render the act special in its nature? The opinion of a court that the legislation is unwise or unjust cannot be the criterion. The legislative purpose very plainly was to secure to the public continuous passage over all routes in any municipality, uniformity and reduction of fares, and uniformity in the expiration of franchises. The legislature sought to accomplish that purpose in general terms, by a definite classification which does not contain within itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>\u2022even a hint of a purely special application. We have no right to attempt to defeat that purpose by extraneous considerations which do not amount to an infraction of any constitutional limitation of the general power conferred upon the general assembly. No street railway company of the class claimed to be \u2022excluded by this statute, has yet appeared to complain about it; and it does not seem to us to lie in the mouth of a taxpayer, speaking for a municipal corporation, to make the claim for an imaginary corporation of such description. For the reasons stated we approve as the fair result of all the cases the statement of the law which is made in <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Parsons et al., </em>40 N. J. Law, 123, as follows: \u201cA law framed in general terms, restricted to no locality, and operating equally upon all of a group of objects, which, having regard to the purposes of the legislation, are distinguished by characteristics sufficiently marked and important to make them a class by themselves, is not a special or local law, but a general law. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">If the law was imperfect in its operation, or if the classification should be broadened, the remedy, as suggested by Burket, J., in <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson, supra, </em>should be sought through the general assembly. <em>The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>94 U. S., 155, was a case which involved the question whether an act of the general assembly of Iowa was an act of a general nature having a uni- ' form operation, and also whether the act was in conflict with the provision of the constitution of the state of Iowa that \u201cthe general assembly shall not grant to any citizen, or class of citizens, privileges or immunities which, upon the same terms, shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>equally belong to all citizens; \u2019 \u2019 and tbe following extract from tbe opinion, which was delivered by Chief Justice Waite, is pertinent here. \u201cThe statute divides the railroads of the state into classes, according to business, and establishes a maximum of rates for each of the classes. It operates uniformly on each class, and this is all that the constitution requires. * <em>* * </em>This act does not grant to any railroad company privileges or immunities which,, upon the same terms, do not equally belong to every other railroad company. Whenever a company comes into any class, it has all the \u2018 privileges and immunities \u2019 that have been granted by the statute to any other company in that class. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u201cIt is very clear that a uniform rate of charges for all the railroads in the state might operate unjustly upon some. It was proper, therefore, to provide in some way for an adaptation of the rates to the circumstances of the different roads; and the general assembly in the exercise of its legislative discretion, has seen fit to do this by a system of classification. Whether this was the best that could have been done is not for us to decide. Our province is only'to determine whether it could be done at all, and under any circumstances. If it could, the legislature must decide for itself, subject to no control from us, whether the common good requires that it should be done. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">It is also argued that the operation of this act is limited to fifty years from the date of its passage, that it is therefore a temporary act, and that being-such it is necessarily also a special act; and the court below has gone to the extent of asserting that this court has so decided <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoffman, 35 </em>Ohio St., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>435, 443, and in <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>66 Ohio St., 75, 79. This point was not made, considered, or decided in either of the cases cited, and the language of the judges delivering the opinions in those cases is that where the subject-matter and operation of an act is <em>local and </em>temporary, it may be a special act, and valid if it does not confer corporate powers. Here the question is, pure and simple, whether the limitation as to the time of operation stamps this statute as special; for this act, so far as appears from the act itself, is not restricted to any locality nor to any individual corporation. This question was before the supreme court of Illinois in <em>People ex rel. </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>70 Ill., 388, and the court said: \u201cThe distinction then, seems plain \u2014 \u2019a local or special statute is limited in the objects to which it applies; a temporary statute is limited merely in its duration, and, necessarily, a local or special law may be perpetual, or a general law may be temporary. This, therefore, is a temporary general law, and not within the prohibition of the section referred to. \u2019 \u2019 This is likewise our conclusion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Having, therefore, arrived at the conclusion that the act in question, which is commonly known as \u201cthe Rogers law,\u201d is constitutional, it is unnecessary to determine the other questions which have been so ably and interestingly presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The judgment of the superior court in general term is</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">\n<em>Reversed and the petition is dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b153-9\">Shauck, Price, Crew, Summers and Spear, JJ,, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
