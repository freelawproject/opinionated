Tisch, as submitted, signed and sworn to by the plaintiff and attending physician, show that her death was caused by a pistol shot fired purposely by herself, with suicidal intent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-8\">The reply of the plaintiff admits the proofs attached to the answer to be a correct copy, and admits that the suicide by-law, as set forth in the answer, was passed by the Supreme Circle at its meeting in Detroit in 1897 as alleged in the answer; admits that the death of said Nell A. Tisch was caused by a pistol shot fired by her own hand with suicidal intent, and denies every other allegation, and statement in the answer. For further reply the plaintiff says that when said Nell A. Tisch so fired said shot she was insane and irresponsible, and that at the time said application was made and said benefit certificate accepted by said Nell A. Tisch there was no rule, by<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>law, or other provision of the Protected Home Circle making said certificate void if death should be by-suicide. It is also alleged in the reply that no notice or knowledge of any change or attempt to change the rules, by-laws or constitution of the defendant in regard to suicide or other matters mentioned was ever given the insured in her lifetime or to the plaintiff until after her death, and no consent or agreement to change said contract was ever given by the holder of said benefit certificate or by the beneficiary named in the same. It is also alleged in'the reply that at the meeting of the said Supreme Circle held in Canton, Ohio, May, 1895, which was after the issuing of said benefit certificate, said Supreme Circle changed section 2 of the constitution and laws of the Protected Home Circle mentioned in the answer to read as follows: <em>\u20181 </em>This order shall be divided into Supreme, Grand and Local Circles, whose power, privileges, obligations and duties are set forth under their respective constitutions herein named,\u201d and changed sections 2, 3 and 5 of article 2, quoted in the answer, to read as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">\u201cSection 2. This Circle shall have jurisdiction over all such Grand and Local Circles as may be instituted through its influence, and governed by its laws wherever located, and the term of its existence shall be perpetual.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-6\">\u201cSection 3.

Every Grand Circle shall be entitled to send one beneficial member as a representative to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the Supreme Circle for the first five hundred members or less, and an additional representative for each additional one thousand members over and above.the first five hundred as shown by the books of the Supreme Circle on the fifteenth of December preceding the session of the Grand Circle, which representative shall have the same rights of voting, holding office, etc., as any other member of the Supreme Circle while serving as such representative; provided that after the membership of any Grand Circle\u2019s jurisdiction reaches 5,500, the basis of representation over and above that shall be one additional representative for each additional 2,000 members; and provided this amendment does not change the relation of any who are already members of the Supreme Circle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">\u201cSection 7. <em>Representation in the Grand Circle. </em>Every Local Circle within the jurisdiction of a state, province or territory, and comprising twenty-five or more beneficial members, shall be entitled to send one representative to the Grand Circle and one additional representative for each additional one hundred members above the first hundred, such representative to be a beneficial member.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\">It was also alleged that the Supreme Circle which met at Detroit in May, 1897, and which passed the suicide by-law, was entirely composed and made up in accordance with section 4 as quoted in the answer and section 5 as changed at Canton and not according to said section as it was then said benefit certificate was issued. Also that by the terms of article 5 of the charter of said association, the power to enact constitutions and laws for the government of all cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>c\u00edes instituted by said association is vested in the corporation, and that at the time said application was made and said benefit certificate was issued and accepted by said Nell A. Tisch, and at all times since said date the corporation has been composed of all its members duly received and in good and regular standing. It is denied in the reply that any amendment to the laws, rules, regulations or usages of the defendant in regard to suicide was ever made, passed or adopted by said corporation in any other way or manner than as stated in the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\">The defendant demurred to the reply for the reason that the facts stated therein are not sufficient in law to constitute a defense to the answer of the defendant. This demurrer was sustained by the court of common pleas, and the plaintiff not desiring to plead further, and both parties waiving a jury, the cause was submitted to the court upon the pleadings and the exhibits attached thereto, viz., the benefit certificate and the application and without any further evidence. On consideration of which the court found the issues joined in favor of the defendant and that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover thereon any other amount than the amount paid by her upon said certificate, with interest at three per cent, to-wit: the sum of eighty-five dollars, and rendered judgment , accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">Motion for a new trial was made and overruled, and a bill of exceptions taken, and upon a petition in error in the circuit court the judgment of the common pleas court was affirmed, and this proceeding is prosecuted to obtain a reversal of the judgments of both the lower courts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>Mr. A.

That, under the charter of this society, and the law of the state under which it is organized, the Supreme Circle had no power to enact such a by-law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-6\">2. The by-law could not work a forfeiture of this contract because the member never knew of the bylaw nor consented to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-7\">3. The by-law, if intended to apply to contracts made before its enactment, is unreasonable, inconsistent with the law of the state, and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-8\">4. This by-law cannot operate retroactively as it does not clearly indicate that such was the intention of the body enacting it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-9\">5. No forfeiture was declared or premiums returned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-10\">By the charter the power to pass by-laws is vested in the corporation, not in the Supreme Circle, which is only a creature of the corporation. There is nothing in the charter which gives the Supreme Circle any power whatever to manage or control the business affairs of this corporation. This authority so vested by the charter cannot be delegated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-11\">Unless delegated by the charter to a select body, the power to make by-laws resides in the body of members themselves and is to be exercised by the majority. Bacon on Mutual Benefit Societies, sec. 80; Morawetz on Corporations, sec. 491; Beach on Private Corporations, 311, 421; Thompson on Corporations, 955-960.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-12\">In this case the power is not delegated but is specifically declared to be vested in the corporation. <em>The Knigths of Pythias </em>v. <em>La Malta, </em>31 S.

Re., 501; 1 Disn., 94.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-5\">The Supreme Circle is the mere agent of this corporation, created by the corporation, having no power to pass by-laws relating to contracts made by it in behalf of the corporation. <em>Knights of Pythias </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>37 L.

The fact that the defendant is a fraternal society does not affect in any degree the obligations of the parties in respect to this contract. Bacon on Mutual Benefit Societies, secs. 51, 78 and 162; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wetherbee, </em>105 Mass., 149; <em>Rochhold </em>v. <em>Benevolent Soc., </em>129 Ill., 440; <em>State </em>v. <em>Life Assn., </em>38 Ohio St., 288.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-7\">By the charter the Supreme Circle had no power to enact this by-law, and the courts will not lend their aid to support this usurpation of authority. Bacon on Mutual Benefit Societies, sec. 71; <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Samson Lodge, </em>102 Ind., 262; 2 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law, 174.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-8\">Counsel for defendant have heretofore claimed, and will doubtless still contend that the Supreme Circle is the corporation. This claim is inconsistent with the terms of the charter and laws under which the society is organized, and inconsistent with the constitution adopted by the corporation at its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>beginning and which has ever since been part of its constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-5\">By the terms of this charter the Supreme Circle is a creature of the corporation, instituted by the corporation, and subject to the constitution and laws enacted by the corporation for its government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apt\">The relation which the Supreme Circle bears to the corporation is more analogous to a board of control ; and that is more nearly in accord with the charter, and with the law of the state of Pennsylvania, which contains . the following: Such corporation shall have power \u201cto carry on its operations through supreme and subordinate bodies or lodges and to issue beneficiary or relief certificates in accordance with its constitution and general laws.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-8\">By the authorities already cited it is established that boards of control and boards of directors have no power to enact by-laws, and in this law of Pennsylvania that power is vested in the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-9\">It is contended by the defendant that the charter, constitutions and laws governing this society are part of the contract; that Nell A. Tisch, when she became a member was presumed to know them and that she and her beneficiary were bound by them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-10\">If she was presumed to know the power and rights conferred by this charter and the laws then in existence, she was equally presumed to know the limitations upon the powers and rights of the Supreme Circle, and also the extent and nature of the powers reserved to the corporation and to have contracted, in pursuance of the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-11\">When Mrs. Tisch became a member and received the benefit certificate all of the rules and regulations governing the insurance feature of this association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>were known and named in its manual as \u201cLaws of General Application.\u201d This is in accordance with the act under which the charter is granted, which provides that the corporation shall have power \u201cto make a constitution and general laws for the management of its affairs,\u201d etc. The charter provides that the corporation shall have power \u201cto draft a constitution and laws\u201d which shall determine the matters mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-5\">It is to be presumed that the word \u201cconstitution\u201d as used in the state law, in the charter, and in said article X of the constitution of the Supreme Circle, is used in the same sense in all places and does not refer to the \u201cLaws of General Application.\u201d <em>Beals </em>v. <em>Rubber Co., </em>11 R. L, 381. The words \u201cgeneral laws\u201d in the act of the legislature, and \u201claws\u201d in the charter, cannot be treated as mere surplusage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-6\">There never v/as any other article, section or law giving the Supreme Circle the right to make, amend or alter constitutions or laws, except the above \u2022mentioned article X; and section 1 of that article, the only one relating to by-laws, does not pretend to confer upon the Supreme Circle power to pass any \"by-laws except for its own government and control.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-7\">It is claimed that this is a contract between the Supreme Circle and Nell A. Tisch as shown by the face of\u2019the benefit certificate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-8\">The certificate admits of no such construction when read in the light of the charter and the state law under which the charter is granted which are part of the contract. The Supreme Circle is merely the agency through which the business operations are carried on as provided by law, which gives the corporation power\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u201c(XI.) To carry on its operations through, supreme and subordinate bodies or lodges and to issue beneficiary or relief certificates in accordance with its constitution and general laws.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-5\">By a co-ordinate section of this same law, quoted above, the power to make a \u201cconstitution and general laws\u201d is vested in the corporation; and the agent employed must operate according to \u201csuch constitution and general laws;\u201d and in this certificate the Supreme Circle agrees to pay \u201cpursuant to the provisions of the laws of the order.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-6\">The section just quoted confers the power to issue certificates upon the corporation, and this certificate is entitled \u201cThe Protected Home Circle, * * # benefit certificate,\u201d and bears the seal of the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-7\">If it be true that Mrs. Tisch was presumed to know of by-laws enacted while she was a member the presumption exists only as to valid by-laws; those passed by the proper authority, reasonable, and such as the society had the right to 'enact, and which were applicable to her membership. She was not presumed to know nor bound to notice any other. So that before any argument can be predicated upon the fact that she did not complain, it must be established that the by-law is valid and applicable to her membership. Silence cannot be construed as a consent to the change. <em>Hamilton Ins.

It is not referred to in the benefit certificate nor in the laws which form a part of the contract. That agreement, as well as similar language used in the application, refers only to rules and laws regulating the fraternal membership or good standing of the member, and cannot be construed as agreeing to the interference with her contract rights without notice. Besides if it is construed to apply to contract rights it only affects the rights of the member personally under the disability clause of the certificate, and does not affect the beneficiary. Forfeitures are strictly construed. <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>53 Ohio St., 558; <em>Starling </em>v. <em>The Royal Templars, </em>66 N. W.

This certificate, though not expressly, did insure against suicide. Can a subsequently enacted by-law be more potent to destroy a contract right than one existing when the contract was made? The power reserved to enact by-laws to preserve the contract rights of members cannot be extended by implication into a power to destroy them.

It is a matter of contract between the insured and the insurer. Many policies limit liability to certain kinds of accidents and causes of death, the validity of which are not questioned. <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>10 Circ. Dec., 562; 19 C. C.

We desire to suggest that by section 2 of article X, above quoted, tbe Supreme Circle is tbe only body that bad power to alter or amend tbe constitution, and that right could only be exercised at a regular annual session. This law was in full force at the date of the application of Nell A. Tisch, and when the Supreme Circle issued, to her the benefit certificate it reserved to itself the right to amend the constitution and bylaws in conformity to the provisions of this section, and in the application signed by Mrs. Tisch, she expressly agreed to be bound by the exercise of this power. <em>Poultney </em>v. <em>Bachman, </em>31 Hun, 49; <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Supreme Tent, etc., </em>68 Hun, 355; <em>People ex rel.

Tisch or her beneficiary. In so claiming the plaintiff ignores section 2 of article X of the constitution above quoted and relies on a close, technical construction of article 5 of the charter, which says that the corporation shall have power to draft <em>a </em>constitution and laws, etc. And therefore argues that the Supreme Circle had no such power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>It is evident from a perusal of the pleadings and the exhibits attached thereto, that the defendant is indiscriminately referred to as, \u201cThe Corporation,\u201d the \u201cAssociation,\u201d \u201cThe Order,\u201d \u201cThe Protected Home Circle,\u201d and \u201cThe Supreme Circle,\u201d and that evidently no distinction, in a technical sense, is intended when reference is made to the corporation as drawing a line of demarkation between it and .the Supreme Circle, the association that adopted the suicide amendment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-5\">In a mutual benefit society, a substantial compliance with its by-laws is sufficient, and strict performance is not required. <em>Earley </em>v. <em>Earley, </em>13-23 O. C. C., 618.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-6\">We submit that the suicide amendment is clearly within the powers granted to the Supreme Circle, that the whole question was, by the constitution, placed in its hands; that section 3, article 2, above quoted, makes the Supreme Circle the legislative and governing body of the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">This is a beneficiary association, organized with the contemplation, presumably, of thousands of members, scattered over many states. If the corporation be composed of all certificate holders it would not be feasible or possible to get them or any considerable number of them present as stockholders to legislate for the corporation or to get an expression from the members which would reflect their sentiment or desire as a whole. The only reasonable and possible scheme of government of such a society is by delegated power, to representatives as in this society. The Local Circles speak by their representatives through Grand to the Supreme Circle. The whole organization graduating through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>different Circles to the Supreme, in which is vested the ultimate power and control and which in a representative way is composed of all the members. It is not something apart from the corporation, but is that form of it in which the legislative power is reposed. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-5\">It is clear that there is nothing unreasonable in the amendment here complained of, as the defendant association, if its experience has shown that it was for the best interests of its members that it protect them against the payment of suicide claims, would have the undoubted right to incorporate such provision in its constitution and laws. <em>Society </em>v. <em>Burford, </em>70 Pa.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmN\">The plaintiff sues upon a contract which was entered into by and between The Supreme Circle of the Protected Home Circle and Nell A. Tisch, the plaintiff\u2019s wife, alleging it to be a contract with The Protected Home Circle, a fraternal benefit society incorporated under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania. He is therefore precluded from claiming that the acts and declarations of the Supreme Circle, which may - affect this contract, are not the acts and declarations of the corporation; for, if the Supreme Circle may manage the business and property of the corporation, notwithstanding article 4 of the charter, it is not very clear why it may not control the affairs of the corporation under both article 5 and article 6 of the charter. Moreover the Supreme Circle is constituted a body representing the whole membership of the corporation, and for that reason alone, if the power were not expressly conferred, it might legislate within the charter powers of the corporation, as to \u201cthe reception of members, their rights, privileges, obligations, duties, dues, fees and penalties.\u201d It is provided also in the constitution of the Protected Home Circle (article 10, section 1), that \u201cthis Supreme Circle may, at any regular session, adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>such hy-laws * * * as may he found necessary for its government and control, and may change the same hy a two-thirds vote of the members.\u201d Thus having full power to do so, the Supreme Circle did enact a by-law which declares that a benefit certificate issued to a member shall he forfeited in case the insured shall die by suicide. In view of the adjudications upon the subject, there is scarcely room to dispute the proposition that such a by-law is both consistent with the charter of the organization and reasonable. <em>Supreme Tent of Knights of the Maccabees </em>v. <em>Hammers, </em>81 Ill. App., 560; <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>93 U. S., 284; <em>Be Gogorza </em>v. <em>Life Ins. Co., </em>65 N. Y., 232; <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McGonkey, </em>127 U. S., 661.</p>\n<p id=\"ARO\">The plaintiff, however, insists that it does not appear that the member upon whose application this certificate was issued, ever consented to or knew of the existence of this by-law, and for that reason the by-law cannot apply in this case. The contract which is the foundation of this action is expressly made in consideration of the representations and declarations made in the application, which application, it is stated, is filed in the office of the supreme secretary as part of the contract. 'In that application Mrs. Tisch agrees to conform in all respects \u201cto the laws, rules and usages of the order now in force or which may he adopted hereafter.\u201d She also signed an agreement, which appears in the medical examiner\u2019s report, to the same effect and as \u201cthe express condition\u201d upon which she was to he entitled to participate in the beneficiary fund. Having entered into such an explicit agreement with reference to by-laws subsequently to he made, and being a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>voting member of a local circle wbicb was presumably represented in the supreme circle, she must be held to have had that knowledge of this by-law which she well might have had, and inasmuch as she never, so far as appears, in any manner objected thereto, she must be regarded as consenting to it, both in person and by her representatives in the Supreme Circle.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">But the plaintiff also contends that the by-law, having been enacted after the benefit certificate was issued to Nell A. Tisch and before her death, could not deprive the beneficiary of his rights as they existed when the certificate was issued. That proposition might prevail if the contract of the parties had not read into the certificate all of \u201cthe laws, rules and usages\u201d then enacted and in force or which might thereafter be adopted. But a subsequently enacted by-law should not be permitted to impair rights which have already vested under the contract. The by-law which is the subject of the controversy in this case is as follows: \u201cThe benefit certificate issued to a member shall be void and all benefits thereunder shall be forfeited in case the insured shall die by suicide, felonious or otherwise, sane or insane, or by his own hand, sane or insane. Provided that in such case there shall be refunded to the beneficiary named in said certificate the amount of all payments made, together with interest thereon at the rate of three per cent, per annum.\u201d This bylaw applies to all benefit certificates <em>issued, </em>whether past,'present or future; but if at the time of its passage the death of a member holding a benefit certificate had already occurred it is clear that the certificate could not be forfeited under this by-law, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>cause the right of the beneficiary to the fund had accrued and he already had the vested right to sue for and recover the money due under the contract. But prior to the death of the insured, what enforceable rights can accrue to the beneficiary? That is the question which is presented in this case. The insured may acquire rights in his or her lifetime which may be protected by law; but before the death of the insured the contract is, in general, executory as to the rights of the beneficiary. It may be rescinded by the parties or it may be defeated by failure of the insured to perform. Mrs. Tisch lived more than three years after this by-law was enacted, and then, as it is conceded, shot herself with suicidal intent. There was no condition on the part of the association which had become absolute in her lifetime and which was countervailed by the by-law and we can discover no vested right of the beneficiary, the plaintiff in this action, which has been violated. <em>Supreme Commandery of the Knights of the Golden Rule </em>v. <em>Ainsworth, </em>71 Ala., 436; <em>Supreme Lodge K. of P. </em>v. <em>LaMalta, </em>95 Tenn., 157; <em>Supreme Tent of Knights of the Maccabees </em>v. <em>Hammers, </em>81 Ill. App., 560; <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen, </em>146 Ill., 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">It has been suggested <em>that Weber </em>v. <em>Supreme Tent of Knights of the Maccabees of the World, </em>172 N. Y. 490, is an authority against the views stated here. We do not think so. When the insured in that case took out his policy the rules of the association and the contract provided that the contract should be void if the insured committed suicide within one year, whether sane or insane. It appears in the opinion by Parker, C. J., that \u201clong subsequent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the taking ont of the policy \u2019 \u2019 and \u2018 \u2018 after the lapse of a year from the making of the contract, \u2019 \u2019 and while the insured was still living, the by-laws were amended so as to provide that if the insured should commit suicide within five years from the time of admission into the order, whether sane or insane, the contract should be void. It was held that such an extension of the time, after the lapse of the original contract period, was a deprivation of vested rights. The facts of this case are obviously different.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">It is also urged in behalf of the plaintiff in error that the certificate has not been declared forfeited by the association, and that no return of premiums was offered. That point is disposed of by <em>Ohio Farmer\u2019s Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>70 Ohio St., 354. The language of the by-law is: \u2018 \u2018 The benefit certificate issued to a member shall <em>be void,\u201d </em>etc.; and judgment was entered in the court of common pleas against the association, by confession, for the amount of payments made under the certificate, with interest thereon at the rate of three per cent, per annum. The judgment of the circuit court is</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b303-9\">Shauck, Price, Crew and Spear, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
