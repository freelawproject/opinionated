A guessing contest, instituted by a newspaper company, by wbicb persons are invited to deliver to the company fifty cents each, twenty-four cents of which being payment for a subscription to the newspaper and twenty-six cents for the privilege of making a guess upon the total vote for a state officer who is to be chosen at an approaching election, the guesser coming nearest to the actual total vote cast to receive a money prize from the fund equal to one-tenth thereof, and others next nearest to receive from the fund lesser money prizes, is within the condemnation of the statutes of Ohio against lotteries and schemes of chance, and is an unlawful enterprise. And a similar scheme, involving the same amount of payment by each person, but differing from the former in that there is to be no subscription to a paper, and the prizes promised are definite amounts from five thousand dollars, down to two dollars, is equally within the condemnation of the statute and unlawful.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b154-8\">2.

A petition setting forth these . facts is insufficient to constitute a cause of action in equity, and, the superior court not having jurisdiction at law in ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>tions to recover the sum of fifty cents, it was not error to sustain a general demurrer to such pleading, and dismiss the plaintiffs action.</syllabus>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b155-5\">(Nos. 8578, 8577 and 8579</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A_K\">Decided March 21, 1905.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">Error to the Superior Court of Cincinnati.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s actions below against these several defendants were begun in the superior court of Cincinnati, October 20, 1902. The petition in the first case named is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-8\">\u201cThe plaintiff, Samuel A. Stevens, brings this action on behalf and for the benefit of himself and all others similarly situated and interested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-9\">\u201cPlaintiff says that the defendant is a corporation organized and transacting business under the laws of the state of Ohio.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-10\">\u201cPlaintiff alleges that he delivered to the defendant company the sum of fifty (50) cents, upon a gaming and lottery contract under and pursuant to the terms of which contract, sums of money, uncertain in amounts, are offered as prizes, conditional and wholly dependent upon the happening of the uncertain event that the persons making the first, second, third and other nearest correct guess or guesses of the exact total vote cast for secretary of state of Ohio, at the November election, 1902, shall be entitled to receive said first, second, third and other prizes; that under the terms of said contract all persons making a guess were required to deposit with said defendant the sum of fifty (50) cents; that twenty-four (24) cents of said sum is retained by said defendant as the price of subscription to a newspaper belonging to said defendant; that the remaining twenty-six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>(26) cents of said sum is deposited with the sum to be paid out in prizes, as aforesaid; that under the terms of said contract, the person making the nearest guess, as aforesaid, shall receive one-tenth (1-10) of said prize fund deposited as aforesaid; to the second nearest, one-twentieth (1-20) of said fund as aforesaid; to the third nearest as aforesaid, one-fortieth (1-40) of said fund; to the fourth and fifth nearest each one-eightieth (1-80) of said fund as aforesaid; to the one hundred next nearest one-fifth (1-5) of said sum as aforesaid; the same being divided equally between said one hundred next nearest; to the two hundred next nearest one-fifth (1-5) of said sum, the same to be divided equally;

that the amount of said prizes is conditional upon the happening of the uncertain event, to-wit, the number of persons who may make a guess; that all and each of said prizes offered, as aforesaid, is conditional and wholly dependent upon the uncertain event that the guess of plaintiff or some other persons who has paid defendant money and made a guess in whose behalf and for whose benefit the plaintiff prosecutes this suit, is nearer the exact total number of votes cast, as aforesaid, than the guesses of other- persons who have likewise entered into said gaming contract with defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-6\">\u201cPlaintiff alleges that the defendant company received said sum of fifty (50) cents from plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>to the plaintiff\u2019s use, and that there is now due the plaintiff from defendant the sum of fifty (50) cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-5\">\u201cPlaintiff further alleges that he is one of a large number of persons who have delivered money to the defendant under the terms and conditions of said gaming and lottery contract, and that all of said persons have delivered money to said defendant under the same terms and conditions under which plaintiff delivered said sum of fifty (50) cents to said defendant; that each and all of said persons and plaintiff have a general interest in and common right to the money or fund thereby accumulated in the hands of the defendant company; that said defendant company, in pursuance of said gaming and lottery contract, has accumulated a large fund of money amounting to about $200,000 or more, that said fund is composed entirely of payments and contributions by the plaintiff and all the other' persons in whose behalf this suit is prosecuted; that said fund equitably belongs to all said persons who have made guesses and paid money to the defendant under said gaming contract; that the persons who have made said guesses and entered into said contract with the defendant are very numerous, and their names are unknown to plaintiff, and it is impracticable to bring them before the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-6\">\u201cPlaintiff alleges th\u00e1t the defendant, unless enjoined from so doing, will dissipate said fund by distributing the same as prizes, and to pay the expenses of continuing of said unlawful contest or otherwise, and that said fund will be wholly lost to this plaintiff and the class represented by him, and for whose benefit he sues, which will cause to them and each of them, irreparable loss and damages and occasion a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>multiplicity of lawsuits, and the plaintiff and each of said persons interested in said funds as aforesaid, are without adequate remedy at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-5\">\u201cWherefore plaintiff prays that it be ordered, adjudged and decreed that the plaintiff recover from the defendant the sum of-fifty (50) cents; that each member of the class on whose behalf this action is prosecuted, recover from the defendant the amount paid to said defendant; that the defendant be declared a trustee of the fund hereinbefore mentioned, and be enjoined from dissipating it by distributing it as prizes, and by way of expenses or otherwise; that a full and complete accounting of said fund be ordered; that a receiver be appointed to take possession of said fund; that a referee be appointed to determine the names of the aforementioned class, and the amount paid defendant by each, and for such other and further relief as this court may. deem proper. \u2019 \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-6\">That against the Commercial-Tribune differs from the other in the allegation respecting the' subscription and the event on which the prizes are t\u00f3 be paid, the amounts thereof, and the source from which payments are to be made. The uncertain event is the total vote to be cast for the secretary of state of Indiana at the election November 4, 1902, and the prize alleged to be promised to be given to the one coming nearest a correct guess of the total vote the sum of five thousand dollars, and others in the order of nearness down to two dollars, there being offered in all fourteen hundred and ninety prizes, all to be paid from the Company\u2019s own funds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-7\">The uncertain event named in the petition against the Enquirer Company is the total vote cast for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>secretary of state of Ohio at the election November <em>4, </em>1902, and there is no allegation respecting a subscription. The one making the nearest a correct guess of the total vote to be awarded twelve thousand dollars, and others in the order of nearness down to five dollars, there being offered in all four thousand and eighty-seven prizes; these also to be paid from the Company\u2019s funds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-5\">To these several petitions demurrers were filed, of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-6\">\u201cThe defendant demurs to the petition for that: 1. The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the action. 2. The petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-7\">With the petitions there were also filed motions for the appointment of a receiver and a referee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-8\">Upon hearing the motions were overruled and the demurrers sustained. Thereupon, the plaintiff not desiring to further plead, the petitions were severally dismissed and judgment entered- for defendant. Error being prosecuted to the general term of the superior court the judgments of the special term were affirmed. The plaintiff brings error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-9\"><em>Mr. J. P. Bradbury </em>and <em>Mr. E. D.

A guessing contract is invalid..</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-5\">Then we have the proposition that all these guessing contracts were and are wholly null and void, having been made in violation of a positive law; and. whatever relation exists between the defendant and these guessers must be a relation existing in law. It must be a resulting relation. Now what is that resulting relation?</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-6\">Section 4270 provides the method of recovery from a winner. There is no statute in Ohio providing how money may be recovered from a stakeholder or one in possession of the funds undistributed as in this case, and consequently it must be decided under the principles of the common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-7\">Section 4271, Revised Statutes, proceeds upon the theory that the lottery promoter has gotten something that does not belong to him and that, he is in law bound to restore whatever he has. gotten to the person from whom he procured it, and that a recovery can be had at any time, <em>even-after a contract is executed, </em>and in addition thereto, it puts in the hands of the person defrauded a means-of punishing the wrongdoer. If the scheme be illegal, then the defendant has received from each and every one of these guessers something of value-that it was not in law entitled to receive, and which it does not own. If it had no right to receive these-payments and contributions, it certainly had no right to keep them except for the use and benefit of all the persons who have contributed thereto. The defendant has come into the possession of this fund as a result of its own wrong, and it is impressed in equity with a trust for the benefit of all the eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>tributors thereto, and the contributors are entitled to have this trust carried out. .This is not a suit under the statute, but under the common law. The statute has simply enlarged the remedy, or rather furnished an additional one. <em>In this connection we will also state that the doctrine \u201cIn pari delicto potior est conditio defenden\u00fcs,\u201d </em>does not apply to these contributors. Equity will execute implied trust. Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, sec. 1053 <em>et seg.; </em>Story\u2019s Equity, sec. 1255; Beach Modern Equity Jurisprudence, sec. 226; <em>Shaw et al. </em>v. <em>Loan &amp; Trust Co., </em>8 Dec., 510; 5 N. P., 411.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-5\">When property is wrongfully taken by fraud or through any illegal transaction, a court of equity will intervene, raise a constructive trust by implication, and enforce an equitable lien for the protection of the true owner. <em>American Sugar Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Fancher, </em>27 L. R. A., 757.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-6\">A person who, from the relation in which he stands to another, is capable of exercising an undue influence over him,, cannot be permitted to derive profit from any transaction with him, and will be held a constructive trustee of any property so acquired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-7\">In the case at bar we contend that the defendant procured the fund through actual fraud. This will be readily seen when we consider that it is a corporation chartered under the laws of Ohio. That \u2022people at large would presume that whatever business it engaged in would be legal. It is the one who has done the wrong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-8\">The defendant has received the money wrongfully. Will equity permit it to wrongfully retain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>it, wrongfully expend it and wrongfully enjoy what does not belong to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-4\">The courts of our country for a century and over have answered \u2014 No. <em>Angle </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>151 U.

Dec., 386.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-5\">In the case at bar we contend that the funds in possession of the defendant in error equitably belongs to the guesser and that good conscience and a sound public policy impresses upon it a trust by virtue of which the defendant is trustee <em>de son tort </em>of the funds in its hands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-6\">Starting with that proposition as a basis, the plaintiff and those whom he represents are entitled to the relief prayed for, unless barred by the doctrine <em>in pari delicto.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-7\">We shall first attempt to show, and we think that we can do so clearly, that the doctrine <em>in pari delicto </em>does not apply, for the reason that the plaintiff and those for whom he sues are not <em>in equal wrong </em>with the defendants, if they be in any wrong. And here we wish to state that even were the plaintiff and those for whom he sues <em>particeps criminis, </em>it would not defeat them in equity. There must be equal guilt, but we shall go farther and maintain that under our laws, in the case at bar, the guessers have been guilty of <em>no wrong, </em>and that they came into equity with clean hands, because they belong to a class that is protected by the statute. <em>Browning </em>v. <em>Morris, 2 </em>Cowp., 790.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-8\">The conducting of lotteries in Ohio is not alone an offense against the statutes, but no law could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>enacted which in any way would legalize them. Section 6, article 15, constitution of Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-5\">It is significant, and we think a controlling fact upon this point that both constitution and statute law aim directly at the lottery promoter, while seeking the protection of those who would be deluded by them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-6\">Sections 6929, 6930 and 6931, Revised Statutes, \u201cOffenses against Public Policy,\u201d prohibit the operation or promotion of any kind of lotteries, but they do not hint at any penalty against the buyer of lottery tickets, and it is not <em>malum prohibitum </em>even to do so. Section 1920 <em>et seq., </em>provides for the suppression of all houses where lottery is carried on or any lottery tickets sold. No censure is found in any of those statutes upon the unfortunate individual who may be fool enough and guileless enough to part with his money on a lottery ticket.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-7\">Not only does the statute law of Ohio warrant the recovery of the money paid, and in this it is but declaratory of the common law as to unexecuted, contracts, but it has to a certain extent put punishment into the hands of those who have been cheated and defrauded by the promoters of lotteries, if they choose to use that method. The law shows clearly whom it seeks to protect. In the language used of the illustrious Lord Mansfield, \u201cThe statute is made to protect the ignorant and deluded multitude, who, in the hopes of gain and prizes, and not conversant in calculations, are drawn in by the office-keepers.. And it is very material that the statute itself by the distinction it makes, <em>has marJced the </em>criminal.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-8\">It is worthy of note that the editor of the subject, \u201cIllegal Contracts,\u201d in 15 Am. &amp; Eng.

In case of relief, upon grounds of public policy, the objection that a party does not deserve the relief, as being <em>particeps criminis </em>or <em>in pari delicto never prevails; </em>the public interest requiring that relief should be given, it is accordingly given to the public through that party. <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>9 Ves., 298; <em>Shirley </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>cited; <em>Roche </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>1 Ba. &amp; Be., 358; <em>Lord St. John </em>v. <em>Lady, </em>11 Ves., 536; <em>Neville </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>1 Bro.

Law, and <em>Horner </em>v. <em>United States, 147 </em>U.

Recent cases have enforced these considerations. <em>Quatsoe </em>v. <em>Eggleston, </em>71 Pac. Rep. (Ore.), 66; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rosenblum, </em>121 Fed. Rep. (N.

(1895), 474, considers similar plans, and in strong, terse language demonstrates that they are neither bets nor lotteries, quoting with approval <em>Caminada </em>v. <em>Hulton, supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-6\">The petition charges no acts of fraud nor undue influence, no intention to keep the money and not pay the prizes promised; on the contrary it charges that unless enjoined the <em>defendant will pay the prizes. </em>But not so mild is the brief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-7\">The brief, assuming, without so charging anywhere, that defendant intends to \u201ckeep the money\u201d from the guessers, to whom alone it belongs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-8\">This is determining \u201cthe liabilities of parties according to individual notions of personal duty,\u201d but it lacks \u201cthe intellectual repose\u201d <em>(Shinkle </em>v. <em>Birney, </em>68 Ohio St., 337) which one may sometimes enjoy when so engaged, and irresistibly carries us from the realm of law into that of fiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-9\">The brief of plaintiff argues that although the contract is wholly null and void because made in violation of a positive law, nevertheless it created a relation between the defendant and the guessers, and required the fund to be applied to the use and bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>fit of all of them. It thus builds up a theory that equity will raise au implied trust in favor of those who not being under any disability, not misled by any fraud or misrepresentation, entered into a contract with one who holds to them no relation of trust or confidence and where they do not allege or show their subsequent discovery of any facts unknown to them at its date, which make the contract illegal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-5\">Later it contends that the doctrine of <em>pari delicto </em>does not apply, because the \u201cguessers are not in equal wrong with the defendants, if they be in any wrong;\u201d that the doctrine of <em>particeps criminis </em>\u201cwould not defeat them in equity,\u201d and insists that they have been guilty of no wrong \u201cand come into equity with clean hands, because they belong to a class that is protected by the statute, \u2019 \u2019 without stating which statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-6\">It contends later that although the court may conclude that the plan attacked is neither a lottery or a gaming transaction, but is in some way detrimental to the public welfare and morality, or invalid \u201cby reason of public policy or any other ground,\u201d that then the right to relief is clear, that the public is the real plaintiff, and the relief granted for its protection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-7\">In support of these vague and general suggestions the brief cites a number of cases and text books, to whose real doctrine we take no exception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-8\">Some of them are cited and considered in <em>St. Louis Railroad </em>v. <em>Terre Haute Railroad, </em>145 U. S., 393. The implied trust arises only where one by fraud, duress or oppression takes advantage of the others\u2019 weakness, necessities or ignorance, and where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the less guilty party is granted relief, because he was the less guilty, and public policy would not thereby be infringed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-5\">Nor do Beach, Pomeroy, Story and the cases cited in the brief support its statement that \u201cin modern times equity has taken an advanced step in protecting the public good,\u201d and will grant relief to one <em>in pari delicto, </em>in order thus to serve the public interest. Pomeroy (sec. 941, note) points out that such relief is limited to the classes of cases described in <em>Railroad </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>145 U. S., 406; <em>Goshen </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>12 Ohio St., 624.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-6\">But even in such cases the court finds that plaintiff\u2019s laches or acquiescence will preclude him from relief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-7\">The plan could not affect the purity of the election. It exercised no influence for or against any candidate, or any party, and could lead to no change of vote from one to the other. It called for an estimate not for the vote of any party or for any candidate, but of the aggregate vote of all parties. If it affected the election it could only be by increasing interest in it and hence the number of voters. Anything which tends to such a result and overcomes indifference is rather to be fostered than denounced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-8\">If these references to public policy, purity of elections and other vague and general grounds of public policy have any weight they present considerations which should be addressed rather to the legislature than to a court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-9\">Thus statutory prohibition does not always make an act <em>malum in se, </em>but where it does neither party can obtain relief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Where the \u201cillegality appears upon the face of the contract\u201d there can he no relief, unless the plaintiff has been defrauded or deceived into it by the other party, who occupied a fiduciary relation to him. Where the contract is legal upon its face-there can he no relief unless discovery of facts making it illegal is followed by timely repentance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-5\">In the case at bar the plaintiff complains of nothing not apparent to any one upon the most casual inspection of his contract. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Garcia del Bio, </em>1 Turn. &amp; Russ., 297.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-6\">The brief of plaintiff says \u201cthe only place we have been able to find reference to that case is in\u201d' note to Pomeroy Equity, see. 267, mentioning its citation by Judge Cooley in <em>Youngblood </em>v. <em>Sexton, </em>32 Mich., 406.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-7\">One is not impressed with the thoroughness of the search thus suggested in view of the following references to the ease, many with statements of its facts and approval of the elementary principles it presents. <em>Youngblood </em>v. <em>Sexton, </em>32 Mich., 406; <em>Chester </em>v. <em>Halliard, </em>36 N. J. Eq., 313; Story\u2019s Equity Pleading (10 ed.), see. 97, p. 102; Foster\u2019s Federal Practice, 119-20; Beach Modern Equity Practice, sec. 68, p. 84; Fletcher Equity Pleading and Practice, 43, 44, 73; Daniel\u2019s Chancery Pleading and Practice, 242-3, 344; Pomeroy Equity Jurisprudence, sec. 267.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-8\">Nor can we agree with the doubt that the Garcia case decides any principle of law. Judge Smith did not use it to overthrow the statutes of Ohio. Lord Eldon did not assume the validity of the contract involved. <em>Chester </em>v. <em>Halliard, </em>36 N. J. Equity, 31(1882), states the facts of the Garcia case, quotes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Lord Eldon\u2019s language with approval and cites no other authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-4\">Whatever the exact nature of the contract, the petition was properly dismissed. The plaintiff stood alone and represented no one. Nothing but his fifty cents was involved. If his suit without prior demand were repentance, then his suit divided all participants into two classes, (1) those who repented with him as its sole member, (2) those who did not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-5\">The election having occurred as the determining event, it divided the latter into two classes, (3) the successful, and (4) the unsuccessful guessers. The day for repentance for the latter had passed. The suit did not extend their time. If the law ever gave them any right they lost it by delay, and have no further interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-6\">There is to be no presumption about it, and especially none that the successful are in a class or have any common interest with the plaintiff or desire his success in this case. They are in as utter hostility as were the plaintiffs and the defendant, Hearn, who demanded return of his money, in <em>Barclay </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>2 Ch. Div. L. R., 154.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s interest was adverse to class 3, for his success in this suit, if he in fact represented them, would have deprived them of their prizes. They had no community of interest with him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-8\">If the contract be as illegal as the plaintiff contends, the law gave the guessers no other right than to sue for and recover their money, if they sued in time. The plaintiff\u2019s action is no evidence of any intention of others than himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Each winner had another legal right, and that was to sue for his prize, and insist upon and test the validity of the contract.- This was a right of which none of the winners without his authority or consent could be deprived of by any act of the plaintiff. Yet the theory of representation necessary to support this case also requires that any decree in it should bind all contestants, and bar each of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4\">But the petition here alleges no facts showing that plaintiff was authorized to act on behalf of any of the participhnts. They had formed no association, entered into no agreement, gave no consent that he should sue for them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-6\">Finally it inevitably follows that: (1) If the contract set up in the petition was legal, then the plaintiff had no standing in court; (2) If it was illegal, his cause of action is founded on and arises out of it, and therefore must fail. <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>51 Ohio St., 277; (3) If he be- entitled to any recovery under 4270 or 4271, he is limited to an action at law for the twenty-sis cents, and that therefore the court below had no jurisdiction; (4) He represented no other than himself, and had no standing in a court of equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-8\">As already suggested, the appeals to consideration of public welfare and policy should be addressed to the legislature \u2014 not to the court. Before they can avail the plaintiff \u201cthe law upon the subject must be changed by the legislature and not by this court.\u201d Williams v.

For this estimate the defendant \u25a0offered specific sums in awards, or premiums, which were to be paid whether there was one estimate made or a greater number. There were elements \u25a0of skill and study required in making an estimate, so that the contest was placed entirely \u25a0out of the realm of. a lottery or scheme of \u2022chance. It required the successful contestant to follow closely the issues involved in the campaign ; to figure on the conditions surrounding that election, the increase of population, the increase .in the voters, whether registered or otherwise; to consider various other .conditions which would naturally present themselves to the mind of a person desiring to make a successful estimate. As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>matter of argument, entirely irrespective of what the facts might have been or were in this case, this must be the course pursued by the various contestants in making their estimates in order to -be successful. On account of the various observations required and the statistical examination necessary to be made, all question as to its being a lottery was eliminated, and the contest resolved itself into an exercise of study and judgment, such as removed it from the charge of being a lottery to that of a political and economic opinion. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>1 Q.

Consider, now, the words used in the United States Statutes, section 3894, and the court will see that the words contained therein are not only as comprehensive as those contained in our statutes (eliminating the word \u201cpolicy,\u201d which is not claimed by any one to be involved in this case), but more comprehensive, for the United States statute contains the words \u201clottery, so-called gift or similar enterprises offering prizes dependent upon lot or chance.\u201d The statute also repeats the foregoing words once or twice. Sections 3929 and 4041 of the Revised Statutes of the United States use even stronger words than 3894, and they authorize the postmaster to forbid the delivery of letters containing either the money orders or the advertisement, and those statutes use the words \u201cengaged in conducting any lottery, gift enterprise or scheme for the distribution of money or for any real or personal property by lot, chance or drawing of any kind. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>These two latter sections, as well as the first section quoted, are all part of the same act, and must be construed together, so as to give the court the benefit of the entire situation.

There are two parties to the gaming contract, one putting up money on the one side and one putting up money on the other side. Further, it is known when the bet or wager is made who are the parties who must either win or lose; that is just the reverse of conditions in this case. The facts as relating to this case are that the defendant placed a specific sum as prizes. Stevens, the individual, made an estimate, and whether he won or lost did not affect the contractual relations with the other parties, nor did it affect the contractual relations between them, whether the company received one guess or a great number.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-6\">We desire to call the court\u2019s attention to certain authorities to rebut this contention that this is a gaming contract. <em>Alvord </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>63 Ind., 62; <em>Hanks </em>v. <em>Brown, 79 </em>Ia., 560; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Day, 71 </em>Wis., 296; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>White, </em>61 N.

There is not the slightest charge in this case of any fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the defendant to the plaintiff, and, therefore, the plaintiff puts upon himself the odium which the law casts upon a litigant when he makes the direct charge of being a party to a lottery or gaming contract, and, by reason thereof, can not recover. In such a situation the maxim, <em>\u201cEx turpi causa, non oritur actio,\u201d </em>applies to the plaintiff. Let us see the situation the plaintiff was in before the legislature enacted the statutes, sections 4269 to 4271, which gave the plaintiff the right to recover at law money lost or wagered in a lottery or at gambling. <em>Hooker et al. </em>v. <em>DePalos, </em>28 Ohio St., 261; <em>Kahn </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>46 Ohio St., 210.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-6\">These propositions, as advanced by our Supreme Court, are irrefutable when this court considers the pleas advanced by the plaintiff as to his rights to recover, and sustain our contention that on the proposition of <em>pari delicto </em>he has no standing in a court of equity. This opinion of our court is fully substantiated in a series of decisions from which quotations are unnecessary, but which we shall cite to the court now: <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Haughton, </em>134 N. Y., 115; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Richmond, 12 </em>Wall., 349; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>36 Ala., 180; <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>McCrea, </em>5 O.

The corporation had set apart for the payment of these awards money not connected with the payments made by the parties in any way, and we, therefore, submit, in view of the foregoing authorities and the well-established principle that this is not a case where the plaintiff can unite others with him, either as plaintiffs or make them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>parties to the suit as defendants, so as to make an equitable action.

When he paid his money and registered his estimate, his hope for success lay in the accuracy of registration carried on by the defendant; in the thoroughness of its system for the prevention of fraudulent estimates which might participate in the awards; in the many things which, in a contest of this kind, are necessary to insure fairness and justice in the awarding and distribution of the <em>agreed </em>premiums. <em>These precautions and such a system must, of their very nature, entail expense. </em>And yet, at the very close of the contest, this plaintiff appears, asking, after the defendant had altered his position and expended large sums of money in carrying it on, that a court of equity shall interfere, by extraordinary process, to put him in <em>statu quo. Miller </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>19 Wis., 466.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-6\">If we are to accept the astounding contention of the plaintiff that he sues for himself <em>and all other participants </em>in the contest, he can not escape the answer that such contest was carried on by the defendant at great expense and at the cost of much time and labor, so that <em>its position being altered, </em>plaintiff, and those on behalf of whom he <em>claims </em>to sue, can not ask to be put in <em>statu quo </em>at the expense of the defendant, with whom they are <em>in pari delicto.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>His repentance, to be meritorious, should come in time to prevent loss to the other party, and, <em>if honest, should </em>be <em>at his own proper expense.

But it is believed that there is no essential difference in the questions of law presented by the several petitions. Hence it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>not been found important to incorporate all of them in full in the record here.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">To maintain his case the plaintiff must establish that the scheme shown by the petition involves a lottery, or a gaming contract such as is made unlawful either by the statutes of Ohio or at common law, and that he is entitled to relief by a court of equity such as is demanded by his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">1. Is the project a lottery, or an unlawful gaming scheme of any kind <em>1 </em>Under the head of \u201c Lotteries \u2019 \u2019 our statutes, sections 6929, 6930 and 6931, interdict the publishing in any way an account of any lottery or scheme of chance of any kind or description, stating when or where the same is to be drawn, or the prizes therein, or in any way giving publicity to such lottery or scheme of chance; the vending, or in any way disposing of any ticket, order or device of any kind, for or representing any number . of shares, or any interest in any lottery or scheme of chance of any kind or description; the carrying on or promoting any scheme of chance of any kind or description by whatever name, style or title the same may be denominated or known. Under the head of \u201cGaming and Betting,\u201d section 6938 declares unlawful the making of any bet or wager for any sum of money, or other property of any value, and the following section declares unlawful the making of any bet or wager on the result of any election held under the laws of this state, etc. Giving further effect to the spirit of these provisions, the statute (sections 4269 to 4271) declares that all promises, agreements, etc., the whole or any part of the consideration of which is money or any other valuable thing, won or lost, laid, staked, or betted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>at or upon any game of any kind, or under any denomination or name whatsoever, or upon any wager, shall he absolutely void; money, or other thing of value, may he recovered hack from the winner hy action commenced within six months, and one who expends any money, or thing of value, to procure any chance, or any interest therein, on account of any scheme of chance, may sue for and recover from the person receiving such money, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Many definitions of the word lottery are found in the hooks. An often quoted definition is given by Folger, J., in <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Ruggles, </em>56 N. Y., 424, which is: \u201cWhere a pecuniary consideration is paid, and it is determined hy lot or chance, according to some scheme held out to the public, what and how much he who pays the money is to have for it, that is a lottery.\u201d \u201cA sort of gaming contract by which, for a valuable consideration, one may, by favor of the lot, obtain a prize of a value superior to the amount or value of that which he risks.\u201d American Cyclo. \u201cA lottery,\u201d says the supreme court of Michigan in <em>The People </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>74 Mich., 264, \u201cis a scheme by which a result is reached by some action or means taken, and in which result man\u2019s choice or will has no part, nor can human reason, foresight, sagacity, or design enable him to know or determine such result until the same has been accomplished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">However, it should not be concluded that the term \u201clot or chance\u201d implies that if any element of certainty or skill enters into the scheme it therefore relieves it of its character as a lottery, or scheme of chance. Chance is something that befalls; the result of unknown or uncertain forces or conditions. An intelligent definition is given in 6 Cyc., 890, thus: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u201cPossibility, hazard, risk,'or the result or issue of uncertain and unknown conditions or forces, neither understandingly brought about by one\u2019s act, nor pre-estimated by one\u2019s understanding.\u201d This element of chance is not at all incompatible with the presence of an element of calculation, or even certainty. That principle is illustrated in <em>Horner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>147 U. S., 449, where the court say: \u201cAlthough by the bonds in question, Austria attempted to obtain a loan of money, she also undertook to assist her credit by an appeal to the cupidity of those who had money, and offered to every holder of a bond a chance of obtaining a prize dependent upon lot or chance, the element of certainty going hand in hand with the element of lot or chance, but the former not destroying the existence or effect of the latter.\u201d It is easily within bounds to conclude that if the dominating, determining element is one of chance, that element gives character to the whole scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Our statute as to gaming and betting has been cited. A bet is: \u201cAn agreement between two or more, that a sum of money, or some valuable thing, in contributing which all agreeing take part, shall become the property of one or some of them, on the happening in the future of an event at the present uncertain; the mutual agreement and tender of a gift of something valuable, which is to belong to the one or the other of the contracting parties, according to the result of the trial of chance or skill, or both combined; a wager; to put to hazard a sum ascertained upon a future happening of some event then uncertain; the thing or sum wagered. \u2019 \u2019 5 Cye., 684. A wager is: \u201cA bet; a contract by which two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>parties or more agree that a certain snm of money, or other thing, shall be paid or delivered to one of them on the happening, or not happening of an uncertain event. A contract upon a contingency by which one may lose but cannot gain, or the other must gain but cannot lose, is a wager. * # <em>* </em>A wager is something hazarded on the issue of some uncertain event; a bet is a wager, although a wager is not necessarily a bet.\u201d 2 Bouv., 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">With the provisions of statute and these rules and definitions before us, what conclusion follows ? The petition in the first-named case shows that the plaintiff paid fifty cents for a subscription to a newspaper and for the privilege of guessing or estimating the total number of votes that would be cast for the secretary of state of .Ohio, at the coming election, November 4, 1902, the subscription to cost twenty-four cents and the guess to cost twenty-six cents, and in case his guess should be superior to all those coming within the terms of the offer extended to all, or equal to those coming within a lower class with the plaintiff, he was to receive a money prize, to be paid to him by the newspaper company, varying in amount from one-tenth of the whole sum contributed by the guessers, to a sum equal to one-fifth of one-eightieth of the whole sum so contributed, all depending upon the nearness of his guess to the actual number of votes cast for the officer named and the nearness of the other guesses to that total vote. It was the opinion of the learned judge who heard the case at the special term that these guessing contests were not within the condemnation of the., statutes of Ohio against lotteries, gambling, wagering, or betting. (13 Dec., 235.) In a later case, that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>Hobing </em>v. <em>The Enquirer Company, </em>heard in the common pleas of Hamilton county, wherein the plaintiff, a guesser, sought to recover judgment upon an allegation that he had made the correct estimate and was therefore entitled to the prize of $10,000.00, that court (Littleford, J.) held that the alleged contract was a wager between the plaintiff and defendant, was in violation of section 4269, Revised Statutes, and that, while plaintiff might, under this statute, recover back his fifty cents in a proper court, yet, the common pleas not having jurisdiction of the amount, the petition was dismissed. By the opinion in this later ease (2 N. P. N. S., 205), we learn that, although the general term affirmed the judgment of the special term, two of the judges (one of them being the learned judge of. the common pleas at the time sitting as a member of the general term) did not concur in the holding of the special term respecting the character of the contract.'</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Which, if either, of these views is correct? It would seem not difficult to reach the conclusion that the project was, in essence and reality, a scheme of chance. The term guess itself imports uncertainty. It is at best a conjecture, a random judgment, and a guesser is one who gives an opinion without means of knowing. It is true that one acquainted with the results of the elections of the state in previous years and educated in politics would have some advantages over one ignorant in those respects, yet, it must be apparent even to a casual observer, that the result would depend upon so many uncertain and unascertainable causes, that the estimate of the most learned would be after all nothing more than a random and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>undecisive judgment. In the sense above indicated there is an element of skill, possibly certainty, involved, but it is clear that the controlling, predominating element is mere chance. It was a chance as to what the total vote would be; it was equally a chance as to what the guesses of the other guessers would be. Whether or not the transaction includes the quality of a bet is not so certain. Its determination is not essential to a proper disposition of this case. We incline to think, however, that it does, but are unable to agree with the conclusion that the bet is between the plaintiff and the defendant. A bet implies that what one party gains the other loses, and <em>vice versa. </em>The defendant in the present case loses nothing whatever the outcome; nor does it gain whatever the outcome. It is a matter of indifference to it who wins the prizes, whether this plaintiff or any of the other contributors. Not so with the contributors between themselves. If A. should win the first prize, for instance, B. could not. If the transaction were a bet, therefore, it would seem to be between this plaintiff and all the other guessers, and in this view the defendant would be a mere stakeholder. We are not concerned to inquire what the law of other jurisdictions may be and hence do not take the pains to discuss, or even cite, the mass of authorities cited by counsel. They will be found in the reporter\u2019s introduction, to which any curious inquirer, should there be such, is referred. It suffices that, under the laws of Ohio, these guessing contests were, all of them, unlawful. Not that there is any belief or claim that the several defendants would, either of them, fail to conduct the ascertainment of the successful guessers and the awarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>and payment of the prizes with entire impartiality and fairness, but the schemes themselves must be held to be within the condemnation of our statute. The vice of the project lies in the payment of money for the opportunity to win more money by a scheme of chance. It is not simply the winning of prizes that the statute seeks to inhibit. There may be such contests in which there is no element of gambling. If the contestant, or player, risk nothing, as where the prizes are offered in school by the teacher to scholars for the best essay, or in society by the host or hostess as an inducement to guests to attend social gatherings and indulge in games innocent in themselves, the winners to receive prizes as matter of grace and favor, and as reward for skill, it is not considered that the function embraces any gambling element, whatever other objectionable features, if any, are present; but, where the players make up by payment of money, or other thing of value, a purse which affords the prizes, as in the ordinary raffle, the game is a gambling game, whether skill enters into the result or not. All highly civilized peoples recognize the evils to society arising from the encouragement of the gambling spirit, and it is for the purpose of discouraging this vice and preventing the spread of it, that laws are passed in other states like the Ohio statutes to punish and prohibit. Such laws are and should be interpreted and enforced by our courts in a way calculated to secure the object sought. A familiar case is that of <em>Hooker </em>v. DePalos, 28 Ohio St., 251, condemning and holding unlawful a scheme known as a \u201cgift <em>enterprise.\u201d </em>This is an instructive case, and the vice which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>condemned by the court is the same which inheres in the scheme present in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">2. Is the plaintiff entitled to relief in a court of equity?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">He seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of the equity court and asks an injunction and a receiver, on the ground that he stands in a representative capacity, having the right to represent and appear for all the other persons who have delivered money to the defendant under the same terms and conditions under which plaintiff delivered his .fifty cents; that such persons are numerous; that each and all having a general interest in and common right to the money or fund thereby accumulated, the fund equitably belongs to all who have made guesses and paid money to the defendant, and hence plaintiff has the right to maintain a suit in equity for the benefit of all. Is his position tenable? This contest we have found to be an illegal enterprise. It is apparent that the inducement to the guessers was not to subscribe for a newspaper, but to get a prize. They, therefore, are each and every one of them <em>particeps crvmmis </em>in an illegal transaction. The general rule applicable to such a situation is that the law will aid neither party to enforce the contract while executory, nor, where executed, will it aid either party to place himself in <em>statu quo </em>by a rescission, but will, in both cases, leave the parties where it finds them. This well-established rule has been varied by changes in our statute, as we have seen, which allows money won by gaming or betting to be. recovered at law by the loser. But these are exceptions, and are to he confined to the particular cases, and relief to be obtained by the particular methods indicated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>statute. While this is true it is also true, independent of the statute, that, so long as the illegal acts remain wholly unexecuted, the party parting with his money may repent, abandon his contract, and recover back the money paid, the law\u2019s aim being to prevent wrongdoing by encouraging such repentance and abandonment. <em>Roll </em>v. <em>Raguet, </em>4 Ohio, 400; <em>Cowles </em>v. <em>Raguet, </em>14 Ohio, 38; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Cronise, 16 </em>Ohio, 54; <em>Hooker </em>v. <em>DePalos, supra; Cooper </em>v. <em>Rowley, </em>29 Ohio St., 547; <em>Kahn </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>46 Ohio St., 195. The plaintiff claims to have thus repented. Well and good so far as it goes. But how about the other guessers? Have they repented? Did they, when this suit was commenced, want their alleged contract rescinded? The petition shows that they were very numerous; that their names are unknown to the plaintiff, and it is impracticable to bring them before the court. This is a conclusive showing, it appears to us, that he is wholly without information respecting a condition essential to the maintenance of a joint suit in equity. Indeed the presumptions are against the plaintiff\u2019s claim. These people had paid a small amount of money for a chance to receive a much larger amount, and they would ,be presumed to remain of the same mind until the contrary is shown. The case is wholly dissimilar, in its presumptions, from one to which it is sought to be likened, viz.: where a property owner seeks to avoid payment of an alleged illegal assessment. In such case it might naturally be presumed that the property owners would all be of the same mind in an endeavor to avoid an injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The rule is uniform that, in order to maintain a suit by one for the benefit of himself and others, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>must be community of interest as well as a right of recovery by reason of the same essential facts. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Treas., </em>10 Ohio, 235; <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>same volume, 456; <em>Trustees </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>51 Ohio St., 285, 295; <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>same volume, 433. These elements are lacking in the case made by the plaintiff\u2019s petition. In passing, also, we should take note of the fact that there would have followed as a necessity from the sustaining of plaintiff\u2019s contention, the ascertainment by the court through its receivers of the names and addresses of the four hundred thousand contributors, and the distribution to each of his half-dollar, reduced by his proportion of the probable fees, allowances and costs, and when this is considered it must be apparent that the magnitude and difficulties of the task would be immeasurably greater than any good which the painful working out of the remedy would bring about.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The superior court properly sustained the demurrer to the petition as an appeal to the equity side of the court, and, having no jurisdiction of the law case respecting the amount, it properly dismissed the case. Its judgment is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-7\">Davis, C. J., Shauck, Price, Crew and Summers, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
