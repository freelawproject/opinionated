The court could not order, without qualification, the payment of any part of the legacy to plaintiff in error\u2019s creditor. The administrator was only an agent of the law to \u00e1dminister the estate in accordance therewith, under the control of the probate court, and to pay to the legatee, if there was anything left after paying the debts and the general legacy under the will. The debts and general legacy to Lucy Orlopp of $2,000 may consume the estate and leave no residue for the plaintiff in error. Besides the residuary legacy did not become due or payable until the estate was settled and an order of distribution made by the probate court. This was necessary to determine whether there was anything to be paid plaintiff in error as residuary legatee under the will of Odo Orlopp, deceased.

The probate court had acquired possession of the money and property, sought to be attached in this proceeding, under the provisions for administering the estate of deceased persons, and had jurisdiction over the garnishee and his administration of said property. To allow the property to be taken by the common pleas court in attachment would take away the jurisdiction of the probate court to settle the estate. This the court will not permit. <em>Byers: </em>v. <em>McAuley </em>and <em>McAuley </em>v. <em>McAuley, </em>149 U.

R., 455.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-7\">These decisions were based on a construction of section 5531. The circuit courts in construing section 5531 held that executors and administrators were included under the term \u201cother officer\u201d in this section. We contend that it was not the object of the legislature to include executors and administrators in the words \u201cother officer\u201d in this section, and it cannot be so construed. Executors and administrators must be expressly named in the statute before they can be garnished, and the statute cannot be made to apply to them in proceedings of attachment and garnishment by implication. 4 Cyc., 409 (e-1); 14 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng.

I., 116.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-8\">As executors and administrators are not within the ordinary meaning of the words \u201cor other officer,\u201d we must therefore determine whether the legislature intended to include them within these words, as used in section 5531, by the established rule of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-9\">Proceeding in attachment is a summary and extraordinary remedy in derogation of the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>law and owes its existence entirely to statutory enactment. 4 Cyc., 396 (ll-a-4).</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-5\">The statutory remedy of attachment being in derogation of the common law must be construed strictly in favor of those against whom the proceeding is employed and must be closely confined within the limits assigned by the legislature and cannot be extended by implication beyond the terms. of the statute creating it. <em>Felix </em>v. <em>Griffiths, </em>56 Ohio St., 39; <em>Hoyman </em>v. <em>Beaverstock et at., </em>4 Circ.

These sections of the act of May 14, 1878, were carried into the Revised Statutes oOhio of 1880, and enacted into sections 5530, 5531, 5532, 5533. Section 11 of the act of May 14, 1878, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>marginal heading is, \u201cEffect of service of garnishment upon public officers. \u2019 \u2019 The.title to section 5531 of the Revised Statutes is, \u201cEffect of service of process of garnishment upon public officers.\u201d It therefore would seem that the construction placed upon this section by the legislature and the annotators of our Revised Statutes, was that it applies to public officers only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-5\">The term \u201cother officer,\u201d as used in section 5531 should be construed in reference to the rule \u201c <em>ejusdem generis.\u201d </em>That is the meaning of the words \u201cother officer\u201d must be limited and determined from, the specific words of a like nature which they follow, and are presumed to embrace only such officers as are like or similar to those designated by the specific words.

By section 5223 he has the same powers as the court to summons and enforce the attendance. of witnesses and grant adjournments.

This is undoubtedly true. We .do not seek to obtain any greater rights in the funds in the hands of said administrator than has the said Oscar Orlopp, but only seek to hold <em>intact </em>pending the determination of the merits alleged in the petition the <em>interest </em>that the said Oscar Orlopp has in said fund. Of course, if Oscar Orlopp is not entitled to any of the funds in the hands of Haldy, administrator, then surely we cannot obtain anything from this fund; but if Oscar Orlopp has an <em>interest </em>in said fund such <em>interest </em>may be attached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-6\">Suppose A. was indebted to B. upon a promissory note due January 1, 1906.

The administrator can safely file his final account and close up the estate so far as the probate court is concerned whenever he pleases, and if the estate is indebted to Oscar Orlopp we are entitled to have it paid to defendant in error, provided, of course, that we can establish upon the trial of the case in the common pleas court that the facts set out in the petition are true.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-8\">By this proceeding the administrator simply holds the. money that would be payable to Oscar Orlopp until the determination in the court of common pleas, as to who is entitled to the same.

So that we insist that the only court that could possibly give us relief or a remedy for the protection of our rights is the court of common pleas. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-6\">It is true that before the enactment of statutes and in some states by express statutes an administrator could not and cannot now be garnisheed, but the law in Ohio is different.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-7\">Your honors will observe that sections 5530 and 5531 are intended to reach money, property, or <em>any interest </em>in any fund that the defendant may be entitled to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>An administrator is an officer of the court and comes within the provisions of section 5531.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-5\">Does the plaintiff in error or his counsel claim that he has not an interest (whether present or contingent) in the property sought to be attached? Surely not, because <em>if he had no interest </em>he would not be here contesting our right to subject it to the payment of our claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-6\">Section 5538 discloses that the common law rule is abrogated in Ohio, because it recites in substance that when once a person or officer is garnisheed all property in his hands is bound from the time of the \u2022 service of process.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-7\">All of the law cited by our opponents applies to cases governed either by common law or by statutes wholly dissimilar to the statutes of Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-8\">In our state the identical question raised in the case at bar was raised in the case of <em>Sampsell </em>v. <em>Sampsell, </em>9 Circ. Dec., 510; 17 C. C. R., 455. In Indiana the identical question has also been decided. <em>Stratton et al. </em>v. <em>Ham et al., </em>8 Ind., 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-9\">The answer of the garnishee in the case at bar is exactly like the one made in the Sampsell case. In fact, the case at bar and that in 9 Circ. Dec., 510 (17 C. C. R., 455), are so similar that a substitution of our parties for those in that case is all that is necessary. to make them alike.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b97-10\">Crew, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aj9\">In the present case the precise question presented by the record may be stated thus: Can an administrator with the will annexed, before an order of distribution is made of the estate he represents, be charged as garnishee in respect to property er funds in his hands that may ultimately belong to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>one named in said -will as residuary legatee? The clear weight of authority undoubtedly is that executors and administrators cannot be thus charged. Such has been the almost uniform holding of the courts of last resort except in those jurisdictions where the rule has been changed by express statutory enactment. And this rule has thus been generally so held and applied by the courts, whether it was sought to charge the executor or administrator on account of a <em>debt </em>owing from the estate to the defendant in the attachment suit, or on account of the latter\u2019s being entitled to a distributive share of the estate as heir or legatee. 14 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law, 829. Indeed, so far as our examination of the authorities has enabled us to discover, the only state in which the garnishment of an executor or administrator is allowed before final settlement or order of distribution, in the absence of express statutory authority therefor, is the state of Indiana. It was held by the supreme court of that state in 1856, in the case of <em>Stratton </em>v. <em>Ham, 8 </em>Ind., 84, that the unascertained distributive shares of a decedent\u2019s estate in the hands of the executor, are effects liable to the process of garnishment. This case has been much criticised and its doctrine almost universally repudiated in other jurisdictions. It was said of it by Lyon, J., in <em>Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Miracle, Exr., etc., </em>54 Wis., 299: \u201cThis is an exceptional case, and in a learned and elaborate note appended to it numerous cases are cited and the unsoundness of the decision demonstrated on principle and by authority. \u2019 \u2019' It would seem to us but reasonable, therefore, that a rule so universally recognized by text writers and so firmly established by judicial decisions as is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>rule, that an executor or administrator holding in his representative capacity cannot in the absence of express statutory authorization, in advance of an order of distribution, be held or charged as garnishee in respect to property or funds in his hands belonging to an heir or legatee, should not now, in the absence of statutory requirement, or other cogent and compelling reason, be disregarded or disturbed by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">That the general rul\u00e9 of law is- as above stated, counsel for defendant in error admit. But they contend that in Ohio the right is given by statute to so charge an executor or administrator, and that the existence of such right is shown and recognized by section 5531, Eevised Statutes, which section is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u2018 \u2018 Section 5531. The service of process of garnishment upon the sheriff, coroner, clerk, constable, master commissioner, marshal of a municipal corporation, or other officer having in his possession any money, claim or other property of the defendant, or in which the defendant has an interest, shall bind the same from the time of such service, and shall be a legal excuse to such officers, to the extent of the demand of the plaintiff, for not paying such money or delivering such claim or property to the defendant, as by law or the terms of the process in his&gt; hands he would otherwise be bound to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The circuit court in its opinion in the present case says: \u201cWere it not for the section above referred to (section 5531) we are not prepared to say that a legacy could be attached especially if the amount was unascertained.\u201d But they say: \u201cWe are of .the opinion that under section 5531 an undetermined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>legacy either in the hands of an administrator or 'executor may he garnisheed; that administrators and executors are included under the designation of <em>other officer </em>in the above section.\u201d Upon this interpretation of this statute the circuit court predicated its judgment. It will be observed that this statute does not mention executors and administrators nor does it in terms provide or prescribe who may be served with garnishee process, it undertakes only as stated in its title, to define the effect of service of the process of garnishment upon public officers. Therefore to give to this section the construction and interpretation placed upon it by the circuit court is, we think, to thereby unduly extend its scope and give to it a potential effect neither warranted by its purpose and provisions nor intended by the legislature. Whether executors and administrators can in any proper sense be regarded as officers may well be doubted. Obviously they are not <em>public officers </em>as. are all those who are specifically named in section 5531, and the obligations and duties devolving upon them in their representative capacity are wholly dissimilar and unlike the duties to be performed by the officers so named and designated. But if it be conceded that executors and administrators fall within the designation \u201cother officer\u201d as found in said statute, it by no means follows that in an action against, the heir or legatee, the executor or administrator may, in advance of an order of distribution and while the estate remains unsettled, be held and charged as garnishee in respect to property in his hands unadministered. So long as the estate remains unsettled, or at least until order of distribution is made, the property'held by an executor or adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>trator as such, is in the custody of the law and does not vest in, or become the property of the heir or legatee. Until such time the executor or administrator is not the <em>debtor </em>of the heir or legatee, nor is it-certain that he is the custodian of any property belonging to him. In the due course of administration the debts, costs of administering the trust, and specific legacies, are to be first paid and until final settlement or order of distribution, there is not such certainty of fact that the executor or administrator holds or has \u201cin his possession any money claim or property belonging to the heir or legatee, or in which he has an interest\u201d as would warrant or justify holding the executor or administrator liable as garnishee even under an answer by him showing that there would probably be something due the heir or legatee upon the final settlement of the estate. The heir or legatee has no present right to, or interest in, the property and whether there will be any' amount due him on final settlement and order of distribution is matter of contingency.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">When we consider, then, that to give section 5531 the force and effect claimed for it by counsel for defendant in error and allowed to it by the circuit-court, is to abrogate a well and firmly established rule of law, presumably known to the legislature at the time of the enactment of said section, we think we may well conclude that if the legislature had intended thereby to provide for and authorize the attachment of, and to allow garnishee process to issue against, executors and administrators, it would have named them in the statute and would not have left its purpose, and intention in that behalf to implication, or to be discovered only through the medium of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>judicial interpretation. The fact that the legislature did not specifically name executors and administrators in section 5531 or in apt language designate or describe them, clearly shows, we think, an absence of intention on its part to include them in its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\n<em>The judgment of the circuit court is reversed and garnishee disclvarged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b102-6\">Davis, C.
