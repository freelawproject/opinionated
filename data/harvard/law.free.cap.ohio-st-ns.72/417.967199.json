D. Re., 2; <em>Crumpaker </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>4 West, 655.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-6\">Section 2732, Revised Statutes, amongst other things, provides that all moneys and credits <em>appropriated solely to sustain and belonging exclusively to such institutions shall be exempt.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-7\">Applying the rule that exemptions should be confined to the clear and strict terms of the law, we find that the first part of this section exempts all buildings together with the land actually occupied by such institutions not leased or otherwise used with a view to profit shall be exempt. Two conditions exist under the statute when such buildings become liable for taxation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-8\">First: When leased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-9\">Second: When otherwise used for profit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-10\">The words, \u201cWith a view to profit,\u201d are omitted in the latter part of this section for the obvious reason that if appropriated solely to sustain the institution and belonging exclusively to said institutions and military organizations, they could use it in no other way and for no other purpose. If the legislature had intended .to exempt moneys and credits,, the income of which is used solely to sustain such: institutions, they would have said so. The legislature evidently had. in mind only the moneys and credits actually appropriated for such purpose, and nothing more. That the legislature did not intend to exempt either real or personal property used with a view to profit is very clear. Applying the rule of strict construction to this statute, it is evident that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>310 exemption exists unless three things are made to appear:</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-5\">First: There must be an actual appropriation of the fund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-6\">Second: That appropriation must be for a specific purpose, namely, to sustain the institution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-7\">Third: The money and credits must belong ex-' clusively to said institution. ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-8\">The fact as alleged in the petition that the <em>income </em>is used solely to pay its professors, and the expenses incidental to the institution, will make no difference. To be exempt the <em>fund itself </em>must be so used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-9\">Government cannot discriminate between the uses which individuals and institutions will make of the proceeds of their business, and determine that this society or individual make a more worthy distribution of the proceeds of his or its business than the other. The legislature could not without a flagrant violation of the principles of equity make such a distinction. <em>Cincinnati College </em>v. <em>State, </em>19 Ohio, 110; <em>Gerke </em>v. <em>Purcell, </em>25 Ohio St., 229; <em>Association v.

The endowment fund of such institution, which is loaned, and the interest used solely for the salaries of the professors and expenses necessarily incident to such educational' work, is a \u201ccredit\u201d within the meaning of section 2732, Revised Statutes, and is exempt from taxation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-5\">Two questions arise:</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-6\">First: Is the plaintiff, under its allegations of fact, as to its objects and purposes, really an \u201cinstitution of purely public charity,\u201d within the meaning of section 2, article 12 of the constitution of Ohio ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-7\">This is conceded by counsel; but that concession not being conclusive of the law, we are cited to authorities which seem to settle the matter beyond controversy. <em>Gerke </em>v. <em>Purcell, </em>25 Ohio St., 229.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-8\">To the same effect are the holdings in <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>Akins, </em>4 Circ.

Dec., 436).</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-9\">Second: Is this fund, the principal of which is not touched, hut is loaned, and the interest only used for the purposes of the institution, exempt from taxation?</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-10\">Upon this question issue is taken. Defendant claims that while the fund itself, if reduced to money and kept in the treasury for use as needed, would not be taxable, the moment it is placed at interest and becomes a source of profit, it is analogous to the leasing of real estate for business purposes, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>following the doctrine of <em>Cincinnati College </em>v. <em>State, </em>19 Ohio, 110, it becomes taxable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-5\">Inasmuch as the rental of real estate only was involved, the case (19 Ohio, 110) was necessarily decided upon a construction of section 3, subdivision 3 of the act then in force on the subject (44 O. L., 86).</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-6\">The learned judge who rendered the opinion, not satisfied with the undoubtedly correct conclusion to which the court had arrived as to subdivision 3 of the act in question, ventured to go beyond the single question then before that tribunal, and gave his individual views of what would be the construction of subdivision 4 of the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-7\">But this construction of subdivision 4 is a mere <em>dictum, </em>and wholly <em>obiter, </em>as is expressly conceded by the judge, since he had previously stated that subdivision 3 was \u201cthe only one that we think could be supposed to have any bearing on this case. \u201d We, therefore, are not bound by it as an expression of the law by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-8\">Such a fund when loaned cannot better be defined than to call it a \u201ccredit,\u201d and such we believe was the purpose of the legislature in so using it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-9\">We also think it would be contrary to the policy of the state to hold otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-10\">The ordinance of 1787, announces as the policy of the northwest territory, that, \u201cReligion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-11\">The constitution of 1802 reasserts this policy, and emphasizes it by introducing the word \u201cessentially\u201d before \u201cnecessary,\u201d making it read, in section 3, article 8, \u201cReligion, morality and knowledge being essentially necessary to good government.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>And the constitution of 1851, section 7, article 1, in similar, hut somewhat less felicitious language, makes the same announcement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-5\">The consequence has been that a large number of educational institutions have been founded and liberally endowed, upon the faith of this wise state policy, and up to the present case, no attempt has been made, so far as the court is aware, to place the burdens of taxation upon them, except as to real estate diverted from educational use.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-6\">Institutions of purely public charity may by general laws be exempt from taxation. 3 Rev.

Counsel for the treasurer challenge that interpretation of the section as well as its constitutional validity. The section describes the property which is exempt from taxation and the present discussion involves the sixth subdivision of the section which is:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u201cAll buildings belonging to institution[s] of purely public charity, and all buildings belonging to and used exclusively for armory purposes by lawfully organized military organizations which are and shall continue to be fully armed and equipped at their own expense and by law made subject to all calls of the governor for troops in case of war, riot, insurrection or invasion together with the road [land] actually occupied by such institutions, and that owned and used as sites for such armory buildings of said military organizations not leased or otherwise used with a view to profit, and all moneys and credits appropriated solely to sustain and belonging exclusively to said institutions and military organizations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The constitutional authority for the exemption is found in section 2 of article 12 of the constitution which prescribes the general rule of uniformity of taxation as well as the subjects of taxation which may be omitted from its operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">It provides \u201cLaws shall be passed taxing by a uniform rule all moneys, credits, * * <em>*; </em>but * # # institutions of purely public charity # * * may, by general laws, be exempted from <em>taxation; </em>and all such laws shall be subject to alteration' or repeal * # *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">While the section employs mandatory terms in prescribing the general rule of uniformity of taxa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>tion, it does not by force of its own terms provide any exceptions to that rule, but merely authorizes the general assembly to provide by general laws for the exemption of property of the. designated character. It is settled in <em>Gerke et al. </em>v. <em>Purcell, </em>25 Ohio St., 229, and in cases following it, that an institution, such as the petition alleges the seminary to be, is \u201can institution of purely public charity\u201d within the meaning of this section of the constitution. Since the particular authority conferred upon the general assembly is to exempt such institutions without limit or qualification, and since within the contemplation of taxing provisions the institution must consist wholly of its property, there appears to be no ground whatever for the constitutional point, raised by counsel for the treasurer. It must, however, be admitted that the meaning of the statute is not so clear as is that of the constitutional provision. The general assembly is not required to exercise all the power of exemption which is conferred, and some doubt has been raised respecting the extent to which it has seen fit to exercise it. It is said that in the court of common pleas the demurrer in the present case was sustained upon the supposed authority of the <em>Cincinnati College </em>v. <em>The State, </em>19 Ohio, 110, where it was decided that where the assets of a similar institution are in lands which are leased, the lands are taxable although the rents are devoted wholly to the maintenance of the institution in the same manner as is the interest derived from the loaning of an endowment fund. The inability of the judge of the court of common pleas to find a philosophical reason why the land should be subject to taxation in one case and the fund exempt in the other starts sympathy. The consideration suggested may have influenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>this court to decide in <em>Davis, Auditor, </em>v. <em>The Cincinnati Camp Meeting Association, </em>57 Ohio St., 257, that \u201cWhere an association, organized and conducted for the purpose of a purely public, charity, as a camp meeting, under the supervision and control of some church, owns real estate devoted exclusively to the same use; and thereon provides privileges for the comfort and convenience of those who may attend the meeting, the fact that it makes charges for the use of these privileges, does not subject its property, nor the privileges so provided, to taxation under the laws of this state.\u201d No attention was there given to the change in the language of the statute since the decision of the <em>College </em>v. <em>The </em>State. But that change was considered in the <em>Cleveland Library Association </em>v. <em>Pelton, Treasurer, </em>36 Ohio St., 253, where it was held that the rented portion of the land of an institution- of that character is not within the exemption, although the rents are used for the purposes of maintenance. In all the cases cited conclusive effect was intended to be given to the terms of the statute without consideration of the reasons for its discriminations. The observation that the reason of the law is its life, so frequently helpful in the determination of questions' arising at common law, must have a restricted application to the interpretation of statutes. In the discharge of the duty of interpretation it is not required or permitted to courts to go beyond the plain meaning of the language which the legislature has used to express its intention. Assuming the correctness of the decisions cited with respect to the taxability of land belonging to such institutions and leased for income to be devoted to their maintenance, it is entirely clear that the legislature has deliberately prescribed a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>rule with respect to an endowment'to be loaned for an income to be devoted to that purpose. There can be no conceivable condition of such a fund in which it is not either \u201cmoney\u201d or \u201ccredits\u201d appropriated solely to sustain, and belonging exclusively to, such institution, and by the unambiguous terms of the statute it is exempt from taxation. When counsel for the treasurer ask us to follow the judge of the court of common pleas to the consideration of the sufficiency of the supposed reasons for the discrimination they invite us to an inquiry which is not open to us. The judgment of the circuit court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b471-6\">Davis, C.
