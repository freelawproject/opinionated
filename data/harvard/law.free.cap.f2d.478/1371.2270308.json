We reverse. We state the facts appearing in Coleman\u2019s selective service file to the extent that they are pertinent to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-18\">In Coleman\u2019s classification questionnaire, which he filed with the Board on January 10, 1968, he answered question 2, in Series XI, which asked whether he had any physical condition which in his opinion would disqualify him, by stating: \u201cMigraine headaches.\u201d He also sent the Board a doctor\u2019s letter to that effect which the Board received on January 10. On April 3 the Board directed him to report to the Board\u2019s medical adviser for an interview, which he did on April 11, 1968. The report of the Board\u2019s medical adviser was: \u201cNeurological disorder Sec XV 2-31(2). Has frequent recurrences incapacitating for work.\u201d The Board did not reclassify him on the basis of this information. We infer that it forwarded the file to the State Director of Selective Service, because, on April 24 the State Director wrote to the Board and instructed it to \u201cForward registrant for preinduction physical examination when reached for that purpose with his age group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-19\">On October 10, 1968 the Board classified Coleman I-A. On November 6, 1968, Coleman appealed on the ground that he was improperly classified because of his migraine headaches. So far as appears, nothing was ever done with this appeal. For all we know, it remains pending and undecided to this day. Be that as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>may, the Board, on February 19, 1969, wrote to Coleman stating that the facts recited in the letter in which he appealed did not warrant reopening.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">On May 21, 1969 Coleman was ordered to report for a physical examination, which he did on June 27. The examining doctor found \u201cPhysically disqualified \u2014 severe migraine headaches. Reexamination believed to be justified within one year.\u201d On July 8, 1969, the Board classified Coleman I-Y. On May 20, 1970 Coleman was ordered to report for another physical examination on June 22, 1970, which he did. Thereafter the Board sent Coleman a statement of acceptability which recited that he had been found fit but also stated: \u201cRegistrant advised to present medical evidence to support unverified ailment.\u201d Coleman did so, but nothing happened. On July 21, 1970, the Board reclassified Coleman I-A. Coleman did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-8\">On September 22, the Board ordered him to report for induction on October 21. Coleman reported. A notation in his file states: \u201c10-21-70 Pending Medical for INDUCTION.\u201d On November 16, the Board ordered him to report again to AFEES on November 30, with the statement: \u201cIf you are found acceptable you will be INDUCTED, so please go prepared.\u201d On November 30 Coleman was examined by an AFEES neurologist. The neurologist\u2019s conclusions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1441-10\">PT. [patient] has approx, [approximately] once per mth. [month] severe headaches unrelieved by Cafergot orally. Also has muscle contraction headaches more frequently. PT. has <em>not </em>been tried on the various anti-migraine preps, [preparations] available. Neg. [negative] family hx. [history] of migraine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1441-11\">IMP. [impression] = Muscle Contraction Headaches (Tension) c [with] probable Migraine Variant Headaches as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1441-12\"><em>Recommend </em>= (1) Bellergol Space-tabs, \u00cdT [2 tabs] i\" [1 tab] in A.M. &amp; T [1 tab] in P.M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1441-13\">2. Pt. should be tried on various anti-migraine meds. [medications] if Bel-lergol is ineffective before pt. should be regarded as unfit for active duty. Meanwhile pt. is fit for [active] duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1441-14\">It is doubtful that the Board ever saw this report until after Coleman refused induction. Be that as it may, Coleman appeared on December 8, 1970 for induction. His file does not contain any order to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He refused to be inducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-15\">We recite the foregoing record in part because it shows that, from January 10, 1968 on, Coleman continuously asserted that he was disqualified because of migraine headaches. There is ample evidence in .the record that he did have such disqualifying headaches, including letters from two doctors who had had him under treatment for 8 or 10 years and from an employer who was forced to discharge him because of the problem, the finding of the Board\u2019s medical advisor, and the June 27, 1969 finding of the AFEES examiner. There is <em>no </em>contrary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-16\">We think that a fair construction of the AFEES neurologist\u2019s November 30, 1970 report is that he, too, found that Coleman had such headaches, but that he felt that the condition might be relieved by medication. We also conclude that his recommendation \u2014 that Coleman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>be considered fit unless the medication proved ineffective, is directly contrary to applicable regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">The regulations are these: First, Selective Service Regulation, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1628, which refers, for classification purposes, to the Surgeon General\u2019s list of physical disqualifications set forth in Army Regulations 40-501. Thus these are the concern of selective service boards as well as of the Army. <em>See </em>United States v. Baray, 9 Cir., 1971, 445 F.2d 949; United States v. Brown, 9 Cir., 1971, 438 F.2d 1115; Briggs v. United States, 9 Cir., 1968, 397 F.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">Second, Army Regulation 40-501 applies. A.R. 40-501, Ch. 2, See. XV, Neurological Disorders, 2-31b(2), lists as cause for rejection \u201cMigraine when frequent and incapacitating.\u201d The doctor\u2019s finding was that Coleman has \u201cprobable Migraine Variant headaches.\u201d However, it is apparent that he was not sure whether they are permanently \u201cincapacitating.\u201d That is why he recommended Bellergol, and, if that did not work, \u201cvarious antimigraine meds.\u201d It is apparent, however, that he was convinced that, unless the medication worked, Coleman\u2019s condition was disqualifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-6\">This brings into play another section of A.R. 40-501 (Ch. 1, Sec. II, l-3a) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1442-7\">\u201ca. <em>Medically Acceptable. </em>No individuals will be accepted on a provisional basis subject to the successful treatment or correction of a disqualifying defect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1442-9\">In spite of this regulation, and of the recommended trial of Bellergol and various other \u201cmeds.,\u201d Coleman was called tor induction just 8 days later. In the meantime, nothing had been done to ascertain whether the recommended treatment had been carried out at all, much less whether it had succeeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-12\">The attempt to induct Coleman was in direct violation of these regulations. To use a cliche, it stands the second A.R. that we have quoted on its head. The doctor\u2019s diagnosis brings Coleman within the regulation, but the doctor\u2019s recommendation that \u201cmeanwhile\u201d he \u201cis fit for active duty\u201d violates the regulation. His premise is good, but his conclusion is upside down.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-13\">Nor can it be said that the regulation is solely for the benefit of the Army. We have no doubt that it benefits the Army: it avoids inducting people who are disqualified unless treated, which would place on the Army the burden of a recruit who is of no use to it unless treated, the burden of treating him, and the risk that the treatment will .fail so that he will have to be discharged. The regulation also benefits the registrant. It avoids the unnecessary disruption of his life that would result if he were to be inducted and the treatment were to fail. It permits him to go about his normal affairs while treatment is being assayed. These are no small benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-15\"> Both the local board and the Army violated these regulations. Under the general principle that an agency is to be held to the terms of its regulations, Service v. Dulles, 1957, 354 U.S. 363, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1 L.Ed.2d 1403; Vitarelli v. Seaton, 1959, 359 U.S. 535, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012, the judgment cannot stand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1442-16\">Reversed. When the mandate goes down, the indictment will be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1441-17\">. It is difficult to imagine a more flagrant breach of selective service regulations. We do not rely on it, however, because the board did later reclassify Coleman to I-Y.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1441-22\">. In this appeal, Coleman makes no point of the lack of such an order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1442-10\">. It is no answer to say that Coleman did not appeal his July 21, 1970 classification of I-A. The operative facts \u2014 the November 30, 1970 examination, came later, and changed the situation. Nor is it an answer that Coleman simply refused induction without expressly relying on his physical disqualification. He was disqualified as a matter of law. He cannot be prosecuted for refusing an induction that the ' system had no right to order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
