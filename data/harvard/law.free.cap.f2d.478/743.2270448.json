There are several substantial and close issues which we need not reach because the entire ease rests upon an invalid warrant-less governmental search of a parcel while in the United States mails. The conviction must, therefore, be reversed and the prosecution dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">On the basis of undisclosed information the postmaster of Ozark, Alabama, was alerted to watch for incoming parcels addressed to James F. Phillips. A sealed parcel arrived addressed to Phillips at an Ozark street address. It bore a stamped notation \u201cair mail special delivery\u201d and postage in the amount of $1.25 but no notation as to the class of mailing. It weighed 11% ounces. Postal authorities were of the opinion that the parcel was fourth class matter, which, while in the possession of postal authorities, may be opened for postal inspection without the necessity of a warrant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Santana v. United States, 329 F.2d 854, 856 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 990, 84 S.Ct. 1915, 12 L.Ed.2d 1044 (1964).

Subsequently, after some of its contents were removed, the parcel was rewrapped and delivered to Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>While fourth class matter is subject to opening for postal inspection, the fourth amendment protects first class mail from warrantless opening for postal inspection, and that constitutional limitation has been carried forward into a statute.

The fee for special delivery service was 45 cents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Postal officials explained that they deducted this amount from the postage of $1.25, leaving 80 cents, which is the minimum fee for any air parcel post package, irrespective of class, weighing less than one pound. 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4303(d)(1) (App.1972). A postal inspector was permitted to testify as an expert, over objection, that in his opinion, based upon his experience and postal laws and regulations, the parcel was fourth class.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The great, and unexplained, leap in logic by the government and its witnesses is the implicit assumption that a sealed package sent air parcel post is neither first class matter nor entitled to the same privacy as first class matter, and instead, as an affirmative proposition, is fourth class matter. We say \u201cas an affirmative proposition,\u201d because under familiar principles the burden was upon the government to establish that it had the right to make a warrantless search.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">Under 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4251(a) (App. 1972) first class mail consists of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-13\">[Mjailable (1) postal cards, (2) post cards, (3) matter wholly or partially in writing or typewriting [with certain exceptions], (4) bills and statements of account, and (5) matter closed against postal inspection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-14\">Fourth class mail consists of mailable matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-15\">(1) not mailed or required to be mailed as first class mail;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-16\">(2) within the size and weight limits prescribed for fourth class mail;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-17\">(3) not entered as second class mail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-18\">39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4551(a) (1962). Second and third class classifications have no arguable relationship to this parcel or this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-19\">In 1967 Congress amended the postal laws so as to eliminate the preexisting service for heavier [i. e., in excess of eight ounces] \u201cair mail of the first class,\u201d see 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4303(d)(2) (1962), repealed by Pub.Law 90-206, Title I, \u00a7 102(b)(2), 81 Stat. 614 (Dec. 16, 1967), and so as to establish a new and lower rate for some first class mail items.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It did so by blending into one enactment the preexisting concept of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>\u201cair parcel post\u201d and the eliminated service for \u201cair mail of the first class\u201d and by providing in 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4253(b) (App.1972) that \u201c[f]irst class mail weighing more than thirteen ounces shall be mailed at the rates of postage established by section 4303(d) of this title [the rates for air parcel post] and shall be entitled to the most expeditious handling and transportation practicable.\u201d The pertinent legislative history of the 1967 amendments reveals the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">\n<em>Air parcels</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">The rate on air parcels, now mailed at a zone rate, is revised. Beginning with the effective date of the postal provisions of this legislation, airmail weighing more than 7 ounces and first-class mail weighing more than 13 ounces will be combined as <em>one class of mail </em>and will be delivered by the most expeditious means of transportation available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax7\">This is a significant departure from the present method of determining <em>class of mail </em>and postage rates for heavier parcels. Because of the significantly high cost coverage of heavy first-class and airmail parcels, the Post Office Department has recommended and the committee and the House of Representatives have approved a new rate schedule combining these two kinds of heavy mail at a zone rate schedule which is generally lower than present rates for air parcel post or first-class mail. A particular benefit to the public will be the 80-cent nationwide airmail rate for any parcel weighing 1 pound.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 90th Cong. 1st Sess.1967, p. 2258 at 2262 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">Prior to these 1967 amendments the separate concepts of \u201cair parcel post\u201d and of classes of mail had proceeded along lines of development that were uncorrelated, and at times contradictory.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not find in the pre-1967 statutory development of the air parcel post concept any guidance on the question of whether the search of the instant parcel violated the fourth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-15\"> We conclude that this sealed air parcel sent under the new \u201cone class of mail\u201d could not be opened without a warrant. We reach that conclusion as a matter of law by examining the 1967 amendments in the light of the fourth amendment and of the pre-1967 implementation of that amendment by Congress in the field of postal matter. The beginning point is the Constitution itself and the rights of privacy protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>by the fourth amendment. The constitutional guaranty is implemented at least in part by the statutory scheme for classification of mail into \u2014 insofar as here applicable \u2014 first and fourth class matter; the statute forbidding the war-rantless opening of a first class item;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the supporting regulations that prescribe how first class matter shall be wrapped and marked and how fourth class matter shall be wrapped. 39 C.F. R. \u00a7\u00a7 131.2(3) and 135.7 (1972). Ambiguities may arise, such as the sender\u2019s sealing a parcel, which should require it to go as first class matter, 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4251(a)(5) (App.1972), but paying only fourth class postage, or, hypothetically, paying only fourth class postage but writing on the parcel \u201cDo not open for postal inspection.\u201d Such ambiguities cast doubt on the proper classification of the item and on the intent of the sender as well. But, indisputably, the privacy of a sealed item bearing the proper amount of postage for a first class item is protected from warrantless opening, not because it is given the appellation \u201cfirst class\u201d but because the Constitution commands that result. Nothing in the legislative history of the new \u201cone class of mail\u201d suggests that an item possessing the characteristics that had entitled it to the privacy protected by the fourth amendment (and thus formerly to first class status) was intended to have a lesser scope of privacy by being rechar-acterized as within the new \u201cone class\u201d and sent at a new rate lower than the first class rate. Indeed, for items sealed against postal inspection, Congress probably could not constrict the scope of privacy without abrogating the fourth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">An argument can be made that any parcel sent in the new class, sealed or unsealed,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is entitled to be treated as though first class mail and exempted from warrantless opening.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But we leave determination of that question to some other case in which the issue is squarely raised and adequately presented.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">We have reached the conclusion that, as a matter of law, this sealed air parcel should not have been opened without a warrant. There are alternative grounds commanding the same result. First, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>burden of proof was upon the government to establish its right to make a warrantless search of a private parcel. The government has not discharged that burden but has merely assumed that the matter was settled by the opinion of one of its employees that the parcel was fourth class. Second, even if it is assumed <em>arguendo </em>that an air parcel sent with correct postage under the new rates can have a classification other than first class matter, and need not enjoy the privacy extended to first class matter, the only other status into which this particular parcel could arguably fall would be fourth class. But the statutes concerning classes of mail and the empirical facts make clear that this parcel was not fourth class. It was sealed, and as already pointed out, it was below the minimum weight for fourth class. While it did not bear first class postage but instead carried the postage of the new rates for the \u201cone class of mail,\u201d the amount of postage exceeded that for fourth class parcel post. 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4556 (App.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The case is reversed with directions to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-9\">. Tlie search took place on February 19, 1971, after enactment of the Postal Reorganization Act, Pub. Law 91-375, 84 Stat. 719, on August 12, 1970. The validity of that search, however, is controlled by the requirements of the Constitution and by the statutory provisions, and supporting agency regulations, of Title 39, United States Code, which pre-existed the Postal Reorganization Act. See 39 U.S.C.A. (App.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"AIu\">The Reorganization Act did not become effective in its entirety until July 1, 1971. During the interim from the date of enactment to the date of commencement of operations of the new Postal Service (July 1, 1971), the Post Office Department continued to operate under pre-existing statutory grants of authority supplemented by those grants contained in the Reorganization Act which became effective before the Postal Service commenced operations. Section 3 of Pub.Law 91-375, 84 Stat. 773, which became effective July 1, 1971, provided that: \u201cThe classes of mail, the rates of postage, and fees for postal service prescribed by law or regulation made or adopted prior to the effective date of subchapter II of chapter 36 of Title 39, United States Code, as enacted by section 2 of this Act, shall be in effect according to the terms of such law or regulation until changed in accordance with such subchapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AxJ\">The section of the Reorganization Act enacted as 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3623, see Pub.Law 91-375, 84 Stat. 761, which became effective January 20, 1971, is merely a directive authorizing the Postal Service to request the Postal Rate Commission appointed by the President under 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601, to make recommendations on classes of mail and rates. The government\u2019s supplemental brief states that the Commission did not submit recommendations until January 18, 1973, and that as of March 1, 1973, no new regulations had been promulgated incorporating these recommendations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-17\">. \u201cThe Postmaster General may prescribe the manner of wrapping and securing mail not charged with first class postage so that the contents of the mail may be easily examined.

It was error to permit this conclusory testimony on what was either a question of law or a mixed question of law and fact. Additionally the prosecution\u2019s presentation \u2014through conclusory expert testimony\u2014 of its claim to a right to make a search without warrant insulated the government from having to point out to the court the statutes, regulations and case law which would have brought to the surface the questions of law involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b814-21\">.

(1) Accepting that Congress did not, and probably could not, by creating the \u201cone class of mail,\u201d extend less privacy than formerly extended to first class mail exceeding 13 ounces, it would be anomalous to conclude that Congress intended a lower status for the other types of items \u2014 air mail parcels \u2014also included in the \u201cone class of mail.\u201d Both types of items pay the same rate and are handled in the same manner. And the legislative history, quoted above, is in terms of \u201cone class.\u201d (2) The classifications for mail established by other provisions of the United States Code are second and third class. They have no relevance here. Congress would not have intended to import fourth class standards into the \u201cone class of mail.\u201d The new class begins at \u201cin excess of 7 ounces.\u201d The minimum weight of a fourth class parcel is 16 ounces. 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4551 (1962) and 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4552(a)(2) (App. 1972). The standards of fourth class, previously restricted to only larger parcels, would hardly be extended by implication, and without any supporting evidence of intent, to smaller parcels as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b816-11\">. In a case remarkably similar to the one before us, a United States District Court and the Eighth Circuit have reached the conclusion that air parcel post <em>is </em>first class matter. Collins v. Wolff, 337 F.Supp. 114 (D.Neb.1972), aff\u2019d, 467 F.2d 359 (8th Cir. 1972). The linchpins of their decisions are first, that after 1967 air parcel post must carry the same postage as first class matter, and, second, that the rate of postage determines whether or not a parcel is first class. We do not adopt that reasoning, because, while the rate for air parcel post and first class items over 13 ounces is the same after 1967, it is not the first-class rate. As the congressional history pointed out, the new and lower rate for the \u201cone class of mail\u201d is lower than previous rates for air parcel post and first class mail (and, of course, lower than the increased rates for first class and air mail).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
