In answer to special interrogatories, the jury found the vessel seaworthy, the defendant free from negligence, and the plaintiff \u201c100% contribu-torily\u201d negligent. Plaintiff challenges the District Court\u2019s failure to grant a directed verdict and its instructions to the jury regarding the negligence and unseaworthiness. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-24\">Plaintiff, employed as a \u201cwiper\u201d in the engine room of defendant\u2019s vessel, alleged that, while the vessel was docked, he was struck by the door of an evapora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>tor he was cleaning. He alleged that the door swung shut unexpectedly as the vessel was rolled by a \u201csneak wave.\u201d No witnesses other than plaintiff testified about the accident, and he sought to sustain his burden of proof solely through his own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">From our examination of the evidence presented, we conclude that, weighing all the evidence, reasonable men could have reached different conclusions. Thus, the motion for a directed verdict was properly denied, and the questions of fact correctly left for the jury to decide. <em>See </em>Mayfield v. Chisholm-Moore Hoist Division, Columbus McKinnon Corp., 467 F.2d 483 (5th Cir. 1972); Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 411 F.2d 365 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Plaintiff argues that the District Court\u2019s charges on negligence and unseaworthiness were \u201cvague, insufficient, and inadequate.\u201d The standard for appellate review of jury instructions is clear: the charge must be viewed as a whole. If the charge in general correctly instructs the jury on the law, even though a portion is technically imperfect, no harmful error is committed. Bolden v. Kansas City So. Ry. Co., 468 F.2d 580 (5th Cir. 1972); Troutman v. Southern Ry. Co., 441 F.2d 586 (5th Cir. 1971); Webster v. Sea Drilling Corp., 411 F.2d 411 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-14\">Though presented in a somewhat colloquial fashion, the trial court\u2019s instructions on negligence contained all the essential elements of the standard charge. Plaintiff is particularly disturbed by the court\u2019s use of an automobile simile in discussing causation. The trial court, however, was careful to note the limits of the analogy and explained that the example was employed only for illustrative purposes. The structure and illustrations of a charge are within the trial court\u2019s discretion. The court need not use any particular form of words so long as \u201cthe charge as a whole conveys to the jury a clear and correct understanding of the applicable law.\u201d <em>See </em>2B W. Barron &amp; A. Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure, 471 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">Plaintiff premised his allegation of unseaworthiness on the fact that the evaporator door had no latch to secure it in an open position. He criticizes the charge as to unseaworthiness for its failure to mention the hazards vessels undergo at sea and in port, the observation that failure to secure a door amounted to negligence rather than unseaworthiness, and the omission of a proposed charge that seamen do not assume the risks of their employment. The District Court\u2019s instructions, however, appear to us to be pertinent to the issues and testimony presented. The uncontradicted evidence showed that the evaporator door was opened only when the ship was in port. The aspects of the charge challenged by plaintiff, if error, were harmless and therefore insufficient for reversal. F.R.Civ.P. 51. The jury was fairly instructed, and its verdict for the defendant decided the issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
