The primary issue<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> raised by appellant concerns the statutory requirement for a hearing whenever \u201csubstantial and material question [s] of fact\u201d are raised regarding the application. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(e) (1970). Contrary to the Commission\u2019s determination we find that there are substantial and material factual questions at issue rendering a hearing necessary prior to resolution of the application. We reverse the order of the Commission and remand for such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-19\">WGLN (FM) began operation on November 29, 1968, as a \u201ccountry and western\u201d music station licensed to Twin States Broadcasting, Inc. Twin States\u2019 application for construction and license stated that \u201calthough the applicant proposes to principally serve Sylvania [a small Ohio \u201cbedroom\u201d suburban community on the outskirts of Toledo],<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which has no other broadcast station licensed to serve it at the present time, the applicant believes that it also has the responsibility to serve the program needs of the remainder of its service area.\u201d Thus, although its primary service obligation was to its principal city of license, Sylvania, Twin States recognized a secondary responsibility to service the effective area of its signal, including other suburban communities and at minimum a significant portion of Toledo proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>Following renewal of its license in 1970,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in March of 1971 WGLN (FM) altered its programming to a commercialized format of \u201cgolden oldies.\u201d Finding neither format economically successful and suffering significant losses in its investment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on August 12, 1971, Twin States sought Commission consent to assignment of the license to Midwestern Broadcasting Corp. The proposed assignee, which also owned a highly successful \u201ctop forty\u201d music station licensed to Toledo, WOHO (AM), stated in the assignment application that it proposed to program \u201cgenerally middle of the road music which may include some contemporary, folk and jazz, similar to what [the] station is currently programming.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The assignee proposed to serve the city of license and other suburban communities in the greater Toledo metropolitan area.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">On August 31, 1971, while the application for assignment was still pending before the Commission, WGLN (FM) began experimentation with a \u201cprogressive rock\u201d music program for several hours late each evening. The unprecedented success of the program led to the eventual complete change of the format to \u201cprogressive rock\u201d on October 15, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">On February 23, 1972, the Commission without the benefit of a hearing found that the \u201cgrant of [the WGLN (FM) assignment] application will serve the public interest, convenience and necessity,\u201d and released an order granting the application. Shortly thereafter it became evident to the individuals who now make up the Citizens Committee that the \u201cprogressive rock\u201d format which they so dearly cherished was to be abandoned. The Committee was formed, petitions calling for the retention of the \u201cprogressive rock\u201d format circulated, and on March 27, 1971, a Petition for Stay, Reconsideration and Permanent Denial of Assignment Application was filed with the Commission. The Committee\u2019s main contention was that since the \u201cprogressive rock\u201d format of WGLN (FM) was unique to the Toledo area, and since a significant portion of the \u201cresidents of the metropolitan Toledo area\u201d (as evidenced by more than 11,000 petition signatures ultimately garnered and submitted) desired retention of the format, this court\u2019s decision in Citizens Committee v. FCC, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 109, 436 F.2d 263 (1970), mandated a hearing to examine the public interest implications of the proposal to convert the communities\u2019 only \u201cprogressive rock\u201d music station into one of several \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d stations. The Commission, for reasons we now deem unpersuasive, denied the Petition and affirmed its original order. Twin States Broadcasting, Inc., 35 F.C.C.2d 969 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">WGLN (FM) has since changed its call letters to WXEZ (FM), moved its studios to those of WOHO (AM) in Oregon, Ohio, and provides the same \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d format that is now offered to the Toledo environs by at least six other licensees.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">In <em>Citizens Committee </em>we held that the public has an interest in diversity of entertainment formats and therefore that format changes can be detri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>mental to the public interest. Consequently, in compliance with its statutory mandate to approve only those assignment applications which it finds to serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(a) (1970), the Commission must consider format changes and their effect upon the desired diversity.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">The majority of format changes do not diminish the diversity available, and are thus left to the give and take of each market environment and the business judgment of the licensee. See WCAB, Inc., 27 F.C.C.2d 743, 746 (1971), <em>and </em>Hartford Communications Committee v. FCC, 151 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 467 F.2d 408 (1972).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Citizens Committee </em>dealt with the specialized situation where the format to be discontinued, \u201cclassical music,\u201d was apparently unique to the area while the proposed format, \u201cmiddle of the road,\u201d was not. A \u201cnot insignificant portion\u201d (sixteen per cent) of the area\u2019s residents desired retention of the unique format, and we stated, 436 F.2d at 269:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-5\">[I]t is surely in the public interest, as that was conceived of by a Congress representative of all the people, for all major aspects of contemporary culture to be accommodated by the commonly-owned public resources whenever that is technically and economically feasible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">In essence, one man\u2019s Bread is the next man\u2019s Bach, Bacharach, or Buck Owens and the Buckeroos, and where \u201ctechnically and economically feasible,\u201d it is in the public\u2019s best interest to have all segments represented.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">Having thus raised format change to a public interest level, in <em>Citizens Committee </em>we went on to find factual disputes concerning (a) the financial necessity for the format change, (b) the accuracy of interviews with prominent citizens pertaining to the retention of the classical music format, and (c) the extent to which daytime listeners in Atlanta (the city of license) were provided with classical music from a non-Atlanta source. Since the format change was an issue to be considered in determining whether the assignment application was in the public interest, these factual disputes became \u201csubstantial and material\u201d and 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(e) (1970) required a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">Not too surprisingly, <em>Citizens Committee </em>has become the object of dichotomous interpretation. The Commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>on the one hand, recognized <em>Citizens Committee </em>(and subsequently a summary reversal based thereon in Citizens Committee to Preserve the Present Programming of WONO (FM) v. FCC, No. 71-1336 (D.C.Cir. May 13, 1971)) to such an extent that in its Primer on Ascertainment of Community Problems by Broadcast Applicants, 27 F.C.C.2d 650, 680 (1971), it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-4\">[A]ny application involving a <em>substantial change in program </em>format\u2014 including assignment and transfer applications (where this type of question has usually arisen) and also applications for renewal or major changes in facilities if they involve a basic programming change \u2014 will be scrutinized in light of [the <em>Citizens </em>Committee] decision; and applicants should be prepared to support their proposals to change formats in light of the needs and tastes of the community and the types of programming available from other stations. A careful reading of this decision is recommended. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">It is our distinct impression, however, based on the briefs and oral arguments in the case <em>sub judice </em>and Lakewood Broadcasting Service, Inc., et al., v. FCC, 156 U.S.App.D.C. \u2014, 478 F.2d 926 (1973), also issued today, that the Commission desires as limiting an interpretation as is possible. We suspect, not altogether facetiously, that the Commission would be more than willing to limit the precedential effect of <em>Citizens Committee </em>to cases involving Atlanta classical music stations. On the other hand, voices have been heard, <em>see </em>dissenting opinion of Commissioner Johnson in this case, 35 F.C.C.2d at 973, espousing a more liberal interpretation \u2014 one holding that any format change diminishing the diversity available automatically gives rise to a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-11\">We treat format changes no differently from any other element affecting public interest. If there are factual disputes, as there were in <em>Citizens Committee, </em>then a hearing must be held. If there are none \u2014 for instance the financial viability of the existing format and the alternative sources of that format may be undisputed,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> so that the Commission is faced only with balancing the competing interests with known and unchallenged<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> factors, and thus determines where the public interest lies\u2014 then no hearing is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-12\">In Hartford Communications Committee v. FCC, <em>supra, </em>we were presented with allegations running to (1) the financial qualifications of a proposed assignee, and (2) diminution of service, issues long considered in the public\u2019s interest, yet we did not grant appellant\u2019s request for a Commission hearing because we found no substantial factual dispute as to those material issues. The dispute concerned the interpretation from a public interest posture to be given the indisputable facts. That determination was for the Commission to make and did not require a hearing. <em>See </em>Anti-Defamation League of B\u2019nai B\u2019rith v. FCC, 131 U.S.App.D.C. 146, 403 F.2d 169, 171 (1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 930, 89 S.Ct. 1190, 22 L.Ed.2d 459 (1969). An identical procedure is applicable for format change considerations. When we say that a format change is of public interest proportions we mean that it must be considered by the Commission in its ultimate determination of public interest, and thus will be an element scrutinized by this court when called upon to exercise its review. If none of the issues pertaining to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>format change are substantially in dispute, however, no hearing need be held.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">Thus, the proposed format change before us should have been surveyed by the Commission, and we must look to the record to determine if any substantial and material issues of fact are present,</p>\n<p id=\"aiq-dedup-0\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">The Commission\u2019s decision views \u201cthe facts here as very much analogous to those which were before the Commission in WCAB, Inc., 21 RR2d 146, 27 FCC2d 743 (1971).\u201d 35 F.C.C.2d at 970. In <em>WCAB, </em>however, there was no dispute that under a \u201cprogressive rock\u201d format the licensee had suffered and continued to suffer serious financial losses. In addition, there was no dispute that an alternative source of the format, WZMF (FM) licensed to Menomonie Falls, Wisconsin, was available to Milwaukee area residents. Those issues <em>are </em>disputed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">While it is true that financial difficulties were experienced under the \u201ccountry and western\u201d and \u201cgolden oldies\u201d format, appellant has produced numerous affidavits of station employees and sales personnel to the effect that the \u201cprogressive rock\u201d format was rapidly achieving financial viability. Hooper surveys for November-December, 1971, and January-February, 1972, showed substantial audience gains during all programming segments, and the station had risen to middle ranking in the twelve station market between 3:00 p. m. and 12:00 p. m.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> More importantly, the rate card was adjusted upward from $2.80 per sixty second announcement to $14.00,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and a \u201cno cut\u201d policy was adopted and faithfully observed. The financial losses of the licensee under the prior formats are relevant, <em>inter alia, </em>to suspension of the \u201cthree year rule,\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but not directly to the format change aspect of the public interest determination.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The question is not whether the licensee is in such dire financial straits that an assignment should be granted, but whether the <em>format </em>is so economically unfeasible that an assignment encompassing a <em>format change </em>should be granted. <em>WCAB </em>represented a case of known economic un-feasibility. Contrariwise, here there exists a legitimate dispute concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>viability of a \u201cprogressive rock\u201d format, and the past difficulties under other formats are only minimally relevant. As appellant aptly points out in its brief, \u201c[t]he question before the Commission is not whether WGLN (FM)\u2019s prior format was profitable in the past, but whether progressive rock as a format has been, and is now, \u2018economically feasible.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The supposed <em>WCAB </em>analogy is equally inapplicable from an alternative source viewpoint. While two \u201ctop forty\u201d formats now service the Toledo area there has been no showing, at least on the record,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that an alternative source of \u201cprogressive rock\u201d is available. The implied Commission assertion that one is available \u2014 through reference to <em>WCAB, </em>and by the nunc pro tunc assertion in the Memorandum Opinion and Order denying appellant\u2019s motion for stay, August 8, 1972,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that \u201cToledo presently has two stations utilizing a \u2018Top Forty\u2019 entertainment format which, though not devoted exclusively to petitioners\u2019 tastes, include some \u2018progressive rock\u2019 music\u201d \u2014is in the face of contrary allegations by the appellant that raise material issues of fact which must be explored in a hearing. We deal here with format, not occasional duplication of selections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">Finally, the Commission attempts to support its conclusion by reference to the fact that WGLN (FM) is the only station licensed to Sylvania, that we stated in <em>Citizens Committee </em>that \u201cif there were only one radio channel available to Atlanta\u201d the result therein might have been different, 436 F.2d at 269, and that the vast majority of petition signatures were those of Toledo rather than Sylvania residents.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">WGLN (FM)\u2019s city of license is its primary obligation. In considering the needs of the community it must stress those of Sylvania and program accordingly. A licensee\u2019s obligations do not end there, however, and a secondary ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>ligation exists .to satisfy the demands of the surrounding environs.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Recognition of this requirement can be seen in Twin States\u2019 application for construction and license, discussed earlier,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and in the survey of community leaders. The survey contained in the assignee\u2019s application, for example, compiled the results of interviews with eleven Toledo and five Oregon residents, six residents of other suburban communities, and thirty-five Sylvania residents. To the extent that WGLN (FM) secondarily serves Sylvania\u2019s neighbors, it is secondarily responsible to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">More importantly, however, is the degree to which Sylvania is served by the area\u2019s other radio stations. WGLN (FM) may be the only channel licensed to Sylvania, but the availability of the multitude of other stations has a distinct bearing upon the format change determination before the Commission. Thus, in <em>WCAB </em>an alternative source available in Menomonie Falls eased the way for the format change of a Wauwa-tosa station serving the entire Milwaukee metropolitan area. Likewise, in <em>Citizens Committee </em>we remanded for a hearing to determine the extent to which a non-Atlanta station provided an alternative source of a \u201cclassical music\u201d format for Atlanta residents. We realize that the fewer the radio sources the more the tastes of the majority must be recognized, and that some easy listening format could represent the greatest good for the greatest number. Nonetheless, when considering the \u201cgreatest good\u201d in this case we cannot ignore the multitude of non-Sylvania stations serving the Syl-vania residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\"> The Commission\u2019s reasoning contains an interesting, if unacceptable, inconsistency. The Commission marks Sylvania as the sole city of license in an effort to support its failure to consider the petition signatures of non-Sylvania residents, and to support its disapproval of a specialized format; yet when the issue of alternative listening sources is raised it quickly points to two \u201ctop forty\u201d formats offered by stations not licensed to Sylvania. Equally important, of course, is the fact that significant numbers of Sylvania residents did petition for retention of the \u201cprogressive rock\u201d format.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> All things considered, a significant minority of those whom WGLN (FM) was obligated to serve desired retention of the apparently unique format. Change of the format became an issue for the Commission and a hearing was required regarding the disputed facts: alternative sources and economic feasibility. The Commission\u2019s failure to recognize its obligation mandates this remand.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>If no objection is raised to a format change the Commission may properly assume that the format is acceptable and, so long as all else is in order, it may grant the application.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> When the public grumbling reaches significant proportions, as here and in <em>Citizens Committee, </em>the format change becomes an issue for resolution and hearing procedures are applicable if issues of fact are in dispute. Questions regarding the extent of support for the format themselves may be material, and if substantial then the proper procedure is either a survey of the area residents or a hearing on the issue. Once the factual disputes are exposed and a hearing held the Commission\u2019s decision regarding the public interest must be reasoned and based upon substantial evidence. Failure to hold a required hearing or failure to render a reasoned decision will be, as always, reversible error. No more is required, no less is accepted.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">We recognize that in reviewing the Commission\u2019s determinations, even as to whether a hearing should be held, our scope of review is limited. <em>See </em>West Michigan Telecasters, Inc. v. FCC, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 39, 396 F.2d 688 (1968), <em>and </em>Southwestern Operating Co. v. FCC, 122 U.S.App.D.C. 137, 351 F.2d 834 (1965).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The failure to hold eviden-tiary hearings herein simply cannot pass muster even under the limited test we impose, and so the Commission\u2019s order granting the assignment application of WGLN (FM) and denying appellant\u2019s Petition for Reconsideration is</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-16\">.

It makes no practical difference whether an adequate listening alternative is considered one of many elements (although undoubtedly the most important, and normally the conclusive element) to be considered by the Commission, or as a factor that renders inapplicable the entire <em>Citizens Committee </em>rationale.

The assignee proposes contemporary popular music and standard popular music from the past. Thus, there is considerable doubt whether the doctrine of the <em>Citizens\u2019 Committee Case </em>even comes into play. However, even if the doctrine of that case were to be applied. here, the application establishes beyond a doubt that the assignee\u2019s proposals, as described above, are designed to serve the needs and interests of Canton and that the tastes of Canton for entertainment programming will continue to be met.

It is possible, although not probable, that a licensee could suffer such financial losses under prior formats that a newly found profitable format will be too little too late. In the event that no purchaser can be found willing to program the new economically feasible format (equally unlikely), and the public is thus faced with abandonment of the- channel altogether, the financial losses of the licensee under prior formats would have to be considered relevant to the format change determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">. Brief for Appellant at 32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">. At oral argument reference was made by counsel for the Commission and Inter-venor to a new \u201cprogressive rock\u201d station servicing the Toledo metropolitan area. This is a matter for the Commission\u2019s consideration cn remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">. The Commission\u2019s original decision was released on June 30, 1972, and is reported at 35 F.C.C.2d 969. Later, on August 8, 1972, Commissioners Robert E. Lee and H. Rex Lee, \u201cacting as a Board,\u201d adopted an opinion and order denying appellant\u2019s motion for stay of the effective date of the Commission\u2019s earlier order. Jt.App. at 288. In this second opinion the Commission for the first time distinguished the <em>Citizens Committee </em>case on the grounds that WGLN (FM) was Syl-vania\u2019s only station, and that alternative sources of \u201cprogressive rock\u201d were available. Appellant contends that this second opinion and order cannot be considered when reviewing the Commission decision to grant the application. We find the Commission decision defective even if we consider the reasons set out in the second opinion, and so we need not decide the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">. Appellant circulated petitions with the following heading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-12\">We the people of the community know [sic] as Toledo, Ohio:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtM\">Protest the elimination of programming dedicated to progressive rock and public affairs serving our community as formerly presented by station WGLN-FM. We the citizens oppose the approval of transfer of frequency 105.5 FM to Lewis Dickey, president of Midwestern Broadcasting and owner of WOHO-AM.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtP\">We feel the interest of the public will best be served by an independent broadcaster using the same broadcasting principles established by WGLN prior to the takeover and elimination by Midwestern Broadcasting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9QA\">Petition sponsored by Citizens Committee to Keep Progressive Rock!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-16\">Jt.App. at 187. Appellant asserts that 11,122 signatures \u201cfrom the greater Toledo, Ohio, area\u201d have been submitted to the Commission. Despite the language of the heading it is clear from the record that the petitions did include signatures of non-Toledo residents, although the exact number is questioned. Appellant stated in its Reply Brief in the Commission proceedings, Jt.App. at 237, that \u201ca substantial percentage of the signers are residents of Sylvania,\u201d and submitted with its Reply Brief the signatures of 188 additional Sylvania residents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">. <em>See </em>Primer on Ascertainment of Community Problems by Broadcast Applicants, 27 F.C.C.2d 650, 682, question #6 (1971) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-6\">Question: Is an applicant expected to ascertain community problems outside the community of license?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-7\">Answer: Yes. Of course, an applicant\u2019s principal obligation is to ascertain the problems of his community of license. But he should also ascertain the problems of the other communities that he undertakes to serve, as set forth in his response to Question 1(a) (2) of Section IV-A or IV-B .... If an applicant chooses not to serve a major community that falls within his service contours a showing must be submitted explaining why. However, no major city more than 75 miles from the transmitter site need be included in the applicant\u2019s ascertainment, even if the station\u2019s contours exceed that distance.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">. <em>See </em>text at note 2 <em>supra, </em>and text of note 3 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1001-13\">. <em>See </em>note 18 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">. Tlie Commission stated, 35 F.C.C.2d at 971 n. 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-15\">It should be noted that WGLN did not have a \u201cProgressive Bock\u201d format when assignee contracted to buy it or when the assignment application was filed. Certainly assignee should not be held responsible for the continuation of a format which was not in existence when it filed its application. This factor clearly distinguishes this case from the decision in Citizens Committee (WGKA) v. FCC, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 109, 436 F.2d 263 (1970) and where the Court found that there was a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>stantial question as to whether the stations were operating at a loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">We find, as did Commissioner Johnson in his dissent, that the time of adoption of the \u201cprogressive rock\u201d format is \u201ca distinction without a difference,\u201d 35 F.C.C.2d at 974 n. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-6\">The majority attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Citizens </em>by pointing out that the current format was not adopted until after Midwestern contracted to buy the station, or even until after the application for approval of the purchase was filed. While this may be a distinction between this case and <em>Citizens, </em>it is a distinction without a difference. The relevant question is still whether, given what we know about the current operation of the station and the proposed future operation, the assignment is in the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">Naturally the length of time that a specific format has been on the air is a factor to be considered in the ultimate public interest determination, for it can have a direct bearing on the degree of attachment which the public has to the unique format. It is also relevant to determinations of economic feasibility. <em>See </em>WCAB, Inc., 27 F.C.C.2d 743, 746 n. 7 (1971), and Note, The Public Interest in Balanced Programming Content: The Case for FCC Regulation of Broadcasters\u2019 Format Changes, 40 Geo.Wash. L.Rev. 933 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">. Again, Commissioner Johnson dissenting, 35 F.C.C.2d at 974: \u201cNormally, when a station proposes to change a format, it is a matter between it and its community. If no one objects, the Commission assumes \u2014 and properly so \u2014 that the new format is acceptable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1002-14\">. We see no greater difficulty in characterizing \u201cprogressive rock\u201d as a format than that present in the characterization of \u201cclassical music\u201d as such. <em>See </em>Citizens Committee v. FCC, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 109, 436 F.2d 263, 265 n. 1 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1002-15\">. As we stated in West Michigan Telecasters, Inc. v. FCC, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 39, 396 F.2d 688, 691 (1968) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-17\">Admittedly, the scope of our review is quite narrow; we defer to the expertise and experience of the Commission within its field of specialty and would reverse only where the Commission\u2019s position is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. And it is clear that the decision of when hearings are necessary or desirable to clarify issues is one which lies in the first instance with the Commission.
