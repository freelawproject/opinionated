BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b926-24\">The easiest thing in this case is how it happened. It was, or so it was thought, a simple rear-end collision at night between two heavily loaded tractor-trailer rigs on Interstate 55 near Hammond, Louisiana. But almost immediately, as a sort of land-based Donnybrook,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it got more and more com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>plex. The upshot is that we must determine how well the Mississippi forum court did with a Louisiana diversity ease involving along the way overriding -Federal Seventh Amendment problems and the force of Interstate Commerce regulations. Since we find two things which affect the result as to all, we reverse and remand for a trial on liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Earl Simmons, the driver of the vehicle which was rear-ended instituted a suit in the Court below against William R. King, the driver of the rear-ending vehicle, Dubose<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Ace<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging that King was the mutual and joint agent of Dubose and Ace.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> King and Ace answered separately but through a single spokesman denying that King was negligent, was the agent of Ace<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and pleading affirmatively that Simmons was eontributorily negligent<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *and that at the time of the accident King had been the agent of Dubose.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Not suprisingly Dubose answered by denying that King had been his agent and pleading affirmatively that King had been the agent of Ace, that the relationship of King to Dubose had been that of independent contractor and that Simmons had been eontributorily negligent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">\n<em>The Trial Outcome</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">At the trial, the District Judge peremptorily instructed the jury that (i) Simmons was not guilty of any contributory negligence but (ii) to find for Simmons against King and at least one of the other two Defendants, Ace and Du-bose. He left to the jury the determination as to whether Ace or Dubose or both were vicariously liable for the acts of King. The jury proceeded to find for Simmons against King and Ace in the amount of $65,000, but found in favor of Dubose.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">On King and Ace\u2019s separate motions the District Judge denied the motion for a J.N.O.V. but conditioned his denial of a new trial upon Simmons accepting a remittitur of $10,000. Simmons accepted the remittitur upon the condition that none of the Defendants appeal the reduced judgment. King and Ace promptly appealed and with his condition breached Simmons cross-appealed. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b927-19\">Of all the parties only Dubose was happy, happy, that is, with how things turned out below, but unhappy now at the prospect that, having been somehow dragged into this appeal of Simmons <em>vis a vis </em>King, Ace or both, he will lose the judgment of exoneration.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-20\">\n<em>What Went Wrong?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b927-21\">Fleeing from the burden of judgment King-Ace assert the Court below erred (1) by peremptorily instructing the jury (a) that Simmons was not guilty of any contributory negligence and (b) to find for Simmons against King and at least one of the other Defendants and (2) by failing either to instruct the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Dubose was liable as a matter of law for the negligence of King or at least submit the issue to a jury. Simmons\u2019 cross-appeal urges error (3) in directing the remittitur of $10,000 and (4) in disallowing some items of Simmons\u2019 bill of costs. We sustain (1) (a), (2) and (3) and reverse and remand for a new trial on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">\n<em>The Law Of Medes And Persians</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A8G\">The substantive law is, of course, that of Louisiana. This means that contributory negligence is a complete bar to recovery.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It also means that under its jurisprudence others (Ace, Dubose, or both) may be liable on civil principles akin to common law <em>respondeat superior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">But what is not left to Louisiana or to Mississippi, the forum state, is the quantum of proof either to support or ignore a finding by a Seventh Amendment Federal jury, or the supremacy of valid regulations issued by a regulatory agency (ICC).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">\n<em>Boeing The Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">The propriety of the trial Court\u2019s peremptory instructions turns on the now familiar, oft-cited standard adopted by this Court en banc.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-8\">\u201cOn motions for directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict the Court should consider all of the evidence \u2014 not just that evidence which supports the nonmover\u2019s ease \u2014 but in the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion. If the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the Court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict, granting of the motions is proper. On the other hand, if there is substantial evidence opposed to the motions, that is, evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions, the motions should be denied, and the case submitted to the jury. A mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to present a question for the jury. The motions for directed verdict and judgment n.o.v. should not be decided by which side has the better of the case, nor should they be granted only when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support a jury verdict. There must be a conflict in substantial evidence to create a jury question. However, it is the function of the jury as the traditional finder of the facts, and not the Court, to weigh conflicting evidence and inferences, and determine the credibility of witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aon-dedup-0\">Boeing v. Shipman, 5 Cir., 1969, 411 F.2d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">And of course, we are often reminded (or remind ourselves as well as trial Judges) that \u201cIssues of negligence and contributory negligence are particularly susceptible of jury determination.\u201d Taylor v. Bair, 5 Cir., 1969, 414 F.2d 815; Anderson v. Eagle, 5 Cir., 1970, 423 F.2d 81; Morvant v. Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty Company, 5 Cir., 1970, 429 F.2d 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-13\">\n<em>How It All Happened</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-x-\">On the fateful night of the collision both tractor-trailer rigs involved were proceeding in a northerly direction on Interstate Highway 55 near Hammond, Louisiana. The lead vehicle, driven by Simmons, was carrying a load of building materials weighing in excess of 43,-000 pounds. Simmons, admittedly aware of another vehicle behind him, testified that he was driving up the interstate at about 45 or 50 miles per hour when he saw some lights over to the right side of the road appearing as if there had been an accident.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He said he immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>pulled out a switch to activate blinking warning lights on the front and rear of his truck and pulled down the hand brake valve to start slowing down. His testimony was that he had slowed to 30 miles per hour when the collision occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">King, his vehicle carrying a load of sugar weighing in excess of 45,000 pounds, had been following Simmons for six or seven miles prior to the collision. According to King\u2019s testimony, upon reaching a flat, fairly straight section of the four lane highway, he began trying to pick up speed to pass Simmons\u2019 truck. He testified that he glanced in his rear-view mirror but observed a car approaching to pass him in the left lane such that he was unable to enter the left lane to pass Simmons. At that point in time it was too late to avoid rear-ending Simmons. The collision knocked the building materials forward, crushing forward the cab of Simmons\u2019 truck and thereby smashing him between the steering wheel and the cab.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">\n<em>King\u2019s Wrong Flagrant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Except for the claim of Simmons\u2019 contributory negligence, King neither does nor can offer any explanation for his own conduct. The collision was the result (in part at least) of his flagrant fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Of course King began with the heavy burden from Louisiana substan-five law which imposes a presumption of negligence upon the driver of the following vehicle in a rear-end collision who bears the burden of exculpating himself from this inference of negligence. Groom v. T. E. Mercer Trucking Co., La.App., 1971, 253 So.2d 586; Barnes v. Toye Brothers Yellow Cab Company, La.App., 4 Cir., 1967, 204 So.2d 83; Strother v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, La.App., 1970, 238 So.2d 774; Prudhomme v. Dore, La.App., 223 So.2d 474; Porter v. Barron, La.App., 185 So.2d 304; Dominique v. Insurance Company of North America, La.App., 195 So.2d 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-20\">King, instead of helping himself, only made matters worse. Confronted with his own testimony from a previous trial involving the property damage of the Frierson (Simmons) truck, King did not disavow that he had expressly acknowledged that because of his inattentativeness he was following too closely.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-21\">The Judge was clearly right in giving a peremptory instruction as to negligence against King. With respect to it the only question remaining was whether such negligence was to be visited upon Ace, Dubose, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-22\">\n<em>Simmons\u2019 Negligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b929-23\">But it stands differently as to contributory negligence of Simmons even though the charge is thin and undoubtedly the jury would have held in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>his favor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> All three Defendants asserted that Simmons was contributorily negligent in operating his vehicle without proper warning lights and in stopping his vehicle suddenly without warning (see note 6 and 8, supra). The only evidence adduced at the trial on the question of warning lights was the testimony of King himself that there was an absence of warning that Simmons\u2019 vehicle was slowing down. King admitted that he had been following Simmons for six or seven miles and was therefore aware of his presence ahead, but Simmons also admitted being aware of King\u2019s presence behind. Besides the testimony of King there was likewise little evidence adduced by the Defendants on the question of whether Simmons stopped suddenly. According to Simmons\u2019 version, he had begun slowing down upon seeing what appeared to be another accident ahead. He testified that he decelerated from 50 miles per hour to 30 miles per hour. A witness to the accident, Mr. Leonard Spinks, testified that Simmons\u2019 deceleration was gradual rather than sudden but that Simmons did slow to 20 or 25 miles per hour. Spinks also testified that King did not slow down before hitting Simmons.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">But probatively weak as it was in the face of strong testimony concerning lights, and undermined further by inconsistencies in King\u2019s prior statements (see e.g. note 11, <em>supra), </em>the question re--' mained whether in the critical moments Simmons had timely activated warning lights. And wrapped up in this was the suddenness of the deceleration.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Evaluating this was a typical jury function. Consequently the verdict for Simmons based on the erroneous peremptory instruction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">\n<em>Laying Off King\u2019s Fault</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqNN\">The Judge below instructed the jury to find against, in addition to King, at least one of the other Defendants on the issue of negligence. He then submitted to the jury the question of which, if not both, of the other party-Defendants, Ace or Dubose, was vicariously liable for the negligent acts of King. The jury chose Ace, thereby exonerating Dubose. We think it was incorrect for this issue to have been submitted to the jury in the manner done.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">\n<em>Ace-King-Dubose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">Briefly stated the relationship between Ace and Dubose arose in the following manner. King, driving for Ace, an ICC certificated carrier, left Memphis, Tennessee on the day prior to the collision with a load bound for Baton Rouge, Louisiana. After delivering his loaded trailer to the Esso Terminal in Baton Rouge he picked up an empty trailer. The general manager in Memphis directed him to report with tractor and trailer to Dubose, an ICC carrier certificated to transport sugar, in Den-ham Springs, Louisiana because Dubose wanted to lease two rigs to haul sugar. Upon King\u2019s arrival at Dubose, a lease was prepared <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> under which the tractor-trailer and driver were leased to Dubose to transport a load of sugar from Reserve, Louisiana, to Memphis Tennessee. King, as instructed, signed this lease on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>behalf of Ace.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Dubose prepared door placard printed \u201cDubose Trucking Company\u201d with Dubose\u2019s ICC authority number and placed them over the Ace identification on the truck (see note 15, infra). The tractor-trailer rig was also inspected by an agent of Dubose (see note 15, infra). King then proceeded to Reserve, Louisiana, picked up a full load of sugar and left about 8:30 p.m. for Memphis. It was about an hour later that the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">\n<em>ICC, Not Louisiana, Controls</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b931-17\">Ace contends that the lease which was effective at the time of the accident, one required by ICC regulations,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>Dubose to assume full and complete liability and responsibility for the actions and negligence of King while he was operating the vehicle under Dubose\u2019s certificate of authority.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Ace contends that, if King was negligent, then the trial court erred in not appropriately instructing the jury that Dubose was liable as a matter of law for the acts of King.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">Dubose, on the other hand, contends that 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1057.4 (see note 15, <em>supra) </em>is inapplicable to a situation, similar to the present one, where both carriers are certificated motor common carriers.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> He submits that the regulation applicable here is 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1057.-5 <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (see note 20, <em>infra) </em>which governs the interchange <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> of equipment between motor common carriers.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>We flatly reject Dubose\u2019s contention that the lease of equipment in question constituted an \u201cinterchange\u201d. In motor carrier parlance an \u201cinterchange\u201d of equipment is a term of art. It is a form of \u201cinterlining\u201d whereby a carrier whose certificated routes do not extend to the through destination permits the on-carrier to use the initiating carrier\u2019s equipment to avoid costly useless unloading/reloading costs, and the like shipment to another carrier for delivery. Gilbertville Trucking v. United States, 1962, 371 U.S. 115, 83 S.Ct. 217, 9 L.Ed.2d 177. Even more important no \u201cinterchange\u201d was or could have been involved here since Ace had no certificate to transport sugar. The transportation of sugar had to be that of Dubose alone. <em>See, </em>Agricultural Transportation Assoc. of Texas v. King, 5 Cir., 1965, 349 F.2d 873 at 880-81 and notes 23, 24; Thompson v. United States, 1944, 321 U.S. 19, 64 S.Ct. 392, 88 L.Ed. 513; United States v. Rosenblum Truck Lines, 1941, 315 U.S. 50, 62 S.Ct. 445, 86 L.Ed. 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">The legislative-administrative travail behind the ICC regulations on trip leases reflects the importance attached by the Congress and ICC to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>economic necessity for such short term leases and why it is critical' that ICC regulations and the leases mandated by them have supreme, controlling significanee. They grew out of the decade long ex parte proceeding No. MC-43 pursuant to the authority contained in Section 204, 49 Stat. 546, as amended, 49 U.S.C.A. 304.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The arduous road has been often traced. Agricultural Transportation Assoc, of Texas v. King, 5 Cir., 1965, 349 F.2d 873. See, Agricultural Transportation Assoc. of Texas v. King, <em>supra </em>at 881, 882 and many others.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Many factors were behind this legislative-administrative determination. Many were economic to avoid costly dead hauls. But many were to correct abuses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>that had arisen under often fly-by-night arrangements with consequent damage to the development and maintenance of a sound transportation system and to the public interest from a helter-skelter operation of thousands of unregulated vehicles on the highways as a menace to safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">One way to assure responsibility was to impose on the certificated carrier the full responsibility for the entire operation of temporarily leased equipment, whether owner-driver, or otherwise. The regulation (note 15, <em>supra) </em>and the mandated lease provision are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">We agree with the United States District Court for the District of Delaware where they wrote \u201c * * * the ICC carrier\u2019s liability for equipment and drivers covered by leasing arrangements is not governed by the traditional common law doctrine of master-servant relationships and respondeat superior.\u201d Cosmopolitan Mutual Ins. Co. v. White, <em>supra </em>at 99. And more recently the Seventh Circuit in Alford v. Major, 7 Cir., 1972, 470 F.2d 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">Here the lease specifically stated that Dubose as lessee assumed \u201cfull responsibility * * * to the public\u201d (see note 13, <em>supra) </em>as required by \u00a7 1057.4 (see note 15, <em>supra). </em>Requisite placards and an inspection were also provided by Dubose as required by \u00a7 1057.4 (see note 15, <em>supra). </em>The deliberate fulfillment of these statutory prerequisites by the parties must be viewed as giving rise to a statutory relationship, since these regulations have the force and effect of law, Cox v. Bond, <em>supra, </em>249 A.2d at 586. Since under the lease Dubose assumed exclusive possession, control, and use of the vehicle and responsibility to the public then King became his statutory employee, and as such Dubose was vicariously liable as a matter of law for the negligence of King.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">In every conceivable way Ace tried to get the Court to instruct that as a matter of ICC law Dubose was responsible for King\u2019s actions. Not only did the Judge decline to so instruct but he openly disparaged the defense. Ace made its position clearly known. The Court erred in rejecting it and Ace has full right to have this error reviewed. <em>Cf. </em>Williams v. Slade, 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-16\">\n<em>Ace Not Home Free</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b935-17\">Although Dubose is liable for King\u2019s acts as a matter of law, Ace could still be likewise liable under applicable common (civil) Louisiana standards of control. This is not as incongruous as might be supposed. ICC can mandate a positive legal responsibility which we uphold in the only way it would be meaningful \u2014 to give protection to the injured member of the public At the same time Ace has, or may have, a practical control over King of a kind which would not allow it to obtain an automatic insulation from liability from the mere terms of a lease between two parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-18\">\n<em>What Comes Next?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b935-19\">Since the damages allowed may well have been affected by the erroneous instruction on contributory negligence, and Ace is entitled to its instruction as to Dubose\u2019s liability the ease calls, we think, for an entire retrial,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> as unfortunate and as unnecessary as that might have been (see note 12, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-20\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-25\">.

In the previous trial involving the property damage of tlie Frierson truck, on cross-examination King testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-10\">\u201cQ So what you\u2019re saying is that you glanced in the mirror and you looked back around and you were right on top of the Frierson truck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-11\">A Too close to stop.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-12\">* * <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-13\">Q And you knew the Frierson truck was some 300 feet in front of you at that point, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-14\">A I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-15\">Q And you looked away two seconds and when you looked back around you were too close to stop, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-16\">A That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-17\">In the trial below King testified that, upon realizing that he couldn\u2019t pass, he backed off three to four hundred feet and tried to hold his distance. Here, according to his testimony King had momentarily abandoned his intention to pass and was simply following Simmons\u2019 vehicle at between 300 and 400 feet. In doing this, King violated Louisiana Statutes Annotated, R.S. 32:81, which prohibits a motor truck from following within four hundred feet of another motor truck, except when overtaking another vehicle to pass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADr4\">Without putting it on statutory negligence per se since the statute has a built-in escape for trucks engaged in passing another, LSA R.S. 32:81, in prohibiting a truck to follow closer than 400 feet, reflects a state policy bearing on general prudence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b930-5\">.
