The most significant issue <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> presented by this appeal is whether the trial court erred in allowing an agent of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) to testify in court concerning an out-of-court voice identification of the defendant when the conversation which served as the basis for comparison, and hence the identification, contained incriminating statements obtained in violation of defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights as set out in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and applied by this court in United States v. Ramos, 448 F.2d 398 (5th Cir., 1971). The trial court did not err in allowing the identification testimony to go to the jury, and defendant\u2019s other points of error are without merit. Ryan\u2019s conviction is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-17\">On March 11, 1972, BNDD Agent Constantine Kritikos, acting undercover, went to the residence of John Black in Apollo Beach, Florida, to negotiate for the purchase of cocaine. He was accompanied by a government informer. In the course of his conversation with Mr. Black, Kritikos learned that Black had a partner who was hiding in the bedroom. The partner was described as a thirty-three year old white man. Before leaving Black\u2019s home Agent Kritikos was given a Miami telephone number to call regarding future cocaine transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-18\">On March 14, 1972, about 7:30 in the evening, Agent Kritikos called the Miami number given him by John Black and asked to speak to Black. The person answering the phone identified himself as \u201cMickey, John\u2019s partner,\u201d and informed Kritikos that the pending cocaine transaction was moving along well and to call back at 9:30 that same evening. (This was the first contact between Agent Kritikos and the defendant Mickey Ryan, and this telephone conversation forms the basis upon which Kritikos was later able to identify Ryan\u2019s voice.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>Later in the evening on March 14 Ryan was arrested at the Executive Inn Motel in Miami. The events leading to his arrest can be summarized briefly. BNDD undercover agents Baumwald and Starratt went to a room in the Executive Inn at 5 P.M. on the 14th and acquired a sample of cocaine from two persons, Runion and Price. The agents returned to the same room at 7 P.M. and purchased 234 grams of cocaine from the same two men. It was agreed that another sale would be made later that evening. At 11:45 P.M. the undercover agents returned to the room to make the final purchase. Runion and Price were present but the cocaine had not yet arrived. After a short wait someone knocked at the door and Runion left the room. Although' Agent Baumwald did not see an actual transfer of cocaine, defendant Ryan was observed standing outside the door in the motel hallway, and when Runion returned he had a package of cocaine with him. Ryan was arrested a few minutes later outside the motel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">After his arrest Ryan was taken to the BNDD office in Miami and was given Miranda warnings for at least the second time. He declined to sign a waiver of rights form. Agent Kritikos then asked the defendant several questions. The following are excerpts from the agent\u2019s testimony which was taken outside the jury\u2019s presence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-6\">[Defense counsel]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-7\">\u201cQ. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-8\">[Agent Kritikos]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-9\">A. I said, \u2018You are Mickey?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 I said, \u2018You\u2019re John\u2019s partner that came down from Apollo Beach,\u2019 and I made a derogatory remark about the Buick they came down in. He said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 That\u2019s all he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-13\">I asked him who was his connection for the cocaine. He wouldn\u2019t say anything. I asked him where they were going to go with the money. He wouldn\u2019t say anything. So with other questions along those lines, he wouldn\u2019t answer them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-14\">Now I asked him how old he was and he advised me that he was thirty-three. And then I said, \u2018You\u2019re John\u2019s thirty-two year old partner ?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-15\">[Government counsel]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-16\">Q. Then, is that when you asked him, \u2018What\u2019s your name ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-17\">A. Yes, sir \u2014 No, sir. No. I said, \u2018You\u2019re Mickey?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-18\">Q. And did you mention any telephone conversation you had with him ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-19\">A. Yes, sir. I said \u2014 that\u2019s right\u2014 \u2018You\u2019re the guy that talked to me on the phone. I\u2019m Gus. Remember?\u2019 And he said \u2018Yes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-20\">Q. Then what did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-21\">A.

What did you say then ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-4\">A. \u2018You\u2019re the thirty-two year old partner of John\u2019s that was up in the house hiding in the bedroom, is the way I put it, \u2018in Apollo Beach.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-5\">Q. What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-6\">A. \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">In United States v. Ramos, 448 F.2d 398 (5th Cir., 1971), we held that incriminating statements made in response to government instigated interrogation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> after defendant\u2019s refusal to sign a waiver of rights form, were inadmissible. A government investigator is <em>Miranda </em>bound to cease interrogation once the defendant indicates that he wishes to remain silent. Miranda v. Arizona, <em>supra, </em>384 U.S. at 473-474, 86 S.Ct. 1602; United States v. Ramos, <em>supra, </em>448 F.2d at 399. <em>See </em>United States v. Phelps, 443 F.2d 246 (5th Cir., 1971). The trial court properly ruled that Ryan\u2019s answers to the questions asked by Agent Kritikos were inadmissible under this standard. Ryan\u2019s answers were incriminating admissions obtained as a result of government instigated interrogation after Ryan had refused to sign a waiver of rights form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">We are not faced with the precise <em>Ramos </em>problem, however, because the agent\u2019s questions and Ryan\u2019s answers were not admitted into evidence. The narrow question is whether these incriminating statements could be part of a voice exemplar used for identification purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">Our analysis begins with the row settled proposition that a defendant can be compelled to give a voice exemplar without any violation of his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 764, 35 L.Ed.2d 67 (1972) [1972]; United States v. Mara, 410 U.S. 19, 93 S.Ct. 774, 35 L.Ed.2d 99 (1972). <em>See </em>United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967); Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263 (1967); Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1967); United States v. Sanders, 477 F.2d 112 (5th Cir., 1973); United States v. Walker, 453 F.2d 1205 (5th Cir., 1972). If Agent Kritikos had talked to Ryan about the weather or some other equally innocuous subject, and based his voice identification on that conversation, we would have no trouble upholding the identification.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The peculiar problem here is that Ryan\u2019s answers to the pointed questions asked by Agent Kritikos tended to confirm that he was, in all probability, the same man Kritikos had talked with just six hours earlier on the telephone. The crux of the issue is, therefore, whether the agent\u2019s identification was based on the content rather than the sound of his conversation with Ryan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-15\">The answer to this question turns on the credibility accorded the agent\u2019s testimony, heard outside the presence of the jury, that his identification was founded on the sound of Ryan\u2019s voice rather than the communicative aspects of the conversation. We assume, as did the trial court, that <em>Ramos </em>would preclude the introduction of in-court identification testimony had the court determined that the identification was the product of the communicative nature of the conversation. The court concluded, however, that the out-of-court identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>fication was the product of a voice comparison. We have examined the record in this case and hold that this finding is not clearly erroneous. The lower court had the benefit of observing Agent Kritikos on the witness stand and of examining him first hand to test the basis for his identification. Under close questioning by the court and by both government and defense counsel, Agent Kritikos maintained, and gave sufficient support for, his position that his identification was based on the sound of defendant\u2019s voice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On this record the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>court\u2019s decision to credit the agent\u2019s testimony is not clearly erroneous. There is therefore no basis on which the agent\u2019s testimony should have been excluded because the identification was not the result of the <em>Ramos </em>proscribed questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\"> For purposes of judicial economy \u2014 and in the likely event that Ryan will at some time seek relief under \u00a7 2255 \u2014 we think it appropriate to comment on several related issues not raised directly by defendant\u2019s appellate brief. After Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 32 L.Ed. 411 (1972), it is apparent that Ryan did not have a right to the presence of counsel at the pre-indictment confrontation with Agent Kritikos. <em>Kirby </em>holds that pre-indictment confrontations are not \u201ccritical stages\u201d of the prosecution at which the presence of counsel is constitutionally required. But, the absence of a requirement for counsel does not remove the defendant from the broad protection of the due process clause. The <em>Kirby </em>Court explicitly recognized this principle when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-6\">\u201cWhat has been said is not to suggest that there may not be occasions during the course of a criminal investigation when the police do abuse identification procedures. Such abuses are not beyond the reach of the Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 690, 92 S.Ct. at 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">The Court then reiterated its view that \u201cit is always necessary to \u2018scrutinize any pretrial confrontation . . . . \u2019\u201d 406 U.S. at 690-691, 92 S.Ct. at 1883, citing United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. at 227, 87 S.Ct. 1926. The standard on which to scrutinize pretrial confrontations is found, according to <em>Kirby, </em>in Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967). The <em>Stovall </em>standard has its foundation in the due process clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. If pretrial confrontation procedures are \u201cunnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification,\u201d then they violate due process of law. 388 U.S. at 302, 87 S.Ct. at 1972. The thrust of this due process protection is to assure against pretrial confrontation procedures which may lead to a mistaken identification of a defendant. The pretrial confrontation in the instant case was not conducive to a mistaken identification of defendant Ryan as a participant in the cocaine distribution scheme.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For this reason Ryan cannot look to the rationale underlying <em>Stovall </em>for a basis upon which to assert that the identification testimony here should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-14\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-15\">Ryan\u2019s other assertions of error are without merit. In United States v. Amando Lopez, 459 F.2d 949 (5th Cir., 1972), we held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) (1) and 846 were constitutional. Congress did not exceed its constitutional power \u201cby creating federal narcotics offenses that do not require proof of a specific nexus with interstate commerce as a prerequisite for conviction.\u201d United States v. Alberto Lopez, 461 F.2d 499, 500 (5th Cir., 1972). The rationale for this holding is that it would be a futile exercise to attempt to separate intrastate from interstate activities, and that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>an attempt would substantially interfere with and obstruct the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. 459 F.2d at 951. <em>See </em>Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 91 S.Ct. 1357, 28 L.Ed.2d 686 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Count One of the indictment, the conspiracy count, charged that Ryan had \u201ca .tacit understanding\u201d with several other persons to violate the previously discussed statutes. Ryan seems to argue that a tacit agreement cannot be an element of conspiracy and thus Count One is insufficient and should have been dismissed. The basis for this position appears to be the erroneous notion that the conspiracy must be bottomed on an actual overt agreement to commit a crime. Defendant also appears concerned that because the dictionary definition of \u201ctacit\u201d implies something done in silence, without words, he could be convicted for an unknowing participation in a criminal scheme. This latter concern is unfounded. The indictment charged that Ryan \u201cknowingly, intentionally, and willfully\u201d conspired with others to violate the statute. Furthermore, the court\u2019s jury instructions carefully emphasized that Ryan\u2019s participation in the criminal activity had to be knowing and intentional. Finally, it is unnecessary for a conspiracy to be bottomed <em>on an </em>express or formal agreement. Oral statements of agreement are equally unnecessary. It is enough if a conspiracy to commit a crime can be inferred from .the circumstances present in a given case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">Ryan next contends that the trial court erred while instructing the jury on intent. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-7\">\u201cIntent, ordinarily may not be proved directly. There is no way of fathoming the operations of the human mind. You may infer the defendant\u2019s intent from the surrounding circumstances. <em>You may consider any statement made or omitted by the defendant at the time; and 1 don\u2019t think there is any particular evidence of any statement. </em>You may consider all the facts and all the circumstances in evidence <em>from </em>which you may be able to arrive at your conclusion following the charges of law as to the intent at the time.\u201d (Emphasis supplied,)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"abe-dedup-0\">Ryan objects to the italicized portion of this statement. He argues that it was a comment on his silence at the time of his arrest and on his failure to testify, thus violating his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Assuming arguendo that .the charge was erroneous in the first instance, the court cured the error when, after suggestion by defense counsel, it clarified the statement to the jury by explaining that a defendant has no duty to make a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">When considering possible error in a court\u2019s charge, the reviewing court must examine the charge in its totality and should not isolate possible erroneous statements from the context in which they were made. We have examined the entirety of the court\u2019s charge here and find it completely fair to the defendant. Any prejudice flowing from the attacked portion of the charge was inconsequential when viewed against the charge as a whole.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-11\">Finally, Ryan argues that the court should have required the government to disclose the name of the government informer who accompanied Agent Kritikos to John Black\u2019s residence on March 11. The court informed defendant\u2019s counsel that it would require the government to produce the informer if he so desired. The record reveals that counsel decided, after consulting with the defendant, that the delay which would have resulted from producing the informer was not worth having the informer present. The court was sufficiently accommodating to the interests of the defendant. Its decision not to disclose the name of the informer was, on the facts here, a proper place to strike the balance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>between the government\u2019s need to keep an informant secret (both for the government\u2019s and the informer\u2019s sake) and the defendant\u2019s desire to know more about the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">' The defendant\u2019s conviction is in all respects affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">.

Other issues will be discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">. Ryan makes an unconvincing argument that there was not probable cause for his arrest. We hold that probable cause was established because the arresting officers were aware of the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-11\">(1) that Black was working with a partner; (2) that Ryan had been seen with Black throughout the evening of March 14; (3) that Black and Ryan together had entered the motel just prior to the 7 P.M. transaction and (4) that Black and Ryan had entered had left shortly after its completion; the motel just prior to the midnight transaction; (5) that Price and Runion were waiting for delivery of the cocaine prior to the arrival of Black and Ryan at midnight; (6) that cocaine was transferred to Runion shortly after the arrival of Black and Ryan: (7) that either Black or Ryan had been seen carrying a brown overnight bag; (8) that Runion had obtained the cocaine for the midnight sale from someone just outside the motel room; (9) that Ryan was observed standing in the hallway just outside the motel room.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1080-12\">. <em>Compare </em>United States v.

No, the three questions, two or three questions that we are talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alr-dedup-0\">A. Was it helpful? That didn\u2019t positively identify him for me, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5u\">Q. I didn\u2019t ask you if it positively identified him. I assume this and the phone conversation, put the two together and you knew you had the right man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ac8-dedup-0\">A. The conversation we had after this also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUSf\"><em>Q. </em>The conversation also that followed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApU\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZb\">Q. In other words, taking the whole thing in conjunction, there was no question but the fact that this was the same guy that you spoke to over the phone previously the past day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHI\">A. Yes, six hours before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avi\">Q. The first two questions of the identification and the fact that he was the one that spoke to you on the phone; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayd\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3n\">Q. After the first two questions were you satisfied this was the same fellow that you spoke to over the phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9B1\">A. Not till we finished our conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANB\">Q. Of course by that time he was saying he didn\u2019t want to talk to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aho-dedup-0\">A. He didn\u2019t want to answer specific questions that were directed to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayz-dedup-0\">Q. Were you looking to have him admit that he spoke to you on the phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvRg\">A. After I spoke to the gentleman a few minutes I recognized his voice; right. That was already established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL3\">Q. You recognized his voice. You said a \u2018few minutes.\u2019 How much into the conversation had you gotten when you recognized his voice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4UI\">A. I couldn\u2019t say. The conversation only lasted ten minutes, maybe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApGU\">Q. How far into the conversation would you say this is the same fellow I spoke to on the phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6d\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>A. A little more than half way through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"amh-dedup-0\">Q. By that stage, what was lie saying to you when you first realized that this was the same guy that spoke to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azd\">A. He didn\u2019t know about any cocaine or any Cuban connections, like that. When lie was talking about Cuban connections, lie also was mentioning words we had used on the phone, saying the same words.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1082-16\">. \u201c[A] claimed violation of due process of law in the conduct of a confrontation depends on the totality of the circumstances surrounding it .\u201d Stovall v.
