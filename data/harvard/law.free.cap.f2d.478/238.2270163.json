Having made a careful study of the transcript of testimony and the Judge\u2019s charge to the jury, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-26\">Defendant\u2019s co-conspirator Frank Howard was the government\u2019s key witness. In an attempt to impeach his testimony, the defense called defendant\u2019s former counsel Ted Hoffmann to the stand. Mr. Hoffmann testified that Howard had previously given him a written, sworn statement exonerating defendant from any involvement in the illegal whiskey operation. At the conclusion of the direct examination, and upon the government\u2019s failure to cross-examine, the Court asked six questions to clarify the witness\u2019s relationship to the defendant and the circumstances surrounding the sworn statement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-27\">We cannot say that this minor interrogation deprived the defendant of a fair trial in any manner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"akw-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-11\">. The entire colloquy between the Court and Witness Hoffmann was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-13\">THE COURT: Cross.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-14\">MR. SEGREST: I have no questions of Mr. Hoffmann.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-15\">THE COURT: Wait a minute. Who lined this appointment up for you?

Our conclusion in this regard is also supported by the careful instructions which the trial court gave to the jury concerning his own participation in asking questions, the ability to impeach a witness by prior inconsistent statements, and the testimony of an accomplice [appendix at 123-124]. The jury had not only Mr. Hoffmann\u2019s testimony, but also a copy of the prior sworn statement of Howard when it considered the case. Obviously, the jury credited Howard\u2019s testimony and discredited prior statement. And there it ends.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
