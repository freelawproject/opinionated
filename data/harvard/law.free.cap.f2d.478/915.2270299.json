ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">In 1952, the Administrator of Veterans. Affairs terminated a 1944 award of monthly disability compensation benefits in favor of appellant, a World War II veteran. The ground assigned for the revocation was a new determination, contrary to the old, that appellant\u2019s disability was unrelated to his military service, and that the award \u201cinvolve[d] a clear and unmistakable error.\u201d In 1968, appellant brought suit in the District Court seeking a judgment declaring the Administrator\u2019s action null and void, and directing the restoration of compensation from the date on which it had been discontinued. Appellant\u2019s complaint alleged that the Administrator\u2019s underlying conclusion that the disability was not service-connected was without supporting evidence. For those reasons, the complaint charged, the termination deprived appellant of compensation without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-17\">In answer to the complaint, the Administrator urged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction of the action, a position unsustainable at the time. By this court\u2019s construction of the then provision of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) rendering the Administrator\u2019s decisions on \u201cclaim [s]\u201d for veterans\u2019 noncontractual benefits judicially unreviewable,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>suits could be maintained for disability compensation terminated after having been previously awarded, as distinguished from compensation denied when originally claimed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But while appellant\u2019s case was pending in the District Court, Congress amended Section 211(a) to eliminate that distinction and to put the Administrator\u2019s decisions in either category beyond the purview of the courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On that basis, the District Court dismissed appellant\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-18\">Appellant concedes that amended Section 211(a) deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to pass on the validity of the Administrator\u2019s 1952 determination on the merits. Indeed, our decision in de Rodulfa v. United States,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> announced during the pendency of this appeal, made that crystal clear.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> **Apparently quite aware of his difficulty, appellant now points to the due process contention advanced in his complaint, and argues that the amended section did not and could not foreclose the District Court\u2019s power and responsibility to decide whether the Administrator had acted consistently with constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-19\">The question appellant thus poses was not presented in <em>de Rodulfa, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>which was devoid of. any attack on the constitutional fairness of the administrative proceedings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We perceive no call to address that question here for, on the record before us, appellant\u2019s thesis that the Administrator\u2019s action stands wholly without notice, hearing or supporting evidence remains unestablished. Constitutional issues are not to be resolved on hypothetical bases,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or otherwise in advance of strict adjudicative necessity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We thus have no occasion to reach the due process issue appellant tenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Confronting the bare allegations of lack of notice, hearing and evidence in appellant\u2019s complaint is the unimpeached record of the administrative proceedings on his claim. That record discloses not only that appellant was advised of the termination of compensation which the Administrator contemplated, but also that he passed up an invitation to present countervailing evidence prior to the effective date of the Administrator\u2019s proposal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Had he accepted that opportunity, the Administrator\u2019s answer declares, appellant would have secured a pre-termination hearing, and nothing impinging on the accuracy of that statement appears.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The administrative record also reveals that appellant has been afforded four posttermination hearings on his claim for restoration of benefits, and that appellant was present at all of these hearings and was represented by counsel at least at two.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> *On each of these occasions, the decision was adverse to appellant and, taken at face value, the record refutes appellant\u2019s assertion that the finding that his disability was service-unconnected was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\"> Appellant urges, however, that since the case was not tried, it must be assumed for purposes of this appeal that he could prove the allegations of his complaint at a trial. But only by contradicting the administrative record could appellant have sustained the factual premise urged here,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and his contention that he should have been indulged a trial for that purpose misconceives a burden which had overtaken him. In the District Court, both sides moved for summary judgment on the administrative record. The record is duly authenticated,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and by statute is evidence of the procedural facts it recounts <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> *** \u2014 includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>ing the pretermination notice and opportunities, and the posttermination hearings and the evidence thereat. Left standing, those facts obliterated the purported factual basis for the constitutional contention which appellant now advances.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, given the presumptive verity of the administrative record,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it was necessary for appellant, in order to gain an opportunity to impeach the record at a trial, to show that an issue as to its accuracy genuinely existed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But appellant made no effort to do so, and the failure was fatal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Without a triable constitutional issue, the case ultimately involved no more than the substantive validity of the Administrator\u2019s 1952 determination on the merits. That, we repeat, became a matter beyond review by the courts.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b986-19\"> We are mindful that the record does not conclusively demonstrate that appellant could have obtained a hearing prior to the discontinuance of his benefits, as distinguished from one thereafter. But that does not affect the case as appellant has framed it. As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>have said, the Administrator, in answer to appellant\u2019s complaint, alleged that had appellant responded to the pretermination invitation to submit evidence, he would have been afforded a pretermination hearing. Nothing brought before us challenges that claim in the least. Since the burden of establishing the factual predicate<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> for a constitutional attack is upon him who makes it,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> it was incumbent upon appellant, if indeed his grievance was unavailability of a hearing before benefits were cut off, to come forward with something to show that the Administrator\u2019s statement was at least open to doubt. Not only did appellant fail to do so but he also failed to present that precise issue for appellate review. His brief in this court does not differentiate pretermination and posttermi-nation hearing opportunities, nor does he even cite Goldberg v. Kelly<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or any of its progeny. Constitutional contentions are to be sharply defined,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and we have no cause to depart from this wholesome precept here.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">The District Court, we hold properly dismissed appellant\u2019s suit.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Its action in doing so is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"AAc7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-8\">.

It is well settled that a certified transcript of judicial or administrative proceedings may.be considered on a motion for summary judgment. See Shulins v. New England Ins. Co., 360 F.2d 781, 785 (2d Cir. 1966) (judicial record) ; Fletcher v. Bryan, 175 F.2d 716, 717 (4th Cir. 1949) (judicial record) ; Ramsouer v. Midland Valley R.

As we have stated, each side moved for summary judgment and predicated its demand on the administrative record. That record, unless somehow contradicted, satisfied the Administrator\u2019s initial burden of demonstrating the absence of any genuine issue of fact material to appellant\u2019s broad constitutional contention. See Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144, 153-161, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). And the presumption importing verity of the record, see text <em>supra </em>at note 16, discharged the concomitant burden on that score, and it then became incumbent upon appellant to come forward with facts indicating the contrary. For \u201c[w]hen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). See also First Nat\u2019l Bank of Arizona v. Cities Serv.
