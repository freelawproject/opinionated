App. \u00a7 462. In the district court defendant waived his right to a jury trial and conceded his failure to report. The sole basis of the defense was that the order to report for induction was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-27\">The district court held that it could not consider this defense because the defendant had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. United States v. Newmann, No. 4-71 CR. 255 (D.Minn. July 18, 1972). We have concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>the district court erred in barring the defense and that the judgment of conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The relevant facts in this case are simple and undisputed. Shortly after his eighteenth birthday defendant registered with Selective Service System Local Board No. 51 in Hennepin County, Minnesota. For approximately two years defendant attended college under a II-S classification student deferment. On March 17, 1970 defendant was granted a I-S(c) classification, which was a limited student deferment designed to allow defendant to complete the semester of study in which he was then engaged. Defendant\u2019s I-S(c) classification was scheduled to expire in September 1970. On September 2, 1970 defendant filed a timely request for conscientious objector status and he was sent SSS Form 150 to pursue this application. On October 6, 1970 defendant returned the completed SSS Form 150. Two weeks later, on October 20, 1970, Local Board No. 51 classified defendant I-A. Although the action of the Local Board in classifying defendant I-A presumably included a consideration and rejection of defendant\u2019s recently filed claim for conscientious objector status, the Board never made a statement of reasons explaining why the conscientious objector request had been denied. On October 23, 1970 defendant was sent the standard SSS Form 110 and Form 217, which notified defendant that the Board had classified him I-A and that he had a right to appeal within thirty days. Neither form made any reference to the basis of the Board\u2019s decision or to the fact that defendant\u2019s conscientious objector application had been considered. Defendant made no effort to appeal his I-A classification within the thirty-day limit. On November 25, 1970 defendant was ordered to report for induction. Shortly thereafter defendant initiated a determined, but unsuccessful, effort to have the denial of his conscientious objector claim reviewed administratively. On December 17, 1970, the date he was ordered for induction, defendant failed to report.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Defendant seeks to excuse his failure to appeal within the thirty-day limit on the ground that he did not realize the Board\u2019s decision to reclassify him I-A on October 20, 1970 was a rejection of his conscientious objector application. Defendant testified that he felt this reclassification was merely an automatic action that resulted from the expiration of his student deferment and that his conscientious objector application would be considered at some later date. Defendant stated that he was aware of his right to appeal the October 20th I-A classification but at the time he received the notice of classification he felt the only grounds for appeal would be that he was entitled to an extension of his student deferment. Since defendant was no longer in school he clearly was not entitled to an extension of the student deferment.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">The evidence introduced by the government in no way contradicts defendant\u2019s testimony. The government\u2019s own witness on direct examination testified that the Local Board\u2019s October meetings always include a large number of automatic I-A reclassifications that resulted from expiring student deferments. The government\u2019s witnesses and exhibits corroborate defendant\u2019s testimony that he received no direct indication that his conscientious objector application had been denied until after his right to appeal had expired. Finally the government\u2019s witnesses and exhibits agree that defendant made every reasonable effort to obtain a discretionary administrative review of his file after his right to appeal had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\"> From the state of the record outlined above it is clear that defendant failed to pursue any of the administrative appeal procedures that were available to him as a matter of right. Normally a failure to exhaust administrative remedies will foreclose any subsequent judicial review of the validity of a registrant\u2019s classification. <em>E. g., </em>United States v. McBride, 468 F.2d 567 (8th Cir. 1972). It has long been established, however, that the exhaustion doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>is not an automatic and absolute bar to any attack on the validity of a registrant\u2019s classification. As early as Glover v. United States, 286 F.2d 84 (8th Cir. 1961), we recognized that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d might justify a relaxation of the normal exhaustion requirement. The necessity of relaxing the exhaustion requirement under \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d has also been recognized in other circuits. <em>E. g., </em>United States v. Rabe, 466 F.2d 783 (7th Cir. 1972); United States v. Davis, 413 F.2d 148 (4th Cir. 1969); Donato v. United States, 302 F.2d 468 (9th Cir. 1962). The difficulty with the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d rationale has been that, until recently, there has been no clear guidance from the Supreme Court identifying the factors that should be considered in deciding whether or not to relax the exhaustion requirement in a particular case. This guidance has now been supplied by the Court\u2019s decisions in McKart v. United States, 395 U.S. 185, 89 S.Ct. 1657, 23 L.Ed.2d 194 (1969) and McGee v. United States, 402 U.S. 479, 91 S.Ct. 1565, 29 L.Ed.2d 47 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">In both <em>McKart </em>and <em>McGee </em>the majority opinions refrained entirely from using the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d language that had become common in the lower federal courts. Instead, the Court utilized a balancing test which weighed the interests of the registrant against three specified governmental interests in requiring exhaustion. The three governmental interests in requiring exhaustion identified by the Court are: (a) the agency\u2019s interest in having an opportunity to make a factual record and exercise its discretion and expertise without the threat of litigious interruption; (b) the agency\u2019s interest in discouraging frequent and deliberate flouting of the administrative process; and (c) the agency\u2019s interest in correcting its own mistakes and thereby obviating unnecessary judicial proceedings. The procedure used by the Court in <em>McKart </em>and <em>McGee </em>in this balancing process was to analyze the governmental interests to determine whether they were \u201ccompelling enough to outweigh the severe burden placed on [the registrant]\u201d when he is denied judicial review of allegedly illegal agency actions. McKart v. United States, 395 U.S. at 197, 89 S.Ct. at 1665; McGee v. United States, 402 U.S. at 485, 91 S.Ct. 1565. In <em>McKart </em>the central issue was one of statutory interpretation and the Court concluded that the governmental interests were not compelling enough to require forfeiture of Mc-Kart\u2019s defense. In <em>McGee </em>the agency\u2019s interests in fact finding and exercising its expertise were threatened by the registrant\u2019s deliberate refusal to participate in the administrative process, and the Court concluded that the necessity to protect the integrity of the Selective Service System compelled a foreclosure of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Applying the principles of <em>McKart </em>and <em>McGee </em>to this case, it is clear that the government has completely failed to show any interest compelling enough to justify a forfeiture of judicial inquiry into the validity of defendant\u2019s classification. Local Board No. 51 refused all of the defendant\u2019s offers to enlarge the factual record. There was no litigious interruption of the Board\u2019s opportunities to exercise its discretion and expertise. Indeed, the inadequacy of the Board\u2019s own actions in exercising its expertise and discretion is the basis of the registrant\u2019s defense. There is no agency interest in time-saving self-correction suggested in this case because the Local Board and the State Director consistently refused defendant\u2019s repeated requests to have his file reopened for just such a correction process. Finally, there is nothing in this case that would encourage frequent and deliberate flouting of the administrative process by others. The record is uncontradicted that defendant\u2019s failure to appeal within thirty days was due solely to his lack of information about the Board\u2019s decision and the consequences of his failure to appeal. The government concedes that as soon as defendant learned that his conscientious objector application had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>been denied he made every effort to have that decision reviewed administratively.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">We hold, therefore, that the government has failed to demonstrate any interests compelling enough to justify foreclosure of judicial review. Furthermore, we find that there is no dispute over the fact that defendant has presented a valid defense under our recent holding in United States v. Hanson, 460 F.2d 337 (8th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for entry of a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
