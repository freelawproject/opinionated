(\u201cthe employer\u201d), from violating the Act\u2019s minimum wage,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> overtime,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and record-keeping<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requirements and to compel payment, with interest, of compensation owing to the employer\u2019s building maintenance personnel. The employer admits that it paid the named employees less than the prescribed federal minimum wage during the period in question (1967-70),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that it failed to pay them the prescribed premium for overtime work, and that its bookkeeping records did not satisfy the Act\u2019s requirements. The employer, however, (1) denies that its payment and record-keeping practices were unlawful, arguing that it was not subject to the Act\u2019s requirements because it is a purely local business, and (2) urges that the district court erred in finding that the activities of the service employees engaged them in commerce for purposes of the FLSA. Concluding that appellant\u2019s elevator operators were engaged in commerce under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(b),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that appellant was an \u201centerprise engaged in commerce\u201d under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 243(r)-(s) (l),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the district court ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>that appellant had violated the Act and granted the relief sought by the Secretary. The district court\u2019s opinion is reported at 320 F.Supp. 664 (S.D.Tex. 1970). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Appellant is a Texas corporation doing business in Corpus Christi. It has offices in that city at 1701 Wilson Tower Building which, together with the adjoining Wilson Building (also an office building), the Wilson Tower Garage, and two parking lots, appellant owns and operates for profit. The office buildings are occupied by a miscellany of tenants, including lawyers, doctors, accountants, geologists, oil companies, lease brokers, and others. The buildings and parking facilities are maintained by various of appellant\u2019s service employees, including (1) elevator operators, (2) maintenance employees <em>(e. g., </em>carpenters, mechanics, and plumbers) and (3) janitors and maids. The district court\u2019s findings as to each category of employees were as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-6\"><em>Elevator Operators. </em>\u2014 Nine employees regularly operate the four elevators in the seventeen-story Wilson Tower Building. All four elevators transport passengers as well as persons delivering interstate mail, parcel post, and freight. Mail is delivered to the tenants twice daily, parcel post two or three times daily, and freight is delivered regularly each week to various tenants. The district court found that although the time devoted by the elevator operators to carrying postmen and freight deliverymen is small in comparison to the time devoted to the carrying of other passengers,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cthe interstate deliveries of mail, freight and parcel post to The Wilson Tower Building are sufficiently regular, frequent, and substantial in amount to constitute said elevator operators as being engaged in commerce; and the elevator operators are so closely related to the movement of commerce as to be a part of it.\u201d 320 F.Supp. at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-12\"><em>Maintenance Employees. </em>\u2014 These employees remodel office space in appellant\u2019s two buildings and perform general carpentry and repair work for the benefit of tenants. The remodeling work is done at the request of tenants, pursuant to the rental agreement, subject to the \u2022approval of appellant. The lower court found that a substantial portion of the materials installed and supplies handled by the maintenance employees, such as the lumber used for wall paneling, doors, etc., is manufactured outside the state of Texas, 320 F.Supp. at 667. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>mechanics and plumbers maintain the air conditioning and heating systems in the buildings, and they, as do the other maintenance employees, handle replacement parts and goods which are manufactured out of state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\"><em>Janitors and, Maids. </em>\u2014 These employees perform custodial services for the benefit of tenants, as required by the rental agreement between tenants and appellant. Their work includes cleaning offices and hallways, stocking restrooms with soap, paper towels, and toilet paper, and replacing light bulbs and fluorescent lamps throughout the buildings. The district court found that a substantial quantity of the electrical and janitorial supplies handled by the janitors and maids is manufactured out of state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">As noted, the district court concluded that the elevator operators\u2019 transportation of mail, parcel post, and freight is regular, frequent, and substantial enough to render the operators \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d within the meaning of the Act, thus satisfying the requirement of Section 203(s) that appellant\u2019s enterprise have employees engaged in commerce. Regarding the maintenance employees, janitors, and maids, however, the court concluded that even though they handle products which have trav-elled interstate, they are not engaged in commerce because the products do not meet the Act\u2019s Section 203(i) definition of \u201cgoods\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court determined that \u201csuch materials when handled and worked on by [appellant\u2019s] employees are in the hands of the ultimate consumer,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>appellant, and that they therefore are out of the flow of commerce. 320 F.Supp. at 669. By virtue of the elevator operators\u2019 engagement in commerce, however, the court ruled that the other named employees are employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce and that they too are entitled to the benefits of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-10\">On appeal both appellant and the Secretary find fault with the district court\u2019s decision. Appellant argues that the court erred in finding that the elevator operators are engaged in commerce and in ruling that all the employees in question are covered by the Act\u2019s enterprise doctrine. The Secretary, while agreeing with the court\u2019s result, argues that the court erred by not ruling that the activities of the maintenance and janitorial employees provide independent grounds for sustaining enterprise coverage under the Act. Since we are of the opinion that the elevator operators are engaged in commerce within the meaning of Section 203(s) we need not, and do not, reach the question whether the activities of the other employees provide an independent ground for finding engagement in commerce; under the Act\u2019s enterprise doctrine<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> they are entitled to the benefits prescribed by the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-12\">We begin our analysis of the question whether appellant\u2019s elevator operators are engaged in commerce mindful of Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s exhortation that the \u201csearch for a dependable touchstone by which to determine whether employees are \u2018engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce\u2019 is as rewarding as an attempt to square the circle.\u201d A. B. Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U.S. 517, 520, 62 S.Ct. 1116, 1118, 86 L.Ed. 1638 (1942). In that case the Court, as it has in numerous cases since, recognized that application of the FLSA to an infinite number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>of industrial and commercial situations is essentially a line-drawing exercise, and that in delineating between areas of activities regulated by the Act and those left to state regulation, courts should be guided by the fixed points of national policy, legislative history, and administrative practicalities. 316 U.S. at 523, 62 S.Ct. 1116. Writing as we do thirty years after <em>Kirschbaum, </em>we are aided by a fourth guideboard \u2014 the long line of judicial decisions which have construed the outer reaches of the Act. We need not dwell on points which, by now, the cases have rendered irrefutable, although we do well to note at the outset the fundamental precepts that influence our reasoning in the present appeal. Thus, for example, it has been firmly established that the phrase \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d within the meaning of Section 203 of the FLSA is to be given a broad, liberal construction rather than a strained, technical one in order to effectuate the Act\u2019s purposes, Mitchell v. C.W. Vollmer &amp; Co., Inc., 349 U.S. 427, 429, 75 S.Ct. 860, 99 L.Ed. 1196 (1955) ; Mitchell v. Lublin, McGaughy &amp; Assoc., 358 U.S. 207, 211, 79 S.Ct. 260, 3 L.Ed. 2d 243 (1959); Shultz v. Mack Farland &amp; Sons Roofing Co., Inc., 413 F.2d 1296, 1300 (5th Cir. 1969); that the Act has a remedial and humanitarian purpose, Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R.R. Co. v. Muscoda Local No. 123, 321 U.S. 590, 597, 64 S.Ct. 698, 83 L.Ed. 949 (1944); Mitchell v. Ballenger Paving Co., Inc., 299 F.2d 297, 301 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 922, 82 S.Ct. 1565, 8 L.Ed.2d 503 (1962), which was designed to provide a minimum standard of living necessary for the health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 202(a)), as well as to prescribe certain minimum standards for working conditions, Wirtz v. Ti Ti Peat Humus Co., Inc., 373 F.2d 209, 212 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 834, 88 S.Ct. 37, 19 L.Ed.2d 94 (1967); and that Congress intended the Act \u201cto extend federal control in this field throughout the farthest reaches of the channels of interstate commerce,\u201d Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 317 U.S. 564, 567-568, 63 S.Ct. 332, 335, 87 L.Ed. 460 (1943); <em>see </em>Wirtz v. Columbian Mutual Life Ins. Co., 380 F.2d 903, 907 (6th Cir. 1967). Moreover, practical considerations, and not technical conceptions, guide us in determining coverage of the Act, and the \u201ccrucial test is the nature of the activities of the employee, rather than the general character of the employer\u2019s business,\u201d Wirtz v. Wohl Shoe Co., 382 F.2d 848, 850 (5th Cir. 1967). With these principles in mind, we turn to the activities of the elevator operators in the present appeal, and to the narrow issue of whether these activities engage the operators in commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">Section 203(b) of the FLSA defines commerce as including \u201ctrade, commerce, <em>transportation, </em>transmission, or communication among the several States\u201d (emphasis added). In support of his position that the elevator operators are engaged in commerce because they transport interstate mail and freight which continue to flow in commerce until delivered to the offices of the tenants, the Secretary points to numerous decisions holding that employees whose duties are directly related to the transportation of goods in interstate commerce are themselves engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act. Our attention is directed specifically to the line of cases beginning with Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., supra.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>In <em>Jacksonville Paper Co. </em>the Supreme Court held that the FLSA was applicable to employees (truck drivers) of a wholesale paper company who transported from company warehouses within the state to retail stores also within the state interstate goods that had temporarily been detained at such warehouses. After noting that \u201cthe purpose of the Act was to extend federal control in this field throughout the farthest reaches of the channels of interstate commerce,\u201d (317 U.S. at 567, 63 S.Ct. at 335) the Court ruled that the interstate journey of the goods did not end, and the goods thus did not cease to flow in commerce, until they reached their final destination \u2014the retail stores (\u201cthere is a practical continuity of movement of the goods until they reach the customers for whom they are intended\u201d), 317 U.S. at 568, 63 S.Ct. at 335. The Court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-5\">The fact that all of respondent\u2019s business is not shown to have an interstate character is not important. The applicability of the Act is dependent on the character of the employees\u2019 work [citation omitted]. If a substantial part of an employee\u2019s activities related to goods whose movement in the channels of interstate commerce was established by the test we have described, he is covered by the Act. 317 U.S. at 571-572, 63 S.Ct. at 337.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">It is plain to us that the goods transported by appellant\u2019s elevator operators (mail, parcel post and freight) continue to flow in interstate commerce beyond the lobby of the office buildings, where appellant argues the journey technically ends, and that they do not come to rest until delivered to the offices of the tenants. Furthermore, it is plain that without the labor provided by the elevator operators in transporting the mail and freight deliverynien throughout the building, the interstate goods would not be delivered to their intended recipients in each office. Appellant urges, however, that the activities of the elevator operators, even though related to the movement of goods traveling interstate, cannot be deemed to engage them in commerce since its business is strictly local in scope. This argument fails, however, in light of the numerous cases holding that applicability of the Act depends not on the character of the employer\u2019s business, but on the nature of the employee\u2019s work. <em>See, e. g., Jacksonville Paper Co., supra, </em>317 U.S. at 571-572, 63 S.Ct. 332; Mitchell v. Lub-lin, McGaughy &amp; Assoc., <em>supra, </em>358 U.S. at 211, 79 S.Ct. 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-10\">Although we have not heretofore ruled on the precise question posed here, namely, whether elevator operators transporting mail and freight in an office building are engaged in commerce, we have had occasion to determine whether elevator operators engaged in other activities satisfied the Act\u2019s coverage requirements. <em>See, e. g., </em>Mitchell v. Sunshine Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., 292 F.2d 645, 647, 648 (5th Cir. 1961); <em>accord, </em>Sucrs, de A. Mayol &amp; Co., Inc. v. Mitchell, 280 F.2d 477, 480-481 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 902, 81 S.Ct. 235, 5 L.Ed.2d 195 (1960); Fleming v. A. B. Kirsehbaum Co., 124 F.2d 567, 571-572 (3d Cir. 1941), aff\u2019d sub nom. A. B. Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U.S. 517, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>62 S.Ct. 1116, 86 L.Ed. 1638 (1942). <em>But cf. </em>Johnson v. Dallas Downtown Dev. Co., 132 F.2d 287 (5th Cir. 1942), cert. denied, 318 U.S. 790, 63 S.Ct. 994, 87 L.Ed. 1156 (1943); Tobin v. Girard Properties, Inc., 206 F.2d 524, 526 (5th Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">In <em>Sunshine Dep\u2019t Stores, supra, </em>the elevator operators, who were also warehouse employees, received, transported and stored shipments of interstate merchandise. The goods were delivered to the company\u2019s warehouse by independent carriers who deposited them at the foot of an elevator. The carriers \u201capproximately 85 or 90 percent of the time\u201d placed the goods on the elevator; the remainder of the time they were so placed by Sunshine\u2019s warehouse employees, some of whom then transported the goods by elevator to the second floor of the warehouse. 292 F.2d at 646. We held that the employees (elevator operators) so handling the goods were engaged in commerce within the meaning of the FLSA. 292 F.2d at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">In <em>Kirschbaum, supra, </em>the Third Circuit on facts similar to those of <em>Sunshine Dep\u2019t Stores </em>noted that elevator operators were \u201cdirectly engaged in commerce for although their activities take place entirely within the state they carry out one step in the actual transportation of the goods to points outside the state.\u201d 124 F.2d at 572 n.5. <em>Accord, </em>Schultz v. Blaustein Industries, Inc., 321 F.Supp. 998, 1008 (D.Md.1971) (\u201celevator operators * * * who regularly and recurrently carried postmen delivering mail and persons delivering materials moving in interstate commerce * * * were engaged in commerce\u201d); Wirtz v. Columbian Mutual Life Ins. Co., 246 F.Supp. 198, 208 (W.D.Tenn. 1965), affirmed, 380 F.2d 903 (6th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-8\">Appellant relies primarily on two decisions, one of which is distinguishable from the facts of the present appeal, 10 East 40th Street Building, Inc. v. Callus, 325 U.S. 578, 65 S.Ct. 1227, 89 L.Ed. 1806 (1945), and the other with which we disagree, Houchin v. Thompson, 438 F.2d 927 (6th Cir. 1970). Although the facts in <em>Callus </em>bear some similarity to those of the present appeal, that case is not controlling because the issue there was whether building maintenance employees were, by virtue of the <em>tenants\u2019 </em>activities engaged \u201cin the production of goods for commerce\u201d, and not whether, as here, the employees\u2019 <em>own </em>activities engage them \u201cin commerce.\u201d Since <em>Callus </em>did not consider the question whether elevator operators regularly and frequently carrying interstate mail and freight shipments are themselves engaged in commerce the case is not helpful.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We similarly distinguished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number><em>Callus </em>in our recent decision in Hodgson v. Travis Edwards, Inc., 465 F.2d 1050, 1053-1054 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1076, 93 S.Ct. 685, 34 L.Ed.2d 665 (1972), where we held that the employees of an office building corporation who regularly mailed monthly reports to out of state corporate officers were engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce within the meaning of the Act. 465 F.2d at 1054. We were there persuaded that even though the monthly reports may have had no intrinsic value and were for internal corporate use only, their preparation and subsequent mailing by the office employees were sufficient to meet the Act\u2019s definition of commerce, <em>i. e., \u201c </em>* * * transportation, transmission, or communication * * *\u201d among the states. And since the activities of the office employees clearly engaged them in commerce, we held that the other building employees, including maintenance personnel, parking lot attendants, and a single maid/elevator operator, were employed in a covered enterprise and thus entitled to the benefits of the Act. 465 F.2d at 1052. If, as in <em>Travis Edwards, </em>the preparation and mailing of monthly reports to corporate directors and officers living out of state engage those sending the reports \u201cin commerce\u201d then, <em>a fortiori, </em>those involved directly in the transportation of the mail (the elevator operators in the instant appeal) are also engaged in commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-13\">To the extent that appellant\u2019s other principal case, Houchin v. Thompson, <em>supra, </em>conflicts with our reasoning in <em>Travis Edwards, supra, </em>and because that decision attempts to revitalize the <em>de minimis </em>doctrine in FLSA cases (438 F.2d at 928-929) <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which has been discredited by the Supreme Court in Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S. 183, 192-193, 88 S.Ct. 2017, 20 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1968),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and by this Court in Shultz v. Kip\u2019s Big Boy, Inc., 431 F.2d 530, 535 (5th Cir. 1970),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we reject the Sixth Circuit\u2019s rationale in <em>Houchin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1165-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-15\">In keeping with the Act\u2019s remedial and humanitarian purposes, and consistent with the Congressional intent of extending coverage under the Act to the farthest reaches of the channels of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>terstate commerce, <em>see Jacksonville Paper Co., supra, </em>317 U.S. at 567-568, 63 S.Ct. 332, the district court correctly, we think, analogized the labor of elevator operators transporting mail and freight to the labor of truck drivers transporting interstate goods between two points in the same state.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See Wirtz v. McClure, 333 F.2d 45, 46 (10th Cir. 1964); <em>Jacksonville Paper Co., supra, </em>317 U.S. at 567, 63 S.Ct. 332. We agree with the district court and the Secretary that both activities satisfy the \u201ctransportation\u201d requirement in the Act\u2019s definition of commerce.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\"> In the context of another Fair Labor Standards Act controversy the Supreme Court, per Mr. Justice Harlan, ruled that \u201cthe considerable discretion possessed by the Secretary as the one responsible for the actual administration of the Act should not be understressed.\u201d Idaho Sheet Metal Works, Inc. v. Wirtz, 383 U.S. 190, 205, 86 S.Ct. 737, 747, 15 L.Ed.2d 694, reh. denied, 383 U.S. 963, 86 S.Ct. 1219, 16 L.Ed.2d 305 (1966). This Court is guided by that precept for, as in all matters regulated by a Congressionally authorized agency, judicial line-drawing in countless possible industrial and commercial situations should begin with deference to the expertise of the agency or administrator involved, especially in questions pertaining to the labor laws. See Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 194, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941); NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 612 n.32, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). Having thus considered the relevant case law, Congressional intent, and administrative practicalities, and believing as we do that the FLSA should be given a liberal interpretation, consistent with Congressional intent in favor of finding coverage, we hold that appellant\u2019s elevator operators are engaged in commerce.

Similarly distinguishable are two of our own past decisions dealing with elevator operators that relied on the <em>Callus </em>decision, Johnson v. Dallas Downtown Dev. Co., 132 F.2d 287 (5th Cir. 1942), and Tobin v. Girard Properties, Inc., 206 F.2d 524 (5th Cir. 1953). Neither case controls the present appeal because in neither case was the issue raised whether elevator operators transporting interstate mail and freight are engaged in commerce. In <em>Johnson </em>the issue was whether six elevator operators whose duties appeared to be limited to carrying passengers up and down the building were <em>engaged in the production of goods for commerce </em>by virtue of the <em>tenants' </em>activities, a question we answered in the negative, 132 F.2d at 289. In <em>Tohin, </em>various employees of an office building owner, including elevator operators, mechanics, janitors, and building maintenance engineers, argued that they were engaged in commerce on the ground that their work in a building 70% occupied by a tenant engaged in interstate commerce, the Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., was \u201can integral part of the operation of the telephone company\u2019s interstate communication system.\u201d 206 F.2d at 526. After noting that the test for determining whether an employee is engaged in commerce \u201cis not whether the employees\u2019 activities affect or indirectly relate to interstate commerce but whether they are actually in or so closely related to the <em>movement </em>of the commerce as to be a part of it,\u201d 206 F.2d at 527 (emphasis added), and noting that the decision in each case must turn upon its own peculiar facts, <em>id. </em>at 528, we held that the various employees were not engaged in commerce because their activities were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>too remote from the \u201cin commerce\u201d activities of the tenant telephone company, <em>id. </em>at 527-528. As far as we determine, in <em>Tobin </em>it was neither alleged nor argued that the elevator operators regularly and frequently transported mail and freight deliverymen as part of their regular duties. Since neither <em>Johnson </em>nor <em>Tobin </em>considered that issue, which is the central issue in the present appeal, those two decisions, relying on <em>Callus, </em>are, like the decision in <em>Callus, </em>readily distinguishable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1165-7\">. The Court in <em>Houchin </em>stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-8\">\u201cWhere some inconsequential incident of interstate commerce happens to result from the general conduct of a fundamentally intrastate business, the rule of de minimis is applicable and the Act does not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1165-9\">438 F.2d at 928-929 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1165-10\">. \u201cThe only question for the courts is then whether the class [of employee activities affecting commerce] is \u2018within the reach of the federal power.\u2019 The contention that in Commerce Clause cases the courts have power to excise, as trivial, individual instances falling within a rationally defined class of activities has been put entirely to rest.\u201d 392 U.S. at 192-193, 88 S.Ct. at 2022 (citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1165-17\">.

In each case the only real relationship between the operator and the load being conveyed is the operation of the means of conveyance involved.
