Appellant does not argue for reversal on the ground that the district court misinterpreted \u00a7 201:14, but instead it contends that Judge Garth had no authority to interfere with the arbitrator\u2019s decision with respect to how this regulation affected the collective bargaining agreement. We disagree. Since the district court determined that the Pay Board regulations, including without limitation \u00a7 201.14 thereof, created a federal right in appellee to secure a review of its existing contract by the Pay Board, and since the district court also found that appellee could exercise this right irrespective of the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, we believe that the district court could properly conclude that the arbitrator in this case should not have denied appellee access to the Pay Board. <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(d) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and San Martine Compania De Navegacion v. Saguenay Terminals Ltd., 293 F.2d 796 (9th Cir. 1961). We emphasize that our holding is limited to the finding that, in view of the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Pay Board regulations, it had the power to vacate that part of the arbitrator\u2019s decision which ordered appellee not to prosecute a wage challenge before the Pay Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>The United States, which was joined as a party in the district court on the motion of plaintiff-appellee, contends that the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction over this appeal under \u00a7 211 of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, 85 Stat. 743 (1971)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, as we have already noted, appellant does not ask this court to consider the district court adjudication on its merits but only raises \u201ca single issue, namely, the proper scope of judicial review of a labor arbitration award.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> *Consequently, since we are not called upon to construe the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 or any regulation promulgated thereunder, it is clear that we do have jurisdiction to decide this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-13\">. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(d) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-14\">\u201cIn either of the following eases the United States court in and for the district wherein the award was made may make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agk-dedup-0\">Hs # * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALK\">\u201c(d) Where the arbitrators exceeded their powers. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b918-12\">.
