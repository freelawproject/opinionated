When the District Court, after hearing testimony and considering affidavits submitted, expressed the intention to require production of the- strictly factual parts of the documents, the Administrator requested a continuance in order to permit him to consider whether to claim \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d. The continuance was granted and the Administrator did file thereafter with the Court an affidavit in which he claimed \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d. Despite this claim by the Administrator, the District Court examined the documents <em>in camera, </em>determined that parts thereof contained purely factual material not inextricably intertwined with policy-making processes, and ordered the same produced. The Administrator has appealed and, pending appeal, secured a stay of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-20\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-21\">The Freedom of Information Act was intended to express in statutory form the firm obligation of governmental agencies to make disclosure to \u201cany person\u201d of identifiable information and facts in their possession, limited only by certain specific exemptions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, it denied the federal agency any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>right to \u201crefuse disclosure of materials covered by the Act for any reason other than one contained in the exclusionary section of the legislation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The legislative history of the Act makes it clear that the obligation to produce thereby mandated is to be construed <em>broadly </em>and the exemptions from such obligation narrowly.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In short, the Act makes disclosure the rule and secrecy the exception. And, lest the Congressional purpose be thwarted by the inevitable tendency of the agency towards secrecy, Congress, discarding the usual principle of deference to administrative determinations, provided for any \u201caggrieved citizen\u201d denied disclosure a judicial remedy in the District Court, which was directed to \u201cdetermine the matter <em>de novo\u201d, </em>with the burden on the agency itself \u201cto sustain\u201d its claim for exemption.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By-such provision, Congress imposed on the federal courts \u201cthe responsibility of determining the validity and extent of the claim [of exemption], and insuring that the exemption is strictly construed in light of the legislative intent.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-23\">The specific exemption on which the Administrator relies authorizes non-disclosure of \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\u201d This exemption has been authoritatively construed as differentiating in treatment between \u201cmaterials reflecting deliberative or policy-making processes on the one hand, and purely factual, investigative matters on the other\u201d,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> between material that deals \u201csolely with matters of law or policy\u201d and those that are \u201cmatters of a factual nature\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Act never \u201cintended to place \u2018factual material\u2019 within the coverage of the fifth exemption.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> ******Simply because a document contains both purely factual material and \u201cmaterials reflecting deliberative or policy-making processes\u201d does not render the document automatically exempt from discovery. Congress never \u201cintended to exempt an entire document merely because it contained some confidential information.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>And this construction of the exemption was given authoritative approval in <em>Mink </em>when Justice White said that \u201cin the absence of a claim that disclosure would jeopardize state secrets, see United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1 [73 S.Ct. 528, 97 L.Ed. 727] (1953), memoranda consisting only of compiled factual material or purely factual matetial contained in deliberative memoranda and severable from its context would generally be available for discovery * * 410 U.S. at 87, 93 S.Ct. at 836. In that case, Justice White stated that Exemption 5 of the Act was not to be applied \u201cwoodenly\u201d as authorizing the \u201cwithholding of factual material otherwise available on discovery merely because it was placed in a memorandum with matters of law, policy or opinion.\u201d He pointed out that the proper application of the exemption makes discoverable <em>factual </em>material in memoranda, even though the memoranda include protected law, policy, or opinion or recommendations, if the \u201cpurely factual material appearing in those documents [is] in a form that is severable without compromising the private remainder of the documents.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Ordinarily, when the issue of severa-bility, as stated in <em>Mink, </em>arises, the Court will review <em>in camera </em>the documents in controversy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But, as <em>Mink </em>declares, such <em>in camera </em>review \u201cneed not be automatic\u201d. If the agency is able to establish, whether \u201cby surrounding circumstances\u201d or otherwise, that the documents \u201care purely advisory and contain no separable, factual information\u201d or if the agency discloses \u201cthe factual portions of the contested documents\u201d and shows \u201cthat the excised portions constitute the bare bones of protected matter\u201d, <em>in camera </em>inspection may be avoided.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">In this case, it is freely conceded by the Administrator that the documents in question contain in part scientific, medical, economic and technological data of a purely factual nature. The District Court found from an <em>in camera </em>review of the documents that such factual data were \u201cseverable without compromising the private remainder of the documents.\u201d That this conclusion is correct was substantiated by the subsequent concession made by the Administrator himself. Thus, the District Court permitted the Administrator to, and the Administrator did, \u201cselect from the documents that the Court has [had] examined en camera [sic], those matters which they [he] would agree are purely factual or scientific, as distinguished from advice, recommendations, opinions and other material reflecting deliberative and policy making processes.\u201d After receiving this compilation by the Administrator, the District Court commented that there were few or no significant differences between the material in the documents found by him to be purely factual and not intertwined with the decisional processes of the Administrator, and those agreed by the Administrator to be so purely factual. The Administrator does not dispute this statement of the District Court. We assume, therefore, there is no substantial difference between the material found by the District Court to have been \u201cpurely factual\u201d and severable from protected material and that so found by the Administrator\u2019s own representative. Under those circumstances, it is thus incontestable that in a substantial sense the material, the disclosure of which he resists, is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>within Exemption 5 both under the findings of the District Court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>inspection and under the admission made by the Administrator\u2019s representative at trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">As a last-line defense to disclosure, however, the Administrator invokes \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d. Such privilege was well recognized long before the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act. The extent and scope of the privilege, which is regarded as in part constitutional in origin and in part common law, have been explicated in the numerous decisions in which the issue has arisen.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> While the claim is one to be asserted initially by \u201cthe head of the department which has control over the matter\u201d inquired into, resolution of the right to secrecy is not left to \u201cthe caprice of executive officers\u201d; rather, it is for the courts to \u201cdetermine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of privilege.\u201d United States v. Reynolds (1953) 345 U.S. 1, at 8-10, 73 S.Ct. 528, at 532, 97 L.Ed. 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In determining when the claim may be properly invoked, the Courts have for long classified the information sought under two broad headings. This was the procedure followed by Justice White in <em>Mink. </em>The first classification relates to what has been often described as \u201cstate secrets\u201d or matters relating to national security, either military or diplomatic.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The second classification consists of \u201cofficial information\u201d, represented in this case by \u201cintra-office advice on policy.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The right to disclosure differs markedly with the two classifications. Because they pose patent dangers to the public interest, \u201c(Disclosures that would impair national security or diplomatic relations are not required by the courts.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> And while courts are \u201cto determine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of privilege\u201d on this ground,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the judgment of the Executive that disclosure might impair \u201cnational security or diplomatic relations\u201d is conclusive, unless the Court finds that the privilege is asserted arbitrarily or capriciously; and, in considering the issue or arbitrariness or capriciousness, the Court is not ordinarily entitled to examine <em>in camera </em>the contested documents.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The second classification, on the other hand, as it relates to this case, applies to \u201cofficial information\u201d, and covers \u201cmaterials reflecting deliberative or policy-making processes,\u201d as distinguished from purely factual material. The disclosure of such materials involves a far lesser danger to the public interest than the disclosure of \u201cstate secrets\u201d and has always been sub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>jeet to a much less stringent rule for discovery and a broader scope of judicial review. <em>In camera </em>examination by the Court of the contested documents in order to determine the acceptability of the claim is generally an accepted practice in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Congress was obviously aware of these two broad classifications of material, over which the claim of \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d might be asserted and, in the Freedom of Information Act, attempted to give to each classification its precise, established judicial right of immunity from discovery.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, in Subsection (1) of the Exemptions, the Act invested with immunity from disclosure all matters \u201cspecifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense or foreign policy.\u201d As <em>Mink </em>makes clear, the test whereby disclosure of these \u201cstate secrets\u201d is to be governed under the Act \u201cwas to be simply whether the President has [had] determined by Executive Order that particular documents are to be kept secret.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This was in keeping with established precedent. But, so far as government documents not qualifying as \u201cstate secrets\u201d are concerned, the Act, as authoritatively construed in <em>Mink, </em>merely codified the existing law by granting protection only to those portions of a government document that were a part of the \u201cdeliberative or policy-making processes\u201d of government and not to those portions that constituted the \u201cpurely factual\u201d material therein, \u201csev-erable without compromising the private remainder of the documents.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">The claim of \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d in this case is no more than a restatement of the Administrator\u2019s claim for exemption under Section (b) (5) of the Act and no broader than the rights given the Administrator under that Section. As the Court recognized in Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Department of H. &amp; U. D. (D.C.Pa.1972) 343 F.Supp. 1176, 1178, the right of immunity, as asserted by the Administrator in this case, is the same, whether it be claimed as an exemption under Section (b) (5) or under the heading of \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d. Thus, the claim of \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d gives no added stature to the Administrator\u2019s claim of exemption under Exemption 5 and is equally unavailing as a basis for reversal of the District Court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-13\">.
