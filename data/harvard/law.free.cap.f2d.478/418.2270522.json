BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b488-21\">Proving again that legislative intent frequently comes to exceed even the wildest imagination of those responsible for enactment, it is ironic that as a product of a laissez-faire society, a 19th Century act is now once again the effective tool in this decade\u2019s awakening awareness of the importance of man\u2019s environment. The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 itself the product of congressional dissatisfaction with the consequences of the Supreme Court\u2019s Willamette Iron Bridge Co. v. Hatch, 1888, 125 U.S. 1, 8 S.Ct. 811, 31 L.Ed. 629, holding that there was no federal common law prohibiting an obstruction to a navigable stream \u2014 was at once the source of jurisdiction and the substantive basis for the action of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Applying \u00a7 10 of the Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which forbids the creation of obstructions in, or alteration of the features of the navigable waters of the United States without permission of the Secretary of the Army the Court ordered Joseph G. Moretti, Jr. to undo dredge and fill operations involving 400,000 cubic yards of earth, because of his failure to obtain the required permit, 331 F.Supp. 151. Despite the fact that Moretti violated the Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> flagrantly and our settled conviction that mandatory affirmative relief requiring a burdensome performance is statutorily and equitably appropriate on these facts, we modify and remand for completion of administrative action which conceivably could have the effect of validating the work done, thus rendering the issues litigated moot.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Moretti owns lands at Hammer Point on Key Largo, one of the Florida Keys curving fingerlike for 120 miles into the Gulf of Mexico off the southern tip of Florida. His property was located about 1 <em>Ys </em>miles from Tavernier on the Florida Bay side of the Key. Tavernier lies to the south of Hammer Point. Hammer Point is in turn about 4% miles southwest of Rock Harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Like the developers in our far-reaching opinion of Zabel v. Tabb,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> he pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>posed to dredge and fill the land into a network of land fingers and canals for use as a mobile home park. Moretti, unlike his counterpart in <em>Zabel, </em>decided to forego the prerequisite imprimatur of the Corps of Engineers before making his proposed project a reality. Having purchased his land in 1969, Moretti had completed substantial work on his project when paid a fateful visit by two employees of the Environmental Protection Agency in December of 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Lee Purkerson and John Hagen, the EPA employees, were not on official business at the time that they noticed the extensive work on the Moretti project. They took some pictures of the drag-line as it was removing soil from the underwater portion of the Bay bottom and adding it to the shoreline thereby moving the shoreline and Moretti\u2019s property bayward. They could also see where channels had been cut or deepened between the fingers. Moretti asked them what they were doing there, a question which they turned back at him. They asked him if he had a Corps of Engineering permit and he said he did not. These facts were reported to the Jacksonville office of the Corps of Engineers. On December 30, 1970, the Corps ordered Moretti to cease from further work below the mean high water mark because this was a violation of Federal law unless properly authorized by the Secretary of the Army.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">After one or two exchanges with the Corps Moretti stopped working, a cessation which was to last for at least a few months. As authorized under Corps regulations the Moretti Company applied for an after-the-fact permit to dredge part of and fill part of Florida Bay. That is, he sought a permit which would legitimize the work done and to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"AEO\">\n<em>Structure of the Act and Regulations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AS9\">In addition to construction and maintenance of flood-control and other improvements on the navigable waters of the United States, the Secretary of the Army acting through the Corps of Engineers has been charged by Congress with administering the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as well as the other principal laws enacted for the protection of navigation and the integrity of the navigable waters of the United States. The Corps of Engineers \u2014 the eyes and ears, and sometimes hand of the Secretary \u2014 is headed by the Chief of Engineers who is charged by law<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> with advising the Secretary of the Army of the propriety of issuing permits. The Corps itself is divided into 11 \u201cdivisions\u201d which are in turn subdivided into 37 \u201cdistricts.\u201d As will be seen later, authority to grant permits is in some cases delegated down to the level of the District Engineers.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">The duties of the Secretary of the Army and the Corps of Engineers under the Act together with the administrative procedures which include the delegation of authority through the Corps are set out at 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 209.120 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">The Secretary has authorized the Chief of the Corps, at the latter\u2019s option, to delegate authority to issue permits to District Offices of the Corps in any ease in which the application for construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>in navigable waters is \u201centirely routine and * * * involve [s] no difference of opinion * * * nor any opposition or other considerations which should be decided by higher authority.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The regulations specify that this grant is not a delegation of the Secretary\u2019s discretionary powers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> By \u00a7 209.120(c) (1) (iii) the Chief of Engineers has exercised this authority and commissioned Division and District Engineers with power to grant permits in the name of the Secretary where the matter is routine.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> *'</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The Corps\u2019 general policy for issuing the permits require that it take into consideration and evaluate \u201call relevant factors, including the effect of the proposed work on navigation, fish and wildlife, conservation, pollution, aesthetics, ecology, and the general public interest * * *.&gt;&gt;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> More specifically the Corps is required by its regulations, various statutes, executive orders and an accord between the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Army<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to consider all applicable data including the views of other federal agencies and the views and objections of state agencies before granting a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">The watchword of the Corps\u2019 relation with other federal agencies charged with protection of the environment is cooperation. Besides its duty to cooperate and collaborate the Corps is charged by executive order, as are all federal agencies, to improve water quality through prevention control and abatement<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of water pollution. In its attempt faithfully to carry out this responsibility the Corps has through formal regulations<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> established a policy, in eases where dredging operations may cause pollution problems, of seeking the technical assistance of state and federal pollution control authorities and conditioning the granting of the permit on the establishment of controls which will insure that federal and state water pollution control standards are met. This policy, and other statutorily required policies are summarized in a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d between the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior signed July 13,1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The memorandum of understanding was drafted in recognition of the statutory responsibility<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the Corps of Engineers and the Department of Interior to interrelate their activities in the area of water pollution control where damage to fish and wildlife is possible as well as in recognition of the agencies responsibilities under Executive Order No. 11288 as discussed above. The memorandum sets forth procedures \u2014 given life in the Corps of Engineers permit procedure, <em>infra </em>\u2014 for carrying out these policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">These procedures provide that (i) upon receipt of an application for dredging or filing permits the District Engineer shall notify Regional Directors of the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and the appropriate state agencies, (ii) The Regional Directors would immediately make such studies and investigations as are necessary and inform the District Engineer whether the quality of the waters will be reduced in violation of applicable standards or the value of natural resources and related environment will be unreasonably impaired, (iii) The District Engineer will hold public hearings when response to a public notice indicates that all parties will not have an opportunity to be heard except at a public hearing, (iv) Besides weighing <em>all </em>factors in granting a permit the District Engineer shall, when advised by the Regional Directors that work proposed will impair water quality or related natural resources encourage the hopeful permittee to take steps to resolve the dispute at the district level and failing this shall refer the case to the Chief of Engineers \u2014his counterpart the Regional Director submitting his views to his agencies \u201cWashington headquarters\u201d \u2014 for appropriate action, (v) Finally the Chief of Engineers and the Under Secretary of Interior shall consult and attempt to resolve any differences between their departments and failing this the case shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Army for decision after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKk\">The Corps regulation \u00a7\u00a7 209.120(e), (f) and (g) govern the applications for permits and the handling of these applications with regard to public hearings and notices to other agencies of federal and state governments. The regulations place the duty of giving both public notice and notice to the other agencies mentioned above on the District Engineer. The permit application must contain a sketch showing the location and extent of the work proposed. This sketch will accompany the Engineer\u2019s notice. The regulations state flatly that \u201cthe public notice is mandatory, and no permit or extention of time in which to complete work authorized by a permit will be granted unless notice has been issued and a reasonable time afforded for a protest * * <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The period in which the permit is to be kept pending awaiting objections is set at a minimum of ten days after issuance of notice. The regulations further provide that under normal circumstances the period should be not less than 30 days after the actual mailing of notice, and a longer period can be afforded in exceptional or im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>portant cases.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Public hearings are portant cases, provided for whenever it appears that there is sufficient public interest to justify such action and in case of doubt a public hearing is required. Cited as a specific example are cases in which there is general public opposition to issuance of a permit.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Hearings, when held, are to be conducted in an informal manner, presided over by the District Engineer or his delegate with a full opportunity given each side to express their views. Formal adversary proceedings are not contemplated.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">In a sentence, the regulations-contemplate application, proclamation, coordination, information, argumentation, consideration and then determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Whatever doubts there might be about the Third Circuit\u2019s reading a permit structure into the related Refuse Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 407 (\u00a7 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899) in United States v. Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical Corp., 3 Cir., 1972, 461 F.2d 468, cert. granted, 409 U.S. 1074, 93 S.Ct. 689, 34 L.Ed.2d 662, it is positive that \u00a7 10 (33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 403) is structured on a permit basis. Indeed the Act itself,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> by its very terms makes it unlawful \u201cto excavate or fill * * * any navigable water of the United States, unless the work has been [i] recommended by the Chief of Engineers and [ii] authorized by the Secretary of the Army * * <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> And the regulations, which are in no wise questioned here, specifically authorize an application for, and the granting of, a permit after the commencement or completion of the work, under appropriate circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">After-the-fact permits \u2014 so vitally important to whatever chances Moretti has for saving the Hammer Point project\u2014 are specifically recognized in the Corps regulations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Read in conjunction with all the regulations, the regulations coneerning after-the-fact permits provide that they be processed in the same manner as other permit applications. These procedures were not followed to full completion of the administrative processing of this application in this case. This is of great import to what we do in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">So long as that regulation stands the Department of the Army was required to respect it. <em>Cf. </em>Vitarelli v. Seaton, 1959, 359 U.S. 535, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012; and <em>see </em>Schatten v. United States, 6 Cir., 1969, 419 F.2d 187; Smith v. Resor, 2 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d 141; and Elmo Division of Drive-X Company v. Dixon, 1965, 121 U.S.App.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>D.C. 113, 348 F.2d 342. Moretti had a right to file the application and have it processed in accordance with those regulations. Conversely, the Corps of Engineers as the delegated agent of the Secretary of the Army had the duty to process Moretti\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">But as it was, somewhere during administrative gestation the permit application was aborted, an event provoked by the mandatory injunction of the District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\n<em>The Buck Stopped Where?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The record reflects without dispute that the resident engineer in the Miami Beach office of the Corps forwarded the after-the-fact permit application to the Jacksonville District Engineer\u2019s office without objection.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Both he and the responsible employee in the District Engineer\u2019s office testified that in practice if the permit were a \u201croutine case\u201d in which no likely objection could be foreseen the District Engineer would grant or deny the permit.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> If controversy seemed likely or in fact developed regulations prescribed that the decision should be made by \u201chigher authority.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2Z\">Likewise, in practice, in approving the permit under usual circumstances the Jacksonville District Engineer committed to Mr. Arthur L. McKnight, Chief of the Operations Division, the authority to act for the District Engineer. That is, if the permit application, before the fact or after-the-fact, were approved by Mr. McKnight and the project was within the authority delegated to the District Engineer,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Mr. McKnight would direct the final approval of the application and issuance of the permit in the name of the District Engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">When Jacksonville received the permit application and found everything in apparent order it issued a public notice and informed the appropriate state and federal agencies<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> as required by the regulations. The Florida authorities, after some indecision, stated that they had no objection to the completion or existence of the project. The Bureau of Sports, Fisheries, and Wildlife of the Department of Interior, however, objected to the granting of the permit and requested that the Corps of Engineers refuse to issue the permit. The Secretary of the Interior \u2014 speaking through his regional field representative \u2014 has literally adopted the views of the Bureau of Sports, Fisheries, and Wildlife. The Bureau of Sports, Fisheries, and Wildlife objected on the ground that to grant the after-the-fact permit would \u201cprovide <em>official sanction to an illegal operation.\u201d </em><footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>At this point the permit granting procedure seems to have ground to a halt and left Moretti\u2019s application in a sort of limbo<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> if not in fact stranded by the ubiquitous \u201csunken object.\u201d Although standard procedure under the regulations would have been for the Jacksonville office to forward the application to Washington because of the objections of the other government agencies, nothing was done, that is, nothing was done by the Corps of Engineers on the application.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\n<em>Self Help For The Impatient?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aeq-dedup-0\">Despite the unrevoked order of the District Engineer to discontinue dredging, Moretti resumed working below the mean high tide line, apparently in early June 1971. Presumably, he simply decided that he had waited long enough for the Corps of Engineers to act on his permit and that it was time to resume the construction of Hammer Point.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The permit application had been forwarded from Miami to Jacksonville on March 4, 1971. Notice had been given by the District Engineer\u2019s office on March 17 stating that objections were due by April 16. Interior, as well as one state agency, requested a delay in the granting of the permit so that it would have time to respond adequately. Interior\u2019s objections, voiced by Bureau of Sports, Fisheries &amp; Wildlife, and echoed by the Regional Director were lodged May 3, and Moretti was informed of the objections. It does not appear that a public hearing was ever scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Rumors that Moretti had resumed work reached the Jacksonville office which instructed engineer Ross of the Miami office to investigate the situation. On July 14, 1971 he found that Moretti had resumed, and substantially completed, work on the Hammer Point project.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">\n<em>The Scene Of Action Shifts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AlAR\">Pricked by Moretti\u2019s disregard of the permit requirements the government lashed out on several fronts. An information was filed by Engineer Ross charging Moretti with a criminal violation of \u00a7 403 <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> which is outlawed by 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 406 and Moretti was arrested July 15. While Moretti was appearing for arraignment on July 30, originally set before a magistrate but taken over by the trial judge, Moretti was served with the civil complaint seeking preliminary and permanent injunction of further operations below the mean high water mark and for relief in the form of a mandatory injunction forcing Moretti to undo the fruits of his labors, all as authorized by \u00a7 406.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">After a short hearing the trial court issued a preliminary injunction and proceeded to hear the case on the merits three weeks later. The court found, as is evident from the record, that Moretti had done substantial dredging and filling without a Corps of Engineers per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>mit. The Court found the waters navigable, and determined that some of the work was done in the navigable water. The District Court ordered that the government should have all the relief it sought \u2014 -namely to have Moretti undo what he had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Moretti challenged in the District Court and challenges on appeal the proof of a number of necessary elements of the government\u2019s case under 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 403 and \u00a7 406. They are (i) whether the water in question is \u201cnavigable water of the United States,\u201d (ii) whether the Mean High Water Mark was adequately proven, (iii) whether any obstruction to navigation had been created, and (iv) whether \u00a7 406 of the Act authorized the District Court to order the removal of a land fill as a \u201cstructure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\n<em>Navigability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Florida Bay is located at the southern tip of the Florida peninsula and merges with the Gulf of Mexico on its western boundary. On the east, Florida Bay is adjacent to Biscayne Bay which leads to the Port of Miami.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The length of Florida Bay is traversed by the Intra-coastal Waterway which runs from the Gulf and enters Biscayne Bay through Florida Bay. Although the record did not reveal the precise distance of appellant\u2019s property from the Intracoastal Waterway, it is clear that it is in close proximity to this Waterway. The Coast and Geodetic Survey Chart shows that at its nearest point, the Intracoastal Waterway is less than one-half mile from Hammer Point.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">Navigability, even at a time when its requirements were more stringent, was simply a question of whether the waterway \u201cin its natural and ordinary condition affords a channel for useful commerce.\u201d The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 19 L.Ed. 999 (1871).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Accessible as it is to both the Gulf of Mexico and -Biscayne Bay, and traversed lengthwise by the Intracoastal Waterway, Florida Bay is a natural passage for commerce and easily meets even -the historical-literal test of navigability. Of course, as with most bodies of water, there comes a point where the depth of water is minimal as the bottom slopes up to the bank. But one would hardly contend that the Mississippi is any less navigable simply because a pirogue would go aground at the water\u2019s edge.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">Questioned directly as to the navigability of Florida Bay the Resident Engineer for the Corps testified unequivocally that Florida Bay is a navigable water. Indeed, if Florida Bay were unnavigable Moretti\u2019s development of his property including finger slips and canals so that his mobile home park would be a \u201clive-in marina\u201d would be incomprehensible and obviously wasteful and a deception to purchasers who expected waterborne access to the sea, not the restricted movement in a short landlocked pond.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">\n<em>Obstruction To Navigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-15\"> Moretti\u2019s argument that there was no showing of an obstruction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>navigation, and hence that one element prerequisite to relief was missing from the government\u2019s case, is unavailing. In light of Zabel v. Tabb, 5 Cir., 1970, 430 F.2d 199, 207 and United States v. Perma Paving Co., 2 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 754, any argument that the filling of navigable waters does not reduce navigable capacity of the filled waterway and thereby constitute an obstruction within the meaning of \u00a7 403 borders on the frivolous.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\n<em>Structures</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Moretti next contends that \u00a7 406 <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> grants to the. District Court only the authority to cause the removal of \u201cstructures\u201d from navigable water and that a land fill is not a structure. The meaning of \u201cstructures\u201d in this provision has often enough been the subject of litigation<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> that we have no doubt that it encompasses the land fills here in question. As the Supreme Court said in United States v. Republic Steel Corp., 1960, 362 U.S. 482, 80 S.Ct. 884, 4 L.Ed.2d 903, its decision in Sanitary District v. United States, 1925, 266 U.S. 405, 45 S.Ct. 176, 69 L.Ed. 352, is enough. In Republic Steel the Supreme Court held that accidental sedimentation which caused the filling of a navigable water constituted a structure within the meaning of \u00a7 406. This double-bottomed answer is enough for us.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\n<em>Mean High Tide Line</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">A good deal is urged about Mean High Tide Line (MHTL). Just what bearing it has at this, not the enforcement, stage is not easy to say. Everyone apparently concedes that the mean high tide line is not a precise measurement. And all concede for this case that relief sought depends on the government proving that Moretti dredged or filled bayward of MHTL. For the Corps has no power landward of it to regulate his conduct or force reconstruction of the topography<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> as it existed before he began work. The District Court agreed that that which was landward of MHTL would not, could not, and should not be affected by mandatory injunction.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">The record proof on location of MHTL took two forms. The first was on the trial. The second, as a part of the plan to be filed by Moretti outlining the method to be followed in restoring the prior condition. On the trial, the government called a civil engineer, Mr. James Glass, employed by Moretti in designing the Hammer Point project and in soliciting the after-the-fact permit from the Corps of Engineers. The MHTL was indicated on the sketch which accompanied the application for the after-the-fact permit. Engineer Glass testified that he placed the MHTL from aerial photographs <footnotemark>42</footnotemark> taken before the project got underway. The District Court accepted this determination as correct, but whether the Corps of Engineers ever did is unknown since the permit application aborted. The Resident Engineer also testified as to the location of the MHTL. He stated that normally the MHTL would be located by visual observation, which, however, would be impossible in an after-the-fact situation. The upshot of his testimony was that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>had presumed the location of the MHTL from the permit application supplied by Moretti.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Actually, the Court did not undertake to fix MHTL. His final order in a negative sense prohibited further activity bayward of it.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> And the hotly contested mandatory injunction<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> simply ordered Moretti (i) to restore the prior conditions bayward of MHTL and (ii) to file a formal plan showing in detail how the work was to be carried out.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">As a part of the formal post-decree plan Moretti included a plat prepared by Mr. Post, an engineer associated with the same firm as Mr. Glass, the engineer who drafted the after-the-fact permit application. Engineer Post\u2019s plat shows, and Moretti cannot seriously dispute, that substantial areas of excavation and refill were bayward of MHTL. If Mor-etti challenges that, there is no mark of it in the record. Since there is no indication whether the District Court approved the plan<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> it is unavoidable that the exact line may still be open to some question either in further proceedings before the Department of the Army, the District Court or both. But no action is yet before us which would call for any modification of MHTL.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\"><em>Court\u2019s Use Of Negative </em>\u2014 Affirmative <em>Injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">Putting to one side the drawing of the exact MHTL we have no doubt that the Judge had the right to reach the conclusions that he did both on jurisdiction and the operational facts. It is equally clear that in the posture of the case as it came to him and as he handled it (see notes 30 and 4, <em>supra, </em>the Court had the power to issue appropriate injunctions prohibiting any further work. This authority is drawn not only from the Court\u2019s equitable powers in carrying out the obvious policy of the Act but such relief is expressly authorized by \u00a7 406, see note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">And for the further guidance of the Court and the parties as this case now takes a new twist we have no doubt that the issuance of a mandatory injunction requiring extensive restoration op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>erations at very large expense to the developers is entirely within the Court\u2019s power as expressly mandated by the statute. Section 406 just plainly states, \u201cthe removal of any structures or parts of structures erected in violation of the provisions of the said sections may be enforced by the injunction of any district court exercising jurisdiction in any district in which such structures may exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Thus, the statute itself specifically empowers the Court to do just what has been done. We do not mean to say here that in every case involving a violation of the Rivers and Harbors Act where no permit has been obtained and an order to cease operations has been issued the Court must impose such serious sanctions. But clearly the Court has the power to do it and we perceive nothing in this record which would compel us to say that in the Chancellor\u2019s discretion he ought not to have imposed this very substantial burden upon this developer.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">But while we find ample jurisdiction, and on the record a set of facts which would otherwise authorize the stringent mandatory injunction of restoration, this part of the Court\u2019s order must be vacated to permit the further proceedings on the application for an after-the-fact permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\n<em>The Scene Shifts Again Back To The Army</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">As we have pointed out in great detail \u00a7 403 and \u00a7 406 with their complementary regulations are structured on a permit system. The statute itself is not to be read as prohibiting all such obstructions, but only those not authorized in accordance with the regulations. Those regulations prescribe also the right to seek an after-the-fact permit. Moretti has initiated this application. Through no apparent fault of his own and without his ever having withdrawn it the Corps of Engineers has either ignored the application or reached some undisclosed determination that because the United States Attorney has successfully been importuned to enter the case the Corps and the Department of the Army have no further obligation. We have held above and repeat again that this is simply not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">Since the statute and the regulations recognize that the developer has a right to seek \u2014 not necessarily obtain \u2014an after-the-fact permit and Moretti has undertaken to do this in a way not challenged for its procedural or substantive sufficiency, a Federal Judge has no power to cut off this statutory scheme and insert his judgment for that of a successive layer of experts in the Corps of Engineers, the Chief of the Engineer\u2019s office, the Department of the Army, and now, in collaboration with the other departments or agencies under environmental statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">Whatever difficulties Moretti may face in trying to persuade those authorities that he should have an after-the-fact permit he is entitled to have that application processed fairly and diligently with an opportunity as permitted under the regulations to present supporting data, facts and argument as to why such relief should be granted. Since the application is either still in the Jacksonville office or perhaps has died there, the Army somehow has to revive it, put it back on the tracks and start the machinery as contemplated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>all of the regulations and the accord between the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior and the application of all of the other environmental statutes and regulations. We do not undertake here to outline the scope and detail of those administrative proceedings. They must go on fairly as permitted by the regulations. As we read them, if there is a disposition to grant the after-the-fact permit by the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of the Army they must then consult all of the other agencies concerned with environmental factors which as specified in pertinent legislation and regulations must be brought into the picture.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">We do think, however, that as a matter of primary jurisdiction<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> it is in the administrative process that the MHTL must first be determined. For where the boundary of its authority is this elusive line, it should have the first opportunity to determine whether and to what extent the area is or is not within its jurisdiction. Federal Power Commission v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co., 1972, 406 U.S. 621, 647, 92 S.Ct. 1827, 1842, 32 L.Ed.2d 369, 389; J. M. Huber Corp. v. Denman, 5 Cir., 1966, 367 F.2d 104, and Weymouth v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co., 5 Cir., 1966, 367 F.2d 84 (sequeled in Mobil Oil Corp. v. FPC, 1972, 149 U.S.App.D.C. 310, 463 F.2d 256, cert. denied, 406 U.S. 976, 92 S.Ct. 2409, 32 L.Ed.2d 676, the D.C. Circuit reversed the FPC).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">This line limits the jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers both negatively and affirmatively, and inescapably they must determine this as a part of the application now pending. Whether in the administrative process the agency should rely to a great extent upon the record and findings of the Court below is a matter for initial determination by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Of course the action or non-action of the Department of the Army is judicially reviewable under the Administrative Procedures Act of 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 702, 704 (Supp. V 1970). This is precisely what occurred in Zabel v. Tabb, <em>supra, </em>and Bankers Life and Casualty Company v. Village of North Palm Beach, 5 Cir., 1972, 469 F.2d 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\"><em>The Scene Shifts Again </em>\u2014 Back <em>To The Court Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">The upshot is that we remand the case for the Court to keep it actively on its docket. The prohibitory injunctions are to remain in full force pending final determination in the administrative proceedings and any appeals, administrative or judicial, therefrom. The mandatory injunction is vacated, subject to being reinstated on a proper showing after completion of the administrative proceedings and any appeal therefrom to the extent that the after-the-fact permit application does not authorize any or all of the work bayward of MHTL. Of course the Court is authorized to grant such interim relief as might be necessary on a proper showing to prevent further incursions into nature\u2019s domain growing out of inaction either in maintenance or in nonrestoration because of the stay which we have heretofore issued.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">As a tag end, also for the guidance of the parties and the Court on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>proceedings on remand and after completion of the administrative process, we reject the contention of Moretti that a District Court, as would an administrative agency, is required to obtain an impact statement and go through the procedures set forth in the intricate structure of environmental statutes and regulations where it is otherwise appropriate for an injunction to be issued on equitable principles or because of statutory standards or policies. The Judge should, of course, be conscious of the ecological factors and in many cases it would be appropriate, and in some it might be essential, that he call in the appropriate agencies, state and federal.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> But the Judge does not have to involve himself in the sometimes impossible task of writing an impact statement that will satisfy all.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Vacated in part and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-12\">.

It was discovered in Jacksonville that the application apparently did not show one of the channels that Moretti had dredged. He ac-knowleged this deficiency in a letter to the Corps and although it appears to have been one of the problems in granting of the permit it was a mere technical imperfection which from all appearances could have been easily corrected.

The defendants are directed to outline in this plan the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"amv-dedup-0\">(a) The equipment to be used in the removal of said material;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"art-dedup-0\">(b) The procedures to be taken to safeguard Florida Bay; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_q\">(c) The estimated time requested for compliance with this order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay2\">Upon approval of this plan by the Court, defendants are directed to immediately begin removal of said fill.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b498-20\">. Moretti filed a plan calling for extensive removal and refilling but then sought supersedeas to the injunction while perfecting his appeal from the outcome below. The Court required supersedeas in the amount of $1,000,000 which Moretti was unable to meet. However, the enforcement of the injunction was stayed by the granting of a temporary emergency stay by this Court, which has remained and is still in effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\">. Although we think this is a matter for initial determination in the further administrative proceedings which we require, one of the things which Moretti emphasizes that makes the result so harsh is that his is just one of a number of like projects which had therefore been either approved by the Engineers or to which they raised no objection. This throws in a sharp conflict the claim of equal protection \u2014 or perhaps more accurately an equal right to violate the law \u2014 a sometime facet of equal protection which is today a very appealing claim, on the one hand, and the incessant demand from environmentalists that what has gone on in the past can no longer be tolerated and the time has come to start cleaning up no matter how much it hurts, on the other. <em>Cf., </em>Zabel v. Tabb, 5 Cir., 1970, 430 F.2d 199, note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b500-6\">. It might be argued that the Army need not consult anyone if after appropriate hearing it decides on its own that no permit should be granted on the theory that there is no \u201cimpact\u201d on the environment if it is denied. We have, however, questioned this narrow reading of \u201cimpact\u201d, although in quite a different context. <em>See, </em>Hiram Clarke Civic Club, Inc. v. Lynn, 5 Cir., 1973, 476 F.2d 421; and <em>cf; </em>Save Our Ten Acres, et al. v. Kreger, 5 Cir., 1973, 472 F.2d 463.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b500-13\">. This Circuit has \u2014 we think with wisdom \u2014been cautious not to trample the primary jurisdiction of administrative agencies. See A.T.A. of Texas v.
