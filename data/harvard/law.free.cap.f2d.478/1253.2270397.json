width=\"377\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-16\">Appellant is The National Association of Blue Cross Plans, the plans associated with which are engaged in underwriting the expense of medical care under the trade name and service mark \u201cBLUE SHIELD,\u201d and it is the owner of registrations covering the collective service mark BLUE SHIELD,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a service mark comprising a representation of a blue shield,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a collective service mark comprising a blue shield with a caduceus thereon,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a collective service mark comprising a shield (no color claimed) with a caduceus,'<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> all essentially for underwriting medical care on a prepayment basis, and of the mark THE BLUE SHIELD with a representation of a shield with a caduceus interposed between \u201cBlue\u201d and \u201cShield\u201d for newspaper and news releases issued monthly.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1322-17\">Appellant\u2019s priority is uncontested. It states that the issue is \u201cwhether mattresses are so related to \u2018Health\u2019 and \u2018Doctors\u2019 that applicant\u2019s use of the mark it seeks to register is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception.\u201d It further charges that applicant\u2019s mark \u201cfalsely suggests a sponsorship and/or endorsement by\u201d appellant. The board did not find either a likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception under 15 U. S.C. \u00a7 1052(d), or that appellee\u2019s mark falsely suggests a connection with opposer within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>Appellant introduced evidence that it advertises the services rendered under its trademarks, with its 1967 budget for advertising amounting to $436,000. Its vice president stated that local plans spend approximately $7,500,000 to $10,000,000 a year on advertising but did not give any particular factual foundation for the statement. The evidence shows that the Blue Shield Plans have a total enrollment of 62,300,000 persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-4\">The issue turns, however, on appellant\u2019s efforts to show, through testimony of its vice-president, that mattresses bear a relationship to its services because they constitute a health care product. The board summarized the testimony on that point as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-5\">(1) The witness is aware that in advertisements by mattress companies, they speak of comfort but they also allude to the healthful nature of their mattress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-6\">(2) The witness knows that Sealy Posturpedic Mattress Company exhibits at the annual meetings of the American Medical Association.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">The board found no documentation of the first item. As to the second, it noted that the witness failed to provide a responsive answer to a question whether the mattress displayed at the AMA meeting were those sold strictly to hospitals or were for use by the general public in their homes as well. It found that the proofs were not persuasive that mattresses for household use are health care products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-8\">Before us, appellee cites several decisions of the Commissioner of Patents, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board and the courts showing that trademarks which it considers related to health or used a form of the word \u201chealth\u201d have been applied to mattresses. As an example, one of the cases is Sleepmaster Products Co. v. American Auto-Felt Co., 241 F.2d 738, 44 CCPA 784 (1957) wherein the mark \u201cHEALTHMASTER\u201d was involved. Another ease, The Spring-Air Co. v. National Mattress Co., 145 USPQ 741 (TTAB 1965), involved \u201cHealth Center.\u201d Appellant also cites the apparently unpublished decision in Mayo v. National Mattress Co., No. 1249 (S.D.Ill.1934), in which it was decided that the defendant\u2019s use of \u201cDr. Mayo\u201d on its mattresses violated the rights which the famed Mayo Brothers had in their name. Finally, at oral argument, appellant asked this court to take judicial notice that mattress sellers allude to the healthful nature of their mattresses in their advertising, sometimes stating that certain mattresses were designed with the aid of doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-10\">Even accepting appellant\u2019s contentions concerning the healthful nature of mattresses and the advertising practices utilized in that industry, we are not satisfied that mattresses are sufficiently related to health, medical care or doctors so that use of the marks before us would lead to a likelihood of confusion or false suggestion. As appellee points out, the <em>Mayo </em>case is not controlling here, for in that case there were actual misrepresentations made that there was a connection between the mattresses sold and the Mayo brothers or the Mayo Clinic. We also note that the differences between the shields used by appellant and appel-lee, appellee\u2019s shield having initials rather than the caduceus associated with the medical profession, would tend to dispel any possibility of false suggestion at least to some degree. In sum, despite the fact that appellant\u2019s marks are very strong in their field, we find no basis for concluding that use of appellee\u2019s mark for mattresses for household use would be likely to result in confusion, mistake or deception or would falsely suggest a connection with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-11\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1322-18\">. 368 U.S.P.Q. 380 (1970) ; see also In re Standard Mattress Co., 153 U.S.P.Q. 864 (T.T.A.B.1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1322-19\">.

The marks are likely to be spoken at least as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>much as seen, making the shield of little effect.
