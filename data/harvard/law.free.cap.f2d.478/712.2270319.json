His motion for a judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, for a new trial was denied by the district court, and he was sentenced to ten-to-fifteen years in prison with a special three year parole term in addition thereto. 19 V.I.C. \u00a7 604(b)(1)(A). This appeal followed and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">A brief summary of the evidence is appropriate. On October 6, 1971, the Joint Narcotics Strike Force on St. Croix employed one Carlos Encarnaci\u00f3n to purchase narcotics from suspected pushers and to be available as a witness against them at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Detective Jose Perez, head of the St. Croix Strike Force, testified that Encarnaci\u00f3n was informed on October 8, 1971 that he was to attempt to make a buy from one of four men, including the defendant, the next night during a Puerto Rican and Cruzan Friendship Day celebration at a lagoon near Christiansted. At about 8:00 p. m. on October 9, Encarnaci\u00f3n was strip searched by the police and given fifty dollars. He was then driven to the lagoon where he saw Cruz whom he knew from a methadone program which they both attended. According to En-carnaci\u00f3n, he approached Cruz who was with a woman and said \u201chello, how is everything,\u201d whereupon Cruz asked him if he wanted to buy any drugs. Encarna-ci\u00f3n responded \u201cyes\u201d, and he and the defendant went into a parking lot where Encarnaci\u00f3n purchased five decks of heroin for fifty dollars. After smoking a marijuana cigarette with Cruz, En-carnaci\u00f3n walked back to where Perez was waiting and gave him the five heroin decks. Encarnaci\u00f3n was then taken a short distance away and was again strip searched with nothing being found. Patrolman Jackson, who trailed Encar-naci\u00f3n at the lagoon, testified that he observed the transaction with Cruz but could not see how much money changed hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">The defendant admitted selling heroin to Encarnaci\u00f3n, but he argued at trial that he was illegally entrapped into doing so. According to Cruz, on the day before the sale he, Encarnaci\u00f3n and a friend named Tomas Robles met after their methadone program and decided to go to a parade ground to smoke marijuana. Encarnaci\u00f3n shared some marijuana with them, and then he asked the defendant to get him some heroin because methadone was not helping him. Cruz testified that at first he refused and told Encarnaci\u00f3n that he did not want to be involved with drugs any more, but that he eventually agreed to do. it after En-carnaci\u00f3n kept saying how \u201cbad\u201d he felt. Cruz said that he then went to a pusher who gave him some heroin on credit, and that he sold his heroin to Encarnaci\u00f3n' without profit for twenty-five dollars. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Robles was a witness for the defense and testified that on the day before the sale he heard Encarnaci\u00f3n ask Cruz to get drugs for him. Mrs. Cruz also testified that Encarnaci\u00f3n approached her husband at the lagoon and asked him \u201cdid you bring the tin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">As rebuttal, the government recalled Encarnaci\u00f3n who denied having requested the defendant to get heroin for him on the day before the sale. In addition, detective Perez was recalled and he testified that it was his decision to have Encarnaci\u00f3n attempt to make a purchase at the lagoon on October 9 and that En-carnaci\u00f3n was not informed of this plan until between nine and ten o\u2019clock the <em>night before.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Defendant\u2019s first contention on this appeal is that he was deprived of a fair and impartial jury trial since a majority of the jurors had also been jurors in at least one of several previous narcotics cases involving the same informer, Carlos Encarnaci\u00f3n.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the jury voir dire, the defendant made two oral motions which were denied by the district court: first, to disqualify for cause those members of the jury array who had served in any prior trial where Encarnaci\u00f3n had testified; and second, to disqualify for cause those members of the array who had served in either of two very recent narcotics trials where Encarnaci\u00f3n had testified and where the defendants had been found guilty. The rationale behind both of these motions was the defendant\u2019s belief that jurors who had sat on such earlier cases had already formed an impression about the credibility of Encarnaci\u00f3n. Prior to these motions, the district court had determined which members of the array had participated in the earlier cases, and both the court and the defendant\u2019s attorney had asked them collectively whether they could judge the evidence in this case without reference to any other trial. Only one person indicated that his judgment would be influenced by what he had heard before, and he did not sit in this case. Although the defendant claims that it was prejudicial error to deny his motions, we recently decided in Government of the Virgin Islands v. De Jesus, 476 F.2d 771 (3d Cir. 1973),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Government of the Virgin Islands v. Hendricks, 476 F.2d 776 (3d Cir. 1973) that the mere fact that a juror has sat on a prior case involving similar issues and some of the same witnesses does not, absent some showing of resulting prejudice, disqualify the juror. Since there was no showing of actual prejudice here, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the district court erred in its rulings on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">A second argument advanced by the defendant is that the trial judge wrongfully denied his motion for a mistrial after detective Perez testified on redirect examination that it would be impossible to use Encarnaci\u00f3n again because he would be shot. The specific question and answer occurred as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-11\">Prosecutor: \u201cDetective Perez, why is it that you would not use Encarna-ci\u00f3n again?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AraX\">Perez: \u201cIt is impossible to use Mr. Encarnaci\u00f3n again because of what is going to happen, he is going to get shot, he is going to get killed on the street.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">The defense immediately objected to this answer, and the trial judge ordered it struck from the record and cautioned the jury to disregard it. The defense then asked for a side bar conference and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>moved for a mistrial, but the trial judge refused to grant the motion on the ground that he did not believe that the answer was overly prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">On this appeal, the defendant claims that detective Perez\u2019 statement caused him irreparable harm and that the trial judge therefore abused his discretion in denying a mistrial. We disagree. During cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Perez at some length about the number of cases on which Encarna-' cion had worked, the amount he was paid, and whether or not he would be used in the future as an informer. On redirect, the government asked Perez to explain why Encarnaci\u00f3n would not be used again. The wording of his response was unfortunate, but it made no reference to the defendant in any way. In view of this, and considering the fact that the jury already knew from the cross-examination that Encarnaci\u00f3n was an informer in at least seven different narcotics investigations, we do not think that Perez\u2019 reply prejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. Consequently, we conclude that the trial judge\u2019s curative instructions were proper and that a mistrial was not necessary. <em>See, e. g., </em>Leonard v. United States, 386 F.2d 423 (5th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The defendant next urges that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction since he established a defense of entrapment which was not refuted beyond a reasonable doubt by the government. Since the jury returned a verdict of guilty, it is fundamental that we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>E. g., </em>United States v. Miles, 468 F.2d 482 (3d Cir. 1972); United States v. Hamilton, 457 F.2d 95 (3d Cir. 1972); United States v. De Cavalcante, 440 F.2d 1264 (3d Cir. 1971). After reviewing the record, we think that the jury could easily have disbelieved the defendant\u2019s story and found no entrapment. The defendant does not appear to have been a persuasive witness, and his testimony lacked credibility in several significant respects. For example, he insisted that he and Encarnaci\u00f3n had been friends since they were \u201csmall,\u201d but he did not know where Encarnaci\u00f3n lived as a youth and had never been to his house. Another notable inconsistency was the defendant\u2019s testimony on direct examination that he got drugs for Encarna-ci\u00f3n because he looked \u201cbad\u201d or \u201csick,\u201d while on cross-examination he stated that Encarnaci\u00f3n was \u201cnot so sick like a junkie\u201d and admitted that he procured the heroin and sold it to Encarnaci\u00f3n because he was a \u201cgood friend.\u201d In addition, detective Perez testified that he did not inform Encarnaci\u00f3n of the plan to attempt a purchase at the lagoon until between 9:00 p. m. and 10:00 p. m. the night before, yet the defendant said that Encarnaci\u00f3n approached him earlier on that same day. In the absence of any significant evidence to support the defendant\u2019s story, and taking all the evidence into consideration, we conclude that the jury could find that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that no entrapment occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">The next contention raised by the defendant concerns the district court\u2019s charge on entrapment. Defendant\u2019s requested instruction number eight<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was specifically approved in Pratti v. United States, 389 F.2d 660 (9th Cir. 1968), which held that when entrapment is an issue, the jury must be charged that the burden of showing that there is no en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>trapment is on the government. Instead of giving this instruction, the district court charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-4\">\u201cIn determining whether any fact or issue has been proven by a preponderance of the evidence in the case the Jury may, unless otherwise instructed \u2014and I do not otherwise instruct you\u2014 the Jury may consider the testimony of the witnesses regardless of who may have called them and all exhibits received in evidence. If then the Jury should find <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>from the evidence in the ease that before anything at all occurred respecting the alleged offense involved in the case, the accused was ready and willing to commit a crime, such as charged in the information, whenever oppoi'tunity was offered and that the Government agents did no more than offer the opportunity, the accused is not entitled to the defense of unlawful entrapment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\"><em>\u201cOn the other hand, if the Jury should find from the evidence in this case that the accused had no previous intention or purpose to commit any offense of the character here charged and did so only because he was induced or persuaded by some agent- of the Government </em>\u2014 and <em>in this case it would have been the informant </em>\u2014 then <em>the defense of unlawful entrapment is a good defense and the Jury should acquit the accused.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">In Notaro v. United States, 363 F.2d 169 (9th Cir. 1966), the case upon which <em>Pratti </em>is based, the Ninth Circuit held that an instruction almost identical to the one above constituted reversible error because it could have created the erroneous impression in some jurors\u2019 minds that the accused carried the burden of proof as to the positive elements of an entrapment defense. Moreover, the <em>Notaro </em>court said that it must be made clear to the jury that the accused is \u201centitled to be acquitted if, from the evidence, the jury, because of the entertainment of reasonable doubt, should be unable to \u2018find\u2019 that the necessary elements of the defense had not been excluded.\u201d 363 F.2d at 176. This must be made explicit even though the jury is properly informed in a general instruction as to the burden of proof which rests upon the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">Although <em>Notaro </em>has not been specifically adopted by this Circuit, we would follow it and reverse the district court here if the defendant had timely objected to the court\u2019s charge as required by Rule 30, Fed.R.Crim.P.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While the defendant acknowledges that he did not object to the entrapment charge after it was read to the jury, he argues that there was no point in doing so since he had already made his objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>tions known in chambers. Aside from the fact that we can find no in-chambers record to support defendant\u2019s claim, we cannot permit Rule 80 to be circumvented in this way. If on appeal a party intends to assert errors in the charge, he must lay the proper foundation by taking exceptions in the trial court before the jury leaves to begin its deliberations. Otherwise, Rule 30 precludes us from considering his arguments unless plain error exists. Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">The defendant next asserts that it was in fact plain error for the district court not to charge in conformance with <em>Notaro. </em>This argument, however, was rejected in United States v. Conversano, 412 F.2d 1143 (3d Cir. 1969), where this court, in the face of a similar entrapment charge not excepted to, declined to invoke the plain error rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Accord, </em>United States v. Levin, 443 F.2d 1101 (8th Cir. 1971), and Esposito v. United States, 436 F.2d 603 (9th Cir. 1970). Since we believe that the present entrapment charge, if taken as a whole, did not mislead the jury, we see no reason to depart from our position in <em>Conversano. </em>Consequently, we find that the defendant has not established that the district court committed plain error in refusing to give his requested instruction number eight.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">In his reply brief, the defendant makes the additional argument that the district court\u2019s charge on entrapment was improper because it contained the phrases \u201clawful entrapment\u201d and \u201cunlawful entrapment.\u201d Since the defendant did not object to the court\u2019s charge on this point, and since he requested an instruction with the same phrases, he can only prevail if the use of these phrases constituted plain error. We conclude that it did not. Defendant relies on United States v. Hayes, 441 F.2d 542 (10th Cir. 1971), where the Tenth Circuit found that a trial judge committed plain error in instructing a jury regarding a concept of \u201clawful\u201d versus \u201cunlawful\u201d entrapment. <em>Hayes </em>is distinguishable from the present case, however, because in <em>Hayes </em>the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>failed to follow earlier Tenth Circuit decisions which had held that it was erroneous to use the word \u201cunlawful\u201d preceding entrapment in a jury charge. Martinez v. United States, 373 F.2d 810 (10th Cir. 1967), and Garcia v. United States, 373 F.2d 806 (10th Cir. 1967). In the Third Circuit, on the other hand, there are no such precedents, and there is even dicta approving the \u201clawful-unlawful\u201d distinction. United States v. Laverick, 348 F.2d 708 (3d Cir. 1965). Consequently, although we believe that it would be preferable to avoid phrases like \u201clawful entrapment\u201d and \u201cunlawful entrapment\u201d when charging a jury, we do not think that their use amounted to plain error so as to warrant consideration in the absence of a timely objection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Defendant next urges that the sentence which he received \u2014 ten to fifteen years in prison plus a special three year parole term \u2014 was excessive and disproportionate to the offense. While this sentence is a long one, it is within the limits determined by the legislature and, therefore, not subject to review here. Government of the Virgin Islands v. Hendricks, 476 F.2d 776 at p. 780 (3d Cir. 1973), and the cases cited therein. We note, however, that defendant may apply under F.R.Crim.P. 35 for a reduction of sentence after the issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The defendant also argues on this appeal that the district court improperly admitted the testimony of the Assistant Attorney General of the Virgin Islands and that a conviction cannot be obtained on the testimony of a convicted forger (Encarnaci\u00f3n) who has other felony charges pending against him. After considering the record, the briefs and oral argument, we reject these contentions as being without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-10\">. Encarnaci\u00f3n was a convicted forger who was apparently also under indictment for at least two other felonies during the time he was working for the Strike Force. He had been a drug addict for several years, and it is unclear from the evidence whether he was still an addict in the fall of 1971. He was hospitalized for a heroin overdose about three months before this trial began, but Dr. De Ohabert, head of the methadone treatment program which Encarnaci\u00f3n had been attending since early 1969, testified that Encarnaci\u00f3n was detoxified and not an addict at the time of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\">. In his brief at 5-7, defendant also contends that lie moved the court to disqualify those members of the panel who had sat on recent narcotics cases involving the same police officers as well as the same informer. Our examination of the transcript of the jury voir dire reveals that defendant\u2019s motion in this regard referred only to the informer and not to the police officers. Transcript of the Voir Dire at 15-16. Consequently, we have limited our discussion to the motion that was actually made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-15\">. This case was decided with Government of the Virgin Islands v. Williams, 476 F.2d 771 (3d Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\">. This instruction stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-7\">\u201cA COMPLETE DEFENSE to the charges is that of entrapment. It is the DUTY of the Government to satisfy you\u2014 BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT\u2014 that the defendant was not entrapped into committing the acts which, if there were no entrapment, would constitute the offense (s).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aca-dedup-0\">\u201cIf the Government fails to convince you <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that the defendant was not entrapped into committing the offense (s), then you must find the defendant not guilty on both counts.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b785-6\">. It should be noted that the Devitt and Blaekmar instruction on entrainment now conforms with the <em>Notaro </em>approach. See the last two paragraphs of 1 E. Devitt and C. Blaekmar, Federal Jury Practice &amp; Instructions, \u00a7 13.13 (2d ed. 1970), which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-7\">\u201cIf, then, the jury should find beyond a reasonable doubt from the evidence in the case that, before anything at all occurred respecting the alleged offense involved in this case, the defendant was ready and willing to commit crimes such as charged in the indictment, whenever opportunity was afforded, and that Government officers or their agents did no more than offer the opportunity, then the jury should find that the defendant is not a victim of entrapment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9A\">\u201cOn the other hand, if the evidence in the case should leave you with a reasonable doubt whether the defendant had the previous intent or purpose to commit any offense of the character here charged, and did so only because he was induced or persuaded by some officer or agent of the Government, then it is your duty to acquit him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8i\">This is the type of instruction which should be used in the future by district courts in this circuit when entrapment is offered as a defense. <em>See generally </em>United States v. Silver, 457 F.2d 1217 (3d Cir. 1972), which deals comprehensively with other aspects of a proper entrapment charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b786-5\">.

However, no point for charge was submitted concerning it <em>nor was any. objection made to the charge of the court at the close thereof, </em>and we see no reason, under these circumstances, to invoke the Plain Error Rule, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), and, accordingly, <em>absent any objection by the defendant, no substantial rights of his were affected as to warrant consideration without such objection. </em>Lopez v.
