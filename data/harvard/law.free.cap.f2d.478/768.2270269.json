We reverse and award a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">At trial, the government\u2019s chief witness was John Gordon Moore. He testified that he was tricked into coming to defendant\u2019s labor camp and once there he was beaten by defendant and forced to work against his will. He testified also that he was given no written statement of his earnings or of the money withheld from his earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">Although Moore\u2019s testimony was corroborated in large part by a number of other witnesses, defendant testified in his own behalf and directly controverted Moore. Defendant also offered extensive testimony to show that his camp was not fenced, that there were no guards, that there were no locks, and that farm laborers, including Moore, were free to come and go without restraint. Although there was clearly sufficient evidence from which a jury might conclude that defendant was guilty, the evidence was sharply conflicting and much of the weight of the government\u2019s evidence depended upon the credibility of Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-19\">When Moore was cross-examined, defendant\u2019s counsel sought to interrogate him about convictions of crimes involving moral turpitude. In fact, Moore had been convicted of six felonies over the years 1943 to I960.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Five were prior to 1954. The record neither reflects their nature nor the punishment imposed. The district court ruled, in response to an inquiry by counsel, that counsel could not inquire about more than one conviction and could not inquire into the nature of even that one. In accordance with the ruling, counsel asked Moore, \u201cHave you been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude?\u201d and Moore responded, \u201cYes.\u201d A motion for a new trial, based in part on undue limitation on the opportunity to impeach Moore, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-20\">\u201cPrior criminal convictions for felonies or misdemeanors involving moral turpitude ordinarily constitute material impeaching evidence,\u201d was our statement in United States v. Hildreth, 387 F.2d 328, 329 (4 Cir. 1967). Of course, in that case, we also said that the trial court has discretion to limit such impeachment, especially of a defendant, when there is reason to apprehend that \u201cthe prejudicial effect of the earlier convictions . . . will outweigh their possible probative force in impeaching credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>329.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-22\">In no sense to depart from this holding, we think that the district court exceeded its discretion in the instant case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Moore was not a defendant. His credibility was a major issue in the case. The district court may properly have refused to permit interrogation about convictions remote in time, depending upon their nature and the extent to which they involved dishonesty or false statements. This is a matter we cannot decide on this record. But we do not think that, having exercised his discretion to permit impeachment on the most recent conviction, the district court should have refused to permit interrogation about the time and place of conviction, the nature of the offense, and the punishment imposed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Reversed; new trial awarded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-14\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1584.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b837-15\">. 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2045(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b837-23\">.
