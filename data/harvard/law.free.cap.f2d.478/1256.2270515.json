The merchandise was held properly classifiable as other halogenated hydrocarbons under item 429.48, the claimed classification. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-11\">The following stipulation sets forth the salient facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-12\">1. The imported merchandise is a liquid under pressure composed of methyl bromide (68.6%), petroleum hydrocarbons (30.0%) and chloropi-crin (1.4%) except in those instances where the merchandise is entered in small cans in which case they were composed of methyl bromide (98%) and chloropicrin (2%).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-13\">2. Its uses are those comprised within the term \u201cpesticide,\u201d as defined in TSUS schedule 4, part 1, sub-part C, headnote 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-15\">3. The petroleum hydrocarbons serve only as a diluent and/or propellant, are not an active pesticidal ingredient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-16\">4. In these importations, the chlo-ropicrin is used in this formulation as a warning agent to alert people by its pervasive, unpleasant aroma, in the event of leakage of the methyl bromide, which is poisonous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-17\">5. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-18\">6. Methyl bromide is a halogenated hydrocarbon, but not one described in any of the TSUS items 429.20-429.47, inclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1325-19\">Stipulation 5 relating to the origin of the chloropicrin was stricken at trial. But the presumption that the chloropi-crin involved was of benzenoid origin has not been disputed, appellee having offered no proof as to the actual derivation. Thus the chloropicrin falls within the scope of subpart A or B of Schedule 4, Part 1. The record also establishes that chloropicrin is capable in itself of serving as a pesticide but not in concentrations as low as 1 or 2%.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-20\"> Appellant\u2019s basic contention is that the presence of the chloropicrin cannot be ignored in the classification of the methyl bromide products. It is urged that the Customs Court committed reversible error in treating the merchandise as if it were a single compound. Proper recognition of the presence of the benzenoid component in the mixtures is said to require classification under the original classification, item 405.15 or, alternatively, under 409.00 as \u201cmixtures * * * in part of\u201d a benzenoid pesticide product provided for in sub-part C of Schedule 4, Part 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-21\">The Customs Court agreed that minute quantities of a substance could have a bearing on classification, but added that \u201cthis should only be the case when these substances are playing a \u2018substantial\u2019 part.\u201d A two-sided test encompassing both a quantitative and a functional approach was set forth as the guide for determining whether the presence of a particular component makes the impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>tation \u201cin part\u201d of that material. Adapting the test to this case, the court took the position that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-4\">* * * the provision for products in part of benzenoid origin will govern an article which contains any amount of a beneznoid [sic] ingredient which plays a part in the article\u2019s principal function or an article containing a benzenoid ingredient which does not play a part in the article\u2019s principal function but is nevertheless present in commercially meaningful quantities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">The court went on to point out that the principal function of the importation was as a pesticide while the chloropicrin in the small quantities employed herein served only as a warning agent. Accordingly it concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-7\">The chloropicrin in the importation does not serve a pesticidal purpose nor is it present in quantities which would warrant considering it a meaningful importation of material of benzenoid origin. It follows that neither the functional test nor the quantitative test justifies the classification of the importation on the basis of the ehloro-picrin being of benzenoid origin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-8\">The alternative classification was dismissed under analogous reasoning, the court stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-9\">An ingredient of benzenoid origin, which does not play a part in the principal function of the mixture and is not present in commercially meaningful quantities, does not make the mixture one which is within the intended scope of the above provision for mixtures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-14\">Cases wherein an ingredient added solely for safety of transportation or as a preservative or binder was disregarded for tariff purposes were also cited as support for ignoring the chloropicrin component of the mixtures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-15\">Appellant contends that the Customs Court should have recognized that a statutory definition exists for the language \u201cin part of,\u201d rendering the functional-quantitative test based on case law improper and unnecessary. We agree that General Headnote 9(f) (iv) defines \u201cin part of\u201d as containing \u201ca significant quantity of the named material,\u201d with the <em>de minimus </em>rule being applicable. The interpretation, however, of \u201csignificant\u201d and the determination of the corresponding scope of the <em>de minimus </em>exception remain open.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-16\">Appellant urges that headnotes 2 and 3 to Schedule 4<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 23are sufficient to make clear the meaning of <em>de minimus </em>with regard to the specific area of chemical compounds and mixtures. It is true that only impurities are positively excluded in headnote 2(a). But we cannot agree that such impurities represent the full extent of the <em>de minimus </em>exception insofar as \u201cmixtures\u201d defined in Headnote 3 are concerned and that the general statutory plan permits no further qualifications as to \u201csignificant\u201d quantities of a mixture component. Although a basic Congressional intent to assess mixtures at the highest rate applicable to any component material is evident from a review of Schedule 4, this does not nullify the requirement that a component be present in a \u201csignificant quantity\u201d to render the mixture \u201cin part of\u201d that component. Such a limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>is in full accord with the statement in the Tariff Classification Study, Submitting Report, November 15, 1960, Vol. I at 14, that where the term \u201cin part of\u201d is used in the new schedules the \u201cintention is that the component material be present in commercially significant amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">The real issue, therefore, lies in whether the chloropicrin component of the present importations was in fact present in \u201ccommercially significant amount.\u201d Appellant strongly contends that this intentionally admixed ingredient, which serves a useful purpose, cannot properly be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">We find no error in the dual test employed by the Customs Court to determine whether the methyl bromide mixtures were to be considered \u201cin part of\u201d chloropicrin for tariff purposes. The quantitative approach was set forth in E. Fougera &amp; Co. v. United States, 49 Treas.Dec. 986, C.D. 41632 (1926), wherein \u201cin part\u201d was equated with \u201ca substantial part in a commercial sense.\u201d The factual distinction drawn by the Customs Court in Northam Warren Corp. v. United States, 65 Cust.Ct. 584, C.D. 4142 (1970), that the minute quantity of coal tar derivative in <em>Fougera </em>did not participate in the primary functional role, has been approved by this court. Id. v. Id., No. 5455, 475 F.2d 647, 60 CCPA \u2014, C.A.D. 1092 (1973). From this arises the exception for quantitatively insignificant amounts which nonetheless are present in sufficient quantity to perform a part in the primary function of the article. It is true both tests were developed in the interpretation of early tariff schedules. In view of the continuation of the language \u201cin part\u201d in the TSUS and the previously mentioned intention as to its import, however, this dual approach remains viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-10\">The only remaining question is whether the Customs Court erred in disregarding the chloropicrin on the importation here involved, on the basis of this quantitative-functional test. No argument has been made that the 1.4-2% of this ingredient is quantitatively significant. Instead it is stressed that the ingredient has been intentionally added for a specific purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-13\">It is agreed, however, that the <em>primary </em>function of the merchandise is to act as a pesticide. The function of the chloropicrin in these importations, on the other hand, is to act as a warning agent. Appellant's own witness acknowledged that a 2% concentration of chloropicrin would only function as a warning agent and that \u201cprobably about 15 per cent\u201d would be necessary to improve the pesticidal efficiency of the mixture. Thus we must agree with the holding of the Customs Court that methyl bromide compositions wherein the chloropicrin ingredient is not pesticidally active are not properly classified under 405.15 as a pesticide \u201cobtained, derived or manufactured * * * in part\u201d from a benzenoid ingredient or under 409.00 as a mixture \u201cin part of\u201d a benzenoid pesticide product. The chlo-ropicrin falls within the scope of the <em>de minimus </em>exception for tariff purposes. Classification of the merchandise under item 429.48 on the basis of its methyl bromide content is more in line with the Congressional intent with respect to \u201cin part\u201d provisions of the TSUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-14\">Appellant additionally argues that the governing headnotes of Schedule 4 create a specific exclusion of all benzenoid chemicals from item 429.48 in the same manner as in the case of Varsity Watch Co. v. United States, 34 CCPA 155, C.A.D. 359 (1947), aff\u2019g Id. v. Id., 17 Cust.Ct. 24, C.D. 1015 (1946). In <em>Varsity Watch </em>this court determined that it was the Congressional intention that all metallic watch cases be embraced within paragraph 367(f) of the Tariff Act of 1930 and that any purposeful inclusion of gold, regardless of the quantity, necessitated classification under a higher duty rate as being \u201cin part of\u201d gold rather than as \u201cnot containing gold.\u201d In the present situation the benzenoid provisions with their high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>protective rates also preclude classification elsewhere, if the product is described therein. But we cannot reconcile the expressed intention with respect to the meaning of \u201cin part\u201d in the TSUS with the restricted concept that any purposeful addition of a benzenoid product, be it to preserve life or to enhance salability, must render the article \u201cin part\u201d of that product. The distinction previously drawn on the basis of the primary functional role of the merchandise better satisfies that which we consider to be the true intent of the language of the TSUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">The decision and judgment of the Customs Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1326-10\">.
