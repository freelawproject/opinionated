Accordingly, the only issue to be determined is whether the board erred in granting the petition to cancel appellant\u2019s registration because the resemblances between the two marks are such that concurrent use would be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-14\">The board, in granting the petition to cancel the registration, had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ara-dedup-0\">Respondent also argues that in determining the issue presented herein consideration must be given to the fact that the mark disclosed in its registration is a composite one. On the other hand the term \u201cZERO KING\u201d, which is visually the most prominent feature of the mark, creates a commercial impression separate and apart from the letters \u201cBR\u201d, and, such being the case, if this term is found to be confusingly similar to petitioner\u2019s mark \u201cTHERMO KING\u201d, then respondent\u2019s mark in its entirety must be so regarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-15\">In this regard, while the literal meanings of the word \u201cTHERMO\u201d and \u201cZERO\u201d are dissimilar, when used in association with the word \u201cKING\u201d for transport refrigeration equipment, they impart to the marks as a whole a somewhat similar, if not readily definable, suggestive connotation. On the record presented in this case, we entertain considerable doubt that the marks here involved can be contemporaneously used for the specific goods without a likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception, and such doubt must be resolved in favor of petitioner, the prior user.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1312-16\">It is, of course, appellant\u2019s contention that concurrent use of the marks in question is not likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception. It argues that the board should have considered the mark THERMO KING to be a weak one and entitled to a limited scope of protection. As proof of this, appellant cited numerous existing third-party registrations using the words \u201cThermo\u201d and \u201cKing\u201d and particularly relies upon the latter since KING is the word common to both marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-17\">Appellant also asserts that the board improperly dissected its mark and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>not consider the marks as a whole. In its view, the prefatory portion is legible and clear, would be seen by a purchaser, and \u201cobviously refers to Bill Rivers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-4\">Appellant also protests that, contrary to the board\u2019s opinion, ZERO and THERMO have substantially different meanings which impart to the respective marks distinct commercial impressions which would mitigate against likelihood of confusion. To demonstrate this, it cited the following definitions from \u201cWebster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary\u201d 1963:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-5\">THERM on page 916</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-6\">\u201cany of several units of quantity of heat, heat\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-7\">ZERO on page 1039</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-8\">\u201cThe temperature represented by the zero mark on the thermometer; the lowest point\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-9\"> We have carefully considered appellant\u2019s arguments but are not persuaded that the board committed reversible error. In the first place, the board noted, and we agree that the record shows that goods sold under appellee\u2019s marks have enjoyed sales amounting \u201cto many millions of dollars.\u201d Expenditures for promotion of this mark between 1958 and 1967 exceeded $5,000,000. We consider this to be evidence of the real significance of the THERMO KING trademark in the market place that is more than adequate to rebut any inference of weakness raised by third-party registrations. We have frequently said that third-party registrations are entitled to little weight in evaluating whether there is likelihood of confusion. See AMF, Inc. v. American Leisure Products, Inc., 474 F.2d 1403 (CCPA 1973) and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-10\">Furthermore, we cannot agree with \u00cd\u00bb appellant\u2019s assertions regarding the portion of the trademark. That it \u201cobviously refers to Bill Rivers\u201d is an untenable argument as the mere initials in no way suggest the name or ownership by Bill Rivers. More importantly, the initials do not impart to the mark, when it is viewed as a whole, any impression that its ownership would be different from that of THERMO KING.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-15\">We also find ourselves in agreement with the board\u2019s interpretation of the significance of the terms THERMO and ZERO. We do agree with appellant that the words can have different meanings, but we are of the opinion, that both have a suggestive connotation when applied to transport refrigeration equipment since both relate to temperature. This relationship plus the fact that both are used with KING convince us that a purchaser would be likely to erroneously conclude that the products bearing those marks come from the same source. At most, the differences in the marks when the marks are viewed in their entireties suggest a related product from the same source. See Mead Johnson &amp; Co. v. American Home Products Corp., 461 F.2d 1381, 59 CCPA 1082 (1972) and Consolidated Cigar Corp. v. M. Landaw Ltd., 474 F.2d 1402 (CCPA 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-16\">Appellant has argued in its brief that appellee should have a greater burden of proof to meet before its petition to cancel is granted since it actually knew of appellant\u2019s use of the mark at a time when it could have opposed registration. Instead, appellee waited until the five-year period for cancellation had nearly expired before filing its petition. This is essentially an equitable argument and does not, we think, point out sufficient inequity to merit reversing the board. Ip this regard, we have considered the fact that appellant was formerly an outlet for appellee\u2019s goods in Florida and was, therefore, fully aware of the existence of the trademark THERMO KING when it adopted the mark for which cancellation has been sought. Therefore, for the reasons we have indicated above, we hold there would be likelihood of confusion arising from concurrent use of the marks <em>~ </em>ZERO KING and THER-xv MO KING on the respective products. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>Accordingly, the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">One other matter merits our attention. Both at oral argument and in a paper filed after oral argument, appellee\u2019s attorney has sought to bring to our attention that appellant\u2019s attorney has made arguments in another forum on another case inconsistent with those made here. Assuming this to be true, we wish to point out that this is totally irrelevant to this case and played no part in our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1312-11\">.
