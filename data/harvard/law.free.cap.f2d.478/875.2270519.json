S.C. \u00a7 1857c-3 et seq., require the Administrator \u2014 as he has already done \u2014 to establish national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards stating how much of each pollutant shall be allowed in the ambient air. Primary standards are m\u00e1ximums allowable to protect the public health; secondary standards are m\u00e1ximums to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects. Each state must then submit to the Administrator a plan for implementation, maintenance and enforcement of the standards. \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(1). The plan must be such as to achieve primary standards within three years (subject to a possible two-year extension), and secondary standards within a reasonable time. \u00a7 1857c-5(a) (2); <em>see </em>\u00a7 1857c-5(e) and (f). The Administrator is to approve or disapprove a plan, or any portion, in light of its ability to meet those timetables and its fulfilling of the other requirements of \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(2)(B) through (H). If a state plan or any portion does not meet the statutory requirements, the Administrator is directed to publish his own regulations setting forth an implementation plan, or portion thereof for the state. \u00a7 1857c-5(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-16\">Petitioners raise eight objections to the Administrator\u2019s approval of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>Rhode Island plan, and four to the Massachusetts plan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">THE RHODE ISLAND PLAN</p>\n<p id=\"A3p\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Petitioners argue that the Administrator erred in approving the classification of the Metropolitan Providence Interstate Air Quality Control Region (MPIAQCR) as Priority III for photochemical oxidants and carbon monoxide.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The classification was made pursuant to 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.3(b)(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-6\">In the absence of measured data to the contrary, classification with respect to carbon monoxide, photochemical oxidants and nitrogen dioxide will be based on the following estimate of the relationship between these pollutants and population: Any region containing an area whose 1970 \u201curban place\u201d population, as defined in the U.S. Bureau of Census, exceeds 200,000 will be classified Priority I. All other regions will be classified Priority III.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Both parties seem agreed that there was an \u201cabsence of measured data to the contrary,\u201d and that the \u201c \u2018urban place\u2019 population\u201d criterion was used. Although the precise meaning of \u201c \u2018urban place\u2019 population\u201d was questioned by petitioners, respondent has informed us that the term was taken from the 1960 census, and that it was intended to mean what \u201cplace\u201d population means in the 1970 census. The 1970 \u201cplace\u201d population of Providence was 170,000; hence, the Priority III classification. We accept the Administrator\u2019s interpretation of his own regulation. Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">The harder question is whether the regulation goes beyond statutory authority. Petitioners argue that it is irrational, since</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9G\">Air pollutants, by their nature, do not respect political boundaries, so that two cities, closely juxtaposed, would have nearly the same degradation of air quality as a single city of the same total population. It is population density and traffic density that are relevant, not the individual city size. Although Providence alone has a population of 170,000, the metropolitan Providence area contains the immediately contiguous cities of Central Falls, Cranston, Cumberland, East Providence, Johnston, North Providence, Pawtucket, Providence, Warwick and West Warwick with a total population of over 570,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">Whatever the facts in Rhode Island, the regulation seems to presume what must, in some places, be fiction: that, if a region lacks a city of over 200,000, its air is relatively pure in the absence of measured data to the contrary. 40 C.F. R. \u00a7 51.3(b)(2). The air over a region containing a dense population, much industry, but no one city with over 200,000 inhabitants, could, though polluted, be classified Priority III. Recognizing this, the Administrator points to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>his need to tackle the national problem in a manageable way. Since photochemical oxidants and carbon monoxide are associated with automobiles, and since control may require regulation of the use of automobiles, he says he must concentrate initial control strategies in single, large cities having a centralized government and hence greater capability to regulate traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">This may be the only feasible approach. Yet the Clean Air Amendments, on their face, contemplate achieving national standards within the allowable time everywhere, an object which the Administrator\u2019s urban place priorities would seem not to achieve. We would be loath to construe the Act as requiring the Administrator to do the impossible; however, without further information we cannot make an informed judgment. We do not accept factual arguments advanced by attorneys in briefs or orally as substitutes for official finding or explanations of the agency. International Harvester Company v. Ruckelshaus,\u2014F.2d 478 at p. 632 (D.C.Cir. 1973). Without data, either we must conclusively presume that the Administrator is right \u2014 a presumption which would reduce judicial review of the question to a formality \u2014 or we must have further data from the agency upon which to make a reasoned judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">At present, we not only do not know officially and in detail why the agency has adopted an approach which seems <em>not </em>to ensure national compliance within the allotted time, we do not know why there remains an \u201cabsence of measured data\u201d regarding the extent of photochemical oxidants and carbon monoxide pollution in the MPIAQCR.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">In a letter dated June 15, 1971, Mario Storlazzi, Regional Air Pollution Control Director, E.P.A., notified Dr. Joseph E. Cannon, Director of the Rhode Island Department of Health, that the MPIAQCR was classified <em>Priority I </em>for carbon monoxide and photochemical oxidants \u201cbased on the high population and traffic density in the Providence area. Mr. Daley [Chief, Division of Air Pollution Control, Rhode Island Department of Health] has agreed to monitor the air quality for [these pollutants] in an area of high traffic density during the time period from July 1 to September 30 of this year. The air quality data collect\u00e9d will be used to establish the final classification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">There is no evidence that the data was ever collected. We should know whether it is available today, one and one-half years later, particularly in light of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857e-5(a)(2)(C).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the data is still not available, is Rhode Island under a continuing duty to collect it, or will the MPIAQCR retain its Priority III classification forever ?</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">The Clean Air Amendments do not expressly require the E.P.A. to provide an explanation of its decisions approving state implementation plans. Compare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857h-5(b) (1) with \u00a7 1857c-5(f) (2). Nonetheless, the judicial review provision necessarily confers authority to compel such information from the E.P.A. to the extent needed to determine whether the Administrator\u2019s action is in accordance with law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Citizens To Preserve Overton Park v.

Environmental Protection Agency, 477 F.2d 495, at pp. 506-508 (4th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">We ask the E.P.A. to provide us with a detailed statement of its reasons for adopting 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.3(b)(2), what efforts have been and are being made to collect data concerning photochemical oxidants and carbon monoxide levels in the MPIAQCR, and elsewhere in Rhode Island, whether or not adequate data is now available, and any other information which the E.P.A. considers might be helpful to this court in reviewing the question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Petitioners claim that Rhode Island\u2019s control strategy for nitrogen dioxide will reduce the ambient nitrogen dioxide concentration by only 9.2%, whereas in 1969 the primary standard was exceeded by 26.5%. We need not discuss this argument in detail since we are now informed that the Administrator has announced the impending reclassification of all regions for nitrogen dioxide, based upon findings that the air quality data originally used in assigning classifications to regions significantly overestimated the actual ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">According to respondent, many regions with air quality better than the nitrogen dioxide air quality standard may have been erroneously classified priority I, and the data which indicated a need in Rhode Island for a 26.5% reduction may have been wrong by as much as a factor of ten. We decline to review this aspect of the plan pending reclassification. United States v. Western Pacific Railroad Co., 352 U.S. 59, 63-64, 77 S.Ct. 161, 1 L.Ed.2d 126 (1956). The Administrator shall advise us within thirty days whether, in light of the reclassification, the Rhode Island plan is in compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air Amendments. Should the necessary data still be unavailable, he shall file a status report within said thirty day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">Petitioners assert that the Administrator erred in approving the Rhode Island plan since it does not provide for revisions, as required by 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 1857C-5(a)(2)(H).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-5\">The statutory language is clear:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-6\">[The Administrator shall approve the plan if he determines that] it provides for revision, after public hearings, of such plan (i) from time to time as may be necessary to take account of revisions of such national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard or the availability of improved or more expeditious methods of achieving such primary or secondary standard; or (ii) whenever the Administrator finds on the basis of information available to him that the plan is substantially inadequate to achieve the national ambient air quality primary or secondary standard which it implements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">We think the plan must expressly provide for revision after public hearings on the occasions and under the circumstances described in the federal statute. Congress did not indicate merely that the state, or some state authority, should have a power of amendment. Compare G.L.R.I. \u00a7\u00a7 23-25-5(1) and 23-25-5(n).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plan was to be approved only if <em>\u201cit provides </em>for revision, after public hearings\u201d in two sets of circumstances where revision is mandatory, not merely optional. (emphasis supplied) The Administrator erred in approving a plan which sets forth something less. We see no reason, when Congress has spoken precisely, for the Administrator or us to try to decide whether the state\u2019s informal substitute is, in the long run, just or almost as good. Presumably the necessary revision undertaking could be in regulations promulgated by the state director of health, or, if more convenient, the Administrator could promulgate his own regulations as a part of the state plan. \u00a7 1857e-5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">Petitioners claim that the Rhode Island plan failed to provide the \u201cnecessary assurances that the State will have adequate personnel, funding, and authority to carry out such implementation plan\u201d required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(2)(F). Respondent counters that the Rhode Island Plan complied with E. P.A. regulation 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.20:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-13\">Each plan shall include a description of the resources available to the State and local agencies at the date of submission of the plan and of any additional resources needed to carry out the plan during the 5-year period following its submission. Such description, which shall be provided in a form similar to that in Appendix K to this part, shall include projections of the extent to which resources will be acquired at 1-, 3-, and 5-year intervals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-14\">The Rhode Island Plan <em>described </em>the available resources and projected further resource acquisition. The question becomes whether 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.20 is consistent with the statute. An assurance is \u201cthe act of assuring . . . something that inspires or tends to inspire confidence . . . the quality or state of being sure or certain: freedom from doubt: CERTAINTY . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary). At first glance, a description does not seem to inspire confidence or provide certainty that the state will have adequate personnel, funding and authority to carry out its plan. Yet given the mechanics of state-federal relations, it is difficult to imagine what sort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>of guarantee the current Rhode Island executive or legislature could give the E.P.A. to insure that adequate resources would be devoted to the Plan. Petitioner speaks of a \u201ccommitment to use all reasonable efforts to obtain these resources from the legislature or from other programs . . . The Governor [should] give his assurance that he will do everything possible to obtain adequate resources, including filing special acts before the state legislature, or if necessary making available the necessary resources from other programs under his control.\u201d Such assurances might have a symbolic effect; however, they would have little more, since a governor or even a present session of the legislature cannot make binding commitments on behalf of their successors, nor would such representations seem fo be enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">We believe that Congress has left to the Administrator\u2019s sound discretion determination of what assurances are \u201cnecessary\u201d. The Administrator has required the states to describe their resources, doubtless reasoning that review of such an inventory is the best practical \u201cassurances\u201d he can obtain. The Administrator can determine whether the itemized resources together with such federal funds as the Administrator may himself channel to Rhode Island <em>(see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c) will enable the state to carry out the plan. The Administrator might also have asked for a promise by the Governor to use his \u201cbest efforts.\u201d But we are not prepared to fault the Administrator for deciding that such a gesture would be so lacking in enforceability as to be meaningless. The \u201cnecessary assurances\u201d clause seems to us to call less for rhetoric than for the Administrator\u2019s reasoned judgment as to the adequacy of resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">Petitioners say the Administrator erred in approving that portion of the Rhode Island plan which permits the state to grant variances.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They maintain that \u00a7 1857c-5(f) establishes the exclusive variance procedure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>The Rhode Island variance provision as it now stands should have been disapproved as a part of that state\u2019s plan. The statute tells us that a state plan implementing a national primary air quality standard is to provide \u201cfor the attainment of such primary standard as expeditiously as practicable but [subject to subsection (e), providing for a possible later two-year extension] in no case later than three years from the date of approval of such plan.\u201d \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(2)(A). Secondary standards are to be implemented within \u201ca reasonable time\u201d as specified in the plan. A plan must include \u201cemission limitations, schedules and timetables for compliance with such limitations, and such other measures as may be necessary to <em>insure attainment and maintenance </em>of such primary or secondary standard . . .\u201d \u00a7 1857c-5(a) (2) (B). [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">A state\u2019s implementation plan must therefore provide for two periods of time: an earlier period during which attainment of primary standards is to be achieved as expeditiously as practicable, but in no case later than three years; and a later period after which standards, having been attained, are to be maintained. We shall consider the Rhode Island variance provision as it applies to each of the two periods (bearing in mind that neither the variance provision itself nor the Rhode Island plan, as presently written, make any distinction between them).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">a. <em>The period after mandatory attainment of standards.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">Under the variance provision, the Rhode Island director of health is authorized, from year to year, to exempt polluters from state emission limitations, schedules and timetables. Were this power to be exercised liberally after the mandatory attainment dates, he could, at his pleasure, grant exemptions which would render maintenance of standards impossible. His retention of such extensive discretion is inconsistent with the federal statute and its stated objectives. It is plain from the legislative history that the expeditious imposition of \u201cspecific emission .standards\u201d and their \u201ceffective enforcement\u201d were primary goals of the Clean Air Amendments. Report No. 91-1146, U.S. House of Representatives, 91st Cong.2d Sess., pp. 1, 5 (1970), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 5356. The Congressional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>intent could too easily be frustrated by the existence of open-ended exceptions. Sources of pollutants should either meet the standard of the law, or be closed down. Report No. 91-1196, U.S. Senate, 91st Cong.2d Sess., p. 3 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Congress\u2019s intention to restrict individual exemptions is further reflected in its enactment of \u00a7 1857c-5(f). That section with its precise standards, its limitation of postponements to not more than one year, and its provision for judicial review, would be meaningless if much less restricted state variance machinery, nowhere authorized by the federal statute, were simultaneously to exist. We think Congress meant \u00a7 1857c-5(f) to be the exclusive mechanism for hardship relief after the mandatory attainment dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">We have, of course, not yet arrived at those dates, and from the Administrator\u2019s argument and brief, we do not understand that he necessarily endorses utilization of state variance machinery after that time. But a state plan must provide not only for the present preparatory period; it must ensure both the attainment and the maintenance of standards. The Administrator may not approve a plan, or a portion thereof, which fails to deal appropriately with both objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">The Administrator contends that the danger of indiscriminate variances is avoided by his own regulations requiring each state and local variance to be treated as a \u201crevision\u201d of the state plan. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.32(f). \u201cRevisions\u201d are not to be considered part of a plan until approved by the Administrator. 40 C. F.R. \u00a7 51.6. The Administrator\u2019s regulations prohibit a state or local agency from granting \u201cany variance of, or exception to, any compliance schedule\u201d if it will prevent or interfere with timely attainment or maintenance of a national standard. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.15. They further provide that \u00a7 1857e-5(f) postponement procedures are not necessary unless a state\u2019s \u201cdetermination to defer the applicability of any portions(s) of the control strategy with respect to such source(s)\u201d will prevent timely attainment or maintenance of a national standard. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.32(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">These regulations, however, insofar as applicable in the post-attainment period, substitute a less rigorous procedure for the one enacted by Congress. Had Congress meant \u00a7 1857c-5(f) to be followed only if a polluter, besides violating objective state requirements, was shown to be preventing maintenance of a national standard, it would have said so. To allow a polluter to raise and perhaps litigate that issue is to invite protracted delay. The factual question could have endless refinements: is it the individual variance-seeker or others whose pollution is preventing maintenance of standards? <em>See e. g., </em>Getty Oil Company v. Ruckelshaus, 342 F.Supp. 1006 (D.Del. 1972), remanded with directions, 467 F.2d 349 (3rd Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1125, 93 S.Ct. 937, 35 L.Ed.2d 256 (1973), where <em>Getty </em>raised this issue in various forums. We hold that the only recourse provided those seeking postponements of a state\u2019s emission limitations after the mandatory deadlines is the restricted provisions of \u00a7 1857c-5(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">We do not say that a state plan may not provide, during the post-attainment period, for minor state and local deferral procedures, such as by bridf postponement of the effective date of abatement orders. Some flexibility may be allowed for mechanical breakdowns and acts of God. Any such procedures would, however, have to be limited to specific time periods measured in weeks or a few months, and would have to contain standards and controls precluding abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">b. <em>The period before the date or dates set for mandatory attainment of standards.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">Whether states may defer control strategy <em>prior to </em>the mandatory compliance dates \u2014 by variance, postponement or otherwise \u2014 is more difficult. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>one may contend that \u00a7 1857c-5(f) must remain the exclusive deferral mechanism, we doubt that Congress intended altogether to preclude the Administrator from approving plans containing reasonable state deferral mechanisms during the preliminary period. The provision for a three-year grace period, followed by the possibility of a further two-year extension, indicates that Congress did not expect immediate achievement of standards. A state plan must provide for attainment of primary standards \u201cas expeditiously as practicable but in no case later than three years from the date of approval .\u201d, and of secondary standards \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d as stated in the plan. \u00a7 1857c-5 (a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">A state plan may well establish emission limitations or other requirements during the preliminary period which one or more sources simply cannot initially meet. A postponement under \u00a7 1857c-5(f), besides being limited to only one year, would require meeting a stricter standard than is suggested by the \u201cas expeditiously as practicable\u201d language \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(2)(A). We can see value in permitting a state to impose strict emission limitations now, subject to individual exemptions if practicability warrants; otherwise it may be forced to adopt less stringent limitations in order to accommodate those who, notwithstanding reasonable efforts, are as yet unable to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The Administrator sees his power to allow such exemption procedures as deriving from the \u201crevision\u201d authority in \u00a7 1857e-5(a)(3). We tend to view it more as a necessary adjunct to the statutory scheme, which anticipates greater flexibility during the pre-attainment period. We do not doubt the Administrator\u2019s power to approve reasonable mechanisms for state and local deferrals of control strategy, provided they cease before the mandatory compliance date and the individual variances are not granted without his specific approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Nothing we say here is to suggest that the Administrator may permit such deferral mechanisms to threaten attainment of full compliance within the mandatory time period, or sooner if practicable. We merely hold that the Administrator has discretion \u2014 as he does not after the mandatory dates \u2014 to permit state and local deferral mechanisms not inconsistent with national objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">(c) <em>Disapproval of the variance provision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">The Administrator, in arguing the related issue of Rhode Island\u2019s overly broad abatement-order laws <em>(infra), </em>asserts that he is powerless to remedy deficiencies in state laws:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-9\">Even if the Administrator disapproved the enfoi\u2019cement authority of Rhode Island, there would be no substantive corrective action which he could take to remedy the deficiency. All that he could do would be to publish a disapproval notice in the Federal Register. Elimination of the economic and technical feasibility considerations from the formulation of state enforcement orders would require a revision of the statutory authority of the Department of Health, to-wit, Sections 23-25-5(h) and 23-25-8(a). However, there is no authority provided in the Clean Air Act which would permit the Administrator to accomplish this. Admittedly, if a State fails to submit a satisfactory. implementation plan, the Administrator is directed to promulgate regulations setting forth a plan for that State. Section 110(c), 42 U.S.C. sec. 1857c-5(c). It is doubtful that Congress ever intended this provision to be used by the Administrator to revise the basic statutory authority of state agencies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKkY\">We do not accept these protestations of helplessness. Of course, the Administrator cannot repeal the state laws. He is specifically empowered, however, to disapprove not only a state implementation plan, but \u201cany portion thereof\u201d (\u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>1857c-5(a)(2) and \u00a7 1857c-5(c)); and he \u201cshall . . . promptly prepare and publish proposed regulations setting forth an implementation plan, or portion thereof, for a State if . (2) the plan, or any portion thereof, submitted for such State is determined by the Administrator not to be in accordance with the requirements of this section, . . .\u201d \u00a7 1857c-5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">We hold that these statutory provisions not only empower, but also require, the Administrator to disapprove state statutes and regulations, or portions thereof, which are not in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Amendments. Congress plainly intended the federal statute and regulations promulgated thereunder to take precedence over state laws and regulations. By enabling the Administrator to insert his own regulations in a state plan, it provided him with the needed authority to substitute appropriate provisions for inappropriate ones. Thereafter, as legal components of the state plan, the Administrator\u2019s regulations may be both federally and locally enforced; violations thereof are violations of a state plan. \u00a7 1857c-8(a) (1); <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1857c-7(d)(1), 1857c-9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">We disapprove the Administrator\u2019s practice of approving defective state laws or regulations as \u201csurplus-age\u201d. The result will be confusion in the minds of state authorities and citizens, and, most likely, unnecessary litigation. The Administrator\u2019s primary enforcement powers are triggered by violation of \u201cany requirement\u201d of a state plan. \u00a7 1857c-8. It is therefore critical that the plan as finally approved (and as supplemented by the Administrator\u2019s regulations forming part thereof) sets forth precisely what is required. If it does not, enforcement efforts in later years may be seriously hampered.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">With respect to the Rhode Island variance provision, the Administrator is directed to take the following action:</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">The Administrator shall publish his disapproval of the portion of the Rhode Island implementation plan consisting of the variance statute (G.L.R.I. \u00a7 23-2515) insofar as the statute permits the granting of any variance after the federal compliance dates for attainment of national primary and secondary standards (except minor deferrals as herein-above described); insofar as it permits the granting of any variance prior to these dates not first approved by the' Administrator; and insofar as it permits the granting of any variance other than one conforming to requirements set forth in regulations to be promulgated as part of the Rhode Island plan by the Administrator. After issuing such disapproval, the Administrator shall promptly promulgate regulations, as part of the Rhode Island plan, specifying the limited terms, conditions and circumstances under which state variances may still be issued. Such terms, conditions and circumstances shall be consistent with this opinion and may include additional more restrictive provisions as deemed appropriate by the Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b956-14\">Petitioners\u2019 sixth argument, also relating to alleged defects in the Rhode Island variance procedure, is controlled by what we have already said on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-15\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b956-16\">Petitioners contend that two provisions of the Rhode Island Clean Air Act, which are part of Rhode Island\u2019s air pollution implementation plan, violate the federal statute by permitting the state air pollution director to consider economic and social factors, and technical feasibility in issuing abatement orders.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Both sides seem agreed that the Clean Air Amendments of 1970 rejected consideration of these factors in determining whether violators should be made to comply with the law. Report No. 91-1196, U.S.Senate, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3 (1970); Hearings, \u201cImplementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, Pt. I,\u201d U.S.Senate, Subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution, Committee on Public Works, 92nd Cong., 2d Sess., p. 21 (1972); Hearings, <em>supra at </em>277, 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">Respondent\u2019s defense is that \u201cinsofar as these sections are not required as part of the State\u2019s implementation plan, they are surplusage as they relate to the Clean Air Act. Insofar as they might be inconsistent with the Clean Air Act, they are a nullity . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">This response is not sufficient. To the extent that G.L.R.I. \u00a7\u00a7 23-25-5(h) and 23-25-8(a), as now worded, are inconsistent with the federal statute, they must be disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The same considerations and limitations which we have discussed at length with respect to variances apply generally to abatement orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">During the post-attainment period, the Rhode Island director must be guided in the issuance of orders by the objective requirements of the state\u2019s implementation plan. He may not exercise discretion, based on economic and social factors and on notions of technical feasibility. Postponements may only be allowed as permitted in laws or regulations hereinafter approved or promulgated by the Administrator providing for very brief grace-periods not to exceed several months. Any greater deferral of enforcement must be achieved, if at all, through \u00a7 1857c-5(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">Prior to the attainment dates greater discretion may be allowed by the Administrator in the issuance and timing of orders. \u2022 We leave to the Administrator the promulgation of suitable regulations, to become part of the Rhode Island plan, indicating the standards to be followed by the Rhode Island director when acting under the Rhode Island laws. Any substantial deferrals of control strategy will, as with variances, require approval of the Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-15\">The Administrator\u2019s disapproval of the two Rhode Island statutes, as written, which shall be published, shall follow a format generally similar to that set forth above for disapproval of the variance statute. Suitable detailed regulations consistent herewith and with the Clean Air Amendments shall thereafter be promulgated and made part of the Rhode Island plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-16\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b957-17\">We disagree with petitioners\u2019 final argument that G.L.R.I. \u00a7 23-25-9 <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> fails to comply with 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>18(d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u00a7 23-25-9 appears to refer to situations where a person is ordered by the Director to adopt, use or properly operate an air pollution control device pursuant to \u00a7 23-25-8. It would appear not to refer to the case envisioned by 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.18 where the Department of Health approves the construction or mollification of stationary sources under \u00a7 23-25-5(k). Furthermore, Section 4.-1.2 of the Rhode Island plan states that \u201cApproval of any construction, installation or modification shall not affect the responsibility of the owner or operator to comply with applicable portions of the control strategy.\u201d Regulations 9.5.1 and 9.8.1 of the Rhode Island plan are further evidence that construction and modification approval does not exempt a source from compliance with other regulations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">THE MASSACHUSETTS PLAN</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Petitioners\u2019 first three objections to the Massachusetts plan raise substantially the same issues as those discussed above with regard to the Rhode Island plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">Petitioners argue that Massachusetts has failed to provide the \u201cnecessary assurances that the state will have adequate personnel, funding and authority to carry out such implementation plan\u201d as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(2)(F). Massachusetts candidly states that it must have additional funds and staff to implement the plan. We have earlier stated, with regard to Rhode Island, that Congress left to the Administrator\u2019s sound discretion determination of what assurances are \u201cnecessary.\u201d The difficulty of a state\u2019s forecasting future resources, funds and needs requires that much be left to the Administrator\u2019s reasoned judgment; honest data, moreover, and even honest doubts are preferable to empty rhetoric. But we cannot, without knowing more, affirm the Administrator\u2019s approval of this portion of the Massachusetts plan which on its face, indicates an inability to provide \u201cnecessary assurances.\u201d It may be that Massachusetts\u2019 statement of inadequate resources is offset by the Administrator\u2019s reasonable belief that he will be able to channel sufficient fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>eral funds to the state to do the job. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857e. It may be that his detailed knowledge of the Massachusetts situation satisfies him that, notwithstanding asserted shortages, the state\u2019s personnel and funding, insofar as can now be estimated, will be adequate. We recognize, of course, the difficulties faced by the Administrator were a state adamantly to refuse to provide for sufficient personnel and funding. But matters must be taken a step at a time; and the first step, required by the statute, is for the Administrator to make a reasoned judgment whether, in light of the resources shown to exist, and his best estimate of future federal and state resources, the necessary assurances requirement has been met. And for us to review the Administrator\u2019s approval in the present case, we must, in view of the doubts expressed by Massachusetts, have more information.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">We direct the Administrator to provide us with a detailed statement of his rationale for concluding from the information in the Massachusetts plan and otherwise in his possession that Massachusetts, notwithstanding the doubts expressed in its plan, has provided \u201cnecessary assurances\u201d that it will have adequate personnel, funding and authority to carry out its implementation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">X-XI</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">Our conclusions with respect to petitioners\u2019 objections to Massachusetts\u2019 variance procedures<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> are identical to those expressed in our discussion of the Rhode Island plan. We shall not repeat them here (see V, above). The relevant Massachusetts regulations shall be disapproved in the manner and to the extent there described, and suitable regulations thereafter promulgated, as part of the Massachusetts plan, consistent with the requirements and standards which we have described in the ease of Rhode Island.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">XII</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">We agree with petitioners that the Massachusetts plan failed to comply with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(a) (2)(F), which requires each plan to provide,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>. (ii) requirements for installation of equipment by owners or operators of stationary sources to monitor emissions from such sources, (iii) for periodic reports on the nature and amounts of such emissions; (iv) that such reports shall be correlated by the State agency with any emission limitations or standards established pursuant to this chapter, <em>which reports shall be available at reasonable times for public inspection . . . </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">This section, particularly important to insure public participation in the enforcement process, is implemented by E. P.A. regulations 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 51.10(e) and 51.11(a)(6).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Regulation 14 of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Air Pollution rules states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-7\">Upon request by the Department through direct communication or public notice, any person who owns or operates a stationary emission source (b) shall make periodic reports to the Department on the nature and amounts of emissions from said such source which the Department shall review and correlate for its use in emissions control and exhibit for public information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">As petitioners point out, Regulation 14 does not <em>require </em>periodic reports. If the Department does not request such reports, they need not be made. We agree that this discretionary aspect of the Regulation is in conflict with the Act, and should have been disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-13\">There is a further problem with this aspect of the Massachusetts plan. G.L. c. Ill \u00a7 142D is enabling legislation for the Department to implement federal air pollution requirements. \u00a7 142D provides, in part, that \u201cThe powers, duties and rights of the department in the exercise of air pollution control in districts established under this section . shall be as provided in section one hundred and forty-two B.\u201d \u00a7 142B states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG-O\">Personnel of the department may in the performance of their duties under this section, enter and inspect any property, premise, or place, <em>Any information relating to secret processes, methods of manufacture, or production obtained in the course of such inspection shall be kept confidential upon request. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-15\">G.L. c. Ill \u00a7 2B contains similar language regarding information obtained during inspections to uncover violations of air pollution emergency orders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-16\">Information relating to trade secrets, secret processes or methods of manufacture or production shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed or received during the course of any such investigation; nor shall such information be used or disclosed in any public hearing under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-17\">These statutes suggest that Massachusetts does not have authority to compel public disclosure of emission data.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>That the federal statute specifically intended emission data to become public knowledge is clear from 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-9(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-4\">Any records, reports or information obtained under subsection (a) of this section [permitting the Administrator access to emission records] shall be available to the public, except that upon a showing satisfactory to the Administrator by any person that records, reports, or information, or particular part thereof, <em>(other than emission data) </em>to which the Administrator has access under this section if made public, would divulge methods or processes entitled to protection as trade secrets of such person, the Administrator shall consider such record, report, or information or particular portion thereof confidential in accordance with the purposes of section 1905 of Title 18, except that such record, report, or information may be disclosed to other officers, employees, or authorized representatives of the United States concerned with carrying out this chapter or when relevant in any proceeding under this chapter. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The Administrator should have disapproved so much of the Massachusetts statutes and regulations forming a part of the state\u2019s implementation plan as allow emission reports to be held confidential.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">No. 72-1219 <em>The Rhode Island Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_I\">The Administrator is hereby ordered:</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">1.

The preamble to those proposed regulations indicated that the air quality data for nitrogen dioxide which was used to classify air quality control regions may be in error, and the Administrator would reassess the classifications and, where appropriate, revise them. After considering the numerous comments on the proposed nitrogen oxides regulations, the Administrator has decided to postpone the promulgation of any such regulations until after the regional classification reassessment.

The Massachusetts plan designates \u201cAdministrative Bulletin #71-3\u201d (of the Executive Office for Administration and Finance) as the source of the state\u2019s authority to compel public disclosure. This Bulletin requires disclosure of \u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cquasi-public\u201d records. Emission data is not a \u201cpublic\u201d record as defined by statute, and the definition of \u201cquasi-public\u201d records excludes \u201c(6) A record containing trade secrets or oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>er information obtained on a privileged or confidential basis.\u201d However, we note the possibility that (5) might permit the disclosure of such data, since it states: \u201cA record containing investigatory information obtained for the purpose of enforcement or implementation of law [is not a quasi-public record] except to the extent that such record is required by law to be made available to a party other than the state agency having custody thereof.\u201d The phrase \u201crequired by law\u201d might be construed as encompassing the requirements of the Clean Air Act.
