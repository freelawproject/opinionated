Sieling was charged by information in the Arizona Superior Court with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and five counts of assault to commit murder. At his arraignment, the court entered a plea of not guilty for him and granted a defense motion for the appointment of two psychiatrists to examine Sieling to determine whether he was competent to stand trial. When the two psychiatrists disagreed on the issue, the court ordered a third expert to examine the defendant. At a hearing, held pursuant to Rule 250, Arizona Rules of Criminal Procedure, 17 A.R.S., the reports of the examining psychiatrists were considered, and each of the experts testified. All three of the psychiatrists expressed the opinion that, at the time of the alleged crimes, Sieling was insane under the applicable M\u2019Naghten standard; however, two of them were of the opinion that he was then able to understand the proceedings and to assist counsel in his defense. The trial court concluded that Sieling was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Approximately a month later, shortly before the scheduled trial date, Sieling notified the court that he wished to change his plea. He was brought into court, and a brief inquiry was made by defense counsel, at the court\u2019s direction, regarding Sieling\u2019s understanding of the charge and the consequences of a guilty plea. A plea of guilty was entered on the counts of assault with a deadly weapon and, pursuant to a plea bargain, the court granted the prosecution\u2019s motion to dismiss the five remaining counts in the information. The court then sentenced Sieling to consecutive terms of 8-10, and 4-6 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">After exhausting all available state post-conviction remedies, Sieling petitioned the United States District Court for a writ of habeas corpus. The matter is here on the court\u2019s judgment dismissing his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Sieling bases his right to relief on the ground that his guilty pleas were invalid. He contends that he was mentally incompetent to enter them*. In substance, his argument is that neither the finding of competency to stand trial nor the guilty plea proceedings, held in the trial court, adequately resolved the question of his competency to waive his constitutional right to trial. He points out that his competency to make such a waiver was not at issue at the competency hearing, and accordingly, the trial court never made a finding on that issue; further, he argues that the colloquy immediately preceding his guilty plea cannot suffice to resolve the question, because it consisted of no more than the usual inquiry concerning volun-tariness, lack of coercion, and understanding of the consequences, and therefore did not extend into the area of his mental competency at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">Support for Sieling\u2019s argument is found in Westbrook v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 150, 86 S.Ct. 1320, 16 L.Ed.2d 429 (1966). In that decision, the Supreme Court gave recognition to a distinction between a defendant\u2019s mental competency to stand trial, and his competency to waive his right to counsel at trial. The Court held that a trial court finding, under Arizona Criminal Rule 250, that the defendant was competent to assist counsel in his defense, did not suffice as a finding that he was also competent to waive such a fundamental constitutional right as the right to the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\"> A plea of guilty \u201cis itself a conviction. Like a verdict of a jury it is conclusive. More is not required; the court has nothing to do but give judgment and sentence.\u201d Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 223, 47 S.Ct. 582, 583, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927); Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 493, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u201cSeveral federal constitutional rights are involved in a waiver that takes place when a plea of guilty is entered in a state criminal trial. First, is the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and applicable to the States by reason of tlje Fourteenth. Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 [84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653]. Second, is the right to trial by jury. Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 [88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491], Third, is the right to confront one\u2019s accusers. Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400 [85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923].\u201d Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1712, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969). Consequently, the courts must exercise the \u201cutmost solicitude of which [they] are capable in canvassing the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.\u201d Boykin v. Alabama, <em>supra, </em>395 U.S. at 243-244, 89 S.Ct. at 1712.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"> It is of course well settled that a defendant in a criminal trial cannot be deemed to abandon any fundamental constitutional protection unless there is both \u201can intelligent and competent waiver by the accused.\u201d Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 465, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938); Westbrook v. Arizona, <em>supra. </em>In the typical case \u2014 that is, when the defendant\u2019s sanity or mental capacity has not been put in issue\u2014 the determination of the validity of the waiver by the defendant can be assessed with an assumption that he is mentally capable of making the weighty decisions involved in giving up his right to counsel, cross-examination, trial by jury, or his privilege against self-incrimination. However, where a substantial question of a defendant\u2019s mental capacity has arisen in a criminal proceeding, it is logically inconsistent to suggest that his waiver can be examined by mere reference to those criteria we examine in cases where the' defendant is presumed competent, since in the latter cases no inquiry into the defendant\u2019s mental capacity to make the waiver is made. Cf. Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 384, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966). If a defendant who can be presumed competent pleads guilty, a court can assess the adequacy of his waiver by examination of the objective evidence in the record, such as the advice given him by the court as to the nature of the charge, the waivers resulting from the plea and the sentencing prospects, as well as the defendant\u2019s statements or responses made in open court. Where the question of a defendant\u2019s lack of mental capacity lurks in the background, however, the same inquiry, while still necessary, fails to completely resolve the question of whether the defendant can properly be said to have had a \u201crational, as well as a factual, understanding\u201d [Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960); Schoeller v. Dunbar, 423 F.2d 1183, 1184 (9th Cir. 1970)] that he was giving up a constitutional right. <em>Cf. </em>Rees v. Peyton, 384 U.S. 312, 86 S.Ct. 1505, 16 L.Ed.2d 583 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">We think <em>Westbrook </em>makes it plain that, where a defendant\u2019s competency has been put in issue, the trial court must look further than to the usual \u201cobjective\u201d criteria in determining the adequacy of a constitutional waiver. In <em>Westbrook, supra, </em>although the state court had, after hearing, concluded that the defendant was mentally competent to stand trial, the Supreme Court deemed it essential that a further \u201cinquiry into the issue of his competence to waive his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel . . .\u201d was required. 384 U.S. at 150, 86 S.Ct. 1320. It was not suggested there, nor has it been in this case, that the state court\u2019s determination that the accused was competent to stand trial was incorrect. The clear implication, then, is that such a determination is inadequate because it does not measure the defendant\u2019s capacity by a high enough standard. While the Court did not suggest a standard, it is reasonable to conclude from the Court\u2019s language that the degree of competency required to waive a constitutional right is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>degree which enables him to make decisions of very serious import. Judge Hufstedler, in Schoeller v. Dunbar, 423 F.2d 1183, 1194 (9th Cir. 1970) has suggested the following standard: \u201cA defendant is not competent to plead guilty if a mental illness has substantially impaired his ability to make a reasoned choice among the alternatives presented to him and to understand the nature of the consequences of his plea.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We think this formulation is the appropriate one, for it requires a court to assess a defendant\u2019s competency with specific reference to the gravity of the decisions with which the defendant is faced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The examination and inquiry into Sieling\u2019s competency, made by the state court here, was not directed at such a level of competency. Under Rule 250, Arizona Rules of Criminal Procedure, the trial court\u2019s inquiry is directed to whether a defendant is \u201c. able to understand the proceedings and to assist in his defense.\u201d In <em>Westbrook, </em>that same Arizona determination was held insufficient for waiver of counsel purposes. If such a determination is deficient on the facts of <em>Westbrook, </em>we think <em>a fortiori </em>it is a deficient basis for upholding a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In our opinion, this court\u2019s per curiam decision in Small v. Arizona, 455 F.2d 456 (9th Cir. 1972) does not compel a contrary result. In <em>Small </em>the court upheld a guilty plea against an attack based on the adequacy of the state court\u2019s determination that the petitioner was competent to stand trial, a determination made after the entry, but before the trial court\u2019s acceptance, of the plea. The decision did not, however, discuss the standard of competency involved in these determinations; that question was not briefed and was therefore not before the court. Accordingly, Small does not control our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">As to the proper form of relief, we think a remand to the state court may be adequate to resolve the question of Sieling\u2019s competency to plead guilty. The Supreme Court in Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966) faced a problem of determining a defendant\u2019s competency some six years after the defendant was tried. There the Court concluded that a retrospective determination of the defendant\u2019s competency could not satisfactorily be made because inter alia, \u201cexpert witnesses would have to testify solely from information contained in the printed record.\u201d 383 U.S. at 387, 86 S.Ct. at 843. That was so, because the trial court had never inquired into the competency question, and thus medical experts had never examined Robinson at the time of the trial. Therefore, the only proper course was a new trial. Here, however, Sieling was examined within a month before his plea by three medical experts, each of whom submitted reports and testified before the trial court. The scope of their examinations and the content of the opinions they expressed may be sufficient for the trial court to determine whether or not their opinions can support a finding that Seiling was competent to plead guilty as well as to stand trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We note, however, that one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>of the experts disagreed even as to Siel-ing\u2019s competence to stand trial, and the trial court may conclude that it is impossible from the present state of the record to make the determination we hold is required. However, we conclude that the trial court should have an opportunity to review the psychiatric evidence in light of our opinion, to decide in the first instance, whether there is sufficient evidence upon which to make that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court to grant the writ, unless within 60 days the State obtains trial court review of the psychiatric evidence in light of the views expressed herein. The District Court shall retain jurisdiction of the cause; if the state court vacates the pleas, then the cause shall be dismissed; should relief be denied the District Court shall then review the matter in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\">. Judge Hufstedler dissented in <em>Sehoeller. </em>However, her quoted statement was not made with respect to any matter in issue in that case, nor was it the subject of attention by the majority, but constituted simply her passing observation on an unrelated question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b283-10\">. In Rees v. Peyton, supra, the Supreme Court held that Rees could not be permitted to withdraw his pending certiorari petition, where Ms counsel had put before the Court a question of Rees\u2019 competence, until it could be determined \u201cwhether he has a capacity to appreciate his position and make a rational choice with respect to continuing or abandoning further litigation or, on the other hand, whether he is suffering from a mental disease, disorder, or defect which may substantially affect his capacity in these premises.\u201d 384 U.S. at 314, 86 S.Ct. at 1506.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b283-13\">.
