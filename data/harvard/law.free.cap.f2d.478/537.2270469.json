Frankel, J., refused to convene a three-judge court and dismissed the complaint, 344 F.Supp. 964 (1972), because of the controlling effect of Romero v. Hodgson, 403 U.S. 901, 91 S.Ct. 2215, 29 L.Ed.2d 678 (1971), summarily affirming 319 F.Supp. 1201 (N.D.Cal.1970) (per curiam). Although we believe that as an original matter plaintiffs\u2019 basic equal protection claim merits the closest judicial attention, we conclude that under applicable precedent we should not now engage in that pursuit. Because the plight of migrant workers as portrayed in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is so unfortunate,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we reach this conclusion, and consequently affirm, with considerable hesitation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-15\">In Romero v. Hodgson, <em>supra, </em>a divided three-judge court sustained the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, one of the statutes under attack here, against an equal protection challenge. Faced with the argument that the exclusion of agricultural labor from the coverage of the statute was no longer justifiable on the grounds originally relied upon by the Supreme Court in 1937,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>nevertheless sustained the exclusion, 319 F.Supp. at 1203, because it could</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aon\">be seen as an indirect subsidy of a \u201cbeneficent enterprise,\u201d or as an effort to save the compensation fund from the drain which would result from the inclusion of another large \u201cdeficit industry,\u201d or even as a necessary political compromise without which it would have been impossible to inaugurate a most important reform in American institutions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Judge Zirpoli filed a strong dissent, arguing that the exclusion was now factually unsupportable and therefore irrational. The dissent pointed out that while administrative hardship for small farmers might have justified the original exemption of agricultural workers, \u201cin 1964, 89 per cent of all hired farm workers . . . were employed by large commercial agricultural corporations\u201d ; in addition, unemployment compensation has been extended to other industries which \u201cfiscally speaking, are much greater drains on the compensation fund,\u201d thus making \u201cuntenable the . . . argument that agriculture has been excluded as a \u2018deficit\u2019 industry\u201d (footnote omitted); and, finally, the \u201cUnemployment Tax Act is not an industrial subsidy; it is social welfare legislation.\u201d Id. at 1205. With the issues thus clearly spelled out, on direct appeal to the Supreme Court the judgment of the district court was summarily affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Plaintiffs argue that such a disposition should not be controlling in this case. They point to the heavy Supreme Court caseload and the observations of Supreme Court scholars (including the recent report of a study group chaired by Professor Paul A. Freund) to the effect that summary disposition of cases on the appellate docket \u201cis not a satisfactory equivalent for the judgment on the merits it is supposed to be.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiffs thus contend that summary affirmance is entitled to no more \u2014 or little more \u2014 precedential weight than is the denial of a petition for a writ of certiorari. However, we have ruled to the contrary. See United States ex rel. Epton v. Nenna, 446 F.2d 363, 366, cert. denied, 404 U.S. 948, 92 S.Ct. 282, 30 L.Ed.2d 265 (1971); Heaney v. Allen, 425 F.2d 869, 870-871 (1970); Port Authority Bondholders Protective Committee v. Port of New York Authority, 387 F.2d 259, 262-263 n. 3 (1967).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are aware that the Ninth Circuit has stated that a summary affirmance by the Supreme Court of a case within its \u201cobligatory appellate jurisdiction has very little precedential significance.\u201d See Dillenburg v. Kramer, 469 F.2d 1222, 1225 (1972).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For now, however, we continue to believe that we are bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s summary affirmances \u201cuntil such time as the Court informs us that we are not.\u201d United States ex rel. Fein v. Deegan, 410 F.2d 13, 22 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 935, 89 S.Ct. 1997, 23 L.Ed.2d 450 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"AG-\">Plaintiffs also argue that even if the affirmance in <em>Romero </em>is entitled to pree-edential weight, differences between that case and this are so significant that the affirmance in the former cannot foreclose the claims made here. <em>Romero, </em>they say, challenged only one statute, while this case attacks many in an effort to establish a \u201cpattern or prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>tice\u201d of systematic exclusion of migrants from curative social legislation. Second, plaintiffs contend that they can here demonstrate a \u201ccausal relationship\u201d between the exclusions and deprivation of fundamental rights, e. g., association, speech, right to travel, and that strict equal protection review is thus appropriate. Finally, plaintiffs urge that <em>Romero </em>was decided prior to cases from the last Term in which the Supreme Court invested \u201crational basis\u201d review under the equal protection clause with considerably more bite and realistic application than had previously been thought appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">These arguments, particularly the last, are by no means frivolous. However, as to the first two, we cannot in good conscience hold that either the presence of four federal statutes under attack instead of one or the bare assertion that \u201cfundamental rights\u201d of migrants are jeopardized by the statutory exclusions justifies our disregarding <em>Romero. </em>As to the last argument, we have ourselves noted the apparent, <em>post-Romero, </em>trend toward a less deferential application of the \u201crational basis\u201d standard of equal protection,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> although not without some disagreement. See Boraas v. Village of Belle Terre, 476 F.2d 824 (2d Cir. 1973) (Timbers, J., dissenting from 4-4 denial of en banc reconsideration). Were we writing on a clean slate, we would take very seriously the assertion that on these facts the statutory exclusions cannot be sustained. But given <em>Romero, </em>the slate is not clean; plaintiffs must obtain any further writings on it in this case from the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\">. The complaint challenges the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 U.S.O. \u00a7 3306 (c) (1), (k) ; the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(a)(5) ; the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.O. \u00a7 409(h) (2) ; the New York Unemployment Insurance Act, N.Y.Labor Law \u00a7 511(6) (a) (McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 31, 1965) ; the New York Minimum Wage Act, id. \u00a7 651(5) (b), id. \u00a7\u00a7 671(6), 673 (1972-73 Supp.) ; and the New York Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, N.Y.Wkmn\u2019s Comp.Law \u00a7 201 (6) (A) (McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 67 1965). Plaintiffs also attack exclusion from and misapplication of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 152(3), 158(b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">In their briefs in this court, plaintiffs refer to only one state statute, the workmen\u2019s compensation law. In view of our disposition, we think it unnecessary to resolve any inconsistency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-16\">. E.g., none of the plaintiffs earns more than $3,000 per year; they are randomly subject to enforced periods of unemployment ranging up to weeks without any compensation, during which they are \u201creduced to utter destitution\u201d; although subjected to serious occupational hazards posed by mechanized equipment and noxious pesticides, plaintiffs are without the disability protections of workmen\u2019s compensation laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b606-17\">. Because we agree with Judge Frankel\u2019s resolution, we need not consider alternative objections to relief, pressed by appellees and alluded to by the district court, i. e., whether plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for injunctive relief is sufficiently concrete to merit three-judge consideration, and whether plaintiffs seek to enjoin assessment or collection of federal taxes, as prohibited by 26 U.S.O. \u00a7 7421(a).

Although these cases considered the stare decisis effect of a Supreme Court <em>dismissal, </em>for want of a substantial federal question, of an appeal from a state court, their reasoning applies with at least as much force to summary affirmances on direct appeals from three-judge courts. This difference in disposition is without significance, explained only by history. R. Stem &amp; E.
