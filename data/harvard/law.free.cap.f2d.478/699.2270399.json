The District Court, relying on its Magistrate\u2019s recommendations, affirmed the administrative decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-20\">The Social Security Act provides that the Secretary\u2019s factual findings which are supported by substantial evidence shall be conclusive. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405 (g). This Court\u2019s task, therefore, is limited to review of the administrative record to determine if there is such substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>Jackson v. Richardson, 449 F.2d 1326 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-21\">Section 223(d)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(d)(2) (A) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-22\">an individual . . . shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental . . . impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-25\">Careful review of the record reveals substantial medical evidence that claimant did not qualify for benefits under this definition of \u201cdisability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-26\">We find no merit in appellant\u2019s claim that she was denied procedural due process in her disability hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-27\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
