We affirm Smith\u2019s conviction but reverse and remand for a new trial as to Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>Smith\u2019s appeal is based on the sole contention that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that he passed the admittedly counterfeit money with the requisite intent to defraud. We decline to elaborate on this contention other than to say that we have read the record of his one and one-half day trial and find more than ample evidence to support the jury verdict, even apart from the rule that we must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the government. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). <em>See </em>Local Rule 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">Appellant Johnson argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a severance, made and denied before trial, and renewed and again denied at trial; he also asserts that a mistrial should have been declared because the government prosecutor used a \u201cbirds of a feather\u201d argument to the jury. We will discuss only the first of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">Johnson timely filed his pre-trial motion for severance pursuant to F.R. Crim.P. 14.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-11\"> Whether to sever the trial of a defendant who has been properly joined, F.R.Crim.P. 8(a) and (b), for trial with other defendants is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. Oper v. United States, 348 U.S. 84, 75 S.Ct. 158, 99 L.Ed. 101 (1954); United States v. Harris, 458 F.2d 670 (5th Cir., 1972). A trial court\u2019s denial of severance will not be lightly overturned, and a defendant has an extremely difficult burden of showing on appeal that the lower court\u2019s action was an abuse of discretion. Tillman v. United States, 406 F.2d 930, 935 (5th Cir., 1969). <em>See </em>C. Wright, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 223 at 441-42 (1969). On the facts present in this case, however, the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-12\">A severance of Johnson\u2019s case was required when at trial it appeared, as Johnson\u2019s well-briefed pre-trial motion for severance had predicted, that he could not obtain a fair trial in a joint trial with Smith.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The pre-trial motion revealed that Johnson\u2019s theory of defense would be completely antagonistic to that of his co-defendant Smith; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>furthermore, the motion pointed out that Smith had made a confession directly incriminating Johnson. Johnson\u2019s defense was that he was not present when the crime charged was committed. His guilt or innocence, therefore, depended on an absence of convincing identification testimony. Smith, however, took an altogether different approach in his defense. He did not deny passing the bills but contended that he did not pass them with the requisite intent to defraud. Indeed, Smith confessed to passing the bills on the day in question. His theory was that, because he was an informer for an Atlanta police detective and because White, the third person in this transaction, accepted the money with knowledge that it was counterfeit, he (Smith) was not criminally liable because he lacked the necessary <em>mens rea </em>to violate the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">As previously mentioned, Smith\u2019s confession directly incriminated Johnson and completely contradicted Johnson\u2019s theory of defense. In his confession Smith stated that Johnson was the person who was with him on , the night that the bogus bills were passed to White. And almost equally as damaging, Smith said that Johnson was the procurer and original possessor of the counterfeit money. A copy of Smith\u2019s statement was, very appropriately, attached to Johnson\u2019s motion for severance. It was thus apparent prior to trial that there was a distinct probability that Johnson and Smith would offer conflicting and antagonistic theories of defense. While Smith would not be highly prejudiced in the presentation of his defense by Johnson\u2019s presence at trial, Smith\u2019s presence would cause definite hardship to Johnson as he endeavored to prove that he played no part in the crime and was not present when it was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">Any doubt as to whether the potential prejudice to Johnson- \u2014 which, we repeat, was forecast in his pre-trial motion \u2014 -would come to fruition was dissipated at the trial. Although finding no prejudice from the joint trial in the case before it, the Supreme Court emphasized that in joint trials \u201cthe trial judge lias a continuing duty at all stages of the trial to grant a severance if prejudice does appear.\u201d Schaffer v. United States, 362 U.S. 511, 516, 80 S.Ct. 945, 948, 4 L.Ed.2d 921 (1960). <em>See </em>Flores v. United States, 379 F.2d 905 (5th Cir. 1967); Byrd v. Wainwright, 428 F.2d 1017, fn. 1 at 1019 (5th Cir., 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-10\">In his opening remarks to the jury Smith\u2019s attorney characterized Smith as a \u201cwhite hat\u201d government informer whose only purpose was to help lead law enforcement officers to the persons responsible for stealing and dealing in stolen unregistered firearms. Counsel described \u201cButterball\u201d Johnson as having a \u201csack full of counterfeit money\u201d and intimated that Smith, acting as his \u201cown Dick Tracy,\u201d had a secondary goal of seeing that Johnson was apprehended for his activity with the counterfeit money. Counsel then commented on the transaction out of which the indictment arose and said that Johnson was present at the scene and was the one who had brought the bogus money to Smith. Smith\u2019s position was thus obvious: he was the good guy \u2014 only along for the ride \u2014 in order to see that criminals such as White and Johnson were removed from circulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-11\">After counsel closed, Johnson\u2019s attorney moved for a mistrial and renewed his motion for severance, pointing out that Smith\u2019s theory of defense was now clear and obviously prejudicial to his client. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-12\">The district court was thus apprised before any testimony that Smith had given a confession directly incriminating Johnson, that there was no reason to expect that the government would not introduce this confession, that the theory of Smith\u2019s defense was directly in conflict with Johnson\u2019s, and that Smith had, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>quite properly,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> no qualms about casting Johnson as the major culprit in the counterfeit transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">Additionally, the accuracy of Johnson\u2019s pre-trial prediction of prejudice was further substantiated by the course of the trial. White, the seller of the unregistered firearms and receiver of the counterfeit money, testified that he believed it was \u201cButterball\u201d Johnson who was present when the bills were passed to him. However, he related that it was dark when the transaction occurred, that he had neither met nor talked with Johnson for any length of time prior to the instant transaction, and that his identification was based on surmise\u2014 from Johnson\u2019s size as well as comments by Smith. Suffice to say that his testimony, while it would be enough to support Johnson\u2019s conviction, was clearly not sufficient to compel it. <em>See, e. g., </em>Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">It is unnecessary to discuss in detail the remainder of the trial \u2014 a brief summary is sufficient. A study of the record reveals that Smith\u2019s attorney implicated Johnson at every opportunity. Moreover, Smith\u2019s confession was introduced with no deletions of the incriminating statements concerning Johnson.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When Smith took the stand, he affirmed his out-of-court statement and also took every available opportunity to further incriminate Johnson as a generally bad person and as the prime mover in the counterfeit transaction. In sum, Smith was the government\u2019s best witness against Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">In Schaffer v. United States, 221 F.2d 17, 19 (5th Cir., 1955), this court recognized that the granting of a motion for severance is within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and that \u201cwhat constitutes an abuse of discretion necessarily depends upon the facts in each particular case.\u201d The court also recognized that a severance was not required simply because one co-defendant had made a confession implicating the other.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court held, however, that the lower court erred in not granting a severance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1201-9\">\u201cA careful study of the record in this case, however, leads us to the conclusion that the motion for severance should have been granted. Devenny and Schaffer were together throughout the transaction; both were present on every pertinent occasion. Schaffer\u2019s confession implicated De-venny and, while the trial judge eliminated from the confession the statement that T think that Devenny knew the property was stolen,\u2019 other parts of the confession clearly prejudiced Devenny in the eyes of the jury. The court, of course, properly instructed the jury to consider the confession as evidence against Schaffer alone, and to disregard it as evidence against De-venny. We believe, however, that the two defendants were so inseparably connected that the jury could hardly have been expected to return a verdict of guilty against one and of not guilty as to the other. There being only two defendants, it would not be very time consuming but entirely practicable to accord them separate trials. Like the Seventh Circuit in the case of United States v. Haupt, 136 F.2d 661, 672, \u2018We doubt if it was within the realm of possibility for this jury to limit its consideration of the damaging effect of such statements merely to the defendant against whom they were admitted.\u2019 We hold, therefore, that the court erred in denying the appellant Devenny a separate trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1201-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 19.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>Here, as in <em>Schaffer, </em>supra, there were only two defendants, and it would not have been very time consuming, but entirely practicable, to have accorded them separate trials. As was noted in United States v. Harris, 458 F.2d 670, 673 (5th Cir., 1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-4\">\u201cIn weighing the competing factors under Rule 14 regarding severance, the trial court must evaluate the alleged factual and legal compactness of the consolidated trial and the government\u2019s interest in judicial economy with the potential prejudice to any of the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">Johnson\u2019s motion for severance was made at least two months prior to trial and was renewed immediately after Smith\u2019s attorney\u2019s opening statement removed any doubt which could have been present concerning Smith\u2019s plan of defense. The posture of the case at the pre-trial stage would warrant the conclusion that no abuse of discretion occurred in the denial of Johnson\u2019s motion at that point. But as the trial progressed it became clear that the prejudice to Johnson of defending at a joint trial with Smith outweighed any possible disruption in the judicial process which would result from having separate trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">We hold that in the particular circumstances of this case the trial court abused its discretion in not granting a severance pursuant to its \u201ccontinuing duty at all stages of the trial to grant a severance if prejudice does appear.\u201d Schaffer v. United States, <em>supra, </em>362 U.S. at 516, 80 S.Ct. at 948. Johnson has established \u201csomething more than the fact that \u2018a separate trial might offer him a better chance of acquittal.\u2019 \u201d Tillman v. United States, supra, 406 F.2d at 935, <em>quoting </em>8 Moore, Federal Practice j[14.04[l], at 14-10, 11. He has demonstrated the \u201caffirmative prejudice,\u201d United States v. Wilson, 451 F.2d 209 (5th Cir., 1971), necessary for a denial of severance to constitute an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We therefore reverse his conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-13\">The Smith judgment is affirmed. The Johnson judgment is reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1198-13\">.

It is necessary at the outset to note the problems which this case does not present. We do not have a <em>Bruton </em>[Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1969)] situation because the co-defendant Smith was available for and was cross-examined. Nor do we face the problem encountered in Nelson v. O\u2019Neil, 402 U.S. 622, 91 S.Ct. 1723, 29 L.Ed.2d 222 (1971), where the Supreme Court held that if a co-defendant takes the stand in his own defense, denies making an out-of-court statement incriminating the other co-defendant, and testifies in the latter\u2019s favor, the co-defendant\u2019s right of confrontation was not violated. The rationale for this decision, as explained by Mr. Justice Stewart, is that \u201cgiven a joint trial and common defense, Bunnells\u2019 [O\u2019Neil\u2019s co-defendant] testimony respecting his alleged out-of-court statement was more favorable to the respondent [O\u2019Neil] than any that cross-examination by counsel could possibly have produced, had Bunnells \u2018affirmed the statement as his.\u2019 It would be unrealistic in the extreme in the circumstances here presented to hold that the respondent was denied either the opportunity or the benefit of full and effective cross-examination of Bunnells.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629, 91 S.Ct. at 1727.</p>\n<p id=\"as_-dedup-0\">Our case is not controlled by <em>O\u2019Neil. </em>The textual discussion, <em>infra, </em>will show that Smith and Johnson did not have a common defense and that Smith did not repudiate his out-of-court statement \u2014 \u25a0 instead, he enthusiastically affirmed it. Smith\u2019s testimony cannot in any respect be characterized as favorable to Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"agy-dedup-0\">Thus, <em>Bruton, </em>as clarified and explained by <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>makes it plain that our reversal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>cannot rest on a violation of Johnson's constitutional right of confrontation. This conclusion does not answer the question. whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying a severance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1201-11\">. <em>See </em>DeLuna v. United States, 308 F.2d 140 (5th Cir., 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1201-12\">. The deletion of the incriminating portions of a confession which implicates a co-defendant is frequently used to avoid error in this type of situation. <em>See, </em>United States v. Kershner, 432 F.2d 1066 (5th Cir., 1970) ; Posey v. United States, 416 F.2d 545 (5th Cir., 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1201-16\">.

That the rationale of <em>Schaffer </em>is still via-able is illustrated by our recent opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>in United States v. Harris, 458 F.2d 670, 673 (5th Cir., 1970), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avi-dedup-0\">\u201c . . . The trial judge in the instant case concluded that there would be no prejudice to the individual defendants resulting from consolidation, and we do not find he has abused his discretion by so concluding. This is not a case of one co-defendant confessing and implicating a fellow co-defendant by his confession, which might make it insurmountably difficult for a jury to render its decision regarding one co-defendant on the basis of his confession and yet to ignore that confession altogether when deliberating the fate of the second co-defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9N\"><em>[Citing </em>Flores v.
