His principal claim on this appeal, one which is heard frequently, see, e. <em>g., </em>United States v. Nazzaro, 472 F.2d 302 (2d Cir. 1973); United States v. Pellegrino, 470 F.2d 1205 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 918, 93 S.Ct. 1556, 36 L.Ed.2d 310 (1973); United States v. Dellinger, 472 F.2d 340, 385-391 (7th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 970, 93 S.Ct. 1443, 35 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973), is that the trial judge\u2019s \u201cdisparagement\u201d and \u201cintimidation\u201d of defense counsel denied appellant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">A brief recital of the evidence introduced at trial will help put appellant\u2019s contention in perspective. The Government's proof established that in June, 1971, appellant received $700 in counterfeit bills in the Bronx from a convicted counterfeiter, one Goodson, who was the principal witness against appellant at trial. It also established that at a hamburger stand in New Orleans appellant had passed a phony $10 bill made from Goodson\u2019s plates and negatives. The defense\u2019s contention was that the Bronx transfer never occurred and that appellant had inadvertently passed the phony $10 bill in New Orleans after receiving it from his girl friend, who in turn had received it from Goodson. The defense claimed that Goodson lied because he sought revenge against appellant for his previous testimony before a grand jury which led to Goodson\u2019s indictment and ultimate prison term on a counterfeiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>charge. The jury, however, apparently rejected appellant's version of events and credited the Government\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">The trial began amicably enough, with the judge telling the jury that \u201c[b]oth lawyers on both sides have the respect of the Judge, they are fine, upright accredible [sic] members of the Bar, and we are proud of them, they are fighting, as they should, for their respective sides . . . . \u201d Soon, however, interaction between the trial court and defense counsel, a former Assistant United States Attorney, developed unmistakable overtones of hostility and acrimony. The flames of hostility that were later to blaze were apparently initially sparked by defense counsel\u2019s delay in making certain suppression motions until the day of jury impaneling. They were fueled by defense counsel\u2019s omission, despite his knowing that the trial was set to begin at 10:00 a. m., to inform the court he had another court appearance that would prevent his being in court at that time. Defense counsel did not appear in the courtroom until 10:20 a. m. on the day that the trial was to begin, and trial did not begin until 10:55 a. m. Hostility between court and counsel first burned openly in an exchange begun by what the trial court believed were defense counsel\u2019s unwarranted interruptions of Goodson\u2019s testimony on cross-examination after counsel had asked Goodson to \u201c[t] ell me everything\u201d about a particular happening. The trial court reacted strongly to defense counsel\u2019s argument with the court\u2019s sustaining of the prosecution\u2019s objection on the point. Before the jury, after the Government\u2019s objection, the court said, \u201cYou are right. Please continue.\u201d Defense counsel replied, \u201cI disagree. I don\u2019t think he is right.\u201d This exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">The Court: Stop it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">Mr. Gold: I am not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-8\">The Court: I will not take any impudence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-9\">Mr. Gold: I am not being impudent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-10\">The Court: Don\u2019t do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-11\">Mr. Gold: I am not doing anything, if it please your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-12\">The Court: Excuse the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">In the absence of the jury the court then expressed displeasure with the whole course of defense counsel\u2019s behavior up to that point in strong terms and at some length. He then asked defense counsel and the Government for comments, which too were at some length. When defense counsel moved for a mistrial, the following interchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aiz-dedup-0\">Mr. Gold: Perhaps your honor would want to relieve me and declare a mistrial and get another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-16\">The Court: You just sit right down. That is what you would like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-17\">Mr. Gold: That is not what I would like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-18\">The Court: Don\u2019t holler at me, sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-19\">Mr. Gold: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-20\">The Court: Don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-21\">Mr. Gold: I will not be ordered about like some child in a courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-22\">The Court: You are a child. I am directing you to sit down or I will hold you in contempt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-23\">Mr. Gold: I am not a child. Your Honor, I hope\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-24\">The Court: Nothing further, quiet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-25\">Mr. Gold: I am entitled to courtesy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-26\">The Court: Bring the jury in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-27\">Mr. Gold: I want to be treated with courtesy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-28\">The Court: When you deserve it you will be. Sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-29\">Mr. Gold: Please, your Honor, don\u2019t address me in that tone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-30\">The Court: Sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-31\">Mr. Gold: I am telling you now, your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-32\">The Court: I am telling you I will hold you in contempt of court if this continues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-33\">Mr. Gold: I am only trying to do what I think is best.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-34\">The Court: I find you in contempt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Mr. Gold: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-4\">The Court: Bring the jury in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Hostility and acrimony in the interactions between defense counsel and the trial court only increased in intensity thereafter. At a side bar conference at another point in the trial, the court called defense counsel\u2019s conduct \u201cdisgusting and shyster-like\u201d and \u201cdenounce[d]\u201d counsel for \u201ccreat[ing] a reason for a mistrial.\u201d Toward the end of the trial defense counsel\u2019s objection to a reference by the trial court to counsel\u2019s motive triggered the court in the presence of the jury to call a Marshal to help enforce the court\u2019s orders to defense counsel to sit down. Other examples of hostility and antagonism between court and counsel could be detailed at some length but to no particular point. Suffice it here to say that a number of incidents occurred throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Appellant blames the trial court and the Government blames appellant\u2019s counsel below for these events. We, however, see little utility in trying to assess proportionate blame on this \u201ccold record.\u201d United States v. Grunberger, 431 F.2d 1062, 1067 (2d Cir. 1970). It may well be that much of the trial court\u2019s treatment of defense counsel was induced by counsel\u2019s lack of ordinary courtesy and close to contemptuous conduct; it is also true that \u201ctrial judges [must] display patience with counsel so as not to prejudice a party or create an impression of partisanship before the jury.\u201d United States v. Pellegrino, <em>supra, </em>470 F.2d at 1207. Instead of seeking to apportion blame we prefer to consider the course of events as regrettable for all concerned and look rather to other \u201ctile[s] in the mosaic of the trial,\u201d United States v. Naz-zaro, <em>supra, </em>472 F.2d at 304, to determine if a new trial is necessary. We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">First, appellant has not substantiated his claim of prejudice flowing from the hostility between trial judge and defense counsel. In contrast to United States v. Nazzaro, <em>supra, </em>and United States v. Dellinger, <em>supra, </em>the trial court\u2019s comments did not create an impression that he personally believed in the appellant\u2019s guilt. United States v. Pellegrino, <em>supra, </em>470 F.2d at 1207; United States v. Brandt, 196 F.2d 653, 656 (2d Cir. 1952). The trial court\u2019s comments were directed exclusively at the conduct of appellant\u2019s counsel, not \u2014 with one exception to be referred to below \u2014 at appellant\u2019s credibility or the strength of his ease. United States v. Ross, 321 F.2d 61, 66 n. 3 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 894, 84 S.Ct. 170, 11 L.Ed.2d 123 (1963). While the trial court\u2019s annoyance was directed primarily at defense counsel, the prosecutor too received a share.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *More importantly, the trial court\u2019s rulings on objections during the trial were quite evenhanded and displayed no bias toward one side or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">There may be a point, however, where hostility between court and defense counsel alone creates the kind of embattled and prejudicial atmosphere in the courtroom that makes a fair trial impossible. This case falls just short of it, however. Defense counsel in no way could be said to have been \u201cintimidated\u201d by the trial court. Rather his advocacy of his client\u2019s interests was vigorous throughout and only increased in vigor in proportion to the hostility from the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>The key question is whether the jury was prejudiced against appellant by the interchanges between the trial court and defense counsel. Most, fortunately, took place outside the presence or hearing of the jury. While it would have been much better had none of the hostility evidenced itself in the jury\u2019s presence, we cannot say that the few brief incidents in which it did inherently prejudiced the jury against appellant. The one of these that comes closest to the line occurred in the course of the cross-examination of the defendant himself the reporting of which (with colloquies) consumed over 160 pages of trial transcript. The cross-examiner was inquiring of the defendant as to his interrogation by two United States attorneys after the New Orleans bill passing incident. After several objections to the line of questioning and to specific questions, primarily on the basis that the interview was not used in the Government\u2019s case in chief and that it was unfair to confront the witness accordingly, defense counsel reiterated his objections as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">Mr. Gold: I have one more thing to bring up, to your Honor\u2019s attention, and that is that the Government did not make an offer of this conversation in its case in chief and they are deprived of the necessity of making an inquiry as to that interview. That is totally an unfair way and I ask for a voir dire out of the presence of the jury to determine whether that interview was consistent with my client\u2019s constitutional rights at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">The court, somewhat exasperated by the repetitious nature of the objections, replied as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-13\">The Court: Objection overruled. On every ground that you have put and I am going to ask you to please not to voice any more objections to this question and giving this witness a great deal of opportunity to contemplate and figure. That is not allowed. You are not supposed to do it. I asked a question and that called for an immediate answer, not time to contemplate by adding these continuous objections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-14\">What you have done is interfere with the purpose of the examination. Now, you have your objection and the objection is overruled and now I will put the question again to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-15\">We think this was unnecessary and warranted entirely different treatment since it inferred in so many words that the witness needed time to contemplate his answers and thereby implied that he was not telling the truth. The trial judge was careful, however, to use strong curative instructions to attempt to erase any ensuing prejudice to the defendant. During the course of the trial and again in the charge the court reminded the jury that they were to deal only with the evidence before them, that \u201c[t]he lawyers were not on trial here, this defendant is the one on trial,\u201d and that exchanges between court and counsel were to be \u201cdisregard [ed] completely\u201d in their deliberations. These strong admonitions tend to mitigate any prejudice that ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>pellant might otherwise have suffered. United States v. Cruz, 455 F.2d 184, 185 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 918, 92 S.Ct. 1769, 32 L.Ed.2d 117 (1972) ; <em>cf. </em>United States v. Nazzaro, <em>supra, </em>472 F.2d at 312-313 &amp; n. 11; United States v. Frascone, 299 F.2d 824, 829 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 910, 82 S.Ct. 1257, 8 L.Ed.2d 404 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Finally, our conclusion that the prejudice to appellant was minimal is also reinforced by the strength of the case against him. United States v. Pelle-grino, <em>supra, </em>470 F.2d at 1208; United States v. Ross, <em>supra, </em>321 F.2d at 66 n. 3. Goodson\u2019s testimony that he delivered the counterfeit money to appellant was corroborated by the testimony of his nephew, one Dogostiano. While the defense was able to challenge Goodson\u2019s credibility, it offered no motive to explain away Dogostiano\u2019s corroboration. Further, appellant admitted passing a counterfeit bill in New Orleans. His explanation for this, if not inherently incredible, was certainly implausible. The implausibility of the explanation is reinforced by appellant\u2019s denial of passing the counterfeit bill when first apprehended in New Orleans and denial when interviewed by the two Assistant United States Attorneys in New York even of being in New Orleans at the time in question. This was thus not a close ease in which the verdict was tipped by the court\u2019s reactions to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Appellant\u2019s other contentions are less troublesome. Appellant claims that the Government violated the Second Circuit Rules Regarding Prompt Disposition of Criminal Cases (the \u201cRules\u201d) because five days before trial was to begin the Government requested a postponement on the ground that one of its key witnesses, a Louisiana resident, was pregnant and was advised by her doctor not to travel. The requested postponement was granted, and, as a result, trial was held ten months after indictment, not the six months appellant claims was required by the Rules.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Rules, however, specifically provided that a continuance may be granted at the prosecutor\u2019s request when material evidence is unavailable. <em>See </em>Rule 5(c) (i); United States v. Counts, 471 F.2d 422, 427 (2d Cir. 1973). The Government was otherwise at all times ready to proceed within the letter and spirit of Rules 3 and 4. In short, appellant\u2019s speedy trial claim is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">Appellant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly allowed appellant to be cross-examined and rebuttal evidence to be submitted concerning crimes not charged in the indictment. One part of this claim is based on evidence submitted about some stolen credit card receipts found during a search of appellant\u2019s car in New Orleans. After some evidence about these receipts was inadvertently introduced as a result of defense counsel\u2019s mistake about the nature of a list in a Secret Service report, the trial court ruled that it would not permit the Government to introduce further evidence about them in its direct case. <em>See generally </em>C. McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 190 at 447 (Cleary ed. 1972). The trial court, however, reserved ruling on whether cross-examination of appellant about the credit card receipts would be proper. Subsequently, the trial court allowed some cross-examination on the point. It may have been within the trial court\u2019s discretion to allow full presentation of evidence on the issue during appellant\u2019s cross-examination, as the defense\u2019s contention was that appellant inadvertently passed a counterfeit bill in New Orleans and use of the stolen credit cards could be said to be a similar criminal act showing appellant in fact had guilty knowledge. <em>See </em>United States v. Kaufman, 453 F.2d 306, 310-312 (2d Cir. 1971); C. McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 190 at 450, 452. United States v. Semensohn, 421 F.2d 1206, 1208 (2d Cir. 1970), heavily relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>on by appellant, is inapposite, for the criminal act on which cross-examination took place there was totally dissimilar to the crime with which Semensohn was charged, United States v. Kaufman, <em>supra, </em>453 F.2d at 311, and at best was only relevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s general credibility. United States v. Glasser, 443 F.2d 994, 1002-1003 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 854, 92 S.Ct. 96, 30 L.Ed.2d 95 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">But we need not and do not decide if full presentation of evidence about the credit card receipts on cross-examination of appellant would have been an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. For the Government confined itself to establishing that appellant had some credit cards and that his denial of using them in New Orleans may have been false. Appellant\u2019s statement that others may have used the credit cards when they borrowed his car, for example, went unchallenged. This limited cross-examination was relevant to appellant\u2019s means of financing his trip to New Orleans, where one bill was passed, and thus was within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>See </em>C. McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 190 at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Also, it cannot be said that the trial court abused its broad discretion in allowing the prosecution to present rebuttal evidence that, contrary to appellant\u2019s statements on cross-examination, credit card receipts were found in an article of appellant\u2019s personal clothing, uncovered in the course of the search of appellant\u2019s car. United States v. Vivero, 413 F.2d 971, 972 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1017, 90 S.Ct. 583, 24 L.Ed.2d 509 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Appellant also claims that evidence relative to crimes not charged was erroneously admitted concerning a prior counterfeiting charge of which appellant had been acquitted. On direct examination appellant testified that he had told the grand jury and the petit jury at a prior trial that he had received some counterfeit bills from Goodson in payment for Goodson\u2019s rental of a room in appellant\u2019s house. He also testified on direct examination in this trial that he had never been in the room claimed to be rented to Goodson. Cross-examination, which proceeded without objection, refined this somewhat to a claim that he had not been in Goodson\u2019s room until after he was arrested on the prior charge and escorted to the room by a police officer. ^ In rebuttal, the Government introduced a portion of the transcript from appellant\u2019s first trial showing that he testified then that he entered Goodson\u2019s room and discovered the counterfeiting equipment <em>pri- or </em>to his first arrest. The Government\u2019s cross-examination and rebuttal evidence were entirely proper, as they went to the issue of appellant\u2019s credibility on subject matter initiated by the defense. <em>See </em>United States v. Vivero, <em>supra, </em>413 F.2d at 972; C. McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 190 at 452. The trial court, moreover, carefully instructed the jury several times that it was not to retry the appellant on the charge of which he had been acquitted, but only to consider the inconsistent statements on the issue of appellant\u2019s credibility. Under the circumstances, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\">. For example, the Assistant United States Attorney was rebuked several times in front of the jury \u2014 indeed, referred to once as a \u201cneophyte\u201d \u2014 for supposed disrespect shown the trial court; for asking leading, repetitive or otherwise improper questions on cross-examination; and for conveying the impression on cross-examination that appellant had lied at a previous trial where he was acquitted on a counterfeiting charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-14\">. A not atypical exchange occurred when at one point in the trial the court interposed an objection on behalf of appellant when defense counsel failed to object to a question similar to those to which he had previously objected. It is not sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>prising that counsel responded, \u201cI think I should be the judge as to when I object and when I don\u2019t.\u201d Counsel here quite surpassed Sir Edward Marshall Hall\u2019s comments to the court in connection with the Styles plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">The Court: How many more speeches am I to hear? I heard you on Thursday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-8\">Hall: I don\u2019t think Your Lordship did hear me; Your Lordship did not <em>msli </em>to hear me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-9\">The Court: You have no right to say such a thing, Mr. Hall; it is a most indecent observation for you to make. I cannot allow it. You meant to be offensive, and you must not be offensive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlZK\">E. Marjoribanks, For the Defense, The Life of Sir Edward Marshall Hall 182 (1954). Or in the Camden Town <em>murder </em>case, when Hall objected to the evidence of a barmaid at the \u201cEagle\u201d as to the last meeting between the defendant and the victim; she failed to identify either the defendant or his companion, one Lambert.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-17\">Hall: I implore Your Lordship to note that this witness has not identified these men.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-19\">The Court: You have said that before ; I have not forgotten it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-20\">Hall: I thought Your Lordship did not <em>appreciate </em>it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-21\"><em>Id. </em>at 231.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b810-6\">.
