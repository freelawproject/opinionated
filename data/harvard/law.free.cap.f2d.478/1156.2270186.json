The facts in this case were reviewed at length by Chief Judge Coolahan in his June 20, 1972 opinion, and it is unnecessary to repeat them here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-15\">Appellants have raised several arguments before this court, but the only one which we must consider is whether the district court had jurisdiction to enjoin the international under Title III of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (\u201cAct\u201d or \u201cLMRDA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 461-466. Section 302 of that Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 462, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-16\">\u201cTrusteeships shall be established and administered by a <em>labor organization </em>over a <em>subordinate body </em>only in accordance with the constitution and bylaws of the organization which has assumed trusteeship over the subordinate body and for the purpose of . . otherwise carrying out the legitimate objects of such labor organization. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-18\">The litigants agree that the international is a \u201clabor organization\u201d as defined in \u00a7 3(i) and (j) of the Act, 29 U. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>S.C. \u00a7 402(i) and <em>(j),</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>since it has chartered a small number of local unions which represent employees in the private sector. On the other hand, Local 1959 is not a \u201clabor organization\u201d under the Act because its charter limits its membership exclusively to Hudson County New Jersey public and civil service employees. \u00a7 3(e), (i) and (j), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(e), (i) and (j).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, the issue which we are required to decide is whether a trusteeship imposed by a parent \u201clabor organization\u201d upon a local which is not a \u201clabor organization\u201d is regulated by the trusteeship provisions of Title III. Appellants argue that the term \u201csubordinate body\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was used in Title III interchangeably with the term \u201csubordinate labor organization,\u201d and that the imposition of a trusteeship over Local 1959 is not governed by the Act since Local 1959 is not a \u201csubordinate labor organization\u201d and thus not a \u201csubordinate body\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 302. Appellees disagree with this interpretation and contend instead that Congress meant to distinguish between a \u201csubordinate body\u201d and a \u201csubordinate labor organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-9\"><em>In </em>addressing this problem, we first observe that the LMRDA has six titles \u201cdealing with various facets both of internal union affairs and of labor-management relations.\u201d Wirtz v. Bottle Blowers Ass\u2019n., 389 U.S. 463, 469, 88 S.Ct. 643, 647, 19 L.Ed.2d 705 (1968). Putting aside Title III for the moment, our examination of the Act reveals that its other five titles specifically apply only to \u201clabor organizations\u201d and thus do not affect public employee unions. Title I enacts a bill of rights for members of labor organizations; Title II involves reporting by labor organizations, officers and employees of labor organizations and employers; Title IV concerns itself with elections in labor organizations ; Title V provides various safeguards for labor organizations; and Title VI consists of certain miscellaneous provisions. Viewing the Act as a whole, it thus seems that if Congress had intended Title III to regulate the manner in which a trusteeship may be imposed upon a public employee union, it would clearly have said so. This it did not do. Nevertheless, it is true that Title III, alone among the Act\u2019s provisions, some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>times uses the phrase \u201csubordinate body\u201d rather than \u201clabor organization.\u201d Consequently, a section by section examination of Title III is necessary in order to determine whether or not \u201csubordinate body\u201d was meant to include public employee unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-4\">Title III contains four operative sections, \u00a7\u00a7 301 through 304 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 461-464.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 301(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 461(a), establishes reporting requirements which a \u201clabor organization\u201d must comply with whenever it \u201cassumes trusteeship over any subordinate labor organization.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Public employee unions are not covered by \u00a7 301 because, as we have noted, these unions are not \u201clabor organizations\u201d under the Act. Since a principal reason for \u00a7 301 is to prevent violations of the substantive trusteeship requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 302 and 303, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 462 and 463, and to provide information about any possible violation, we agree with appellants that it is unlikely that the range of trusteeships governed by those sections would exceed that which is protected by the reporting provisions of \u00a7 301. This is also consistent with the manifest Congressional intent in the other five titles of the Act to exclude public employee unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-12\">While \u00a7 301 indicates that Title III does not regulate trusteeships over public employee unions, \u00a7 303 demonstrates even more strongly that this is so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Its heading reads \u201cUnlawful acts relating to <em>labor organizations </em>under trusteeship,\u201d yet the text of \u00a7 303(a) ends with a proviso that uses the term <em>\u201clabor organization\u201d </em>for the exact entity that the rest of that section discussed as a \u201csubordinate body.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Plainly, then, Congress used these terms interchangeably in \u00a7 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-13\">The two remaining sections of Title III are \u00a7\u00a7 302 and 304, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 462 and 464. Section 302, which was quoted in part at the beginning of this opinion, establishes the purposes for which a trus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>teeship may be imposed, and it is this section which appellees claim was violated when appellants placed Local 1959 under trusteeship. The other section, \u00a7 304, deals with procedural aspects of enforcing or challenging a trusteeship. Both of these sections use the term \u201csubordinate body,\u201d and thus appellees argue that there is a distinction between \u201csubordinate body\u201d and \u201clabor organization\u201d or \u201csubordinate labor organization.\u201d We cannot accept this literal interpretation of these two sections. As the Supreme Court has cautioned, labor legislation, and particularly the LMRDA, should not be construed literally but rather \u201cagainst the background of its legislative history and in the light of the general objectives Congress sought to achieve.\u201d Wirtz v. Bottle Blowers Ass\u2019n., supra at 468, 88 S.Ct. at 646; National Woodwork Mfrs. v. NLRB, 386 U.S. 612, 619, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 18 L.Ed.2d 357 (1967). Appellees do not discuss the legislative history of the Act, and our examination of this history has revealed nothing to indicate that Congress intended to include public employee unions as subordinate bodies in \u00a7\u00a7 302 and 304 while explicitly excluding them from the rest of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">In summary, after considering the legislative history of the LMRDA, its express exclusion of public employee unions from the definition of \u201clabor organization\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 3(e), (i) and (j), its failure to regulate these unions in the other five titles of the Act, the use of the term \u201csubordinate labor organization\u201d in \u00a7 301, and the interchangeability of the terms \u201clabor organization\u201d and \u201csubordinate body\u201d in \u00a7 303, the only conclusion which we can reasonably reach is that public employee unions are not covered by the phrase \u201csubordinate body\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 302 and 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and this case is remanded to the district court so that the complaint may be dismissed in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1225-10\">. While it appears that the trusteeship in question was imposed only over Local 1959, there existed at the same time an unchartered organization known as New Jersey County and Municipal Council No. 01 which had been dfesigned as the successor of Local 1959. The district court found that Council No. 61 was a viable entity having a de facto existence, and that it and Local 1959 constituted a hybrid organization. Accordingly, all references to Local 1959 in this opinion shall he deemed to include Council No. 61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1225-20\">.
