The Commission opinion is reported as Charles A. Haskell, 36 F.C.C.2d 78 (1972). The sole issue propounded in both appeals is identical to that which was before the court in Hartford Communications Committee v. FCC, 151 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 467 F.2d 408, 410 (1972): \u201c[W]hether the Commission could reasonably conclude that appellants had not raised substantial and material questions of fact which would make a <em>prima facie </em>showing that Commission approval of the license assignment would not be in the public interest. Put more succinctly the issue is whether an evidentiary hearing was necessary.\u201d <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(d) (1970). We find that no hearing was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-14\">KBTR (AM), wholly owned by the late John C. Mullins since 1961, is a five kilowatt station providing twenty-four hour radio service to the Denver metropolitan area. Following several unsuccessful attempts at alternative formats the station in 1967 adopted an \u201call news\u201d format, becoming the sole station in the Denver area to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *The \u201call news\u201d format received heavy television promotion over a Mullins owned television station, KBTV, and considerable print media promotion through utilization of a Mullins owned billboard company. KBTR (AM) nonetheless suffered considerable financial losses totaling nearly a half-million dollars,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and not long after Mr. Mullins\u2019 demise the executors of his estate entered into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>contract to sell the station to Mission Denver Company.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">. Mission Denver\u2019s proposal in its assignment application before the Commission to alter KBTR (AM)\u2019s format to \u201ccountry and western\u201d music engendered Petitions to Deny from Lakewood Broadcasting Service, Inc., the would-be primary competitor of KBTR (AM) in the Denver \u201ccountry and western\u201d market, and Colorado Citizens for Broadcasting,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a citizens association whose activities are \u201cdirected to scrutinizing the performance of the broadcast media in Colorado to assure maximum public service and accountability.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The petitioners jointly sought a hearing on the public interest ramifications of abandoning the unique \u201call news\u201d format, citing Citizens Committee v. FCC, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 109, 436 F.2d 263 (1970), and Lakewood additionally challenged the financial qualifications of Mission Denver. The Commission, in a painstakingly thorough decision, rejected the contention that a hearing was required and adjudged that the public interest would best be served by granting the assignment application.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">1. <em>Format Change</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\"> In Citizens Committee to Keep Progressive Rock v. FCC, 156 U.S.App.D.C.\u2014, 478 F.2d 926 (1973), also issued today, we have analyzed at some length the ramifications of the <em>Citizens Committee </em>decision. Where a \u201csignificant minority\u201d of those whom a station is obligated to serve voice discontent over a proposed entertainment format change, the format change becomes an issue to be dealt with by the Commission in its 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(a) (1970) determination that the assignment comports with public interest, convenience, and necessity. Consequently, factual disputes surrounding the format change are material, and if substantial become subject to the 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(e) (1970) hearing requirement. In <em>Progressive Rock </em>we also noted, however, the limited scope of review we exercise over the Commission\u2019s hearing determination, quoting from West Michigan Telecasters, Inc. v. FCC, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 39, 396 F.2d 688, 691 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-13\">Admittedly, the scope of our review is quite narrow; we defer to the expertise and experience of the Commission within its field of specialty and' would reverse only where the Commission\u2019s position is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. And it is clear that the decision of when hearings are necessary or desirable to clarify issues is one which lies in the first instance with the Commission. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-14\"><em>Progressive Rock, supra, </em>156 U.S.App.D.C. at\u2014n. 25, 478 F.2d at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-16\">All of our \u201cformat\u201d decisions to date have involved entertainment formats.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In light of the special public interest in news sources, <em>see </em>City of Camden, 18 F.C.C.2d 412, 423 (1969), and the analogy to the entertainment decisions in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>unusual situation where news is the \u201centertainment\u201d substance of the format, we feel that the logic of <em>Citizens Committee </em>and <em>Progressive Rock </em>most certainly applies to the case at hand. A close analysis of the record reveals, however, that no substantial and material facts are at issue, and therefore that the Commission could rightly make its public interest determination as to the format change without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Appellants claim that interview summaries submitted to the Commission \u2014 in compliance with the requirement that the applicant consult with community leaders, evaluate community problems based on those consultations, and program accordingly <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 were defective in that they failed to recite that many of the civic leaders interviewed favored retention of the \u201call news\u201d format. Appellants additionally allege that in some instances the interviewees were not informed of the proposed format change.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These actions, appellants claim, raise factual questions concerning the adequacy and accuracy of the community survey which can only be resolved in an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">The Commission found appellant\u2019s assertion to be based on a persistent \u201cmisreading of the purpose of ascertainment procedures,\u201d and stated that \u201cthe purpose of interviewing community leaders is to discover community <em>problems, not </em>to elicit program preferences.\u201d 36 F.C.C.2d at 84-85. We must agree. Clearly the Primer on Ascertainment of Community Problems by Broadcast Applicants, 27 F.C.C.2d 650, 682 (1971), elucidates that the ascertainment procedures are meant to determine the problems of the community, <em>e. g., </em>drug abuse, pollution, race relations, crime, as opposed to the programming preferences of the interviewees.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">In <em>Citizens Committee </em>we remanded for a hearing to resolve alleged discrepancies in the summaries of interviews with thirteen community leaders, and thus to determine if misrepresentation was more than just an allegation. The summaries at issue were submitted by the applicant-assignee to reflect fa-' vorable views toward the proposed new entertainment format, in an effort to offset mounting pressure being applied by citizens seeking to retain the old. To the extent that the summaries did not truly reflect the affiants\u2019 views regarding programming preferences \u2014 precisely the issue they were represented to influence \u2014 misrepresentation and appendant denial of the application were in issue. In the situation <em>sub judice, </em>however, statements of preference simply are not relevant to the ascertainment survey as presently constituted, and so the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the alleged misrepresentations regarding format preferences do not raise material issues of fact cannot be faulted. We adopt the Commission logic, 36 F.C.C.2d at 86:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8n\">[S]ince the Primer is not concerned with community leaders\u2019 views or program preferences, there is no basis for concluding Mission tried to mislead the Commission by not including interviewee comments on format choices in the consultation reports filed with the application. Given the Primer requirements, any factual questions raised by Mission\u2019s alleged failure to inform interviewees of the format change or to include their comments on such proposal are not substantial questions, and certainly not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>the <em>material </em>questions which are required before a hearing is needed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQL\">Appellants additionally complain that there exist material and substantial questions of fact concerning alternative sources of the \u201call news\u201d format<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the financial viability of the \u201call news\u201d format.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is enough to respond (without entering into a lengthy enumeration of facts and figures) that our study of the record shows that what really is being challenged is not the authenticity or accuracy of the surveys, composites, or economic reports, but rather the inferences which the Commission may draw therefrom. Certainly the' \u201cinferences to be drawn from facts already known and the legal conclusions to be derived from those facts\u201d may be made by the Commission without an evidentiary hearing.

The applicable standard established by the Commission in Ultravision Broadcasting Co., 1 F.C.C.2d 544, 546-47 (1965), places the burden on the applicant to show that it has the financial strength to withstand the costs of purchase and the first year of operation. The Commission estimated that some $2,079,900 would thus be needed, an estimate that is unchallenged. The Commission additionally estimated that $2,224,705 (some $180,000 less than applicant-assignee\u2019s estimate) would be available from the following sources: (1) a $2,000,000 loan, the existence of which is also unchallenged; (2) $192,087 in excess of current assets over current liabilities as shown on the consolidated balance sheet of Mission Broadcasting Company, Mission Denver\u2019s parent corporation; and (3) $46,435 in estimated profit from the first year of operation of KBTR (AM). 36 F.C.C.2d at 87-88. We find, notwithstanding the fact that the figures relied upo.n by the Commission in its extrapolations were several months old at the time of the decision,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that the Commission\u2019s determinations were sound and reasonable, especially in light of the fact that only $79,000 was really in issue. Finding such, we are bound to affirm. <em>See Hartford, supra, </em>467 F.2d at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">The determination of the Commission that no material and substantial questions of fact, existed, and so no evidentiary hearing was required, along with its conclusion that the public interest would be served by granting the application, is supported by substantial evidence in the record and is neither arbitrary, unreasonable, nor capricious.

Joint Brief of Intervenors at 36 n. 49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b992-4\">. In the Primer on Ascertainment of Community Problems by Broadcast Applicants, 27 F.C.C.2d 650, 679-80 (1971), the Commission points out that it was specifically \u201cexcluding] a question recommended . . . relating to the showing that must be made in cases where a station proposes to change its format.\u201d It did recognize, however, that Citizens Committee v. FCC, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 109, 436 F.2d 263 (1970), necessitated \u201cthat any application involving a <em>substantial change in program format </em>... be scrutinized\u201d and that \u201capplicants should be prepared to support their proposals to change formats in light of the needs and tastes of the community and the types of programming available from other stations.\u201d <em>See </em>Citizens Committee to Keep Progressive Rock v. FCC, 156 U.S.App.D.C. at\u2014, 478 F.2d at 926 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"An3\">The ascertainment survey is concerned with problems, not preferences and need not be the vehicle for supporting evidence regarding a program format alteration. This is especially true in light of the fact that unless a significant minority voices opposition to the format change \u201cthe Commission assumes \u2014 and properly so \u2014 that the new format is acceptable.\u201d Twin States Broadcasting, Inc., 35 F.C.C.2d 969, 974 (1972) (Commissioner Johnson, dissenting). <em>See Progressive Rock, supra, </em>156 U.S.App.D.C. at \u2014 n. 23, 478 F.2d at 926. Thus the absence of any references to preference in the ascertainment survey cannot be considered a misrepresentation. If the format change does become a public interest issue, however, and surveys <em>et al. </em>are submitted by the applicant \u201cto support [its] proposals to change formats,\u201d misrepresentations contained therein certainly become material. <em>See Gitiaens Committee, supra. </em>Also, should an applicant anticipate opposition and include references to program preferences in its ascertainment survey in an effort to supply videntiary support for its proposed change, hen if format change becomes a public interest issue any misrepresentations will become material. We are presented with neither of those situations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b992-15\">. The Commission found, 36 F.C.C.2d at 86, that the twenty other Denver area radio stations would provide a total of 291 hours and 39 minutes of radio news per week. <em>See </em>Jt.App. at 209-10. Two Denver area stations altered their formats to provide \u201call news\u201d in prime listening hours and have increased their news staffs and news gathering facilities. The Commission concluded, 36 F.C.C.2d at 87:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-16\">[T]he plethora of news services available in Denver, the prime time \u201call news\u201d services recently made available by Stations KGMC and KOA-AM, and the alternative balanced program format .proposed by Mission all justify the format change at KBTR. In making this judgment, we do not pretend that every demonstrated listener need or interest in Denver will be perfectly met. But as suggested before, we cannot guarantee that every broadcast need will be instantly ratified on a fixed frequency twenty-four hours per day. It is unreasonable to expect this, and the Communications Act neither requires nor authorizes such a result.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b992-17\">. In addition to the financial losses experienced over the past five years, <em>see </em>note 2 <em>supra, </em>increased operating expenses as a result of the disaffiliation with KBTV (sold to another buyer in compliance with the Commission\u2019s \u201cone-to-the-market\u201d policy), were a distinct possibility. <em>See </em>Jt.App. at 203.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b992-18\">. There have been advanced glimmerings of an argument that no Commission determination of the public interest can be made absent a survey of community preferences on the issue, similar to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>conducted in <em>Citizens Committee. </em>Certainly the extent of community support is an element to be considered by the Commission, but the <em>exact </em>proportions or degree of such support need not always be known prior to a reasoned determination. Here the case for allowing the format change, in view of financial considerations, alternative sources, and the broadcasting record of the assignee, was strong. Tlie Commission had to consider the public interest, but that does not in all situations require a survey to determine the exact degree of support for the old format.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b993-6\">.

One further note of explanation regarding our decisions in the area of the law explored today in <em>Progressive Rode </em>and <em>Lakewood Broadcasting </em>is in order. While we have recognized that format changes may impair the public\u2019s paramount interest in diversified programming, we have never attempted to set out specific guidelines for achieving the marketplace ideal. The first, tentative steps into this complex area of regulation must be taken by the Commission. The Commission, and perhaps rightly so, appears loathe to lightly undertake a task which smacks of establishing it as the \u201cnational arbiter of taste.\u201d The law in this area, following the lead of <em>Citizens Committee, </em>is in a state of transition. Whatever standards are set must remain flexible and open to new information and new understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">So far we have only pointed out on a case by case basis those circumstances in which the Commission must <em>take a closer look </em>at the result achieved by the give and take of the market environment and the business judgment of the licensee\u2014 and must test this result against the public interest in accommodating \u201call major aspects of contemporary culture.\u201d We do not here intimate any views on how the balance of competing public, and public and private, interests should be struck.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
