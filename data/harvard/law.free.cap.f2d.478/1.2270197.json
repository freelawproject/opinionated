(Hoffmann), has brought this special statutory proceeding against the Honorable Richard G. Kleindienst, Attorney General of the United States, and John E. Ingersoll, Director of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs of the United States Department of Justice (respondents), to review a Final Order issued by the Director, filed on February 5, 1971 (36 Fed.Reg. 2555 (1971)l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The proceedings were commenced pursuant to \u00a7 201 (v) of the 1965 Amendments to the \u201cFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act <em>\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and were proceeded with under the \u201cComprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970.\u201d Title II of the 1970 Act deals with the control of drugs and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>separately entitled the \u201cControlled Substances Act,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Review is sought pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 371(f) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, formerly Section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Chlordiazepoxide<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Librium) and diazepam (Valium) are described as a new class of drugs which differ chemically from barbiturates and other drugs known at the time of their synthesis. Librium has been in general medical use since 1960 and Valium since 1963. In 1966 at the original hearing before the Bureau it was estimated that over fifteen million patients had taken Librium and over five million patients had received doses of Valium. The 1965 Act set up special controls over the prescription and distribution of \u201cdepressant and stimulant drugs.\u201d Depressant or stimulant drugs\u201d were defined to include barbiturates, amphetamines, and any other drug which the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare designated by regulation\u2019 as having a notential for abuse because of its depressant or stimulant effect on the central nervous system.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The legislative history of the Act must be referred to. Very relevant to that history is the Final Report of the President\u2019s Advisory Commission on Narcotics and Drug Abuse, at 2 (1963), which states: \u201cWhen this report speaks of \u2018drug addiction\u2019 it is using the term in its full technical sense to include both the psychological and the physical dependence. When it speaks of \u2018drug abuse\u2019 it is referring to the broader problem which includes also those drugs which create only psychological dependency. We will use the term \u2018drug abuse\u2019 in this report as existing when an individual takes psychotoxic drugs under any of the following circumstances: (a) in amounts sufficient to create a hazard to his own health or to the safety of the community; or (b) when he obtains drugs through illicit channels; or (e) when he takes drugs on his own initiative rather than on the basis of professional advice. Drug abuse today involves not only the narcotic drugs and marihuana, but to an increasingly alarming extent other drugs such as the barbiturates, the amphetamines and even certain of the \u2018tranquilizers.\u2019 This latter group will be referred to in this report as the \u2018dangerous drugs.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Regulation 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 166.2(e) (1967), follows the Final Report of the President\u2019s Advisory Commission on Narcotics and Drug Abuse, <em>supra </em>at 2, and states in part as follows: \u201c(e) The Commissioner may determine that a substance has a potential for abuse because of its depressant or stimulant effect on the central nervous system or its hallu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>cinogenic effect if: (1) There is. evidence that individuals are taking the drug or drugs containing such a substance in amounts sufficient to create a hazard to their health or to the safety of other individuals or of the community; or (2) There is significant diversion of the drug or drugs containing such a substance from legitimate drug channels; or (3) Individuals are taking the drug or drugs containing such a substance on their own initiative rather than on the basis of medical advice from a practitioner licensed, by law to administer such drugs in the course of his professional practice * *</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">This case was begun by a proposed regulation filed by Acting Commissioner Rankin on January 17, 1966.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6*31 Fed. Reg. 565 (1966). The issues presented by this, the present proceeding, were stated to be as follows in the notice of May 16, 1966:1<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c1. Whether there is evidence that individuals are taking the drug or drugs [Librium or Valium] containing such substances in amounts sufficient to create a hazard to their health or to the safety of other individuals or of the community; 2. Whether there is evidence of significant diversion of the drug or drugs [Librium or Valium] containing such substances from legitimate drug channels; 3. Whether there is evidence that individuals are taking the drug or drugs [Librium or Valium] containing such substances on their own initiative rather than \u2022 on the basis of medical advice from a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs' in the course of his professional practice; and 4. Whether, if chlordiazepoxide [Librium] has been the subject- of abuse, diazepam [Valium], a newer drug, is so related to it as to make it likely that the drug will have the same potentiality for abuse.\u201d 31 Fed.Reg. 7174 (1966) The proceeding culminated in the Final Order of Director Ingersoll filed February 5, 1971,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ruling that chlordiazepoxide and its salts, and diazepam, respectively Librium and Valium, were depressant drugs having a potential for abuse because of their depressant effect on the central nervous system. This is the order which we review here. If the order is sustained, Librium and Valium, already available only upon prescriptions of licensed physicians, will be subject to additional record-keeping, inspection, regulation, and labeling requirements by legitimate channels of distribution. Moreover, illicit, <em>i. e., </em>non-allowable, possession and distribution would be illegal and subject to criminal sanctions as is presently the case in respqet to barbiturates and amphetamines, commonly considered as \u201cdepressant\u201d and \u201cstimulant\u201d drugs. Hoffmann concedes that Librium is a depressant drug. \u201cThe conclusion that Librium has a depressant effect is not controverted.\u201d Hoffmann\u2019s brief at 9. Hoffmann objected to Librium and Valium being made subject to regulation, filed its petition for review and injunctive relief, and this court stayed Director Ingersoll\u2019s- Final Order until our disposition of the case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">The issues presented are rather hard to frame for they are differently stated by the parties. Hoffmann asserts in its brief at 1-2: \u201cThe issues are whether the order of the Director should be held unlawful and set aside because \u2014 (1) the order is in excess of statutory authority or limitation in that it employs a decisional standard different from that established by Congress; (2) the conclusions as to chlordiazepoxide (Librium) are not supported by adequate findings or substantial evidence on the whole record; (3) the listing of diazepam (Valium) cannot be based on the experience with Librium, and the conclusions as to Valium are not supported by adequate findings or substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>on the whole record; and (4) the order was issued without observance of procedure required by law and due process.\u201d The respondents\u2019 \u201cCounterstatement of the Issues Presented for Review\u201d is as follows: \u201c1. Whether the findings of the Director, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, that Librium and Valium are \u2018depressant drugs\u2019 subject to control under the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, are supported by substantial evidence of record. 2. Whether the Administrative order listing Librium and Valium as drugs subject to control under the Drug Abuse [Control] Amendments of 1965 should be set aside on the ground that it was entered without due process of law.\u201d Another issue which we disignate as \u201c(3)\u201d and which must be discussed is whether the proceedings before the Director were \u201crule making\u201d or \u201cadjudication,\u201d as defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(5) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(7)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">We deal first with this case on the basis of the evidence which was before the Director, without regard to the matters discussed under the later headings of this opinion. Hoffmann contends that the Director\u2019s order is based on a deci-sional standard different from that established by the statute and that the agency has not met the requirements of the applicable statutes in that \u201c \u2018[1] the agency must make findings that support its decision and [2] those findings must be supported by substantial evidence.\u2019 [Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 [83 S.Ct. 239, 9 L.Ed.2d 207] (1962)] Moreover, mere \u2018conclusionary statements . . . are not the sort of findings which enable [the Court] intelligently to pass upon the correctness of the judgment reached.\u2019 \u2018The agency\u2019s findings must be sufficiently definite to enable the courts to perform the task of judicial review.\u2019 [Braniff Airways, Inc. v. Civil Aeronautics Board [113 U.S.App.D.C. 132] 306 F.2d 739, 742 (D.C.Cir. 1962)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">The applicable law is cogently set out by Judge Butzner in Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Gardner, 417 F.2d 1086 (4 Cir. 1969), in which Carter-Wallace, Inc. attacked a Food and Drug Administration order subjecting meprobamate to control as a depressant drug. The court stated: \u201cIn selecting \u2018potential for abuse\u2019 as one of the criteria for subjecting a drug to special control, the House Committee did not intend this to be determined on the basis of the drug\u2019s having a potential for isolated or occasional nontherapeutic purposes. Instead, the committee recommended that a drug\u2019s potential for abuse should be determined \u2018on the basis of its having been demonstrated to have such depressant or stimulant effect on the central nervous system as to make it reasonable to assume that there is a substantial potential for the 'occurrence of significant diversions from legitimate drug channels, significant use by individuals contrary to professional advice, or substantial capability of creating hazards to the health of the user or the safety of the community.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">The principles of law and criteria enunciated in <em>Carter-Wallace, supra </em>at 1090, we believe to be sound and we adopt them.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The \u201cConclusions of Law\u201d reached by the Director are as follows:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u201c1. The Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 were intended to protect the public health and safety by establishing special controls for depressant and stimulant drugs. This protection was to be accomplished through increased record keeping and inspection requirements, through providing for control over intrastate traffic in these drugs because of its effect on interstate traffic, and through making possession of these drugs, other than by the user, illegal outside of the legitimate channels of commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u201c2. Chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and diazepam (Valium) are drugs with a depressant effect on the central nervous system. They may be legitimately dispensed only upon the prescription of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs, and in full conformity with section 503(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u201c3. The substantial, probative, and reliable evidence of record establishes that chlordiazepoxide (Librium) due to its depressant effect on the central nervous system has been abused in the past in the following ways:</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\u201c(a) There has been significant use of chlordiazepoxide (Librium) in amounts sufficient to create a hazard to the health of the individual and to the safety of other individuals and the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">\u201c(b) There has been significant diversion of chlordiazepoxide (Librium) from legitimate channels.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">\u201c(c) There has been significant use of Librium by individuals on their own initiative rather than on the basis of medical advice from a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs in the course of his professional practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">\u201c4. Due to the past history of abuse of chlordiazepoxide (Librium), because of its established capacity to substitute for other sedative drugs which are known to be abused and which are now subject to increased controls of the amendments, it is reasonable to conclude that the abuse of chlordiazepoxide (Librium) will continue to increase unless this drug is similarly brought under the control of the amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">\u201c5. The substantial, probative, and reliable evidence of record establishes that diazepam (Valium) due to its depressant effect upon the central nervous system has been abused in the past in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">\u201c(a) There has been significant use of diazepam in amounts sufficient to create a hazard to the health of the individual and to the safety of other individuals and the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-15\">\u201c(b) There has been significant use of diazepam (Valium) by individuals on their own initiative rather than on the basis of medical advice from a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs in the course of his professional practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-16\">\u201c6. Diazepam (Valium), the newer drug, is so related to chlordiazepoxide (Librium), a drug for which there is considerable evidence of continuing abuse as to make it likely that it will have the same potentiality for abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-17\">\u201c7. Due to past history of abuse of diazepam (Valium), because of its close relation to chlordiazepoxide (Librium), and because of its established capacity to substitute for other sedative drugs which are known to be abused and which are now subject to controls under the provisions of the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, it is reasonable to conclude that the abuse of diazepam (Valium) will continue to increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-18\">\u201c8. Chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and diazepam (Valium) are drugs which because of their depressant effect on the central nervous system, have a substantial potential for significant abuse within the meaning of the Amendments, 21 U.S.C. 321(v)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\u201c9. Chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and diazepam (Valium) are \u2018depressant or stimulant drugs\u2019 within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 321 (v), and are therefore subject to the provisions of 21 U.S.C. 360a. Any drug which contains any quantity of chlordiazepoxide or diazepam is a \u2018depressant or stimulant drug\u2019 within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 321(v)(3) and is also subject to the provisions of 21 U.S. C. 360a.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><em>\u201cTherefore, it is ordered, </em>That the stay of effectiveness announced May 17, 1966 (31 F.R. 7174), on the listing of chlordiazepoxide and its salts and diaze-pam in \u00a7 166.3(c)(1) [redesignated \u00a7 320.3(e)(1)] as a drug subject to control under the Amendments by the order of March 19, 1966 (31 F.R. 4679), be ended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The last paragraph of this order brought its terms into effect until stayed by the order of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The amount of evidence presented in this ease has been enormous. The Findings of Fact contained in the Final Order of the Director, as set out hereinafter, and the references to their supporting evidence, we deem to be sufficient for the purposes of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\u201c1. The benzodiazepines, of which chlordiazepoxide (Librium) was the first synthesized, are a new class of drugs, different chemically from the barbiturates or any other drugs known at the time of their syntheses (Zbinden, Tr. 2080-84; R-142C; R-119; Lofft, Tr. 531).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">\u201c2. Chlordiazepoxide (Librium) is a benzodiazepine compound with the following chemical formula: 7-chloro-2-methylamino-5-phenyl-3H-l, 4-benzodi-azepine 4-oxide hydrochloride. It is a colorless crystalline substance; is soluble in water and its molecular weight is 336.22 (R-119).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">\u201c3. Diazepam (Valium) is a benzodi-azepine derivative with the following chemical formula: 7-ehloro-l, 3-dihy-dro-l-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-l, 4-benzodi-azepine-2-one. It is a colorless crystalline compound insoluble in water and its molecular weight is 284.74 (R-120).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">\u201c4. Experimental studies of their effects in animals were conducted by the Respondent. These tests indicated that Librium and Valium are depressant drugs having a marked calming action on the central nervous system at lower doses. An increase in dose resulted in more pronounced effects on the central nervous system, i. e., drowsiness, motor incoordination or ataxia, and sleep. On the basis of specially designed experiments whereby excitation was induced by surgical or chemical means, or by putting the animals under stressful conditioned behavior situations, the benzo-diazepines produced an antiexcitatory effect at dose levels below those that caused neurotoxicity or over-sedation, thus suggesting a usefulness in the treatment of anxiety and tension. The benzodiazepines are not generally recognized as effective sedative-hypnotic agents within the normal dosage range. (Zbinden, Tr. 2199-2204; R-142; Lang (1963), R-145; Heise (1961), R-146).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">\u201c5. The Respondent also presented evidence concerning the results of experimental tests on animals, designed to determine the primary site of action of the benzodiazepines. Primary site of action is defined to mean to location in the brain where a drug at the lowest dose will produce an effect. It is believed that the primary site of action of these drugs is in the subcoritical structures of the brain. The precise site of action cannot be determined with certitude. Dr. Gerhard Zbinden of Roche Laboratories stated that their tests showed it to be in the hippocampus (Tr. 2187-88). However, Dr. Harold Himwich, another Respondent witness, testified that his tests showed that the area most sensitive to low doses of Librium and Valium, was in the transmission from the amygdala to the hippocampus (Tr. 2677). Moreover a doubling of the dose in these tests done at Roche . Laboratories resulted in the drug effect spreading to the cortex, the area of the brain associated with judgmental functions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>(Zbinden, Tr. 2187; R-142S). When the dose was further increased the whole brain was involved. (Tr. 2188).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u201c6. Librium and Valium are widely used in the treatment of anxiety and tension, as muscle relaxants, as anticon-vulsants, and as anti-depressants.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u201c7. Librium has been in general medical use since 1960. More than 6 billion capsules of the drug have been commercially distributed, and millions of patients have taken Librium since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (Bennett, Tr. 4135-36; R-222).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\u201c8. Librium is indicated whenever fear, anxiety and tension are significant components of the clinical profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">\u201cIn low oral doses, the drug is effective in mild to moder\u00e1te anxiety and tension, tension headache, pre- and post-operative apprehension, premenstrual tension and menstrual stress, chronic alcoholism, behavior disorders in children, and whenever anxiety and tension are concomitants of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, gynecologic or der-matologic disorders.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">\u201cSkeletal muscle spasticity (resulting from spinal cord injury, congenital or acquired brain damage) and other debilitating neuro-museular disorders such as dystonia and athetosis frequently respond to Librium. Painful muscle spasm associated with myositis, fibrosi-tis, bursitis, tenosynovitis, arthritis, fractures, intervertebral disc syndrome, whiplash injury, low back pain or postural strains is often benefited when emotional factors are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">\u201cIn higher oral doses, Librium is of value in the more severe anxiety and tension states, agitated depression and ambulatory psychoneuroses (e. g., acute and chronic anxiety states, phobias, obsessive-compulsive reactions and schizoid behavior disorders). In addition, it may be useful in certain types of acute agitation due to chronic alcoholism or alcoholic withdrawal (including delirium tre-mens), hysterical or panic states, paranoid states and acute stages of schizophrenia (R-119).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">\u201c9. Diazepam (Valium) is of use in dealing with anxiety reactions stemming from stressful circumstances or whenever somatic complaints ' are concomitants of emotional factors. It is useful in psychoneurotic states manifested by anxiety, tension, fear and fatigue. Valium may also be useful in acute agitation due to alcohol withdrawal. Valium may be of use to alleviate muscle spasm associated with cerebral palsy and athe-tosis (R-119).\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">Finding 15, 36 Fed.Reg., at 2556, states: \u201cSubstantial evidence of record establishes that individuals have developed psychic dependence to Librium and Valium. The uncontested testimony of physicians was that patients find the two drugs pleasant to take. (Murray, Tr. 364; Barten, Tr. 454; Evans, Tr. 813-15, 829-30). They provide an inner sensorial feeling that is gratifying to the patient (Uzee, Tr. 907). Patients were reported to have been apprehensive about being without their supply of the medication and expressed to their physicians a reluctance to come off the drugs. Individuals have attempted unsuccessfully to discontinue taking Librium and Valium when a dependency has developed. Still other patients have gone to excessive lengths to maintain their supply of the two drugs. (Lofft, Tr. 1560; Evans, Tr. 817, 825; Uzee, Tr. 905-06; Galen, Tr. 1443-48; Chelton, Tr. 1672; Williams, Tr. 1757-59; Guile (1963), G-14; Lingjerde (1965), G-55; Wenkstetten (1965), G-91, Table 3; Kranz (1965), G-94, pp. 8-9). This experience confirms the opinion expressed by experts that Librium and Valium are drugs to which individuals can and do develop psychic dependence. (Eddy, Tr. \u00cd077; Isabell [sic], Tr. 1552-54; Eddy, et al. (1965), G-81, 727.\u201d An examination of the citations of Finding 15 shows that there is substantial evidence that individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>have developed psychic dependence to Librium and Valium. Therefore, one of the elements necessary for a demonstration of \u201csubstantial potential for significant abuse\u201d is present as found by the Director. True, there is evidence to the contrary, as the Director acknowledges in his Finding of Fact 16, but we are not judges of the evidence for the reasons set out hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">We think it is well established that drugs which are capable of producing euphoria are peculiarly susceptible to being abused. Finding of Fact 17 of the Final Order defines \u201cEuphoria\u201d as \u201can exaggerated sense of well being.\u201d (21 C.F.R. 166.2(e)(2) (1967). \u201cThe evidence establishes that euphoria has been reported following use of Librium and Valium. (Barten, Tr. 454; Chambers, Tr. 1628; Domino, Tr. 4617; Zbinden et al. (1961), R-118, pp. 627, 634; Guile (1963), G-14, p. 57; Towler 'et al. (1962), R-73, 833; Darling (1963), G-48, p. 502.\u201d 36 Fed.Reg., at 2556. Checking out these citations we find there is sufficient evidence to support the finding that Librium and Valium produce euphoria albeit the evidence in this respect cannot be characterized as very ample or very persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u201cTolerance\u201d is described in Finding of Fact 19 as \u201c . .\u2019 . an adaptive process which contributes to abuse because, where it exists, a person tends continually to increase the amount of drug being taken. Tolerance has developed when, after repeated administration, a given dose of a drug produces a decreasing effect or conversely when increasingly larger doses must be administered to obtain the effects observed with the original dose (Jaffe (1965), R-113, p. 285; Deneau, Tr. 1009).\u201d 36 Fed.Reg., at 2557. We accept this definition. Finding of Fact 22 states: \u201cThe evidence establishes that it is possible to develop tolerance to Librium and Valium but that it has not been frequently observed or reported.\u201d But the same finding states: \u201cThere was . . . evidence that patients have increased their dosage in order to maintain relief of anxiety (Uzee, Tr. 913, 919; Mr. E, Tr. 494-95; Lingjerde (1965), G-55, p. 3). To date however, there have been few such reports in the medical literature and Respondent\u2019s witnesses have testified that tolerance to Librium and Valium has not been encountered in extensive use over many years (Gibbs, Tr. 2263-64; D. Feldman, Tr. 2532-33; Bercel, Tr. 2653-54, 2657; Scherbel, Tr. 2821; Goldman, Tr. 2914; Friend, Tr. 2937; Cohen, Tr. 3218, 3220; Schwab, Tr. 3383-84; D. Feldman, Tr. 3682; Knott, Tr. 3716; D\u2019Agostino, Tr. 3817; Stanfield, Tr. 3844; Snell, Tr. 3884; Smith, Tr. 3924; Schiele, Tr. 4033; Greenberg, Tr. 4060).\u201d 36 Fed.Reg., at 2557. The evidence of tolerance developing from repeated doses of Librium and Valium is not too strong, and if we had this case <em>de novo </em>we would not make the finding as did the Director on the citations of evidence stated in the finding. However, the statement made by the Director in Finding 22 that the evidence does establish that it is possible to develop tolerance to Librium and Valium is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Another factor in determining a drug\u2019s potential for abuse is the existence of withdrawal symptoms. As to withdrawal symptoms associated with Librium and Valium, Finding 34 seems to us to be conclusive. That Finding states: \u201cDr. John G. Lofft, a psychiatrist and specialist in the treatment of alcoholism and allied addictions, testified that the abstinence syndrome associated with Librium and Valium withdrawal compares to that experienced after abrupt withdrawal from barbiturates (Tr. 550). It is characterized in its mildest form by insomnia and increased anxiety (Tr. 548-49). When the patient has been taking elevated doses for long periods of time the withdrawal syndrome is marked by restlessness, tremulousness, muscle pains, perspiration, hallucinations, and sometimes, although not frequently, convulsive seizures (Tr. 540, 543, 547). The severity of the withdrawal is dependent upon the degree of dependence, and the amount of drug the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>person has been taking (Tr. 551-52; Jaffe (1965), R-133, p. 289). Librium-Valium withdrawal differs from the barbiturate withdrawal syndrome in that it persists over a longer period of time (Lofft, Tr. 550-51).\u201d 36 Fed.Reg., at 2558. There is ample evidence to support this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Finding 38 seems to supply a strong basis for the regulation proposed under the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965. It is as follows: \u201cThere was some evidence indicating that Librium may produce a paradoxical rage reaction, i. e., an excitable and exhilarated state whereby the individual may become a danger to himself and to others. This reaction has been manifested in isolated instances by a hostile and irritable mood to a point where the person taking Librium has become violent and has physically threatened the lives of others (Murray, Tr. 355-56, 357-59, 360-63; Barten, Tr. 447; Lofft, Tr. 558; Gibbs, Tr. 2254-55; Stanfield, Tr. 3860-61; Murray (1962), G-24; Bowes (1965), G-44, p. 338; Krakowski (1963), G \u2014 51, p. 49; Dean (1962), R-70, p. 4).\u201d 36 Fed.Reg., at 2558. An examination of the citations supports the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">Is there a substantial potential for occurrence of significant divergence from legitimate drug channels, significant use by individuals of Librium and Valium contrary to professional advice, or substantial capability of creating hazards to the health of the user and the safety of the community? See again H.R.Rep. No. 130, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1965), set out above.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">There is evidence which supports Finding 40 that pharmacists are distributing amounts of Librium without authorization from physicians, i.e., substantial diversion from legitimate drug channels. Finding 40 is as follows: \u201cThe evidence indicates that some pharmacists are distributing amounts of Librium without authorization from physicians. During a 5-year period extending from 1961 through 1965, U.S. Food and Drug Administration records show that there were 35 completed prosecutions involving the drug chlordiazepoxide, all of which were terminated in convictions. These 35 eases involved 132 illegal buys of the drug, made either without a prescription or as requests for a refill when no refill was authorized. Investigations in three of these cases were initiated following complaints that a druggist had illegally dispensed Librium (Clevenger, Tr. 1846). At the close of the investigations in 14 of these cases, Food and Drug Inspectors checked the records, invoices, and prescription files of the drugstores involved. On the basis of investigation it was estimated that in each case between 47 percent and 100 percent of the pharmacies\u2019 supply of chlordiaze-poxide had bgen dispensed without authorization of a physician. An average of 75 percent of the total amount of the drug dispensed by the pharmacists involved in these instances could not be accounted for. This amounted to over 54,000 capsules (Clevenger, Tr. 1799-1807, 1815, 1834-36; G-268). See also Ashcraft, Tr. 1158, 1519; Witness X, Tr. 1895-97 for other evidence to the same effect.\u201d 36 Fed.Reg., at 2558. See also Findings 41 to 46, inclusive. 36 Fed.Reg., at 2559. All of these findings are amply supported by evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">Hoffmann places great emphasis on 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, formerly \u00a7 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act which provides that a reviewing court must \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions\u201d found to be \u201ccontrary to constitutional right,\u201d \u201cin excess of statutory . . . authority,\u201d \u201cwithout observance of procedure required by law,\u201d or \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d The section further requires that, \u201cIn making the foregoing determinations, the court shall review the whole record. . . . \u201d We do not disagree, nor do the respondents, with the statement of the law. We have reached the conclusion that the Director\u2019s Final Order and his Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law are in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, and we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>compelled to the conclusion, as was he, that Librium is a drug having a depressant effect on the central nervous system (as conceded) and that it has a substantial potential for significant abuse. We believe that it must be conceded that Valium, a diazepam, has a stronger and more positive effect on persons ingesting it than does Librium. While Valium has a different chemical formula the differences are not qualitatively significant enough to cause us to conclude that the effects attributed to Valium would be other than of stronger potentialities than those attributed to Librium. We cannot conclude that Valium requires a separate hearing on a new and perhaps more detailed record than that which is presently before us.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">This opinion could have been terminated at the conclusion of the previous heading \u201cI.\u201d were it not that other points remain for discussion and disposition. Hoffmann asserts that the Director\u2019s order was issued without observance of procedure required by law and without due process of law. This brings us to a critical issue in this case, whether the proceedings were \u201crule making\u201d or \u201cadjudication\u201d as defined, respectively, in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(5) or 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(7). Whether they were rule making or adjudication, the ultimate standard against which we must evaluate the fairness of the proceedings is due process of law. Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 767, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968); Morgan v. United States, 304 U.S. 1, 18, 58 S.Ct. 773, 82 L.Ed. 1129 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">(a) Hoffmann contends that the proceedings were essentially adjudicatory and that the participation of the Government\u2019s trial counsel in the preparation of the Director\u2019s tentative and final orders therefore contravened the separation of functions principle as enunciated by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554 and violated Hoff-mann\u2019s right to due process.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>554(d) contains the following language: \u201cAn employee or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for an agency in a case may not, in that or a factually related case, participate or advise in the decision, recommended decision or agency review. . . . \u201d Congress has limited the above restriction to adjudicatory proceedings, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(a), and \u201c[t]he conclusion seems to be rather solid that no law requires the [Director] to separate functions in rule making for which on-the-record hearings are required.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The line dividing adjudication and rule making is, unfortunately, not always entirely clear, and this is true in the case at bar. However, consideration of the relevant factors leads us to conclude that the challenged procedures were rule making.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Here the final order will- apply across the board to all producers, wholesalers, and distributors of Librium and Valium, as well as to pharmacies and physicians. Hoffmann was not singled out for special consideration based on its own peculiar circumstances. The fact that Hoff-mann may be one of those adversely affected explains the highly adversary character of the proceeding but does not change the generalized nature of the order. Although the proceeding involved a concrete factual situation from which factual inferences provided the basis for the Director\u2019s order, the facts and inferences therefrom were used to formulate a basically legislative-type judgment of entirely prospective application. Compare United States v. Florida East Coast Railway Company, 410 U.S. 224, 93 S.Ct. 810, 35 L.Ed.2d 223 (1973). Since the proceedings were thus in substance rule making, the separation of prosecuting and decision-making functions was not required. Willapoint Oysters, Inc. v. Ewing, 174 F.2d 676 (9 Cir.1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">(b) Hoffmann contends that the Director relied on evidence not of record. On November 4, 1969, the day before oral argument was to commence before the Hearing Examiner, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit handed down its decision in Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Gardner, <em>supra, </em>affirming the Commissioner\u2019s use of \u201csubstantial potential for significant abuse\u201d in determining whether or not Meprobamate should be listed. At the conclusion of the oral argument, at the Director\u2019s order, Government counsel indicated a desire to submit additional evidence covering the three year period from the close of the original hearings, <em>viz., </em>November 18, 1966, to November 4, 1969. The Director requested counsel to attempt to arrive at a stipulation which would simplify any further proceedings. Such a stipulation was agreed to and presented to the Director in the form of a \u201cJoint Recommendation\u201d of counsel.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">The stipulation recites that four categories of documents which the Government would offer are \u201csubstantially similar to evidence previously submitted.\u201d The four categories were: \u201c(1) Cases, evidenced by hospital records, medical records and reports, and police records and reports, involving intentional overdoses of Librium or Valium, alone or in conjunction with other drugs, in an apparent attempt at suicide or in a suicidal gesture, (2) A more limited number of cases of the kind described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Category (1), in which death is alleged to have resulted from an intentional overdose of Librium or Valium, most of which also involved simultaneous ingestion of other drugs. (3) Reports of audits of retail drugstores undertaken by Federal or State officials which have shown shortages of Librium or Valium, some of which have resulted in administrative action against the pharmacists involved. (4) Police reports showing instances in which a person arrested for drug violations or for other reasons was found to have Librium or Valium in his possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The stipulation also provided, \u201cThe cases which would be evidenced by these documents appear to be substantially similar to those already in evidence in the prior hearing and do not appear to differ significantly in their nature or frequency of occurrence from those already in evidence. Therefore, this evidence seems cumulative, except to the extent that it indicates that instances of the kind already in evidence have continued to occur since the hearing.\u201d The stipulation provided<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that the documents referred to were not to be put in evidence and that the supplemental hearing was to be limited to the question of the use of Librium and Valium in conjunction with the abuse of other drugs. The documents were not offered and are not of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Ploffmann asserts that all that is of record is the description of their nature and contents quoted immediately above but that nonetheless the Director\u2019s Final Order refers to the Joint Recommendation and states: \u201c \u2018As a consequence, evidence relating to intentional overdoses and attempted suicides; evidence concerning suicides and other deaths <em>in which the drugs played a significant role; </em>reports of audits of retail drugstores <em>detailing significant shortages which could not be legitimately accounted for; </em>and police reports showing instances in which the drugs were discovered by police during their investigation of drug and other criminal offenses <em>suggesting use and distribution outside of the legitimate channels, </em>were neither to be presented nor rebutted by either side. . . .\u2019 (Emphasis added.)\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The point made by Hoffmann is that the order, to quote its brief which states the petitioner\u2019s position succinctly, \u201cdoes not disclose how the Director, who is supposed never to have seen them, concluded that these documents showed that the deaths were ones \u2018in which the drugs played a significant role\u2019; or how he concluded that the audits of retail drugstores showed \u2018significant shortages which could not be legitimately accounted for\u2019; or how he concluded that possession of the drugs by persons arrested suggested' \u2018use and distribution outside of the legitimate channels\u2019 \u2014 since such characterizations do not appear in the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">\u201cThe comments indicate one of two situations: <em>either the Director read and made an evaluation of the documents, without Roche </em>[Hoffmann] <em>having an opportunity to rebut them or offer evidence as to their significance, or the order was written by the attorneys who had collected the documents for use in their case in behalf of the </em>Government.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Neither circumstance is consistent with due process.\u201d (Emphasis supplied), citing West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, 294 U.S. 63, 55 S.Ct. 316, 79 L.Ed. 761 (1935); Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, 301 U.S. 292, 57 S.Ct. 724, 81 L.Ed. 1093 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">The point asserted by Hoffmann is without merit. The emphasis put upon the word \u201csignificant\u201d in the Director\u2019s final order as quoted above is in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>nothing more than an echo, a reverberation of that adjective as used in the Hearing Examiner\u2019s Supplemental Report of Findings and Conclusions Re Potential for Abuse of Librium and Valium used Conjunctively with Other Drugs, dated November 6, 1970, Preliminary Statement, \u201cA. Scope of Supplemental Hearing,\u201d where the limitations on the scope of the supplemental hearing are given as follows: \u201cThe limitations on the scope of the supplemental hearing were in direct response to a joint recommendation made to the Director by counsel for the Government and counsel for Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc. (Respondent). As indicated in the joint recommendation, the presentation by the Government of other evidence of abuse, together with Respondent\u2019s rebuttal evidence, would have inordinately protracted the hearings. Additionally, for the most part, such evidence would have been cumulative; that is, showing a continuation of circumstances existing at the time of the prior hearing in 1966. As a consequence, evidence relating to intentional overdoses and attempted suicides; evidence concerning suicides and other deaths in which the drugs played a <em>significant </em>role; reports of audits of retail drugstores detailing <em>significant </em>shortages which could <em>not be </em>legitimately accounted for; and police reports showing instances in which the drugs were discovered by police during their investigation of drug and other criminal offenses suggesting use and distribution outside of the legitimate channels, were neither presented nor rebutted by either side inasmuch as essentially the same type of evidence had already been adduced at the prior hearing.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-17\">The comments upon which Hoffmann rests its point included in the Proposed Supplemental Findings of Fact were not objected to in the exhaustive list of exceptions which Hoffmann later filed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Aside from the foregoing, the Director\u2019s conclusions to which Hoffmann now objects are amply supported by the stipulation from the evidence of record in the original hearings. See letter of January 7, 1972, from Allan P. Mackinnon, Esquire, attorney for respondents, to Clerk Quinn, at 2.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-18\">The record therefore does not support Hoffmann\u2019s contention that there was a surreptitious display of documents and evidence to the Director by his staff which enabled him to reach the conclusions respecting the three-year period from the close of the original hearing on November 18, 1966 to November 4, 1969, without Hoffmann having an opportunity to rebut the evidence or to offer evidence. And even if the staff attorneys who had collected the documents for use in their case on behalf of the Government had participated in preparing the Director\u2019s order, such participation was not improper in connection with the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>making procedures involved here. See subsection (a) of II., <em>supra. </em>Hoffmann cannot support its assertion of lack of due process on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">(c) Hoffmann makes further weighty contentions that the proceedings were conducted without observance of procedure required by law and without due process of law. These contentions must be stated along with what we deem to be the law applicable thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">As we pointed out in our earlier opinion, \u00a7 706(d)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 376(d)(2), provides that \u201cany report, recommendations, underlying data, and reasons certified to the Secretary by an advisory committee . . . shall be made a part of the record of any hearing if relevant and material, subject to the provisions of section 7 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d 464 F.2d 1068, 1069. The casual refusal of the Hearing Examiner to admit this material and the strong objection of the Government to making it part of the record seems without justification and we deem it to be totally unacceptable as a principle of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The Order, 21 C.F.R., Part 166, commencing the present proceedings regarding Librium and Valium, headed \u201cDepressant and Stimulant Drugs; Proposed listing of Additional Drugs Subject to Control\u201d states: \u201cThe Commissioner of Food and Drugs proposes, on the basis of his investigations and recommendations of an advisory committee appointed pursuant to section 511(g) (1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that the drugs set forth below be listed as depressant or stimulant drugs within the meaning of section 201 (v) of the Act. Therefore, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 201 (v), 511, 701, 52 Stat. 1055, as amended, 79 Stat. 227 et seq.; 21 U.S.C. 321 (v), 360a, 371) and under the authority delegated by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to the Commissioner (21 CFR 2.90), it is proposed that Part 166 be amended by adding thereto \u00a7 166.-3(b) and (c), as follows: \u00a7 166.3 Listing of drugs defined in section 201 (v) of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">* *****</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">\u201c(e) The Commissioner has investigated and designates all drugs, unless exempted by regulations in this part, containing any amount of the following substances as having a potential for abuse because of their:</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">\u201c(1) Depressant effect on the central nervous system:</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">\n<em>Established Name Some trade and other names</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">Chloral hydrate Chloral.</p>\n<p id=\"A5s\">\n<em>Chlordiazepoxide and its salts Librium.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">\n<em>Diazepam Valium.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"As\">Ethchlorvynol Placidyl.</p>\n<p id=\"AO\">Ethinamate Valmid.</p>\n<p id=\"AR6\">Glutethimide Doriden.</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">Meprobamate Miltown, Equanil, Meprotabs.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">Methyprylon Noludar.</p>\n<p id=\"Au5\">Paraldehyde</p>\n<p id=\"b84-26\">\u201cAll \u25a0 interested persons are invited to submit their views in writing regarding the proposal published herein.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>At a pre-hearing conference of August 1, 1966, counsel for the petitioner stated to Examiner Buttle:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u201cMr. Finney: I called to the attention of the presiding officer that in the order, the original order, listing these drugs, which I believe is the General Exhibit A, the Commissioner of Food and Drug recited as follows: \u2018The Commissioner of Food and Drugs proposes, on the basis of his investigations and the recommendations of an advisory committee appointed pursuant to section 511(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, that the drugs set forth below be listed as depressant or stimulant drugs within the meaning of Section 201 (v) of the act\u2019 [sic].</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u201cIn view of the fact that an advisory committee was utilized in this case under a specific section of the statute and the regulation we would like to move that the presiding officer require the Government to furnish us data as to that advisory committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u201cSpecifically, we would like to have all the materials, information and data relevant to the listing of Librium and Valium as drugs having a potential for abuse, which was furnished to the advisory committee for its consideration or used by the advisory committee in its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u201cSecondly, we would like to have the minutes of the advisory committee\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">\u201cThird, we would like to have a copy of the report of the advisory committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">\u201cFourth, we would like to have any memoranda or other recommendations from the Bureau of Medicine to the Commissioner relative to the report of the advisory committee or the recommendations of the Bureau as to the reasons for the inclusions of Librium and Valium in the list of drugs having a potential for abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">\u201cI would point out to the presiding officer that the section of the regulations which deals with the use of an advisory committee makes the delivery of these materials automatic. In the ease-where the original proposal for a rule comes from a party other than the Commissioner and he then elects to resort to an advisory committee then the regulation is very specific as to copies of all these documents being given to the person requesting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">\u201cIn the case of an advisory committee that is appointed by the Commissioner of Food and Drug other than on the request of a party, the same automatic requirement does not exist in the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">\u201cHowever, there is this provision with respect to the Advisory Committee's report and the proper form of the Advisory Committee\u2019s report. The regulation states, in Section 166.19(b)(3): \u2018The [sic] Chairman shall certify to the Commissioner the report and recommendations of the Committee, including any minority report, together with all the underlying data and a statement of the reasons or basis for the recommendations. The report will include copies of all material considered by the Committee except that in the case of scientific literature readily available in scientific libraries proper reference may be made to it instead of furnishing actual copies.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b85-18\">\u201cThis is the section that relates to the nature and the form of the Advisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Committee Report which is applicable in any case, whether the appointment of the committee was at the request of a party or at the voluntary election of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u201cOur reason for requesting that is this: We are seeking and have sought informally, and unsuccessfully, from the Government for some time to get some factual information as to what were the considerations, what were the data, what was the rationale, on which these drugs were included in this list. It appears to us the best and most concise source of that would be, what did the Government deliver to the Advisory Committee, what did the Advisory Committee do about it in their deliberations, and what did they say about it in their report to the Commissioner?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u2018\u2018We feel that having elected to use this procedure, and having then elected to go to hearing on our objections we are entitled to have that information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The following then ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u201cExaminer Buttle: How about this?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">\u201cMr. Phelps [counsel for the respondents] : We strenuously oppose any motion to lay bare the government\u2019s files relating to this. I think these data, reports, minutes, and memoranda would be privileged matter. The Commissioner made his finding alone, based on recommendations given to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">\u201cTrue, he did review these reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">\u201cExaminer Buttle: How about counsel\u2019s statement to the effect that they are entitled to them as a matter of course? Is there anything to that?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">\u201cMr. Phelps: They are not entitled to them as a matter of course, because it is privileged matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">\u201cExaminer Buttle: Well, I do not see why respondents need them in this instance, because I have indicated that I am going to allow them to offer, and I will receive, evidence in accordance with the theory of their case, which would mean that I will have evidence before me, complete evidence before me, which will involve the respondent\u2019s construction of the legislation, and rules issued under it for control.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">\u201cSince I am receiving such evidence and have indicated on the record that I intend to do so, I see no point in your having this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">\u201cWhat point is there for it?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-16\">\u201cI am going to look at your whole case, as a matter of fact, completely in accordance with your theory, completely in accordance with what you say is what Congress meant when it passed the legislation it did pass. So what difference does it make what the Advisory Committee recommended, when now you are adjudicating the matter and we are going to have a complete report in addition to what the Advisory Committee considered ? What difference does it make what the Committee or Commissioner considered, insofar as this hearing is concerned?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-17\">\u201cMr. Finney: May I inquire whether the Presiding Examiner would feel the same way if we made a second request to be supplied only with a copy of the report of the Advisory Committee ?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-18\">\u201cExaminer Buttle: What about the report of the Advisory Committee ?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-19\">\u201cMr. Phelps: We would oppose that also. I would have to look at that myself. I do not recall it, exactly.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-20\">\u201cExaminer Buttle: Would you look into it?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-21\">\u201cMr. Phelps: I will.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-22\">\u201cExaminer Buttle: If you feel free to do it voluntarily, I am anxious that you be as cooperative as you can.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-23\">\u201cMr. Phelps: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-24\">\u201cExaminer Buttle: But I am afraid if we get into all the underlying data with regard to wha&lt;t the Advisory Committee considered it will merely confuse the issues that I\u2019m going to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-25\">\u201cI am allowing you to adduce the entire theory of your case. I think it is only fair that I should. I do not see how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>those documents are necessary. But they can look at the report, and perhaps you can get together on that.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u201cMr. Phelps: That could be one of the things we will discuss with them when we get together.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u201cExaminer Buttle: Yes. Discuss that between now and Friday.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u201cSo your application is denied in that respect, for the reasons I indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u201cMr. Finney: Just in order that neither the Presiding Officer nor the Government\u2019s counsel be under any misapprehension in this matter, because I do not want to induce their cooperation on the basis of any misunderstanding of our feeling about it, I would like to advise the Government and the Presiding Officer at this time that \u2014 based on what investigation we can make, we think in this case the Government purported to use an Advisory Committee and totally departed from its own regulations as to how that Advisory Committee should function, and the kind of documents that that Advisory Committee would provide to the Government.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">There is nothing in the record to suggest that Hearing Examiner Buttle examined the Shideman report or its underlying exhibits. In fact, a fair reading of the colloquy between him and counsel indicates that he did not read or examine the report and its underlying material.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Two statutes are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 874 provides: \u201cThe Attorney General may from time to time appoint committees to advise him with respect to preventing and controlling the abuse of controlled substances. \u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 376(d)(2) provides: \u201c[A]ny report, recommendations, underlying data, and reasons certified to the Secretary by an advisory committee appointed pursuant to subparagraph (D) of the subsection (b)(5) of this section, shall be made a part of the record of any hearing if relevant and material, subject to the provisions of section 1006(c) of Title 5. The advisory committee shall designate a member to appear and testify at any such hearing with respect to the report and recommendations of such committee upon request of the Secretary, the petitioner, or the officer conducting the hearing, but this shall not preclude any other member of the advisory committee from appearing and testifying at such hearing;</p>\n<p id=\"b87-16\">Despite the express provisions of the statutes referred to, the Hearing Examiner, counsel for the Department objecting to the admission of the report and its underlying material, refused to have them produced for the examination of the petitioner, first on the ground that the material was \u201cconfidential\u201d and later on the ground that production would be useless. At long last, on July 10, 1972, pursuant to our direction, the report was produced and is attached to this opinion as Appendix \u201cB\u201d. The report in substance is merely a recommendation that certain drugs, including Librium and Valium, should be included in \u201cthe regulations implementing the drug abuse law\u201d because, allegedly they have a \u201cpotential for abuse because of their depressant effect on the central nervous system . . . \u201d Without the underlying material the report was informa-tionally useless and the original material apparently was lost. However, to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>a long and tortuous story short,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the underlying material of the Shideman report has now been made available and stipulated into this record for the sole purpose of determining whether Hoff-mann was prejudiced by the failure of the Hearing Examiner to permit examination of the report and the underlying material on August 1, 1966. This issue has been briefed and the last memorandum, that of the respondents, was filed in this court on January 2, 1973. We are, therefore, able at long last to dispose of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Hoffmann is very critical of the Shideman report and its underlying data, but nonetheless Hoffmann\u2019s memorandum of December 12, 1972, respecting the report goes far afield. On the other hand, we must confess ourselves surprised as does Hoffmann by the paucity of supporting material for the report.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It is also the case that the seven-man advisory committee met for only two days and considered Librium and Valium among many other drugs as hereinbefore set out in this opinion. See Order, 21 C.F.R., Part 166, <em>supra,. </em>The minutes of the meetings are indeed scanty and the material submitted by the' Executive Secretary, Dr. Cyrus H. Maxwell, of the FDA staff, which contains \u201cbackground material\u201d has little bearing on whether or not Librium or Valium should be listed. The first memorandum from Dr. Maxwell also submitted an agenda for the committee\u2019s scheduled two-day meeting on December 27-28, 1965, and the data on individual drugs submitted to the committee for its consideration were contained in five exhibits attached to this agenda and dealt briefly with each drug to be considered by the committee. A subsequent memorandum dated December 13, 1965, from Dr. Maxwell distributed to the committee an index to three of these exhibits and brief supplements to two of them, together with the FDA\u2019s data on the drugs to be considered.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The minutes do not disclose the amount of time which was devoted by the committee to the consideration of each individual drug. Hoffmann insists that it is \u201cobvious that the committee could not have devoted more than minutes to the discussion of each of the 18 drugs which they recommended be regulated, the 8 drugs which they recommended not be regulated, and the 30 drugs which they apparently considered but on which they deferred decision and asked for further information.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The committee\u2019s report consists of a one-page memorandum, a copy of which accompanies this opinion and is marked Appendix \u201cB\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>These criticisms, however, are beside the point for it was not incumbent upon the Commissioner even to have appointed a committee or that the form of its report should be perfect. However, having embarked upon the report its contents are material insofar as their non-disclosure affected the fairness of the hearing and prejudiced Hoffmann\u2019s ease. In this connection, some very troublesome items appear. There were three documents in the report which, if they had been put before the Hearing Examiner and developed fully (and surely Hoffmann' would have called the Examiner\u2019s attention most vigorously to them) might have persuaded the Examiner to recommend that the drugs not be listed, thereby affecting the final order of the Director. The facts concerning the first of these are as follows: A senior member of FDA\u2019s Medical Staff, Dr. Dorothy S. Dobbs, submitted a report to the advisory committee dated August 9, 1965, concerning Librium. In the final paragraph of her report, Dr. Dobbs stated: \u201cIt is my conclusion, however, based entirely on the information described above, that evidence of abuse of this drug is minimal. It is equally clear that information from other sources may be quite different.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Surely Dr. Dobbs would have been an excellent witness for Hoffmann in the proceedings and we cannot assume Hoffmann would not have called her to testify in respect to her \u201cminimal\u201d conclusion. It would have been possible to show, according to Hoffmann, that Dr. Dobbs reviewed the volumes of \u201cNDA 12-249\u201d, the drug application filed covering Librium, and the \u201c130.35B Report\u201d as to adverse reactions of Librium. These documents could have enhanced the weight of her testimony but we do not have them before us. Dr. Dobbs was not called as a witness. Had Hoffmann known of her report and its conclusion so favorable to Hoffmann, one might well conclude that petitioner would have called her as a witness. The second item relates to the memorandum of Dr. N. N. Alberstadt of November 22, 1965, concerning Valium. This was addressed to Mr. Julius Hauser, Executive Officer, and is as follows: \u201cThe evidence gathered from the scientific literature and from reports recently submitted by the field districts is not sufficient to support a finding that diazepam has a potential for abuse because of its depressant effect on the central nervous system. Additional evidence may accrue in the future, however, so that such a finding can be supported.\u201d What we have said about Dr. Dobbs\u2019 report is equally applicable to that of Dr. Alberstadt. Had Hoffmann known of Dr. Alberstadt\u2019s report and its conclusions favorable to Hoffmann, one might well conclude that Hoffmann would have called him as a witness. It should be pointed out that Dr. Alberstadt had the final responsibility for making the recommendation of the Division of Medical Review to the Medical Director and had access to all of the reports which had been collected by the Bureau of Medicine from FDA Field Offices. Certainly Hoffmann was entitled to have explored Dr. Alberstadt\u2019s conclusions, and the basis for those conclusions. Third, and this seems to us to be of particular importance, the Medical Director, Dr. Joseph F. Sadusk, Director of the Bureau of Medicine, in a memorandum dated November 29, 1965, addressed to the Commissioner respecting the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, did not include Valium among the drugs that should be listed albeit he did include Librium. Dr. Sadusk\u2019s memorandum and its contents were of course, not known to Hoffmann, and again, Dr. Sadusk would have been an excellent witness for the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Our next reference must be to the Shannon and Yolles reports, Dr. James A. Shannon, Director of National Institute of Health, addressed to the Surgeon General, Public Health Service, a report dated July 1, 1965, which listed \u201ca num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ber of agents which [our staff] believe should be considered by the FDA for the list of drugs to be controlled.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> There was also a memorandum from Dr. Stanley F. Yolles, Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, addressed to the Surgeon General, dated July 25, 1965, elaborating on the basis for recommending consideration of particular drugs.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> They are set out in the foot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>notes. Respecting the Shannon and Yolles reports, Hoffmann states in its final memorandum: \u201cPerhaps the most significant documents from the standpoint of Petitioner\u2019s ability to prepare its own case, as well as to conduct effective cross-examination, in the administrative hearing were two internal memo-randa of the Public Health Service which were forwarded to the FDA by the Surgeon General and furnished to the Advisory Committee as Exhibit E to the agenda. The first was a memorandum from Dr. James A. Shannon, the Director of the National Institute of Health, to the Surgeon General, dated July 1, 1965, listing \u2018a number of agents which [our staff believes] should be considered by the FDA for the list of drugs to be controlled.\u2019 The second was a memorandum from Dr. Stanley F. Yolles, the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, to the Surgeon General, dated July 25, 1965, elaborating on the basis for recommending consideration of particular drugs. These memo-randa would have alerted Petitioner to the theory upon which the Government later contended that Librium and Valium had a potential for abuse- \u2014 a theory which, because these documents were not available, Petitioner was able to divine <em>only after </em>the hearing. In fact, the theory was not coherently stated until the testimony of Dr. Harris Isbell, the Government\u2019s twenty-fifth witness, who was not called until August 29, 1966, and was not fully developed until the testimony of Dr. Edward F. Domino, the Government\u2019s rebuttal witness, who was not called until October 26, 1966, after Petitioner had completed its ease. Dr. Shannon\u2019s memorandum indicated the criteria which NIH had used in suggesting drugs to be considered for listing. It stated: \u2018Our nominations fulfill one or more of the following criteria: (1) Clinical evidence of compulsive use; (2) evidence that physical dependence will develop with chronic use; and (3) evidence that the agent has a basic mode of action that is similar, if not identical, to agents that have been clearly demonstrated to produce physical dependence.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Hoffmann\u2019s brief goes on to assert: \u201cKnowing that there was no clinical evidence of compulsive use, and that the basic mode of action of Librium and Valium had been scientifically demonstrated to be quite different from those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>agents which had been abused, Petitioner\u2019s cross-examinations and preparations would have been immediately focused on the apparent belief that physical dependence on these drugs \u2018will develop with chronic use.\u2019 For example, since the only instances of physical dependence on Librium were the patients in Dr. Hollis-ter's experiment, Petitioner would have been better able to develop by cross-examination and direct evidence the lack of relevance of this experiment to an assessment of abuse potential. That it could have done so in the original hearing is best illustrated by Dr. Hollister\u2019s own testimony in the supplemental hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u201cEqually useful in anticipating the Government\u2019s theory and preparing Petitioner\u2019s case would have been the memorandum of Dr. Yolles. It would have given Petitioner its first notice, prior to Dr. Deneau\u2019s appearance as a witness, that the Government would argue for the listing of \u2018all [sedative compounds] which have been shown by Dr. Gerald Deneau ... to effectively replace barbiturates and prevent withdrawal symptoms in dogs made physiologically dependent upon barbiturates.\u2019 It also would have provided the conclusive rebuttal to the use of this standard, because the memorandum points out that other sedatives not proposed for control could also be expected to suppress the barbiturate abstinence syndrome, \u2018since bromides are the only non-phenothiazine sedatives tested, to date, which have failed to suppress this syndrome.\u2019 Since this test would result in regulation of practically all sedatives, it runs directly counter to the intention of the Drug Abuse Amendments, as clearly expressed by Commissioner Larrick in his testimony before the House committee: \u2018Not every drug that would affect the central nervous system [e. g., every sedative] would come under this bill. It would have to not only affect the nervous system, but be a drug that is sought for non-medical purposes to produce these escapes from reality.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> (Star note omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">An examination of the record shows that Hoffmann makes some rather extravagant claims as to the assistance which the possession of the reports of Drs. Shannon and Yolles would have afforded it, but without burdening this already over-long opinion with the details of these claims it is sufficient to say that in our view Hoffmann would have been assisted in the preparation of its case had these reports been before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">As to what effect the inclusion of this report and its supporting material would have had upon the Hearing Examiner and the Director in the formulation of his Final Order, one can only surmise. It seems clear from the record that the report and its material were never examined by the Hearing Examiner or by the Director. Some of its contents were potently in favor of Hoffmann\u2019s position and there can be no doubt that there would have been substantial assistance to Hoffmann in the preparation of its case had the entire Shideman report and its underlying documents been made available to it when requested at the pre-trial proceeding. Accordingly, we deem the nondisclosure to be so egregious as to have tainted the entire procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">As we said in our previous opinion, 464 F.2d at 1072, \u201cThe objection of Hoffmann goes to the fairness of the hearing, and it should be noted that the denial of somewhat analogous reports have been treated as a lack of procedural due process even where the reports have not been mandatorily required by statute.\u201d In support of our position we cited Gonzales v. United States, 348 U.S. 407, 75 S.Ct. 409, 99 L.Ed. 467 (1955) ; United States v. Cabbage, 430 F.2d 1037 (6 Cir. 1970); and United States v. Owen, 415 F.2d 383 (8 Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-15\">The listing action set out in the Director\u2019s Final Order will be vacated and set aside.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>APPENDIX \u201cA\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">CHRONOLOGY OF PERTINENT EVENTS RELATING TO PROCEEDINGS TO DESIGNATE LIBRIUM AND VALIUM AS DRUGS SUBJECT TO CONTROL</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">July 15, 1965 \u2014 Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 enacted into law.

Accordingly, it is our recommendation that such drugs be included in the regulations implementing the drug abuse law.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-16\">I.

Dr. John G. Lofft, a psychiatrist and specialist in the treatment of alcoholism and allied addictions, testified that the abstinence syndrome associated with Librium and Valium withdrawal compares to that experienced after abrupt withdrawal from barbiturates (Tr. 550). It is characterized in its mildest form by insomnia and increased anxiety (Tr. 548-49). AVhen the patient has been taking elevated doses for long periods of time the withdrawal syndrome is marked by restlessness, tremulousness, muscle pains, perspiration, hallucinations, and sometimes, although not frequently, convulsive seizures (Tr. 540, 543, 547). The severity of the withdrawal is dependent upon the degree of dependence, and the amount of drug the person has been taking (Tr. 551-52; Jaffe (1965), R-133, p. 289). Librium-Valium withdrawal differs from the barbiturate withdrawal syndrome in that it persists over a longer period of time (Lofft, Tr. 550-51).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">\u201c35. The evidence also indicates that those individuals who showed signs of Librium or Valium dependence usually had experienced difficulty with similar drugs before \u2014 most often alcohol (Lofft, Tr. 553; Evans, Tr. 820; Uzee, Tr. 905; Chambers, Tr. 1626-29; Chelton, Tr. 1670, 1674). These \u2018dependent personalities\u2019, as they have been characterized, look for chemical solutions to a variety of problems. They will reduce a dependency on alcohol by moving to a different but related dependency (Lofft, Tr. 552-53). Sometimes the pattern of dependency is multiple in nature, <em>e. g., </em>Librium and alcohol together, Librium and a barbiturate, etc. (Lofft, Tr. 536; Evans, Tr. 819-20; Uzee, Tr. 907; Isbell, Tr. 1558; Chambers, Tr. 1632; Chelton, Tr. 1671; Williams, Tr. 1741).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-15\">See further Findings of Fact 59 to 63, inclusive, 36 Fed.Reg., at 2560.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-16\">See also Conclusions of Law 5 to 7, inclusive, 36 Fed.Reg., at 2561.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b80-17\">.

It is probable that the inquiry into Librium and Valium was inspired, as also was that into Meprobamate and certain other drugs, by Congress. See Finding of Fact No. 63 of the Final Order of the Director as follows: \u201cThe legislative history of the Amendments reflects the expectations of Congress, in enacting this legislation, that Librium and similar tranquilizing drugs, would be expeditiously brought under the control of the Amendments because of their potential for abuse. Testimony taken before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce demonstrated the need for bringing Librium under these controls. (House Report No. 130, 89th Congress) This Committee considered the advisability of listing chlordiazepoxide (Librium) among others by name, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>decided not to single out this or any other drug. The Committee, however, stated that it expected the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to take early action with respect to the consideration of bringing Librium and other drugs within the controls of the Amendments. A similar expectation was expressed by the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. (Senate Report No. 337, 89th Congress) (6-228, pp. 2-3; G-229, p. 13; G-230, pp. <em>24, </em>33, 38, 43-53, 54-56, 91-92, 101-105, 115-121).\u201d 36 Ped.Reg., at 2560.</p>\n<p id=\"AmQ\">We cannot agree, however, with Hoff-mann\u2019s contention that the Congressional Report influenced the Director\u2019s decision.

Before giving a list of drugs, 1 would like to make a few comments about a central issue in all this, namely the definition of \u201cpotential for abuse.\u201d If one assumes that all agents with pharma-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>eological actions similar to those of the barbiturates and amphetamines have a potential for abuse, one arrives at a rather long list of drugs, some of which may rarely, if ever, be abused in practice, although one can conceive that such agents could possibly satisfy the needs of an individual who is dependent upon barbiturates or amphetamines. For example, paraldehyde is occasionally used by desperate alcoholics in lieu of alcohol and could be similarly used by a barbiturate addict. However, its unpleasant odor and taste would probably make it an unlikely choice of such an individual and its liquid form might make it unsuitable for dispensing on a blackmarket basis. Some of the other compounds which could be listed, for example hydroxyphenamate (Listica), are relatively little used in medicine generally. Someone inclined to abuse sedatives might not have heard of such a drug and thus not be likely to seek it out. On the other hand, it is possible that-individuals now abusing barbiturates which they are obtaining illegally might turn to over-the-counter preparations such as Sominex if their illicit supplies of barbiturates are cut off. If the broad range of sedative prescription drugs are to be brought under control, perhaps consideration should be given to the status of the over-the-counter preparations with sedative properties which may be as likely candidates for use in lieu of barbiturates as are nonbarbiturate sedatives available only on prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"AalC\">In addition, the whole question of the availability of bromides on an over-the-counter basis could be re-evaluated, since these agents can be used by individuals who wish to feel sedated and prolonged use can produce a bromide psychosis.</p>\n<p id=\"Abm\">In developing our list of sedative compounds we have included all those which liave been shown by Dr. Gerald Deneau in the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Michigan to effectively replace barbiturates and prevent withdrawal symptoms in dogs made physiologically dependent upon barbiturates. Two drugs meprobamate and glutethimide, have also been shown to produce barbiturate-like addiction in dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"AaX\">In considering amplietamine-like drugs, we have concluded those with amphetamine-like effects in man in which there have been reported cases of psychic dependence and abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"A5E\">Several of the sedative-tranquilizer drugs have also been reported to cause either physiological abstinence syndromes or to be abused for their sedative properties. A detailed list of bibliographic references relating to abuse, dependence and abstinence syndromes or, in the case of the stimulants, drug-induced psychoses, is being prepared by the National Clearinghouse for Mental Health Information and will be transmitted next week.</p>\n<p id=\"AP\">It should be noted that the major tranquilizers useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, principally the phenothiazine derivatives and the rauwolfia alkaloids, are not included in the listing because these agents are generally found unpleasant by drug-abuse-prone individuals and are not, to my knowledge, subject to abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax1\">I have not specifically addressed myself to the preparations which could be considered exempt because they include both drugs with a potential for abuse and other drugs which would be likely to make the abuse of the combination preparation unlikely. However, if Commissioner Larrick would be willing to provide me with a listing of the multitudinous preparations of this type and their constituents, I could attempt to provide opinions concerning the potential for abuse of these specific preparations.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ\">In addition to the barbiturates, the following sedative drugs should certainly be under control since they not only, can prevent barbiturate withdrawal symptoms but also have been reported to cause physical dependence in man; meprobamate (Miltown, Equanil, Meprospan, Meprotabs),; glutethimide (Doriden); ethinamate (Valmid); ethchlorvynol (Placidyl); methyprylon (Noludar), and chlordiaze-poxide (Librium).</p>\n<p id=\"AGN\">In addition the following drugs have been shown to substitute for barbiturates in barbiturate-dependent animals and should probably be under control: chloral hydrate, paraldehyde, carisoprodol (Soma) and bromural.</p>\n<p id=\"Auo\">The following compounds are sedative but have not been tested in dogs: diaze-pam (Valium); hydroxyphenamate (Listica); hydroxyzine (Atarax, Vistaril); phenaglycodol (Ultran).</p>\n<p id=\"At3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>In my opinion they might also be shown to suppress the barbiturate abstinence syndrome since bromides are the only nonphenothiazine sedatives tested, to date, which have failed to suppress this syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiq\">Abuse of the following stimulants in an amphetamine-like manner has been reported, either in England or the United States: methylphenidate-HCl (Ritalin) and phenmetrazine-HCl (Preludin).</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">The following compounds have amphetamine-like actions and might possibly be abused; pipradol-HCl (Meratrain) and diethylpropion-HCl (Tenuate).</p>\n<p id=\"ABJ\">All non-phenothiazine and non-rauwolfia sedatives or tranquilizers could be considered for inclusion as could all stimulants and anorexegenic agents.</p>\n<p id=\"Auj\">Direct evidence of abuse or dependence in man would be a more restrictive and possibly cleaner basis for making decisions about the inclusion of drugs under control. By this criterion, meprobamate, glutethimide, ethinamate, ethchlorvynoi, methyprylon, chlordiazepoxide, methylphenidate and phenmetrazine should be under control while other sedatives and stimulants should be watched for evidence of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"A6B\">I have not included any of the hallucinogenic drugs in that list (such as LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide] or psilocybin) since they are investigational new drugs (IND) and therefore are not available on prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"A56\">I hope the above information is of assistance to Commissioner Larrick and will be helpful to you in preparing your reply.</p>\n<p id=\"AhF\">/s/ Stanley E.
