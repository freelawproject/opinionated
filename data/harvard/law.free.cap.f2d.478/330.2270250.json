Matya, for wagering taxes. The tax lien was based on a jeopardy assessment issued by the government against the plaintiff and her husband in the amount of $793,703.95. Plaintiff urges that any obligation for wagering taxes is solely her husband\u2019s and she cannot be held legally liable for her husband\u2019s debts under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4401(a) and (c). She asserts that she is the exclusive owner and operator of the liquor store business.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Plaintiff contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that the jeopardy assessment procedure is unconstitutional insofar as it allows an ex parte summary attachment, without a hearing, against the taxpayer\u2019s property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff argues that the court has jurisdiction to enjoin the assessment against her property, notwithstanding the prohibition in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because the exceptional circumstances discussed in Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., 370 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> prevail here.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-17\">The government denies that the case presents any constitutional issues and urges the applicability of Section 7421, and it further moves, as it did in the district court, for a dismissal on the ground of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-18\">The fundamental difficulty with the plaintiff\u2019s case is that she has sued the wrong party.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit without its consent. Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, 406 U.S. 128, 141-142, 92 S.Ct. 1456, 31 L.Ed.2d 741 (1972); United States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 586-587, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941); Gnotta v. United States, 415 F.2d 1271, 1276-1277 (8 Cir. 1969). No statute, regulation or order has been cited which shows that the United States has consented to being sued in the situation presented here. In Buck v. United States, 466 F.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>2d 481, 483 (10 Cir. 1972), the Tenth Circuit dismissed a similar cause of action for lack of jurisdiction saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">\u201cThe United States, as sovereign, may not be sued without its consent and the terms of its consent define the court\u2019s jurisdiction. . . . Taxpayers present no claim that any assessment has been paid or that any application for refund has been filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">\u201cTaxpayers argue that if relief is not granted they will be unable to contest the validity of the penalties and will suffer irreparable harm in violation of their Fifth Amendment rights. We need not explore what remedies the taxpayers might have had or now have because we are concerned with sovereign immunity. Whatever actions the taxpayers might have maintained against the Collector of Internal Revenue . . . are unimportant because we have a suit against the United States, not against a collector.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMW\">We vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the same with directions to enter a judgment in the district court dismissing the complaint on the grounds of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-12\">. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6862, 6331. Plaintiff relies on Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972), Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970), and Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., 395 U.S. 337, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-14\">. Section 7421 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-15\">\u201c(a) Tax. \u2014 Except as provided in sections 6212(a) and (c), 6213(a), and 7426(a) and (b) (1), no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b399-19\">. The Supreme Court in <em>Mnoohs </em>held that Section 7421 prohibits judicial intervention in the assessment and collection of federal taxes unless \u201cit is clear that under no circumstances could the Government ultimately prevail\u201d and \u201cequity jurisdiction otherwise exists. In such a situation the exaction is merely in \u2018the guise of a tax.\u2019 \u201d Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., 370 U.S. at 7, 82 S.Ct. at 1129.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-20\">. At this late date the government in a post-trial suggestion has indicated it would consent to a substitution of the proper party in order to permit the court to pass on the merits of the appeal. We decline the government\u2019s suggestion. Plaintiff has made no motion to substitute parties, and additionally we feel that, under the circumstances existing here, the government\u2019s suggestion is untimely made.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
