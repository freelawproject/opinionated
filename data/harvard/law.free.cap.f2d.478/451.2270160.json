Up to stated limits, benefits take the place of what a victim might recover in a tort action against the person responsible for the accident. Tort recovery is permitted, but only above those limits. \u00a7 2058.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">This \u201cno-fault\u201d plan, enacted in 1970, a year before Massachusetts became the first state to adopt compulsory no-fault insurance, M.G.L. c. 90 \u00a7 34A et seq., as amended by St.1970, c. 670 \u00a7 1 et seq., is operated by an instrumentality of the Puerto Rico government, a special corporation known as the Automobile Accident Compensation Administration (AACA). \u00a7 2060. The AACA is empowered to fix a yearly \u201cpremium\u201d, which is to be \u201cin accordance with the experience and the corresponding actuarial study.\u201d \u00a7 2063(4). This is exacted annually from each owner of a registered motor vehicle. It is used solely to compensate victims and for expenses of the no-fault scheme. \u00a7 2064(3), (4). The funds may not be used for general revenue purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">The United States brought the present action in the district court on behalf of non-resident servicemen stationed in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico requires all servicemen owning automobiles to pay the annual no-fault premium. They and their families, like all others in Puerto Rico, may share in the plan\u2019s benefits. The United States has sought a declaration that the exaction, from non-resident servicemen, is illegal under \u00a7 514 of the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act (the Relief Act), 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 574.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The district court ruled otherwise. It held that the annual contribution, being neither a \u201ctax\u201d nor a fee paid for the privilege of operating a motor vehicle, was not \u201cforbidden\u201d by \u00a7 514. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The district court\u2019s decision was made upon cross motions for summary judgment. Besides affidavits filed earlier for purposes not here relevant, the court had before it a stipulation of facts. Prom the court\u2019s findings and the undisputed facts, the following appears. The premium is set irrespective of the vehicle\u2019s value, and may vary from year to year depending upon past experiences in the administration of the system. In 1970-71 it was fixed by the AACA at $35 per vehicle. A separate $25 license plate fee is charged on registering an automobile in Puerto Rico which servicemen retaining their home state registration need not pay. \u00a7 179. (However, the no-fault premium must be paid regardless of place of registration.) Under the no-fault act, \u00a7 2064(1), and under the regulations of the Administration, Rule II, Rule 2.1, payment of the premium is made at the time of registration or of renewal of an owner\u2019s license. An owner without Puerto Rican registration must have a sticker attached to his plates evidencing payment of the premium; a required transit license is not issued unless the insurance is paid. Rule 2.6. The premium is prorated if the vehicle is brought into Puerto Rico after the beginning of the year or taken out before the end. \u00a7 2064(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Servicemen for whom this action was brought, residents of the continental United States, are in Puerto Rico solely by reason of military orders. They own motor vehicles, some registered in Puer-to Rico, some registered in home states.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>All are insured. Their insurance companies are required by Puerto Rico authorities to issue endorsements to their policies which exclude from coverage thereunder accidents occurring in Puer-to Rico to the extent the accident is or would be covered by the Protection Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">While \u00a7 514 of the Relief Act has as its chief aim \u201cto prevent multiple State taxation of the property and income of military personnel,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it does not \u201crelieve servicemen from every state tax which is somehow dependent on the presence of personal property within the state.\u201d Sullivan v. United States, 395 U.S. 169, 180, 89 S.Ct. 1648, 23 L.Ed.2d 182 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The tax \u201cin respect of\u201d personal property as to which \u00a7 514 most plainly grants immunity is the recurring ad valorem property tax. Thus in California v. Buzard, 382 U.S. 386, 86 S.Ct. 478, 15 L.Ed.2d 436 (1966), \u00a7 514 was held to exempt a Washington resident from paying a so-called license fee which California sought to impose as a condition to his registering his car in California. While termed a \u201clicense fee\u201d, the exaction was separate from and in addition to an $8 \u201cregistration fee\u201d. Calculated at 2% of a motor vehicle\u2019s market value, and collected \u201cin lieu of all taxes according to value levied for state or local purposes on vehicles,\u201d the tax had been adopted as a substitute for local ad valorem taxation of automobiles. <em>Buzard, supra, </em>382 U.S. at 389, 395, 86 S.Ct. 478, n. 9. The tax proceeds went for highway maintenance, a familiar object of tax revenues. <em>See also </em>Snapp v. Neal, State Auditor, et al., 382 U.S. 397, 86 S.Ct. 485, 15 L.Ed.2d 445 (1965) (serviceman exempt from paying ad valorem trailer tax).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Section 514 does not, however, provide exemption from a host state\u2019s sales and use taxes. In Sullivan v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the court held that \u201ctaxation in respect of\u201d personal property, within the meaning of \u00a7 514, means taxes \u201con\u201d personal property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">The legislative history of the 1942 enactment and the 1944 and 1962 amendments of \u00a7 514 reveals that Congress intended the Act to cover only annually recurring taxes on property \u2014 \u25a0 the familiar ad valorem personal property tax. Thus, the reports advert to the possibility that servicemen ordered to move around the country \u2014 as they were increasingly during World War II \u2014 might have their property taxed by more than one state \u201cwithin the same calendar year\u201d. . . . And the reports throughout refer explicitly to \u201cpersonal-property taxes on property\u201d . . 395 U.S. at 176-177, 89 S.Ct. at 1653.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">The court also emphasized the absence of any significant risk of double taxation, both because of credit provisions and the taxes\u2019 non-recurring nature. <em>See </em>395 U.S. at 180, 89 S.Ct. 1648.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">In the present instance, the United States argues that Puerto Rico\u2019s no-fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>premium is simply a tax on automobiles, the proceeds of which are used for a special class of citizens \u2014 those harmed by automobiles. It likens the exaction to the 2% tax in <em>Buzar\u00e1, </em>used for highway improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We do not agree. The measure of the exaction is not the value of the vehicle; the amount of the annual contribution is based on experience and actuarial computations. And it is adjusted to reflect the length of a vehicle\u2019s stay in Puerto Rico. The exaction is, in fact, an insurance premium. As with private insurance, the premium reflects an effort to spread certain costs of personal injuries caused by motor vehicles among all those registering and-maintaining such vehicles. What is significant is not the taxable wealth represented by the vehicle, but the vehicle\u2019s potential for harm when driven \u2014 a potential which gives rise to the requirement that its owner contribute to a pool of money held for the benefit of those injured or killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">We believe it to be immaterial whether the sum is properly described as a \u201ctax\u201d (see Carmichael v. Southern Coal Co., 301 U.S. 495, 508, 57 S.Ct. 868, 81 L.Ed. 1245 (1937)) or as a form of regulatory exaction (see Head Money Cases, 112 U.S. 580, 595, 5 S.Ct. 247, 28 L.Ed. 798 (1884)). It is, in any event, not \u201ctaxation in respect of\u201d personal property within the meaning of \u00a7 514. <em>Sullivan, swpra, </em>395 U.S. at 175, 89 S.Ct. 1648. Puerto Rico\u2019s exaction is most closely allied to the premium required by some states to be paid to private insurers for \u201ccompulsory\u201d motor vehicle insurance, i. e. a policy of insurance made mandatory if one is to secure registration.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Such compulsory insurance is usually closely regulated by the state\u2014 the terms of the policy being prescribed by law and the amount of the premium set annually by the state. <em>See, </em>e. g., M.G.L. c. 175 \u00a7 113A et seq. We are not aware of any authority interpreting \u00a7 514 to prevent a host state from requiring a serviceman to comply with its compulsory insurance law. That Puerto Rico\u2019s compulsory insurance is administered by the state rather than by private insurers should make no difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">We recognize that Puerto Rico\u2019s plan, being state-run and no-fault, may create a particular burden; transient servicemen may find it more difficult to obtain full premium adjustments from home-state liability insurers in view of these features (although no-fault is, of course, no longer unique, <em>see </em>M.G.L. c. 90 \u00a7 34A et seq., as amended, <em>and generally </em>Note, A Social Insurance Scheme for Automobile Accident Injuries, <em>supra, </em>n. 6 at 432-476). Puerto Rico has a substantial interest in the welfare of its citizens exposed to injury and death through the operation of motor vehicles. We do not believe that Congress meant in \u00a7 514 to exempt servicemen, whose vehicles increase the risk of injury to a host state\u2019s citizenry, from participating on the same terms as all others in the prevailing insurance requirements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>In holding that the annual premium is not taxation in respect of property under \u00a7 514, we have considered whether it might be such by virtue of clause (2) (b) of \u00a7 514, defining \u201ctaxation\u201d as including \u201clicenses, fees, or excises imposed in respect to motor vehicles or the use thereof: . . .\u201d That clause and its proviso were extensively analyzed in <em>Buzar\u00e1, supra, </em>and also in <em>Sullivan, supra. </em>The words \u201clicenses, fees or excises\u201d were given a narrow and restricted interpretation in <em>Buzar\u00e1. </em>They were held to refer \u201conly to those taxes which are essential to the functioning of the host State\u2019s licensing and registration laws in their application to the motor vehicles of non-resident servicemen\u201d. <em>Buzard, supra, </em>382 U.S. at 395, 86 S.Ct. at 484. In <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 182, 89 S.Ct. 1648, the words were equated with \u201cthe motor vehicle registration fee\u201d itself \u2014 that and no more. It seems clear, under <em>Buzar\u00e1 </em>and <em>Sullivan, </em>that the Puerto Rico premium is not a \u201clicense, fee or excise\u201d, and thus is not, on that ground, \u201ctaxation\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 514(2) (b). Moreover, not being a \u201clicense, fee or excise\u201d, the premium is not subject to the language in the proviso of clause (2)(b); we need not consider what effect, if any, to give to a serviceman\u2019s compliance or non compliance with the requirements of his home state.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Significantly, in <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 181, 89 S.Ct. at 1655, the Supreme Court stated;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">[Tjhe only taxes on the <em>use </em>of property from which servicemen are exempted are the special registration taxes imposed annually by all States on the use of motor vehicles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The \u201cspecial registration taxes\u201d referred to were the motor vehicle registration fee; in Puerto Rico, this would presumably be the $25 charge imposed for obtaining Puerto Rico \u201cplates\u201d. Since the premium is not such a special registration tax, and since, if a tax at all, the premium taxes the use of the vehicle rather than its value, \u00a7 514 does not prohibit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-10\">.

From affidavits filed in the district court, we understand that of 4300 privately-owned vehicles registered at Ramey ARB to military personnel, 38% ar\u00e9 registered in Puerto Rico; the rest are home-state registered (48%) or registered solely for on-base driving. About 14% of vehicles owned by servicemen at the naval station are registered in Puerto Rico, as are 30% of vehicles owned by other military personnel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b522-6\">. It appears from the affidavits that servicemen get refunds from their insurance companies. However, one officer states in an affidavit that his refund was less than the amount required to be paid under the Puerto Rico plan. Further, two New York servicemen state that New York minimum coverage requirements would force them to continue their coverage while paying for protection under the Puerto Rico plan, and that the plan thus compels them to pay double premiums. New York is one of a relatively few states with a compulsory insurance law. <em>See infra, </em>n. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b522-15\">. S.Rep.No.1558, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 11 (1942) ; H.R.Rep.No.2198, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 6 (1942) both of which went on to express concern that \u201c[u]nder present state laws the personal property and income of such persons may beeome liable for taxes in several states within the same calendar year.\u201d <em>See also </em>S.Rep.No.959, 78th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1944). Although avoidance of multiple taxation is a chief aim, a serviceman need not pay a tax covered by the Relief Act in a host state even if no similar tax is imposed in his home state. Dameron v. Brodhead, 345 U.S. 322, 73 S.Ct. 721, 97 L.Ed. 1041 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">. Massachusetts adopted compulsory insurance as early as 1925. <em>See </em>Opinion of the Justices, 251 Mass. 569, 147 N.E. 680 (1925), upholding the scheme under the state\u2019s power to regulate highway travel for the public welfare. Although all states have some kind of financial responsibility law concerning motor vehicle operators, as of 1971 only three, Massachusetts, New York and North Carolina, had compulsory insurance laws. Note, A Social Insurance Scheme for Automobile Accident Compensation, 57 Va.L.Rev. 409, 414 (1971). There is no evidence that Congress had such insurance plans in mind when it enacted \u00a7 514 in' 1942 and amended it in 1944 and 1962.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b523-12\">. We add that the government has not shown that Puerto Rico\u2019s plan results in all or most cases in double exactions for transient servicemen. <em>See Sullivan, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 180, 89 S.Ct. 1648. Puerto Rico would seem to avoid or at least reduce double exaction by prorating the premium and exempting the serviceman, while driving in Puerto Rico, from liability below stated limits, thus presumably lowering his liability insurance costs. Preliminary affidavits from some servicemen suggest that the mathematics are un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>favorable, especially for those from one of the few compulsory insurance states, New York. But given the variety of home-state laws and the total absence of serious data, we cannot say what financial tradeoffs actually result from a serviceman\u2019s move to Puerto Rico.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
