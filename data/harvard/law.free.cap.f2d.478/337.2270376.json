The Walker automobile was insured by Royal Globe.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-32\">On the day of trial GEICO settled the personal injury claims arising from the accident. The case proceeded to trial on GEICO\u2019s third party complaint for contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-33\">The jury found both drivers guilty of negligence which proximately caused the subject accident. The trial judge rendered judgment enforcing contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Royal Globe urges three grounds for reversal. It is first contended that the trial court erred in not directing a verdict in its favor, and secondly in failing to enter judgment notwithstanding the verdict in its behalf. Specifically, Royal Globe alleges that there was no evidence to indicate that its insured, Mr. Walker, was guilty of any negligence and, therefore, the question should not have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Guided by the standard of Boeing v. Shipman, 411 F.2d 365 (5th Cir., 1969), the trial court properly denied the motions. A substantial issue regarding Walker\u2019s negligence had been raised by the evidence and was properly submitted to and decided by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Appellants\u2019 remaining contentions relate to alleged errors in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. After careful consideration, we find appellants\u2019 claims to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
