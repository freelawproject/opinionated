Secs. 2113(d) and 2), and (2) conspiracy to commit said bank robbery (Title 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">The claims of error raised on appeal are (a) improper jury instructions as to consideration of accomplice testimony, (b) improper jury instructions as to the specific intent required to be proved under the substantive count, and (c) impermissible use of hearsay testimony to prove that the bank was FDIC insured at the time of the robbery. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-28\">Responding to the first contention, we do not find harmful error demonstrated in the instructions given when the several portions of the entire charge are weighed in relation each to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-29\">The objection to the instructions concerning requisite specific intent is raised for first time on appeal, not having been preserved for review as required by Rule 30, F.R.Crim.P. Assuming without deciding that the charge might have been appropriately clarified if timely objected to, we reject the attack on it as failing to demonstrate \u201cplain error\u201d. Rule 52(b), F.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-30\"> The entire proof offered with respect to the FDIC insured status of the bank at the time of the robbery is reproduced in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The witness was no longer connected with the bank when he testified, but he had been its president the year before at the time of the robbery. He testified from personal knowledge that the bank\u2019s deposits were in fact federally insured and gave the certificate number, 19936-2 from memo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>ry. Of course proof of FDIC insured status is a required element of proof of the offense. Indeed it is necessary to allege and prove it to establish federal jurisdiction. But appellant fails to demonstrate prejudice to him in the overruling of his objections on the grounds of \u201cbest evidence\u201d or \u201chearsay\u201d. No evidence contrary to that of Cureton was offered by appellant. The cases he cites, King v. United States, 9 Cir.1970, 426 F.2d 278, and Kane v. United States, 8 Cir.1970, 431 F.2d 172 do not offer support to our reaching a different result. Indeed <em>Kane, </em>431 F.2d at 175-176, albeit in dictum, holds that the original insurance certificate while clearly the best evidence, need not be produced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-11\">. DIRECT EXAMINATION OF MARVIN THOMAS CURETON BY MR. LEWIS :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-12\">Q. Mr. Cureton, will you please state your full name for the record, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-13\">A. My name is Marvin Thomas Cureton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-14\">Q. Mr. Cureton, how are you currently employed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-15\">A. I am a vice-president with the First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association here in Marshall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-16\">Q. How were you employed, Mr. Cureton, in the first part of 1971?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-17\">A. I was the president of the Security State Bank in Elysian Fields, Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-18\">Q. In the course of that employment, Mr. Cureton, are you able to say that that bank was insured by the FDIC?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-19\">A. Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-20\">MR. DAVIS: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-21\">THE WITNESS: (interrupting) And it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-23\">THE COURT: Just a moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-24\">MR. DAVIS: I object to his testimony in this regard because being insured by the FDIC, if it is admissible at all, it is a business record. He is no longer the custodian of that business record and the best evidence of the bank\u2019s being insured is the Certificate of Insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab5\">THE COURT: Well, if he knows of his own personal knowledge that it w,as insured by the FDIC, then he can testify to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAZ\">Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWI\">What was your answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4Q\">THE WITNESS: Yes, Sir, it was and is still insured by the FDIC'.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayx9\">BY MR. LEWIS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"apn-dedup-0\">Q. Further, Mr. Cureton, are you aware of what the certificate number of the Certificate of Insurance is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aal-dedup-1\">A. Yes, sir, I have it here. It is 19936\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aetq\">MR. DAVIS: (interrupting) Your Hon- or, again I object to it as hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_p\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"afi-dedup-0\">BY MR. LEWIS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2W\">Q. Go ahead, please, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aypa\">A. 19936-2.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b832-13\">.
