Powell, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Washington, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">The United States brought this action against Curtis Howe Springer and others for ejectment, an injunction, and damages in connection with defendants\u2019 use of their unpatented mining claims on real property owned by the United States in San Bernardino County, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">The United States moved for a partial summary judgment permanently enjoining defendants from using the real property in question for any purpose other than prospecting, mining or processing of minerals, and uses reasonably incident thereto. The district court held that while the Government was not entitled to a permanent injunction at that stage of the proceedings, it \u201cmay well be entitled to an injunction pendente lite\u201d enjoining defendants from using the property for non-mining and non-prospecting purposes. United States v. Springer, 321 F.Supp. 625, 627 (C.D.Cal.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-15\">The court noted in its opinion that, for many years, defendants have been using the property for the purpose of operating a resort hotel with related facilities, for the manufacture of \u201chealth\u201d foods, and for such other purposes as the preparation of printed materials and tape recordings for radio broadcasts. The court also observed that defendants were maintaining on the property \u201cfour guestroom buildings aggregating 59 units, a dining room with kitchen facilities, an administration building, a chapel-meeting room, indoor and outdoor mineral baths, a number of out buildings, electrical facilities and various other structures and facilities.\u201d 321 F.Supp., at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-16\">The district court entered the partial summary judgment on December 18, 1970. In reliance thereon the Government, on December 29, 1970, filed a motion for an injunction pendente lite. Such an injunction was entered on June 18, 1971. It enjoins defendants pending disposition of the action or further order of the court from engaging in ten classified activities, as set out in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants have appealed from the entry of this injunction pen-dente lite.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">An injunction pendente lite is, in essence, a preliminary injunction. <em>See </em>Rule 65, Fed.R.Civ.P. \u201cOrdinarily, the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is a matter within the discretion of the district court, and it will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.\u201d Douglas v. Beneficial Finance Co. of Anchorage, 469 F.2d 453 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Defendants present a variety of arguments why the district court erred in entering the injunction pendente lite. Insofar as they pertain to the limited issues relevant here as to what use one who has unpatented mining claims may make of the land, and whether these claimants are making impermissible use of such lands, we think these arguments are fully answered in the opinion of the district court. We adopt the district court\u2019s reasoning as our own, reject defendants\u2019 arguments, and hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">\u201c3.

The order granting an injunction pendente lite is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING AND SUGGESTION FOR REHEARING IN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The petition for a panel rehearing is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Pursuant to Rule 35(b), Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, appellant\u2019s suggestion for a rehearing in banc was transmitted to the judges of the court who are in regular active service. One such judge requested a vote on the suggestion, but only this judge voted for an in banc rehearing. The suggestion for a rehearing in banc has therefore been rejected.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-9\">. Defendants are enjoined, pending disposition of the action or further order of the court, from:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-21\">. There are now pending before the Department of the Interior two complaints in contests filed by the Bureau of Land Management against the mining claims here in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>issue. There have also been contempt proceedings in the district court, and an eviction order. Springer has made several attempts to obtain title or possession under non-mining laws, as follows: Desert Land Application \u2014 Los Angeles Nos. 087266 and 087267, July 12, 1951, finally rejected in Decision A-27305, September 25, 1957; Recreation and Public Purposes applications Nos. LA-0153617 and LA-0158843, November 14, 1957, and June 17, 1958, final appeal dismissed November 18, 1964; non-mineral application No. R-07418, January 10, 1966, appeal denied April 28, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"AMc\">Springer has been convicted of various offenses in connection with the use of these lands, some on pleas of guilty. These convictions include eighteen counts of false advertising concerning remedies for hemorrhoids, heart disease, \u201cnerves,\u201d thyroid and goiter; and violations of the California State Health and Safety Code pertaining to misbranding foods.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b114-10\">. On August 19, 1971, a judge of this court granted Springer a stay of the district court injunction pendente lite, to September 2, 1971. On August 26, 1971, a two-judge panel of this court granted Springer a further stay, reserving the right of the Government to move for reconsideration. The Government moved for reconsideration and, on September 9, 1971, a two-judge panel of this court denied reconsideration. Early in 1972, the Government renewed its motion to lift the stay of the district court\u2019s injunction. On January 31, 1972, a two-judge panel of this court set aside the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"AS5\">On February 10, 1972, a two-judge panel of this court denied Springer\u2019s motion to stay the district court injunction. On February 18, 1972, the same panel denied Springer\u2019s renewed petition for a stay. On September 5, 1972, another two-judge panel of this court denied Springer\u2019s motion to stay district court contempt hearings, but expedited the hearing of this appeal. On October 6, 1972, the district court entered an order of eviction from the premises, except as to those engaged in mining operations including maintenance work and cooking for workers. On October 16, 1972, a judge of this court stayed the enforcement of the eviction order pending the hearing of the appeal calendared for November 1, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b114-12\">CHAMBERS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AM1\">(dissenting from the refusal of the court to take the case en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">Springer is operating some kind of a health spa on mining claims on government land.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-14\">This involves several buildings built on the claims and the use of some spring water claimed to contain health-giving minerals. It is not contended the business is an unlawful one.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">What the panel has done is to approve the granting of a temporary injunction where no final judgment or decree has been entered. No threatened irreparable injury was ever proved. Certainly by final judgment a landowner is entitled to have one adjudged to be on the land improperly and is entitled to have the defendant put off by mandatory injunction, but not now.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-16\">What we do is to approve the practice of giving the government \u201ctwo bites at the cherry,\u201d \u2014 one is on preliminary in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>junction and the second is on trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">There was no balance of convenience here in favor of government. Any damage done was when the establishment was erected. It is not suggested that any real damage has been done since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Although the case is not mentioned, the panel has quietly overruled such cases as McCarthy v. Bunker Hill and Sullivan Mining and Concentrating Company, 164 F. 927 (9th Cir. 1908), a case that has stood for 65 years. There, mines were polluting the Coeur d\u2019Alene River. On a temporary injunction request, this court said \u201cno.\u201d Comparatively the damage in the McCarthy case was horrendous. Here, no present damage is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">It is very troublesome that the panel opinion refers to the fact that Springer has been convicted of a number of offenses. I thought the day was long past when we forfeited a man\u2019s legal rights because he had been previously convicted of a crime or crimes.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
