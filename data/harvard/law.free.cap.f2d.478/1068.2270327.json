App. \u00a7 462(a)). An induction order issued September 15, 1970, ordered defendant to report on October 14, 1970. On September 21, 1970, defendant requested and received the special form for conscientious objectors which he returned to the local board on September 28, 1970. The board reviewed the claim, determined that it lacked sincerity, refused to reclassify defendant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2**and advised defendant that he must report for induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">It is now claimed that the board did in fact consider the claim on the merits and in fact reopened the classification, and that having done so the board could not label its action as a refusal to reopen and thus cut off defendant\u2019s rights to appear, be heard, and appeal. Defendant relies upon Miller v. United States, 388 F.2d 973 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-7\"> 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2 provides that a classification \u201cshall not be re-ppened\u201d after the induction order is mailed unless the board \u201cfirst specifically finds there has been a change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.\u201d The language is mandatory. The board lacks power to reopen in the absence of the required finding. United States v. Stupke, 451 F.2d 997 (9th Cir. 1971); United States v. Hand, 443 F.2d 826 (9th Cir. 1971). A local draft board lacking power to formally reopen cannot accomplish a de facto reopening. United States v. Nix, 437 F.2d 746 (9th Cir. 1971). Miller v. United States, <em>supra, </em>is not contrary. In that case the State Director, acting within his authority, had ordered the local board to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-17\">Had Musser been inducted and had he made an in-service claim to conscientious objector status no presumption that the local board evaluated and denied that claim could have been drawn. The board was powerless to reopen the classification. Anything the board recorded in its minutes or did on the merits of Musser\u2019s conscientious objection had no validity, force, or effect.</p>\n<p id=\"aat-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1137-9\">. The local board\u2019s minutes stated: \u201cC.O. claim reviewed under section 1625.2 SSR and classification not reopened.\u201d And the form letter notice to Musser said that his classification was not reopened because there had not been a change in status resulting from circumstances over which he had no control.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1137-18\">HUFSTEDLER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"aoy-dedup-0\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-19\">I recognize that a conflict in the circuits now exists on this question and that authorities in some of the circuits support the majority\u2019s view.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This conflict has been engendered by differing interpretations of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Ehlert v. United States (1971) 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625. I read <em>Ehlert, </em>as do the First and Third Circuits, as requiring that every conscientious objector applicant has meaningful opportunity for at least one full and fair administrative determination of his conscientious objector claim and that the registrant cannot be relegated to a \u201c \u2018no man\u2019s land\u2019 \u201d where his claim will never be administratively reviewed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>v. Alioto (1st Cir. 1972) 469 F.2d 722; United States v. Ziskowski (3rd Cir. 1972) 465 F.2d 480; United States v. Shomock (3rd Cir. 1972) 462 F.2d 338; see also United States v. Usdin (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 21, 1972) 6 SSLR 3039; United States v. Cotton (S.D.N.Y.1972) 346 F.Supp. 691; United States v. Takala (E.D.Mich. Sept. 11, 1972) 5 SSLR 3773.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">Judge Coffin\u2019s opinion in <em>Alioto </em>eloquently expresses my own views on the correct interpretation of <em>Ehlert. </em>That reading would compel a reversal of this conviction for the <em>Ehlert </em>\u201c \u2018no man\u2019s land\u2019 \u201d script exactly fits Musser.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the pertinent Selective Service regulations and case law, the local board could not simultaneously make an evaluative determination that his claim lacked sincerity and not reopen his classification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I am also convinced that the local board\u2019s contradictory and ambiguous characterizations of its actions could have foreclosed appellant from an in-service forum for his conscientious objector claim. See United States v. Usdin, <em>swpra. </em>Finally, were I to search the record to find a basis-in-fact for the local board\u2019s finding of appellant\u2019s insincerity, I would be compelled to conclude that the board\u2019s determination is wholly insupportable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1137-10\">. <em>See </em>United States v. Waldron (7th Cir. 1973) 474 F.2d 90; <em>cf. </em>Swift v. Director of Selective Service (D.C.Cir.1971) 145 U.S.App.D.C. 224, 448 F.2d 1147; Wright v.

See Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 .. . It would be wholly arbitrary to deny the late crystallizer a full opportunity to obtain a determination on the merits of his claim to exemption from combatant training and service just because his conscientious scruples took shape during a brief period in legal limbo.7</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2M\">\u201c7. Since such a \u2018no man\u2019s land\u2019 would be intolerable our decision today simply involves settling in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>forum late crystallizers must have an opportunity for a ruling on the merits. Whether they may have such an opportunity at all cannot be open to question. ...\u201d 402 U.S. at 103-104, 91 S.Ct. at 1323.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">. Following a I-A classification by his local board on February 25, 1970, appellant was ordered on September 15, 1970, to report for induction into the armed forces on October 14, 1970. On September 21, 1970, he requested and received an SSS Form 150 for conscientious objectors. The board members reviewed his claim on September 29, 1970. A summary of that meeting by the board\u2019s executive secretary indicates that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-6\">\u201cThe local board reviewed registrant\u2019s complete claim. It was their determination that the claim lacks sincerity. Registrant must report for induction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ald-dedup-1\">The local board minutes for that date bear the following handwritten entry: \u201cComplete claim reviewed. Claim lacks sincerity.\u201d In addition, a barely legible stamped entry states that the \u201cc. o. claim reviewed under section 1625.2 SSR and classification not reopened.\u201d On the same day of its meeting, the local board notified appellant by form letter that it had not reopened his classification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-7\">\u201cThis will acknowledge receipt of your communication relative to your selective service status. The information contained therein has been considered by this board and you are hereby advised it did not specifically find there has been a change in status resulting from circumstances over which you had no control. In its opinion, the reopening or reclassification of your case is therefore not warranted.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1138-8\">. Under certain circumstances a local board\u2019s handling of a registrant\u2019s request for a reopening and reclassification can constitute a constructive or de facto reopening of his classification, despite the board\u2019s characterization of its action as a denial of the reopening request. <em>E. g., </em>United States v. Foster (9th Cir. 1971) 439 F.2d 29; Miller v. United States (9th Cir, 1967) 388 F.2d 973. Since Musser presented a prima facie case for conscientious objector status (see note 5 <em>infra), </em>any determination whether he was actually a conscientious objector could be evaluatively decided only through the normal processes and provisions of the regulations for considering and ascertaining classifications. The board\u2019s own records clearly demonstrate that appellant\u2019s claim was thoroughly reviewed. Only after this complete investigation did the board conclude the claim lacked sincerity. If the board did reopen and reconsider Musser\u2019s request, he was denied the important procedural rights of a personal appearance and appeal conferred by 32 O.F.R. \u00a7 1625.13. Mulloy v. United States (1970) 398 U.S. 410, 417-418, 90 S.Ct. 1766, 26 L.Ed.2d 362. The order to report for induction was accordingly invalid, and Musser\u2019s conviction for refusing to submit should be reversed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1138-14\">. As the Supreme Court has most recently observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-15\">\u201cIn order to qualify for classification as a conscientious objector, a registrant must satisfy three basic tests. He must show that he is conscientiously opposed to war in any form. Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168. He must show that this opposition is based upon religious training and belief, as the term has been construed in our decisions. United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733; Welsh v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308. And he must show that this objection is sincere. Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428.\u201d Clay v. United States (1971) 403 U.S. 698, 700, 91 S.Ct. 2068, 2070, 29 L.Ed.2d 810; <em>see also </em>United States v. McKinley (9th Cir. 1971) 447 F.2d 962.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">In his representations to the board, appellant manifested those deeply held scruples against killing customarily associated with conscientious objection. I-Ie signed Statement B of Series I of Special Form for Conscientious Objector (SSS Form 150) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-7\">\u201cI am, by reason of my religious training and belief, conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form and I am further conscientiously opposed to participation in noncombatant training and service in the Armed Forces. I, therefore, claim exemption from combatant and noncombatant training and service in the Armed Forces, but am prepared to perform civilian alternative service if called. Registrants granted this status are classified I-O.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a5b-dedup-0\">Commenting on the source of religious training and belief that formed the basis of his claim, Musser indicated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-8\">\u201cParents &amp; family strongly Roman Catholic. Catechism (Our Lady of Lor-etto Parish, Novato Ca.), until the age of 12 (weekly) Confirmed at 12 yrs. active member of C.Y.O. with close relationship with Parish Priests. Public school education (Novato) Close friend of family \u2014 Father Thomas Reilly ; profound influence until College age. Member Newman Club, College of Marin. Influenced by the writings of Bertrand Russel [sic] of which I have read almost everything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1139-9\">In his attached statement amplifying his views, Musser set out in great detail the underlying reasons for his convictions and the genesis of his beliefs;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-10\">\u201cThe nature of my belief in the sacredness of human life arises out of my religious training, and is a product of that training and the observations I have made concerning the relationship between people, and between people and their god.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-11\">\u201cI believe in God in the Christian (Roman Catholic) sense \u2014 as an outward, affecting omnipresent being ; and that Jesus Christ was the son of God, manifesting himself in human form for the purpose of communicating consciously with men on earth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqm-dedup-0\">\u201cHowever I also believe that God is within you (\u2018The Kingdom of God is within you\u2019) and can only be truly understood by inward reflection on the knowledge that is attained in the world outside the body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-13\">\u201cIt is this inward reflection that has brought me, spontaneously, to the realization that the spiritual life of the individual is primary; indeed it is the main purpose for living \u2014 and all else (on a purely religious level) in this life, is either meant to develop or retard the spiritual growth of men, depending on their capacity to recognize the truth and act upon it. (\u2018For what does a man have if he should gain the whole world, but lose his own soul?\u2019)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-14\">\u201cIt is also this reflection (or belief), which I realize now would not allow me to participate in <em>any </em>war for the reason that I might be compelled, either by outside authority or animal instinct, to take the life of a person who by virtue of his wisdom could enrich my spiritual life considerably.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-15\">\u201cThese beliefs stem directly from my religious training. Questions 1 &amp; 2, standard Catholic Catechism:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-16\">1. Who made us? Ans. God made us</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-17\">2. Why did God make us? Ans. God made us to know, love and serve him that one day we might enter the kingdom of Heaven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-18\">\u201cIn the end it is Jesus Christ who [sic] I believe we must look to, as Christians and as human beings, for an example to follow. Being a good Christian means being <em>as much in Ms image </em>as possible. Though it would be academic to argue whether Jesus would have let himself be drafted or not, the fact is that he never was. The fact is that when he was nailed to the cross, with all the power of the universe at his command, he only said \u2018Forgive them Lord, for they know not what they do.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-19\">\u201cThese beliefs may appear to be the result of a process of thinking that could not have developed in the short time since I have received my notice of Induction. Actually, I never could have written this down for the purpose for which it is intended without receiving my notice. At that time the thoughts that had been brewing in my subconscious for so long were suddenly confronted with the reality that exists\u2014 that I could be called upon to kill another man for the beliefs that other people hold. I realize now that this is something I could not do.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
