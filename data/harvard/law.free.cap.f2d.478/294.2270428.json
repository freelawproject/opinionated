Because we hold that the Act does not discharge the liability of an unindemnified surety, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case for modification of the referee\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Creditors of General Steel Tank Co., Inc., alleging that the company was removing its property from North Carolina, attached the property through proceedings filed in state courts. The attachments were discharged when General Steel posted bonds conditioned on its paying any judgments that might be obtained by attaching creditors but limiting liability on the bonds to the value of the property attached. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Company of Maryland was the surety on the bonds. Within four months, General Steel filed a petition for an arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-17\">The referee found that General Steel was insolvent when the creditors secured the attachments. He declared the attachment liens and the bonds null and void, and he enjoined the attaching creditors from continuing their state court suits to subject the surety to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-18\">The attaching creditors, reserving their rights against the surety, participated in the arrangement, but they also sought permission to continue their state court actions so they could establish General Steel\u2019s liability as principal and pursue their remedies against the surety. They acknowledge that any judgments awarded by the state courts can be executed only against the surety, not against General Steel, and they are willing to have this restriction expressed in the referee\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-19\">General Steel and its surety challenge the attaching creditors\u2019 right to obtain judgments in the state courts against General Steel even for the limited purpose of subjecting the surety to liability on the bond. The Bankruptcy Act, however, does not support their contention. Continuation of state court actions to impose liability on the debt- or\u2019s surety is a recognized procedure,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the attaching creditors\u2019 participation in the arrangement and receipt of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>fraction of the indebtedness does not bar this relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Section 16 of the Act provides that the discharge of a debtor shall not alter the liability of his surety.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This provision rests on the premises that a discharge is personal and that it results from operation of the law, not the consent of the creditor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These principles form the background for interpreting the specific provisions of \u00a7 67(a), which pertain to a surety\u2019s liability on a bond given to release an attachment lien. The purpose of \u00a7 67(a) is to foster the equitable distribution of the debtor\u2019s property by preventing the creation of preferences by judicial liens, either directly, or indirectly through the interposition of a surety. Under \u00a7 67(a)(1), a lien obtained by attachment within four months before the filing of a petition for arrangement is deemed null and void if the debtor was insolvent at the time the lien was obtained.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If a lien deemed null and void under \u00a7 67(a)(1) has been dissolved by a releasing bond, the transfer of property, or the creation of a lien, for the indemnification of the surety is deemed null and void under \u00a7 67(a)(2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, As a corollary to the preceding provisions, \u00a7 67(a)(3) renders property and liens affected by \u00a7\u00a7 67(a)(1) and (2) available for the benefit of the debtor\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, when \u00a7 67(a)(2) nulli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>fies the protection a surety has obtained through indemnification, \u00a7 67(a) (5) discharges the surety of his liability to the extent the indemnifying property or lien enhances the debtor\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">In this case no party claims that General Steel transferred any property, or created any lien, for the indemnification of the surety. Nevertheless, the referee held, and the district court affirmed, that the policy of the Bankruptcy Act would be subverted by allowing the attaching creditors to recover a greater portion of their debts than other creditors even though the surety, not the debtor, would pay the difference. This conclusion, however, conflicts with \u00a7 16, which recognizes the legitimacy of a creditor\u2019s recovery against a surety despite the principal\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When \u00a7 67(a) is read in the light of \u00a7 16, it is apparent that allowing attaching creditors to recover a portion of their claims against a surety on a releasing bond does not contravene the policy of the Bankruptcy Act. The loss suffered by the attaching creditors is simply transferred to the surety without affecting the debtor\u2019s estate or his other creditors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">The referee and the district court also ruled that under North Carolina law the bonds given to release the attachment were statutory forthcoming bonds that stood as a substitute for the attached property, and not payment bonds for the satisfaction of any judgments that might be obtained by the attaching creditors. They held that the Act\u2019s nullification of the attachment liens also dissolved the bonds and discharged the liability of the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling does not, we believe, give appropriate consideration to the legislative history of \u00a7 67(a). Prior to 1934, the predecessor to \u00a7 67 (a)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> contained no provision governing the surety\u2019s liability when an attachment lien was discharged by a bond. Most cases held that bankruptcy did not relieve the surety of his liability,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> although a minority ruled that the surety was released.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In 1934, Congress amended the Act to incorporate the minority view by expressly providing that the bond given to dissolve an attachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>lien was null and void.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Congress again amended the section in 1938, this time to substantially its present form.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The 1938 amendment abolished the 1934 clause that voided all bonds when the liens underlying them were invalidated, and it replaced the clause with \u00a7 67(a)(5), which discharged only those sureties whose indemnifying transfers had been voided under \u00a7 67(a)(2). The amendment makes no reference to the distinction between forthcoming bonds and payment bonds. It classifies both types as \u201creleasing bonds.\u201d The intention to expand surety liability seems obvious, for otherwise there would have been no need to alter the 1934 statutory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">The congressional intent is made even clearer by the legislative history of the 1938 amendment. The House committee report recognized that under the amendment the surety could remain liable even when \u00a7 67(a)(1) voided the underlying lien. However, the committee noted that the credit for the value of the indemnifying property allowed by \u00a7 67(a)(5) prevents injustice to the surety.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>emphasis in the House committee report on the limited nature of release granted to sureties by \u00a7 67(a)(5) provides additional support for our interpretation of \u00a7 67(a). According to the report, the provision discharging the liability of a surety applies only to \u201cthe case where a lien has been released by the furnishing of a bond, the surety of which has been indemnified.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The narrow scope of \u00a7 67(a)(5) indicates that Congress intended only a limited exception to the general rule of continued surety liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In sum, we conclude that the Bankruptcy Act does not discharge the liability of an unindemnified surety on a bond given to release the property of an insolvent debtor that was attached within four months before a petition for arrangement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But this holding is not to be read as conclusively imposing liability on the surety. The bankruptcy court\u2019s adjudication of the surety\u2019s liability ends after it determines when the attachments were given, whether the debtor was insolvent at that time, what transfers of property and liens are deemed null and void, and to what extent the liability of the surety must be discharged under the Act because of the indemnifying property and liens he must surrender for the benefit of the debtor\u2019s estate. The surety\u2019s liability ultimately must be decided in a forum other than the bankruptcy court, where the validity of the attachment and the effect of state law on the surety\u2019s undertaking can be litigated. Nothing that we have written reflects on these issues. We hold only that the Bankruptcy Act did not discharge the unindemnified surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is vacated, and the ease is remanded so the referee\u2019s order may be modified to delete the declaration that the bonds are null and void and that no recourse may be had against the surety. The injunction should be modified to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>permit the attaching creditors to pursue their state court actions and to bar them from executing any judgments against General Steel. The attaching creditors shall recover their costs against the Fidelity &amp; Deposit Company of Maryland.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-11\">.

With reference to \u00a7 67(a)(2), the committee reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">\u201cSection 67 (a) (2) is intended to avoid an indix'ect preference, such as may be created by the obtaining of an attachment lien against the debtor, who px-o-cures its release by furnishing a sui'ety bond and indemnifying the surety by transferring or pledging property which other-wise would pass to the trustee. Sometimes this process is carried one step further by having the surety indemnified by a relative or friend of the debtor, who in turn is indemnified by a transfer or pledge of the debtor\u2019s property. Even though the ox-iginal lien may be dissolved by the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy, the lienholder may nevertheless proceed on the bond and recover from the surety. In re Federal Biscuit Co., (2 Cir., 214 F. 221). The creditor thus is effectually preferred, while the surety, who has given an adequate present consideration for the transfer of the bankrupt\u2019s property, would be entitled to retain his security. The net result to the bankrupt estate is a transfer for the purpose of effecting a preference, which cannot be set aside under any specific provision of the act. The purpose is to enable such a transfer to be set aside, and since the surety is given credit for the value of the propex-ty recovered no injustice is done to him.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. at 33 (1937).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">A National Bankruptcy Conference analysis of a similar bill from the preceding year provides further evidence that the 1938 amendment was intended to discharge an unindemnified surety. Speaking critically of the 1934 amendment to \u00a7 67 (f) of the Bankruptcy Act, the analysis states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-15\">\u201cThe section, thus amended [in 1934], is expanded to x-ender null and void \u2018any bond which may be given to dissolve any such lien so created\u2019, and \u2018any nonexempt property of his (debtor) which he shall have deposited or pledged as security for such bond or to indemnify any surety thereon\u2019 is discharged and released. This provision is unsound in that it extends beyond the purpose of protecting property of the estate. Where the obligation of the surety is covered by indemnity, consisting in part of property of a third person, it would seem px-oper to release the bond only to the extent covered by the bankrupt\u2019s property. Thus the attaching or lien creditor would be entitled to recover from the sux-ety, and the surety would continue liable on his obligation, to the extent of the amount remaining undischarged after cx-edit is given for the value of the px-operty recovered by the tx-ustee for the estate.\u201d National Bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ruptcy Conference Analysis of H.R. 12889, Hearings on Amendments to the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 Before the House Judiciary Comm., 74th Cong., 2d Sess. at 208 (1936).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b367-9\">.

The court which sets aside the transfer or lien determines its value; and it is specifically provided that the obligee' on the bond, who has been given notice of the proceeding, shall be bound by this determination of value. The credit given the surety is limited to the value of the property actually recovered by the trustee or debtor or the value of the lien, if the lien is set aside, or the amount actually paid to the trustee or debtor where the proceeding is to recover money rather than to recover the property itself or to set aside the lien.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">This comment was taken almost verbatim from the National Bankruptcy Conference analysis, which was prepared by the drafters of the 1938 amendments. <em>See </em>National Bankruptcy Conference Analysis of H.R. 12889, Hearings on Amendments to the Bankruptcy Act. of 1898 Before the House Judiciary Comm., 74th Cong., 2d Sess. at 210 (1936).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b367-13\">.
