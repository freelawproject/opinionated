Before this plea was accepted, appellant\u2019s attorney informed the district court that it was being made upon an understanding with the prosecution that appellant would be \u201cpermitted to appeal constitutional grounds as to the selection of the jury.\u201d The court briefly expressed its assent to this arrangement and, after conducting an inquiry as to the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s plea, entered a judgment of conviction against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-15\">Following the imposition of sentence, appellant made a motion for bail pending appeal which was denied, D.C., 57 F.R.D. 645. Since this request for bail alleged that appellant\u2019s plea had not been voluntarily and intelligently entered, the court properly treated it as a motion to vacate a guilty plea based on noncompliance with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. War-war\u2019s appeal is apparently from the denial of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-16\">We agree that Rule 11 was not complied with in the present case. That Rule provides that a district judge may not accept a plea of guilty \u201cwithout first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and <em>the consequences of the plea\u201d </em>(emphasis added). It is, of course, settled that the Rule does not require the district court to inform the defendant of all collateral legal consequences of his plea, <em>see, e. g., </em>United States v. Washington, 341 F.2d 277 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 850, 86 S.Ct. 96, 15 L.Ed.2d 89 (1965), or of the defenses which might be available to him were he to go to trial. <em>See, e. g., </em>Flores v. United States, 337 F.Supp. 45 (D.C.P.R.1971). However, when it affirmatively appears that the defendant may be under a misapprehension as to the effect of a guilty plea upon the preservation of any of his rights, it becomes the duty of the court to take appropriate corrective action. <em>Cf. </em>Smith v. United States, 400 F.2d 860 (6th Cir. 1968).\u2019 In the present case, the court should have informed the appellant that, by pleading guilty, he might be waiving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>claim which he apparently intended to preserve, notwithstanding any purported stipulation to the contrary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">Noncompliance with Rule 11 normally requires that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea be set aside and his case remanded for a hearing at which he may plead anew. McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968). In the present case, however, we decline to upset appellant\u2019s conviction, since the only prejudice which he could have incurred from the court\u2019s oversight was the waiver of a claim which is patently without merit. Appellant\u2019s \u201cconstitutional\u201d challenge to the jury selection process was based on the fact that persons from eighteen to twenty-one years of age were not included in the pool from which the jury panel was drawn. The relevant facts are as follows. Trial in appellant\u2019s case was scheduled to be held on May 16, 1972. Approximately one month earlier, Congress had amended 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1865 to lower the minimum age requirement for service on federal juries from twenty-one to eighteen years. Pub.L.No.92-269 (April 6, 1972). According to \u00a7 3(b) of that statute, however, the district of Puerto Rico was required to refill its master jury wheels from sources including the names of persons eighteen years of age or older only as of September 1, 1973. Thus, any absence of eighteen year olds from the jury pool is more than adequately explained by the Jury Commissioners\u2019 adherence to a reasonable age qualification which had been in force until just before appellant\u2019s trial. In view of these facts, which are very similar to those in Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), nothing even approaching a constitutional violation was made out. <em>See </em>United States v. Ross, 468 F.2d 1213, 1215 (9th Cir. 1972), petition for cert. filed, 41 U.S.L.W. 3434 (U.S., Feb. 13, 1973) (No. 72-860); <em>see generally </em>United States v. Butera, 420 F.2d 564 (1st Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">. We cannot say whether, under the circumstances of this case, appellant\u2019s guilty plea would have precluded him from attacking the jury selection process bn appeal. First, the decisions in this circuit do not clearly reveal whether claims of this nature are waived by a guilty plea. <em>See </em>United States v. Karger, 439 F.2d 1108 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 919, 91 S.Ct. 2230, 29 L.Ed.2d 696 (1971) ; United States v. DeCosta, 435 F.2d 630 (1st Cir. 1970). Furthermore, we note that the Second Circuit has approved a procedure whereby a defendant may plead guilty to the charges against him while preserving an issue for appeal by stipulation with the United States Attorney and the court. <em>See </em>United States v. Doyle, 348 F.2d 715, 718-719 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 843, 86 S.Ct. 89, 15 L.Ed.2d 84 (1965). In the context of the present case, we express no view as to either of these matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
