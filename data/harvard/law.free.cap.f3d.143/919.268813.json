Because the plain language of the amendments to \u00a7 1915 imposing new filing burdens only expressly encompasses \u201ccivil actions\u201d or \u201cappeals\u201d of judgments in civil actions or proceedings, we had to decide whether a writ of mandamus could be characterized as either a \u201ccivil action\u201d or an \u201cappeal\u201d of a civil action. <em>Stone, </em>118 F.3d at 1033-34. We concluded that a writ of mandamus \u201cis not an independent civil action, but may be considered a type of appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1034. Reaching this conclusion, however, did not end our inquiry as the PLRA only applies to appeals of \u201ccivil actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, we reasoned that the nature of the underlying action would determine the applicability of the PLRA. Because the petition for a writ of mandamus in <em>Stone </em>arose out of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition for post-conviction relief, the fee payment requirements of the PLRA did not apply. <em>Id. See United States v. Cole, </em>101 F.3d 1076, 1077 (5th Cir.1996) (holding the PLRA does not apply to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings because habeas proceedings, though technically civil, are in reality hybrid cases whose nature is not adequately captured by the phrase \u201ccivil action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">The instant case presents the issue of whether the \u201cthree strikes rule\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) prevents Crittenden from filing a petition for a writ of mandamus in this Court without first paying the applicable filing fees when his petition arises from an underlying civil rights action, indisputably a \u201ccivil action.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that it does. <em>Accord In re Washington, </em>122 F.3d 1345 (10th Cir.1997); <em>Martin v. United States, </em>96 F.3d 853, 854 (7th Cir.1996); <em>In re Nagy, </em>89 F.3d 115, 117 (2nd Cir.1996). As such, Crittenden may not file a petition for a writ of 'mandamus with respect to a civil matter in this Court without prepaying the filing fee unless his filings claim that he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Crittenden\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-6\">. Section 1915(g) ofTitle 28 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-7\">In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. Crittenden has been placed on this Court\u2019s \"three strikes\" list as he has had at least three suits filed in the federal courts dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or failing to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
