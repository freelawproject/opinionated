There were no minor children involved at the time of the divorce. Subsequently, the monthly alimony payment was reduced to $575. In 1982, after the initial alimony decree, as modified, had expired, the plaintiff filed a petition to extend alimony. After a hearing, the Master <em>(Larry B. Fletcher, </em>Esq.) recommended granting the extension in the amount of $475 per month for another three years, which the Superior Court <em>(Bean, </em>J.) approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Based upon the record, we find no abuse of discretion in granting an extension of alimony at a reduced rate in this case. <em>See Healey v. Healey, </em>117 N.H. 618, 620-22, 376 A.2d 140, 142-43 (1977). We find the other issues raised by the defendant to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
