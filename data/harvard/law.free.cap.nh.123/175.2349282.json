Maria Hanke named herself the sole beneficiary and sole trustee of the trust during her life. The trust agreement provided that on Maria Hanke\u2019s death, the plaintiff would receive the income from the trust during his life. On the plaintiff\u2019s death the property was to be distributed to the couple\u2019s children, and potentially to other family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Maria Hanke reserved to herself many powers under the trust agreement. Specifically, she retained the right to change beneficiaries, to amend the trust provisions, to revoke the trust in whole or in part, and to withdraw all or part of the trust estate. She also retained the power to direct the trustee to invest in specific property. In 1978, she exercised her right to amend the trust agreement by amending the agreement to provide that New Hampshire law would govern the administration of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Maria Hanke died testate in 1980. Upon her death, the plaintiff became the sole income beneficiary of the trust. The defendants, the plaintiff\u2019s children, became successor co-trustees. The plaintiff also has the right to receive amounts of the trust principal if the co-trustees find that the income from the trust is insufficient. Because Maria Hanke had transferred virtually all of her property to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>trust during her lifetime, the trust estate comprised more than ninety-eight percent of her total assets at her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The plaintiff waived all provisions of his wife\u2019s will in his favor and, under RSA 560:10, is entitled to receive one-third of his wife\u2019s estate. He then filed the instant action, against the trustees and remainder beneficiaries of the trust, to set aside his wife\u2019s transfers of property to the trust, contending that they were \u201cillusory\u201d and thus invalid. If the transfers are set aside, the property will become part of his wife\u2019s estate, and according to the plaintiff, the trust will be entitled to a substantial refund of federal estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment accompanied by an affidavit. The defendant successor trustees objected to the plaintiff\u2019s motion and filed a cross motion for summary judgment. The superior court did not rule on the motions, and instead transferred the following questions of law for determination by this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201c1. Under New Hampshire law are the rights of a surviving spouse under RSA 560:10 defeated by the deceased spouse\u2019s <em>inter vivos </em>transfers to a trust when the deceased spouse/grantor retained and exercised virtually absolute control over the transferred property during her lifetime and after the transfers by reason of her status (1) as grant- or, because of the terms of the trust instrument allowing her to revoke or amend it, (2) as sole trustee, because, in part, of her power under the instrument to deal with the property as absolute owner thereof, and (3) as sole beneficiary of the trust?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">2. If the answer to the first question is \u2018no\u2019, whether under the circumstances disclosed by the Bill in Equity, defendant\u2019s Answer, the cross Motions for Summary Judgment, plaintiff\u2019s Affidavit, and the Objections filed in connection therewith, the transfers by the decedent of property to her <em>inter vivos </em>trust is (or can be found to be) illusory and of no effect such that the property transferred is subject to the surviving spouse\u2019s rights under RSA 560:10?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-9\"> It is well established that under New Hampshire law we look to the intent of the spouse in making a transfer to determine the validity of a transfer which has the effect of depriving a surviving spouse of his or her statutory rights in the estate of the deceased spouse. If the spouse makes the transfer for the purpose of depriving the surviving spouse of his or her rights, the transfer is invalid. <em>Hamm v. Piper, </em>105 N.H. 418, 420, 201 A.2d 125, 127 (1964); <em>Ibey v. Rey, </em>93 N.H. 434, 435, 43 A.2d 157, 158 (1945). To determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>intent of the transferor, a court will consider the circumstances surrounding the transfer, \u201cincluding the pecuniary circumstances of the parties when the conveyance is made, the consideration received . .., the relationship of the parties to the transaction, and other relevant facts.\u201d <em>Hamm v. Piper, </em>105 N.H. at 420-21, 201 A.2d at 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The plaintiff asks that we expressly adopt the \u201cillusory transfer doctrine\u201d enunciated in <em>Newman v. Dore, </em>275 N.Y. 371, 9 N.E.2d 966 (1937), either to replace or supplement our test. In <em>Newman, </em>the Court of Appeals of New York rejected a test based on the motive or intent of the deceased spouse in making a transfer, to determine the validity of a transfer by a deceased spouse which had the effect of depriving the surviving spouse of his or her right to receive a statutory share of the deceased spouse\u2019s estate. Instead, the court stated that the only sound means of determining the validity of a challenged transfer is whether the transfer is \u201creal or illusory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379, 9 N.E.2d at 968-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Under this approach, a transfer is valid if the spouse in good faith divested himself of ownership of his property. <em>Id. </em>at 379, 9 N.E.2d at 969. Using this test, the <em>Newman </em>court invalidated several transfers in trust by the deceased spouse. The court held that the transfers were \u201cillusory\u201d because the deceased spouse had retained the right to receive trust income for life, the power to revoke the trust, and the right to control the trustees. <em>Id. </em>at 381, 9 N.E.2d at 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">As the plaintiff correctly states, tests which focus strictly on the intent of the transferor have been criticized by many courts and commentators because these tests create doubt about all transfers made by a spouse. <em>See, e.g, Newman v. Dore, </em>275 N.Y. at 379, 9 N.E.2d at 968-69; <em>see generally, </em>W. Macdonald, Fraud on the Widow\u2019s Share 117 (1960); Note, <em>Estate Planning: Validity of Inter Vivos Transfers Which Reduce or Defeat the Surviving Spouse\u2019s Statutory Share in Decedent\u2019s Estate, </em>32 Okla. L. Rev. 837, 839-40 (1979). However, commentators have stated that intent tests which consider the objective manifestation of the transferor\u2019s intent, as our test does, have considerable merit. <em>See </em>W. Macdonald, <em>supra </em>at 117-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">In determining the validity of a transfer which has the effect of depriving a surviving spouse of his or her statutory right to a certain portion of the deceased spouse\u2019s estate, our test attempts to reconcile the policy of permitting a spouse to freely dispose of his or her property with the policy of protecting a surviving spouse by guaranteeing him or her a portion of the deceased spouse\u2019s estate. We believe that our test, which focuses on objective manifestation of the transferor\u2019s intent, properly balances these two policies. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>legislature considers the test specified in <em>Hamm </em>to be an improper balancing of these policies, it can adopt the <em>Newman </em>test or any other provision which it believes correctly balances these policies. <em>See generally, </em>W. Macdonald, <em>supra </em>at 271-327.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">It is also important to note that the <em>Newman </em>test is not without problems. It has been criticized by commentators as being illogical because most courts have held that the retention of the power to revoke a trust, when the spouse has made a transfer in trust, is not generally excessive control so as to make the transfer illusory. W. Macdonald, <em>supra </em>at 90. In addition, commentators have noted that courts have difficulty in applying the test consistently. <em>Id. </em>at 93-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"> For these reasons, we refuse to adopt the \u201cillusory transfer doctrine\u201d enunciated in <em>Newman v. Dore. </em>To answer the first question posed by the superior court, the rights of a surviving spouse under RSA 560:10 are defeated by an <em>inter vivos </em>transfer of property in trust by a deceased spouse, even if the deceased spouse retained and exercised virtually absolute control over the transferred property during her lifetime, unless the transfer was made with the purpose of depriving the surviving spouse of his rights. Because of our answer to this question, it is not necessary for us to consider the second question transferred by the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b207-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
