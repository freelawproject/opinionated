For the reasons which follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The victim in this case, a twenty-year-old female, was hitchhiking between Keene and Peterborough on October 28, 1980, at approximately 2:00 a.m., and accepted a ride from a white male who told her his name was Doug and that he worked at American Advertising Company. She later identified the man as the defendant. The defendant allegedly drove with the victim to the town of Dublin where he stopped the car and made advances toward the victim, who resisted. When she resisted his advances and got out of the car, the defendant struck the victim on the face with his closed fist with sufficient force to fracture her jaw. The defendant forced the victim back into the car and drove to a second location where he forcibly disrobed and raped her. The defendant then drove to another location where he repeatedly raped the victim in the backseat of the vehicle. Finally, the victim escaped, and at approximately 4:00 a.m. she reached a private residence in Dublin where she appeared to be in pain and was bruised and bloody; her face was swollen and she could speak only with difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">During initial questioning by the police, the victim described her assailant as being \u201capproximately six foot one, twenty-five to thirty years of age and large shoulders, and [having] light brown curly hair, shoulder length, and also a moustache which was untrimmed.\u201d Efforts to construct a composite sketch of her assailant at that time were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The victim\u2019s information led the police to American Advertising Company where they met Robert Boyle, an employee at American who told them that his friend, Doug Allard, was similar in appearance to the man they had described, but that Allard did not have a mustache and did not work for American Advertising. On October 30, 1980, acting on this information, the Dublin police chief and New Hampshire State Police Trooper Michael Miles arrived at the Allard residence, where Boyle was also present, and spoke with the defendant. The police took color photographs of both Allard and Boyle, with their permission. The color photos of Allard and Boyle were placed on the last pages in a photograph album containing facial photographs of an assortment of men. The photographs of the defendant and Boyle were the only color photographs in the album.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>On the evening of October 30, the Dublin police chief and Trooper Miles visited the victim and showed her the book of photographs. At the suppression hearing, Trooper Miles testified that when the victim was handed the book, she was told that there were pictures in the book for her to look at, to go through them at her own pace, and to take her time. He also stated that as she examined the book, she \u201ckept going back to the page that had the picture of Douglas Allard on it and kept looking at that particular picture.\u201d The trooper testified that \u201cshe felt. . . that [the defendant] was the subject that had assaulted her, but she couldn\u2019t be positive because of the quality of the picture.\u201d The following day, she repeated the same procedure, going \u201cback to the picture of Mr. Allard,\u201d but again without making a positive identification. About this time, the police attempted to prepare a composite sketch, but again failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Subsequently, Trooper Miles located a 1977 police black and white photograph of the defendant from the Keene Police Department and a second photographic lineup was created consisting of that photograph and seven other black and white photos. This second photographic lineup was shown to the victim on November 5. At this time, she picked out the defendant as the man who assaulted her. In identifying the defendant, she volunteered the following to the officer, \u201cI would swear on my grandmother\u2019s grave that .that was the man who assaulted me.\u201d As a result of this photographic lineup, the defendant was indicted for aggravated felonious sexual assault, RSA 632-A:2 (Supp. 1981), and first-degree assault, RSA 631:1 (Supp. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Prior to his trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress both the out-of-court identification and any future in-court identification arguing that the police procedures were unnecessarily suggestive because the defendant was the only person common to both photographic arrays and because the color photographs of the defendant and Boyle were placed in the last pages of a photo album consisting primarily of black-and-white snapshots. The trial court denied the motion, and during the trial the victim testified and identified the defendant as the assailant. The jury found the defendant guilty of both offenses charged. The defendant appeals both the denial of the motion to suppress and the trial judge\u2019s instruction on burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\"> The integrity of a courtroom identification is dependent upon the out-of-court identification: if the out-of-court identification is unreliable under the totality-of-the-circumstances test, then the State must show that the in-court identification has an independent source which is not influenced by the previous improper out-of-court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>viewing. <em>State v. Preston, </em>122 N.H. 153, 157-58, 442 A.2d 991, 994 (1982); <em>State v. Leclair, </em>118 N.H. 214, 220-21, 385 A.2d 831, 834-35 (1978). Consequently, our inquiry in this case is whether the out-of-court identifications are the result of such improper police procedures that the in-court identification and other evidence derived from them are inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\"> The defendant, in the first instance, has the burden of showing that the police identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive. <em>State v. Ober, </em>116 N.H. 381, 383, 359 A.2d 624, 626 (1976); R. McNamara, 1 New Hampshire Practice: Criminal Practice AND Procedure \u00a7 230, at 144 (1980). Once the police procedures are shown to be unnecessarily suggestive, the State must prove that the identification was nonetheless reliable by clear and convincing evidence. <em>State v. Leclair, </em>118 N.H. at 219-20, 385 A.2d at 834; <em>see </em>R. McNamara, 1 New Hampshire Practice, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 230, at 144 (1980). There is no need to consider the reliability issue unless the police procedures have been shown to be unnecessarily suggestive. <em>State v. Gullick, </em>120 N.H. 99, 101-02, 411 A.2d 1113, 1115 (1980). In this case, the court implicitly concluded that the police procedures were unnecessarily suggestive because it proceeded to consider the reliability issue, applying the criteria set forth in <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199-200 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">To determine whether an out-of-court identification is reliable, notwithstanding unnecessarily suggestive police procedures, the courts employ the totality-of-the-circumstances test by which the prejudicial effect of the suggestive identification is balanced against five reliability factors. <em>Id. </em>The five factors contributing to reliability of the identification under the totality-of-the-circumstances test are: (1) the opportunity to view the criminal; (2) the witness\u2019 degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of any prior description given by the witness; (4) the witness\u2019 level of certainty; and (5) the lapse of time between the crime and the confrontation. <em>Id.; see also State v. Perron, </em>122 N.H. 941, 948, 454 A.2d 422, 425 (1982). This test is the functional equivalent of the test used to determine whether an in-court identification is admissible because it had an independent origin. <em>State v. Preston, </em>122 N.H. at 158, 442 A.2d at 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Although we are not persuaded that the out-of-court identification procedures were unnecessarily suggestive\", because the trial judge applied the <em>Biggers </em>criteria we will assume that he found the police procedures to have been unnecessarily suggestive. Application of the <em>Biggers </em>test clearly supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the victim\u2019s out-of-court and in-court identifications were admissible. First, the victim\u2019s opportunity to view the defendant was considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ble: she was in the defendant\u2019s presence for a protracted period of time, during which she was repeatedly assaulted. Although the quality of lighting was uncertain during the early morning hours when the victim was assaulted and raped, there was illumination from street lights. The trial court could reasonably have concluded that the victim\u2019s degree of attention was great because of her close contact with the defendant. The inconsistency between the defendant\u2019s appearance and the victim\u2019s description of him was limited to the absence of a mustache and a discrepancy in hair length. The lapse of time between the crime and the first out-of-court identification was only two days, and the second photographic identification was eight days after the assault. Finally, the high degree of certainty with which the victim identified the defendant after the second photographic showing was reflected in her statement, \u201cI would swear on my grandmother\u2019s grave that that was the man who assaulted me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We hold that the trial court, by weighing the five reliability factors discussed above against the arguably unnecessarily suggestive identification procedures, could reasonably have concluded that the out-of-court identification was reliable by clear and convincing evidence and therefore admissible. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to discuss whether the in-court identification was independent of an inadmissible out-of-court identification. <em>See State v. Preston, </em>122 N.H. at 157-58, 442 A.2d at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The defendant\u2019s next argument involves the issue whether the reasonable doubt language of the model burden-of-proof instruction contained in <em>State v. Wentworth, </em>118 N.H. 832, 838-39, 395 A.2d 858, 862-63 (1978), was vitiated by the court\u2019s following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">\u201cIt is of utmost importance that no person who is guilty should go free, and, likewise, it is equally important that no person who is innocent should be convicted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">In determining whether an instruction violates the <em>Wentworth </em>paradigm, \u201c[w]e must evaluate the effect of the disputed charge in the context of the overall instruction. . . .\u201d <em>State v. Langdon, </em>121 N.H. 1065, 1068, 438 A.2d 299, 301 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">The criticized language occurred at the beginning of a jury instruction which covers twenty-six pages of transcript. The <em>Went-worth </em>instruction, however, was given properly, including the instructions relating to burden of proof and presumption of innocence. In concluding his charge, the court instructed the jurors that if they were all satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>ant engaged in conduct comprising the elements of the offense, they should find him guilty. The trial judge then added, \u201c[h]owever, if you are not so satisfied as to each of the elements of this offense beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find the defendant not guilty.\u201d Similar language was used with respect to each offense and was repeated in substance on two other occasions in the instructions. We are satisfied that \u201cany possible prejudicial effect of the phrase was harmlessly lost in the totality of the instruction,\u201d and any possible error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Black, </em>116 N.H. 836, 837-38, 368 A.2d 1177, 1179 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-4\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
