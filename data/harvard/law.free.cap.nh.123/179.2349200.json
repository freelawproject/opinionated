She claims that as a result of this breach of duty, she fell and was injured upon leaving the club.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">On the date of the accident, a commercial liability insurance policy issued by Hartford to the club was in effect. This policy provided insurance coverage for liability for bodily injury, but contained the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201cExclusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">This insurance does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">(h) to bodily injury or property damage for which the insured or his indemnitee may be held liable</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">(1) as a person or organization engaged in the business of manufacturing, distributing, selling or serving alcoholic beverages, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">(2) if not so engaged, as an owner or lessor of premises used for such purposes,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-12\">if such liability is imposed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-13\">(i) by, or because of the violation of, any statute, ordinance or regulation pertaining to the sale, gift, distribution or use of any alcoholic beverage, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-14\">(ii) by reason of the selling, serving or giving of any alcoholic beverage to a minor or to a person under the influence of alcohol or which causes or contributes to the intoxication of any person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-15\">but part (ii) of this exclusion does not apply with respect to liability of the insured or his indemnitee as an owner or lessor described in (2) above . .. .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">The club requested that Hartford enter an appearance in the Johnson action, but Hartford stated that no coverage was afforded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>for the injuries incurred, because the policy excluded coverage for this type of liability, and refused to defend the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The issue of coverage was submitted to the superior court on an agreed statement of facts and was referred to a master. The Master <em>(Robert A. Carignan, </em>Esq.) held that exclusion (h) in the policy operated to exclude coverage to the club for Johnson\u2019s accident, and recommended that judgment be entered for Hartford. The Superior Court <em>(DiClerico, </em>J.) approved the master\u2019s recommendation, and the plaintiff appealed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Under New Hampshire law, the burden of proving that no insurance coverage exists is on the insurer. RSA 491:22-a (Supp. 1979); <em>see Town of Epping v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>122 N.H. 248, 252, 444 A.2d 496, 498 (1982). In this case, Hartford has the burden of proving that the policy in question provided no coverage for the club.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The final interpretation of an insurance policy is for this court. <em>Connolly v. Galvin, </em>120 N.H. 219, 221, 412 A.2d 428, 429 (1980). This court previously construed an exclusion identical to exclusion (h) in <em>New Hampshire Insurance Co. v. Hillwinds Inn, Inc., </em>117 N.H. 350, 373 A.2d 354 (1977). In <em>Hillwinds, </em>we held that the exclusion in the policy at issue excluded coverage of a suit brought by the estate of a pedestrian against the inn for serving alcoholic beverages to a customer, until she was intoxicated, who, while operating a motor vehicle, caused the death of the pedestrian. <em>Id. </em>at 351, 373 A.2d at 355. We noted that the exclusion was \u201cmore or less standard language in <em>tavern and saloon </em>general liability policies, and is generally recognized as accomplishing the result [an exclusion of coverage] for which the New Hampshire Insurance Company contends.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351-52, 373 A.2d at 355 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The plaintiff claims that <em>Hillwinds </em>is distinguishable. It argues that exclusion (h) is inapplicable to it because it is not \u201cin the business of\u201d selling or serving alcoholic beverages, as used in section (1) of the exclusion, because it did not make a profit on the beverages, as would a tavern.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">A clause is ambiguous when the contracting parties reasonably differ as to its meaning. <em>Commercial Union Assurance Cos. v. Town of Derry, </em>118 N.H. 469, 471, 387 A.2d 1171, 1172 (1978). If a clause in an insurance policy is ambiguous, we will interpret the clause in favor of the insured and against the insurer. <em>Town of Epping v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>122 N.H. at 252, 444 A.2d at 498. However, we will not find that a clause is ambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>simply to resolve the ambiguity against an insurer. <em>Robbins Auto Parts, Inc. v. Granite State Ins. Co., </em>121 N.H. 760, 764, 435 A.2d 507, 509 (1981). As we stated in <em>Robbins:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u201cThe ambiguity rule . .. will not be applied so as to create coverage where it is clear that none is intended. In determining whether an ambiguity exists, we will look to the claimed ambiguity, consider it in its appropriate context, and construe the words used according to their plain, ordinary and popular definitions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 764, 435 A.2d at 509; <em>see Royal Globe Insurance Cos. v. Graf, </em>122 N.H. 978, 981, 453 A.2d 1262, 1264 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In the present case, the meaning of the phrase \u201cin the business of\u201d as used in section (1) of exclusion (h) is ambiguous. Because the parties have failed to provide us with a full copy of the insurance policy, we do not know whether the phrase \u201cin the business of\u201d is defined within the policy itself. Corpus Juris Secundum states that the word \u201cbusiness\u201d can be used in two senses. It can be used in a broad sense to mean any regular activity that occupies one\u2019s time and attention, with or without a direct profit objective, or it can be used more narrowly to mean an activity with a direct profit objective. 12A C.J.S. <em>Business, </em>at 464-65 (1980). Because the phrase \u201cin the business of\u201d as used in this policy is ambiguous, we must interpret it in favor of the club and hold that the club is not \u201cin the business of\u201d selling or serving alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Because we so interpret this clause, it is clear that exclusion (h) does not apply to exclude coverage of the underlying suit. Section (2) of the exclusion does not operate to exclude coverage because the final clause of the exclusion provides that the exclusion does not apply when the liability of the owner of property is not based on the violation of a statute, ordinance, or regulation pertaining to alcoholic beverages. Because of our resolution of these issues, we need not address the plaintiffs other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b211-10\">All concurred</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
