Would the establishment of a class of property known as \u2018tax base\u2019 as provided for in HB 674-FN with said amendment create a class of property distinct from \u2018taxable business profits\u2019 or \u2018net profits\u2019 as defined in RSA 77-A so as to allow each class to be taxed differently without violating the provisions of Part I, Article 12 and Part II, Article 5 of the New Hampshire Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u201c2. Would enactment of HB 674-FN with the proposed amendment, which would impose a uniform business tax on a business organization\u2019s tax base and provides for a credit for all taxes paid pursuant thereto against the business organization\u2019s tax imposed by RSA 77-A, violate the provisions of Part I, Article 12 and Part II, Article 5 of the New Hampshire Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201c3. Would enactment of HB 674-FN with said proposed amendment violate any other provision of the New Hampshire Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u201cThat the Clerk of the House transmit 7 copies of this resolution to the Justices of the Supreme Court together with an equal number of copies of HB 674-FN and the proposed amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The following answers were returned:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">\n<em>To the House of Representatives:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">The undersigned Justices of the Supreme Court reply as follows to the questions contained in your resolution adopted May 12, 1983, regarding certain amendments to House Bill 674. Interested parties were permitted to file memoranda until May 16, 1983; however, none was received.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">In our recent opinion of May 6, 1983, we advised you regarding both House Bill 674 and House Bill 316, the latter of which would have established a one percent tax on \u201calternate business profits.\u201d We expressed our opinion that a one percent tax on \u201calternate business profits,\u201d defined in House Bill 316 as a business\u2019 gross income subject to reasonable and uniform credits, deductions, and adjustments, would constitute a constitutionally taxable class of property under part two, article six of the New Hampshire Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">We also expressed our opinion, however, that \u201calternate business profits\u201d as defined in House Bill 316, and \u201ctaxable business profits\u201d as defined in RSA chapter 77-A, were both essentially classifications of <em>one </em>class of property; namely, business income. For that reason, we said that taxation of \u201calternate business profits\u201d and \u201ctaxable business profits\u201d at differing rates would be unconstitutional and, also, that to require the payment of taxes on both could result in double taxation in a manner not permitted under our constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>We were of the opinion that a one percent tax on \u201ctax base,\u201d as defined and outlined in House Bill 674, would be a legitimate exercise of the legislature\u2019s power to classify property under our constitution. Because House Bill 674 would have <em>replaced </em>the existing scheme, RSA chapter 77-A, with a new scheme, RSA chapter 77-E, the bill raised no problems with respect to either double taxation or imposition of taxes at differing rates on the same class of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The proposal now before us would <em>retain </em>the eight percent tax imposed on \u201ctaxable business profits\u201d under RSA chapter 77-A, and would also impose a one percent tax on \u201ctax base\u201d as defined in House Bill 674, proposed RSA chapter 77-E. The tax paid pursuant to proposed RSA chapter 77-E would be allowed as a <em>credit </em>against any tax due under RSA chapter 77-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u201cTax base\u201d as defined in House Bill 674 is substantially similar to \u201calternate business profits\u201d as defined in House Bill 316. It is apparent that both are simply slightly different and broader definitions of business income than is \u201ctaxable business profits\u201d under RSA chapter 77-A. For the reasons stated in our advice with respect to House Bill 316, we therefore do not believe that a one percent tax on \u201ctax base\u201d can be imposed at the same time as an eight percent tax on \u201ctaxable business profits.\u201d To do so would similarly result in the imposition of differing rates of tax on essentially the same class of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The proposed amendments to House Bill 674 would, in addition, run afoul of the double taxation prohibition in our constitution. As we noted in our May 6, 1983 opinion, most of the provisions of House Bill 674, proposed RSA chapter 77-E, were taken verbatim from the existing scheme, RSA chapter 77-A, including the federally based definitions of \u201ctaxable income,\u201d \u201cordinary income,\u201d and \u201cnet income\u201d as starting points for the computation of the tax, the various credits and deductions, and the apportionment system. The only difference of significance between proposed RSA chapter 77-E and existing RSA chapter 77-A is the requirement that amounts previously deducted from \u201ctaxable business profits\u201d for leases, depreciation, compensation and benefits be included in the computation of \u201ctax base.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Under House Bill 674, as amended, the current tax on \u201ctaxable business profits\u201d pursuant to RSA chapter 77-A would be retained, apparently because of a concern that, for some businesses, the present eight percent tax on \u201ctaxable business profits\u201d would exceed the proposed one percent tax on \u201ctax base.\u201d In order to avoid this potential revenue shortfall, two taxes would be imposed, but a credit for the amount paid pursuant to proposed RSA chapter 77-E would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>allowed against that levied pursuant to RSA chapter 77-A. It is equally apparent, however, that this gives rise to the precise double taxation problem we adverted to in our response to your request with respect to House Bill 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">A business organization which would be required to pay any tax pursuant to RSA chapter 77-A would be paying tax on property which had already been included and taxed in \u201ctax base\u201d under proposed RSA chapter 77-E. This is because, as we stated above, the only difference between \u201ctax base\u201d and \u201ctaxable business profits\u201d is the inclusion in \u201ctax base\u201d of sums previously deducted from \u201ctaxable business profits\u201d for leases, depreciation, compensation and benefits. House Bill 674 as amended would therefore result in unconstitutional double taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">That is not to say, however, that if a separate tax were imposed on items such as compensation or payroll, to the extent that they are not presently taxed under RSA chapter 77-A, a constitutional problem would arise. Similarly, provision of a credit for the amount of that tax against the tax due under RSA chapter 77-A would be within the broad powers allotted to our legislature. As long as all business organizations in this State were subject to both tax schemes, and as long as the credit, if so provided, were available to all on a uniform and equal basis, such legislative action would not violate the constitutional requirements of reasonableness and uniformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">As we have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">\u201cThe power of the legislature to classify property as taxable or non-taxable is a broad one .... Classification of property by kind has always been recognized as proper. So, too, classification by use is said to be permissible. So long as there is a reasonable line of demarcation, and there is no attempt to make taxability depend upon a classification of owners, the legislative power in this matter is supreme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-10\"><em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>84 N.H. 559, 569, 149 A. 321, 326 (1930) (citation omitted), <em>quoted in Havens v. Attorney-General, </em>91 N.H. 115, 118, 14 A.2d 636, 638 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">Justices of this court have previously found a wide variety of tax schemes to be constitutional so long as the property being taxed was \u201csufficiently inclusive to constitute a distinctive class.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>114 N.H. 174, 177, 317 A.2d 568, 570 (1974). In <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>111 N.H. 136, 139-40, 276 A.2d 821, 822-23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>(1971), justices of this court indicated that a three percent tax on personal incomes could co-exist with a six percent tax on \u201ctaxable business profits.\u201d It was stated there that since \u201cthe personal income to be taxed would not include income taxable under RSA chapter 77-A (supp.) as business profits, but would include income from wages, salaries, and unearned income,\u201d and because the tax would \u201cdiffer in its essential characteristics\u201d from the tax imposed under RSA chapter 77-A, no constitutional problem was thus posed by the bill. Id., 276 A.2d at 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Accordingly, our answer to question one is \u201cno\u201d; our answer to question two is \u201cyes\u201d; and, in light of the answers given, we need not address question three.</p>\n<judges id=\"b377-5\">John W.
