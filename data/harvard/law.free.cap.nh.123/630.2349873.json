Novosel, </em>115 N.H. 302, 303, 339 A.2d 16, 17 (1975). The Superior Court <em>(Pappagianis, </em>J.) subsequently found him to be a dangerous sexual offender under RSA chapter 173-A (repealed by Laws 1983, ch. 206) and sentenced him to the custody of the director of mental health for consecutive terms of seven-and-one-half to fifteen years and two-and-one-half to five years. The defendant appeals his convictions on the ground that evidence admitted at trial, which had been seized during a search of his home, should have been suppressed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-16\">The defendant was arrested in August 1980, after a woman complained to the Keene police that he had sexually assaulted and abused her. After taking a statement which was signed and sworn to by the victim, two Keene police officers applied for a warrant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>search the bedroom, closets, and cellar of the defendant\u2019s residence. The Keene District Court (Talbot, S.J.) issued a warrant authorizing the police to search those areas for property described as follows: \u201cPhotos of nude and siminude [sic] males and females, restraining devices, jack knife with yellow handle, wooden ladle, paddle, ruler, rubber straps, rubber underclothes and other devices used in S &amp; M sexual activity, i.e., Polaroid type camera.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The police seized extensive evidence from the defendant\u2019s bedroom and closets, including certain items which had not been described specifically in the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The defendant, alleging that the search warrant was invalid, filed a motion to suppress the evidence. The motion stated that the \u201citems and articles to be seized\u201d were not \u201cdescribed with sufficient particularity,\u201d and that the affidavits submitted to obtain the warrant did not support a finding of probable cause because no evidence was presented regarding the credibility of the victim. With regard to the latter argument, the defendant argued that the victim\u2019s psychiatric background should have been presented to the justice issuing the warrant so that he could make \u201can independent [determination of her credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">At the hearing on this motion, the defendant asserted in support of his first argument only that certain tapes and a tape recorder should be excluded from evidence because they did not reasonably conform to the \u201cgeneral\u201d phrase \u201cother devices used in S &amp; M sexual activity.\u201d The Superior Court (Contas, J.) granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the seized evidence only with respect to the tapes and tape recorder, but otherwise denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">At trial, the State introduced numerous items of evidence, most of which fit specific descriptions in the search warrant, including 37 Polaroid color photographs of the victim taken by the defendant, two \u201cwide black rubber bands,\u201d one \u201cblack rubber band, masklike in cut,\u201d one \u201cblack rubber band with attached golf ball device,\u201d a \u201cblack rubber posing strap,\u201d ropes and pulleys, a Polaroid camera, a pocket jackknife, a wooden dildo and a wooden stick. A \u201cblack rubber mask/hood,\u201d a gas mask, and a pair of panties, corresponding to the more general description in the warrant of \u201cother S &amp; M devices,\u201d were also admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">On appeal, the defendant claims first that <em>none </em>of the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant should have been admitted because the terms \u201crestraining devices,\u201d \u201crubber straps,\u201d and \u201cother devices used in S &amp; M sexual activity,\u201d were so general as to taint the entire warrant, and allowed the police to engage in an unlimited and unconstitutional \u201cexploratory\u201d search.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The State responds, as a preliminary matter, that the defendant\u2019s present argument is not properly before us because he did not raise it below. While we agree that the defendant failed at oral argument on his motion to suppress to make the specific argument he now raises on appeal, we conclude that the issue is properly before us because his written motion alleges that the warrant was invalid because the items seized were not sufficiently described.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Nonetheless, we hold that the defendant\u2019s claim fails on its merits, as we do not find the description of items to be seized to be unconstitutionally vague or general. <em>See Lo-Ji Sales, Inc. v. New York, </em>442 U.S. 319, 325 (1979). The degree of specificity required in a search warrant depends upon the nature of the items to be seized. <em>State v. Salsman, </em>112 N.H. 138, 142, 290 A.2d 618, 621 (1972); <em>see </em>R. McNamara, 1 New Hampshire Practice: Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 60 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">We fail to see how the State in this case could have better described the various rubber strap items, ropes, and pulleys found in the defendant\u2019s bedroom and closets, than to describe them as \u201crubber straps\u201d and \u201crestraining devices.\u201d If the phrase \u201cdevices used in S &amp; M sexual activity, i.e., Polaroid type camera\u201d stood alone in a search warrant, it might be considered unconstitutionally general; however, this phrase does not stand as the sole description of the items to be seized in the defendant\u2019s home. Rather, the warrant lists numerous specific items which had been described by the victim, and ends with the phrase <em>\u201cand other\u201d </em>S &amp; M devices, which simply provided for the seizure of <em>other </em>S &amp; M devices, like those listed specifically, including the noted Polaroid camera. <em>See Andresen v. Maryland, </em>427 U.S. 463, 479-81 (1976) (use of \u201cother fruits\u201d clause at end of particularly described list of items does not render warrant unconstitutionally general).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The defendant also argues that the police failed to make the victim\u2019s troubled psychiatric background known to the justice who issued the warrant, and that he should have been allowed to introduce evidence attacking the victim\u2019s credibility at the suppression hearing. We note that the affidavit given by the police in support of their application for a search warrant specifically stated that the victim was an \u201coutpatient of Monadnock Family and Mental Health Service,\u201d and thq,t the defendant has in no way made even a preliminary showing that the police misrepresented or concealed this fact from the justice who issued the warrant. <em>See State v. Spero, </em>117 N.H. 199, 204, 371 A.2d 1155, 1158 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>More generally, however, we hold that the credibility of the victim of a crime does not need to be proven or bolstered when the police apply for a search warrant. Absent a strong showing of falsehood or material misrepresentation by the police, attacks on the credibility of a victim have no place in a suppression hearing, whether or not they may eventually be relevant and permissible at trial. A finding of probable cause to support a search warrant does not require more than a showing of \u201ca strong probability that the facts alleged are true.\u201d <em>State v. Comeau, </em>114 N.H. 431, 434, 321 A.2d 590, 592 (1974); <em>see State v. Breest, </em>116 N.H. 734, 744, 367 A.2d 1320, 1328 (1976). Probable cause is not tantamount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>122 N.H. 1161, 1163, 453 A.2d 1319, 1320 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b662-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
