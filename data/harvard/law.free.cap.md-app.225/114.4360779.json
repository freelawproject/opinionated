David Geier was the subject of a separate disciplinary proceeding at the time of the disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The Geiers responded to the disclosures by accusing the Board, its 22 members, its administrative prosecutor, and two staff members of abuse of power, invasion of privacy, and acting maliciously and vindictively. They filed suit in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In discovery, the Geiers attempted to uncover why the Board<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> publicly disclosed their confidential medical information. The Geiers also attempted to establish that the disciplinary proceedings against them were motivated by malice. Although the Geiers ordinarily could not have obtained discovery about the Board\u2019s decisional processes in the disciplinary proceedings against them <em>(see, e.g., Montgomery County v. Stevens, </em>337 Md. 471, 481, 654 A.2d 877 (1995); <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Patuxent Valley Conservation League, </em>300 Md. 200, 214, 477 A.2d 759 (1984)), they attempted to discover that information in this separate civil case and then to use it in the disciplinary proceedings. Their discovery requests collided with the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of governmental communications of \u201can advisory or deliberative nature,\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Verdow, </em>287 Md. 544, 563, 414 A.2d 914 (1980), as well as the general statutory prohibition on the discoverability and admissibility of documents from the Board\u2019s investigations and hearings. Md.Code (1981, 2014 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 14-410 of the Health Occupations Article (\u201cHO\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Citing the deliberative privilege, the general statutory prohibition against the discovery of the records of its investigatory proceedings, the attorney-client privilege, and the work-product protection, the Board refused to produce much of the information that the Geiers had requested in discovery. The circuit court granted one of the Geiers\u2019 several motions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>compel, and the Board took an interlocutory appeal from that discovery order (No. 722).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">After this Court stayed part of the discovery order pending the appeal, the Geiers moved for discovery sanctions because of the Board\u2019s other failures of discovery, most notably including the failure to produce a properly prepared designee at a duly noted deposition. The circuit court imposed the sanction of a default judgment on the issue of liability, and the Board took a second interlocutory appeal (No. 2256), which we consolidated with the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\n<em>Questions Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The Board\u2019s consolidated appeal presents several questions for our review. We quote the single question presented in No. 722 and rephrase and consolidate the questions posed in No. 2256:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">1. Does the circuit court\u2019s order compelling disclosure violate the Board\u2019s absolute quasi-judicial immunity, its common law and statutory privileges, and \u00a7\u00a7 l-401(d) and 14-410 of the Health Occupations Article?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">2. Did the court err by entering an order of default against the Board on the issue of liability?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The Geiers have moved to dismiss both appeals on the ground that the order compelling discovery and the order of default are unappealable interlocutory orders, and not final judgments from which an appeal will lie.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">1. Is the sanction of default as to liability barred by the defendants' absolute judicial immunity from suit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-13\">2. In proceeding on the plaintiffs' fifth motion for discovery sanctions and entering a sanction of default as to liability, did the circuit court improperly interfere with the defendants' pending appeal from the order compelling discovery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-14\">3. Did the circuit court err and abuse its discretion in entering a discovery sanction of default as to liability against all defendants for the Board's purported failure to prepare adequately its Rule 4-212(d) organizational representative?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>In the unusual circumstances of this case, we conclude that the first of the two appeals is properly before us, because the requested discovery implicates the decisional processes of high-level government administrators and is thus eligible for an immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Stevens, </em>337 Md. at 479-80, 654 A.2d 877; <em>Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. at 210, 477 A.2d 759. On the merits, we vacate the discovery order and remand for further proceedings, because the circuit court did not correctly evaluate some of the Board\u2019s statutory and common-law privileges, including the deliberative privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">On the other hand, we conclude that the order of default is not properly before us. Nonetheless, because the decision on the discovery order may indirectly affect the premises for the order of default, the circuit court, upon a proper motion, should reevaluate the propriety of that interlocutory order on remand. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-602(a) (stating that, in general, \u201can order or other form of decision, however designated, that adjudicates ... less than an entire claim ... is subject to revision at any time before the entry of a judgment that adjudicates all of the claims by and against all of the parties\u201d); <em>Gertz v. Anne Arundel County, </em>339 Md. 261, 272-73, 661 A.2d 1157 (1995) (an interlocutory order \u201cis not a final judgment and may be revised at any time before the entry of a final judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Dr. Geier is a physician who advocates the theory that certain vaccines cause autism in genetically susceptible children. Dr. Geier\u2019s son, David Geier, is not a physician, but has assisted his father in his research concerning that theory. In a case concerning the admissibility of expert testimony, the Court of Appeals has held that \u201cDr. Geier\u2019s genetic susceptibility theory is no more than hypothesis and conjecture, devoid of a generally accepted methodology to support it.\u201d <em>Blackwell v. Wyeth, </em>408 Md. 575, 618, 971 A.2d 235 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In protracted and contentious disciplinary proceedings, the Board has established that Dr. Geier committed numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>violations of the Medical Practice Act, [\u00b6] \u00a7\u00a7 14-401 <em>et seq., </em>in his treatment of autistic children. <em>Geier v. Maryland State Bd. of Physicians, </em>223 Md.App. 404, 415-17, 116 A.3d 1026 (2015). The Board has also established that, while assisting in the treatment of autistic children in Dr. Geier\u2019s practice, David Geier practiced medicine without a license. <em>David </em>A <em>Geier v. Maryland Bd. of Physicians, </em>No. 709, Sept. Term 2014, slip op. at 8-10 (filed July 31, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The Geiers contend that the Board has acted against them out of a desire to punish them and to discredit their research.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">A. The Disciplinary Proceeding against Dr. Geier</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">On April 27, 2011, the Board summarily suspended Dr. Geier\u2019s right to practice medicine, asserting that the \u201cpublic health, safety or welfare imperatively required emergency action.\u201d On May 16, 2011, the Board formally charged Dr. Geier with violations of the Medical Practice Act. As later amended, the charges included unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine; willfully making or filing a false report or record in the practice of medicine; willfully failing to file or record any medical record as required under law; practicing medicine with an unauthorized person or aiding an unauthorized person in the practice of medicine; gross overutilization of health care services; failing to meet standards, as determined by peer review, for the delivery of quality medical care, and failing to keep adequate medical records. <em>Geier, </em>223 Md.App. at 413-14,116 A.3d 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">In September 2011, after six days of hearings, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) issued a proposed decision upholding the summary suspension of Dr. Geier\u2019s license. In March 2012, after an additional five days of hearings, the ALJ issued a 126-page proposed decision, in which she recommended that the Board uphold the charges of unprofessional conduct, willfully making or filing a false report or record, failing to meet standards for the delivery of quality medical care; and failing to keep adequate medical records. The ALJ also recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>mended that Dr. Geier\u2019s license be revoked. <em>Id. </em>at 414, 116 A.3d 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Dr. Geier took exceptions, but on August 22, 2012, the Board issued a final decision ordering that his license be revoked. On a petition for judicial review, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County affirmed on April 9, 2014. <em>Id. </em>at 418, 116 A.3d 1026. On appeal, this Court affirmed as well. <em>Id. </em>at 412,116 A.3d 1026.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">B. The Disciplinary Proceeding against David Geier</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Meanwhile, on May 16, 2011, the Board charged David Geier with practicing medicine without a license in violation of [\u00b6] \u00a7 14-601. On March 7, 2012, an ALJ recommended that the charges be dismissed. On July 30, 2012, however, the Board rejected the recommendation (and many of the ALJ\u2019s findings), concluded that Mr. Geier had practiced medicine without a license, and imposed a fine of $10,000. On a petition for judicial review, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County affirmed on April 25, 2014. In an unreported opinion dated July 31, 2015, this Court affirmed as well.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">C. The Disclosure of the Geiers\u2019 Medical Information</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">On January 25, 2012, while both of these disciplinary proceedings were pending, the Board issued a cease and desist order that accused Dr. Geier of practicing medicine at a time when his license had been summarily suspended. The order, which was posted to the Board\u2019s website and could be viewed by the public, specifically alleged that Dr. Geier had written prescriptions for himself, his son David, and his wife Anne. The order also detailed the Geiers\u2019 confidential medical information, identifying the specific medications that Dr. Geier had allegedly prescribed for each person and describing the medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>cal conditions that each medication typically treated. Rather than reproduce the confidential medical information, we shall simply state that it was highly personal in nature and not of the sort that an ordinary person would want to have disseminated to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Although the Board claimed (and continues to claim) that it had the right to post the Geiers\u2019 confidential medical information to its website,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it promptly removed the information when the Geiers protested. In addition, the Board issued an amended cease and desist order that deleted the references to the medications that Dr. Geier had allegedly prescribed and the patients for whom he had allegedly prescribed them. In the interim, however, other persons viewed and commented about the Geiers\u2019 confidential medical information, and those comments are still accessible on the internet. Ultimately, an ALJ rejected the charge that Dr. Geier had written any prescriptions and had violated the summary suspension order.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">D. The Geiers\u2019 Complaint, and the Board\u2019s Unsuccessful Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">On December 21, 2012, while Dr. Geier and David Geier were pursuing their petitions for judicial review of the Board\u2019s rulings against them, they and Dr. Geier\u2019s wife filed a three-count complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. As defendants, the Geiers named the Board, as well as each of its members, its administrative prosecutor, and two staff members. The complaint alleged that by disclosing the Gei-ers\u2019 confidential medical information, the defendants had deprived them of their constitutional right to privacy; violated the Maryland Confidentiality of Medical Records Act, Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Code (1982, 2009 RepLVol.), \u00a7\u00a7 4-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the Health General Article; and committed the tort of invasion of privacy by giving unreasonable publicity to private facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The complaint alleged that the defendants \u201cacted with ill will and with the intent to injure Plaintiffs by exposing Dr. Geier\u2019s personal medical information and that of his wife and son.\u201d The Geiers requested compensatory damages as well as $3 million in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The Board moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Following a hearing on July 10, 2013, the circuit court dismissed the Confidentiality of Medical Records Act claim, explaining that the statute does not create a private right of action. The court, however, declined to dismiss the constitutional claim and the invasion of privacy claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">E. Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The Geiers sought extensive discovery, attempting to unearth any evidence that might show that the Board acted out of animosity towards them. The Geiers did not limit their discovery requests to the specific circumstances immediately surrounding the Board\u2019s disclosure of their confidential medical information. Instead, based on the contention that the Board was motivated by an overarching desire to punish them and discredit their research, the Geiers sought documents and testimony that revealed the Board\u2019s decisional processes in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>administrative proceedings against them. They also sought communications between the Board and its counsel that related to these prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The Board\u2019s response to the Geiers\u2019 maximalist approach proved unsatisfactory both to the Geiers and, eventually, to the circuit court. The Geiers filed multiple motions to compel and motions for discovery sanctions, two of which are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">F. The First Motion to Compel</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">On November 5, 2013, the Geiers moved to compel discovery, contending that the Board had not complied with their earlier discovery requests, which principally concerned the rationale for issuing a public cease and desist order that disclosed confidential medical information. The Board opposed those requests on the basis of the deliberative privilege, see <em>Hamilton v. Verdow, </em>287 Md. at 563, 414 A.2d 914, and the work-product protection. After a hearing on the motion, the circuit court ordered the .Board to provide the requested discovery, but stayed its order for 15 days to allow the Board to pursue an interlocutory appeal. The Board did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">G. The First Motion for Sanctions and the Second Motion to Compel</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Although the Board began to produce responsive documents, the Geiers were dissatisfied with the pace and quantity of the production. On January 10, 2014, the Geiers filed a second motion to compel, in which they challenged the Board\u2019s assertion of the attorney-client privilege. A week later, the Geiers moved for sanctions after the Board informed them that it had belatedly located 14 boxes of documents that might be responsive to the requests for production.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">On February 20, 2014, the circuit court granted the motion for sanctions, but did not specify a sanction. On the same day, the court granted the motion to compel the putatively privileged documents. The Geiers assert that the Board produced those documents four days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>H. The Third Motion to Compel</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">On May 1, 2014, shortly after they had failed in their petitions for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decisions against them, the Geiers filed a third motion to compel. That motion concerned two classes of documents: the Board\u2019s administrative investigatory file in its disciplinary proceedings against Dr. Geier\u2019s partner, John L. Young, M.D.; and communications between the Board\u2019s attorneys and defendant Joshua Shafer, an investigator for the Board. The Geiers argued that the Board had proceeded against Dr. Geier\u2019s partner, Dr. Young, as part of its campaign to discredit their research.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The Board opposed the production of the deliberations in Dr. Young\u2019s case on a number of grounds, including the deliberative privilege, the attorney-client privilege, the work-product protection, and [\u00b6] \u00a7 14-410, which states that, generally, \u201c[t]he proceedings, records, or files of the Board, a disciplinary panel, or any of its other investigatory bodies are not discoverable and are not admissible in evidence[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Following a hearing on June 17, 2014, the circuit court granted the Geiers\u2019 motion and compelled the disclosure of all of the requested documents. On June 26, 2014, the Board filed a notice of appeal of that order. That appeal is before us as No. 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">I. The Proceedings after the Initial Appeal, and the Entry of the Order of Default on the Issue of Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In an order dated August 15, 2014, this Court granted the Board\u2019s motion to stay the production of Dr. Young\u2019s file and all other discovery pending further orders of court. In a revised order dated September 24, 2014, this Court stayed the production of Dr. Young\u2019s file, of audio recordings of the Board\u2019s deliberations in the disciplinary proceedings against Dr. Geier and Mr. Geier, and of any written communications concerning this case between the Board or its members and the Board\u2019s attorneys. In the meantime, however, a number of additional developments had occurred in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>On June 17, 2014, the day of the order granting the third motion to compel, the Geiers served a notice of deposition for a representative of the Board. The notice set the deposition for the previously agreed dates of July 1 through July 3, 2014, and enumerated no fewer than 167 discrete topics on which the Geiers requested testimony, including the Board\u2019s investigation of Dr. Young. On June 29, 2014, two business days before the commencement of the deposition, the Board moved for a protective order. In support of the protective order, the Board did not assert the deliberative privilege or complain about the staggering number of requested topics. It simply asserted that the topics were insufficiently specific and that its designee had \u201ca professional scheduling conflict.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Although the Board did not obtain a protective order before the deposition was to begin, its designee and counsel nonetheless failed to appear. The failure to appear prompted a second motion for sanctions. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-432(a) (authorizing immediate sanctions if any officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under Rule 2-412(d) to testify on behalf of a party, fails to appear before the officer who is to take that person\u2019s deposition, after proper notice).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Meanwhile, even though the Board had not yet obtained a stay of the June 17, 2014, discovery order from either the circuit court or this Court, the Board did not produce the documents that the circuit court had compelled it to produce. The Board\u2019s conduct prompted a third motion for sanctions, which the circuit court granted on August 14, 2014, one day before this Court stayed discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The Board\u2019s designee had appeared for a deposition on July 29, 2014, but was unprepared to address many of the topics in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the notice, including the investigation of Dr. Young. The lack of preparation prompted a fifth motion for sanctions on August 8, 2014.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After denying the Board\u2019s motion to stay any action on the motion pending the appeal of the discovery order of June 17, 2014, the circuit court granted the motion for sanctions in a memorandum and order dated December 16, 2014. In that memorandum, the court exhaustively detailed the Board\u2019s conduct in discovery and, on the basis of that conduct, imposed the sanction of a default order against the Board on the issue of liability. The court added that \u201c[o]nce the current interlocutory appeal has been resolved, the court will schedule a trial on damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The Board took an appeal from the December 16, 2014, order. That appeal is before us as No. 2256.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">This Court consolidated the two appeals by order dated January 27, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">I. The Motions to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">We begin by addressing the scope of this consolidated, interlocutory appeal. The Geiers have asked this Court to dismiss both appeals. We shall deny the motion as to the discovery order of June 17, 2014, but grant it as to the order of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">A. Appealability of June 17, 2014, Order</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">Generally, parties may appeal only from the entry of a final judgment. Md.Code (1974, 2013 RepLVol.) \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201c[A] party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court\u201d). \u201c[A] ruling must ordinarily have the following three attributes to be a final judgment: (1) it must be intended by the court as an unqualified, final disposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the matter in controversy, (2) unless the court acts pursuant to Maryland Rule 2\u2014602(b) to direct the entry of a final judgment as to less than all of the claims or all of the parties, it must adjudicate or complete the adjudication of all claims against all parties; [and] (3) it must be set forth and recorded in accordance with Rule 2-601.\u201d <em>Metro Maint. Sys. South, Inc. v. Milburn, </em>442 Md. 289, 298, 112 A.3d 429 (2015) (citing <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767 (1989)). All parties agree that the June 17, 2014, discovery order is not a final judgment. <em>See, e.g., In re Foley, </em>373 Md. 627, 634, 820 A.2d 587 (2003); <em>accord St. Joseph Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Cardiac Surgery Assocs., P.A., </em>392 Md. 75, 85-87, 896 A.2d 304 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The Board, however, argues that the order is appealable under the collateral order doctrine, a \u201cvery narrow exception\u201d to the final judgment rule <em>(see, e.g., Dawkins v. Baltimore City Police Dep\u2019t, </em>376 Md. 53, 58, 827 A.2d 115 (2003)) that \u201ctreats as final and appealable a limited class of orders which do not terminate the litigation in the trial court.\u201d <em>Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. at 206, 477 A.2d 759. Those orders have been deemed appealable under the collateral order doctrine because they are \u201coffshoots of the principal litigation in which they are issued[.]\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>337 Md. at 477, 654 A.2d 877 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>To qualify as a collateral order, a ruling must satisfy four criteria: \u201c(1) it must conclusively determine the disputed question; (2) it must resolve an important issue; (3) it must be completely separate from the merits of the action; and (4) it must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Addison v. Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, </em>411 Md. 251, 285, 983 A.2d 138 (2009). On a number of occasions, Maryland courts have held that, notwithstanding the general prohibition on immediate appeals of discovery orders, the collateral order doctrine may permit an immediate appeal of a discovery order that permits a litigant to inquire into the decisional processes of high-level government officials, particularly administrative adjudicators.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In <em>Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. at 204, 477 A.2d 759, the Public Service Commission issued a certificate to authorize a utility to construct overhead transmission lines. Patuxent Valley, an association of affected property owners, petitioned for judicial review and took steps to depose the commissioners. <em>Id. </em>In support of the unusual request to depose administrative decision-makers in an action for judicial review, Patuxent Valley and its allies cited a possible ex <em>parte </em>communication between the hearing examiner and the chairman of the Commission and made vague allegations of bias and bad faith. <em>Id. </em>at 204-05, 477 A.2d 759. The circuit court denied the Commission\u2019s motion for a protective order, the Commission appealed, and Patuxent Valley moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the discovery order was not a final judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 205, 477 A.2d 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">After issuing a writ of certiorari on its own motion <em>(see id.), </em>the Court of Appeals denied the motion to dismiss and held that the Commission had the right to take an immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 210, 477 A.2d 759. In an opinion by Judge Eldridge, the Court rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>soned that the Commission had met the four criteria of the collateral order doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">First, the order conclusively determined that individual Commission officials must appear for depositions with respect to their decision to grant [the utility] certificate. Second, the issue is clearly important. If, in actions for judicial review of administrate decisions, it is permissible for trial courts to order the depositions of the administrative decision makers, upon the type of allegations made in this case, the impact upon administrative agencies of the State and local governments may be quite substantial. Third, the question whether Commission decision makers should be required to stand for depositions is distinct from the merits of Patuxent\u2019s action for judicial review of the agency decision. Finally, if not appealable until the conclusion of the trial, the claim that Commission members should not be routinely subjected to extensive probing of their individual decisional thought processes would irretrievably be lost. Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the disruption to the administrative process, caused by placing the officials under pretrial scrutiny, is incurred at the first instance. Therefore, it would be impossible to cure the harm done to the Com- . mission once the depositions have been taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 206-07, 477 A.2d 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The Court took pains to distinguish routine discovery orders from an order requiring high-level governmental decision-makers to submit to questioning about their decisional processes: while routine discovery orders ordinarily are effectively reviewable on appeal from a final judgment on the merits, \u201cthe harm that will result from deposing Commission members before trial, should they be immune from this type of scrutiny, will occur from the instant they are subjected to a probing of their decision making processes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208, 477 A.2d 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The Court added that, \u201cin the context of administrative decisionmaking, judicial review of Commission decisions is generally based on the record, and the thought processes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>individual agency officials are free from scrutiny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209, 477 A.2d 759. \u201cIt would defeat this principle,\u201d the Court stated, \u201cif agency officials were routinely forced to undergo time-consuming depositions, then proceed to trial, and ultimately, upon a final judgment in the case, attempt to litigate the issue of whether they should have been deposed in the first place.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Similarly, in <em>Montgomery County v. Stevens, </em>337 Md. at 475, 654 A.2d 877, the Montgomery County Chief of Police exercised his right, under the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights, to impose a higher penalty than a board had recommended for a policeman who had engaged in conduct unbecoming an officer. In the officer\u2019s action for judicial review, he sought to depose the Chief, as well as several other County and local officials. <em>Id. </em>at 476, 654 A.2d 877. When the circuit court allowed the depositions to proceed over the County\u2019s objection, the County took an immediate appeal, which the officer moved to dismiss. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">After issuing a writ of certiorari on its own motion, the Court, in another opinion by Judge Eldridge, followed <em>Patux-ent Valley </em>and held that the discovery order \u201cmeets the requirements of the collateral order doctrine and is, therefore, appealable as a final judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, 654 A.2d 877. Indeed, the Court said that the facts of <em>Stevens </em>were \u201cessentially the same as the facts in <em>Patuxent </em>Valley.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479, 654 A.2d 877. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">First, [the order] conclusively determines that Chief Edwards must appear for depositions. Second, the importance of the issue in question here is identical to that in <em>Patuxent Valley, </em>that is, the potentially great harm to the public by the \u201cdisruption of the governmental process\u201d that can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>caused by discovery into the decision making processes of a high level government official. Third, the issue as to whether the deposition is appropriate is distinct from the merits of the action for judicial review. Finally, this issue will become effectively unreviewable later, because the harm would occur when the deposition was taken, and there would be no effective remedy available thereafter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 479-80, 654 A.2d 877 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Accordingly, the Court held that the appeal could proceed. <em>Id. </em>at 480, 654 A.2d 877.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">On a number of occasions, this Court has applied <em>Patuxent Valley </em>and <em>Stevens </em>in permitting an immediate appeal of orders that permitted litigants to obtain discovery from high-level decision-makers. <em>Maryland State Bd. of Dental Exam\u2019rs v. Fisher, </em>123 Md.App. 322, 327-28, 718 A.2d 627 (1998) (applying collateral order doctrine to entertain immediate appeal of order, in action for judicial review, that permitted litigant to depose administrative decision-makers and required administrative board to produce its minutes for in camera review); <em>see also Johnson v. Clark, </em>199 Md.App. 305, 308 n. 1, 21 A.3d 199 (2011) (applying collateral order doctrine to entertain immediate appeal from order denying motion to quash deposition of County Executive).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">By their terms, <em>Patuxent Valley </em>and <em>Stevens </em>apply only in actions for judicial review of an administrative decision, when the agency\u2019s opponent attempts to obtain discovery about the decision-makers\u2019 deliberative processes. Consequently, if the circuit court had permitted Dr. Geier or David Geier to pursue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>discovery about the Board\u2019s deliberations <em>in their actions for judicial review, Patuxent Valley </em>and <em>Stevens </em>would have permitted the Board to take an immediate appeal. <em>Patuxent Valley </em>and <em>Stevens, </em>however, do not directly apply to this case, which involves an independent tort claim for damages for invasion of privacy, rather than a petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Nevertheless, the June 17, 2014, discovery order meets the four criteria of the collateral order doctrine. First, like the discovery orders in <em>Patuxent Valley </em>and <em>Stevens, </em>the discovery order in this case conclusively determines that the Board must produce evidence of its deliberations and decisional processes. Second, because of \u201cthe potentially great harm to the public by the \u2018disruption of the governmental process\u2019 that can be caused by discovery into the decision making processes of [] high level government officials]\u201d <em>(Stevens, </em>337 Md. at 479, 654 A.2d 877 (quoting <em>Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. at 208, 477 A.2d 759)), the issue is no less important than the discovery issues in <em>Patuxent Valley </em>and <em>Stevens. </em>Third, the issue of whether it is appropriate to permit discovery into the deliberative processes of an administrative adjudicator<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is distinct from the merits of the Geiers\u2019 tort claim for invasion of privacy. Finally, this issue is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment, because the harm occurs when the administrative decision-makers are compelled to disclose their deliberative processes. \u201c[Tjhere would be no effective remedy thereafter.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>337 Md. at 480, 654 A.2d 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Furthermore, from a review of the record, it is beyond any serious dispute that the Geiers have used this case to circumvent the prohibition on discovery in their actions for judicial review and to obtain documents and testimony to challenge to the Board\u2019s administrative actions against them. In particular, although the Geiers successfully persuaded the circuit court to seal the record at the outset of this case, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>repeatedly asked the court to unseal much of the record so that they could use it in their petitions for judicial review. For example:</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">1. On November 5, 2013, the Geiers moved to unseal a portion of the deposition of the Board\u2019s administrative prosecutor, Victoria Pepper, in which they questioned her \u201cconcerning her role in, and the adequacy of her investigation into, the charges against Dr. Mark Geier.\u201d The Geiers explained that they intended to introduce the transcript into evidence in Dr. Geier\u2019s petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">2. On December 20, 2013, the Geiers moved to unseal the deposition of Dr. Paul Elder, a Board member. Dr. Elder had not yet testified at the time of the motion, but the Dr. Geier \u201canticipate[d]\u201d that Dr. Elder\u2019s testimony would \u201cbe directly relevant and necessary evidence\u201d in Dr. Geier\u2019s petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">3. On February 6, 2014, the Geiers moved to unseal \u201cany documents produced by Defendants that relate to their respective judicial review proceedings.\u201d Although the motion did not expressly state that Dr. Geier and David Geier intended to employ those documents in connection with their petitions for judicial review, it noted that they were both \u201cseeking judicial review of adverse decisions before the Maryland Board of Physicians.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">4. On March 6, 2014, the Geiers moved to unseal all rulings and information that did not relate to the Geiers\u2019 private medical information. Explaining the timing of the motion, the Geiers stated, \u201c[a] brief is due in Dr. Mark Geier\u2019s judicial review case on Monday, March 10, 2014.\u201d They added that \u201can opening brief is due in David Geier\u2019s judicial review case during the week of March 10, 2014.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">5. Just before his petition for judicial review came before the circuit court, Dr. Geier requested a stay \u201cto allow him time to accumulate evidence from the discovery process\u201d in his tort claim \u201cagainst the Board.\u201d <em>Geier, </em>223 Md.App. at 448-49, 116 A.3d 1026. He asserted that during discovery he had \u201c \u2018uncovered evidence that directly demonstrated bad faith, malice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>and irregularities <em>(ie., </em>misconduct) committed by the Board and its members and the administrative prosecutor against [him] in\u2019 \u201d the administrative proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 449, 116 A.3d 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">6. Similarly, in his petition for judicial review, Mr. Geier also moved for a stay of the proceedings or, alternatively, to admit new testimony or evidence. <em>Geier, </em>No. 709, Sept. Term 2014, slip op. at 26. He too claimed that the evidence, which largely concerned the Board members\u2019 deliberations, would show \u201cirregularities and misconduct by Board members and staff.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">7. Even after the circuit court had denied the stays, affirmed the Board, and ruled against the Geiers on their petitions for judicial review, they continued to use the ongoing discovery in this case to discredit the Board and bolster their legal positions. In David Geier\u2019s appeal from the denial of his petition for judicial review, he cited a number of instances of alleged misconduct that he did not cite to the circuit court. In justifying their discovery requests at the hearing that led to the discovery order of June 17, 2014, the Geiers complained of what they saw as defects and inadequacies in the Board\u2019s decisional processes and left little doubt that they intended to invoke those flaws, as well as any others that they might later find in discovery, in a kind of rhetorical collateral attack on the administrative judgments against them.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">This case does differ from <em>Patuxent Valley </em>and <em>Stevens </em>in that they concerned depositions, while this concerns the production of documents. In our view, however this is a distinction without a difference. The administrative decision-makers did not have the right to an immediate appeal in <em>Patuxent Valley </em>and <em>Stevens </em>only because an adversary had attempted to depose them about their deliberative processes; they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the right to appeal because the adversary had attempted to inquire into their deliberative processes. The administrative decision-makers would have had the right to an immediate appeal if the attempt to invade their decisional processes came in the form of interrogatories, document requests, requests for admissions, or some other discovery device. Indeed, in <em>Fisher, </em>123 Md.App. at 329, 718 A.2d 627, this Court followed <em>Patuxent Valley </em>and <em>Stevens </em>in entertaining an immediate appeal of a discovery order compelling an administrative board to produce the minutes of its deliberations. In addition, in the slightly different context of a tort claim action against the Governor (as opposed to an administrative agency), the Court of Appeals employed the collateral order doctrine to review and reverse a discovery order that required the chief executive to submit privileged documents, including documents as to which he had asserted the executive privilege, for \u201cexpanded <em>in camera </em>review\u201d by the circuit court and opposing counsel. <em>Ehrlich v. Grove, </em>396 Md. 550, 571-72, 914 A.2d 783 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In summary, in the unusual circumstances of this specific case, we have appellate jurisdiction to review the discovery order of June 17, 2014, under <em>Patuxent Valley, Stevens, </em>and the collateral order doctrine. We would certainly have had appellate jurisdiction had the court allowed discovery of the Board\u2019s deliberative processes in an action for judicial review. We see no reason why we would not also have appellate jurisdiction when a court allows discovery of the Board\u2019s deliberative process in a separate action that is quite obviously being used to garner evidence in connection with an action for judicial review or the functional equivalent of a collateral attack on the agency\u2019s final decision. Accordingly, we hold that the appeal of the discovery order of June 17, 2014, \u201ccomes within the collateral order doctrine and is properly before us.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>337 Md. at 480, 654 A.2d 877. Therefore, we deny the motion to dismiss Case No. 722.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>B. Appealability of December 16, 2014, Order of Default</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">On December 16, 2014, the circuit court entered an order of default as to liability. The order of default corresponded to the Geiers\u2019 fifth motion for sanctions, which complained that the Board had failed to produce a qualified or competent organizational representative for a deposition. The order contemplated that the court would wait to decide damages after this Court resolved the Board\u2019s interlocutory appeal of the June 17, 2014, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">It is beyond dispute that, because the order of default leaves open the question of damages, it is not a final judgment. <em>See Banegura v. Taylor, </em>312 Md. 609, 618, 541 A.2d 969 (1988) (determining that entry of order of default, which left damages open for future trial, was not final judgment and could not be immediately appealed); <em>Adams v. Mallory, </em>308 Md. 453, 461, 520 A.2d 371 (1987) (\u201c[the order], which purported to enter a judgment of default without determining any relief is not a final judgment under the Maryland Rules\u201d); <em>Farragut Vill. Condo. Ass\u2019n, Section III v. Bowling, </em>168 Md.App. 376, 381, 896 A.2d 1079 (2006) (\u201cThere may be a partial judgment as to liability ... but there is no final and appealable judgment until the issue of damages has also been resolved\u201d); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 2-613 and Md. Rule 2-433(a)(3) (enabling court to enter default judgment as discovery sanction only after determination of damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>The Board correctly concedes that a party cannot appeal from an order of default on the issue of liability. Nonetheless, the Board argues that because the collateral order doctrine treats the discovery order of June 17, 2014, as a final judgment, every other order in the case, including the subsequent order of default and perhaps even the order denying the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss, have now come before the Court. The Board misunderstands the concept of a collateral order.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">It is true that, under Md. Rule 8\u2014131(d), \u201c[o]n an appeal from a final judgment, an interlocutory order <em>previously </em>entered in the action is open to review by the Court unless an appeal has previously been taken from that order and decided on the merits by the Court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Yet, even if the discovery order of June 17, 2014, qualified as a conventional final judgment (which it does not), Rule 8\u2014131(d) would not authorize the review of the subsequent order of default: by its terms, the rule authorizes the review only of interlocutory orders that were entered \u201cpreviously\u201d to the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In any event, in <em>Snowden v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>300 Md. 555, 560 n. 2, 479 A.2d 1329 (1984), the Court of Appeals, in a decision by Judge Eldridge, made it clear that this appellate rule ordinarily does <em>not </em>apply when a party exercises the right to an immediate appeal of an interlocutory order under a statute, a rule, or the collateral order doctrine.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In reaching that decision, the <em>Snowden </em>Court specifically rejected the contention that a permissible interlocutory appeal, such as an appeal under the collateral order doctrine, is \u201c \u2018a final decision to which may be added other matters for appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Fort Sill Apache Tribe, </em>205 Ct.Cl. 805, 507 F.2d 861, 863-64 (1974)). The Court also rejected the contention that a permissible interlocutory appeal \u201c \u2018can carry along wholly unrelated holdings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Snowden, </em>300 Md. at 559 n. 2, 479 A.2d 1329 (quoting <em>Fort Sill, </em>507 F.2d at 864).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Accordingly, in a permissible interlocutory appeal under the predecessor of Rule 2-602(b), the Court refused to consider a challenge to any decision other than the specific interlocutory decision that had come before it. <em>Snowden, </em>300 Md. at 559 n. 2, 479 A.2d 1329; <em>accord Banashak v. Wittstadt, </em>167 Md.App. 627, 671, 893 A.2d 1236 (2006) (\u201cthe appealability of each separate issue must be analyzed in a vacuum,\u201d and \u201cthere are no two-for-the-price-of-one bargains on the appellate docket\u201d); <em>Forward v. McNeily, </em>148 Md.App. 290, 296 n. 2, 811 A.2d 855 (2002) (\u201ca non-appealable order may not be combined with an appealable interlocutory order so as to confer jurisdiction upon this Court\u201d); <em>cf. Davis v. Attorney General, </em>187 Md.App. 110, 123, 975 A.2d 362 (2009) (entertaining appeal of second interlocutory ruling because it \u201cdirectly controll[ed]\u201d and \u201cwas inextricably bound to the order that [was] treated as final for purposes of appeal\u201d). Had the appeal reached the <em>Snowden </em>Court under the collateral order doctrine, the result would have been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Furthermore, in a permissible, interlocutory appeal under the collateral order doctrine, it would make no sense to allow the parties to contest every other order in the case as though there had been a conventional final judgment. \u201cThe collateral order doctrine \u2018is based upon a judicially created fiction, under which certain interlocutory orders are considered to be final judgments, even though such orders clearly are <em>not </em>final judgments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ehrlich v. Grove, </em>396 Md. at 562, 914 A.2d 783 (quoting <em>Dawkins, </em>376 Md. at 64, 827 A.2d 115). More important, a party may take an immediate appeal of a collateral order only if it is <em>\u201ccollateral\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>only if it is \u201ccompletely separate from the merits of the action.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Addison, </em>411 Md. at 285, 983 A.2d 138. It would be absurd to say that, in an appeal that is permissible only if the subject matter is \u201ccompletely separate from the merits of the action,\u201d the appellate court may proceed to consider and decide every interlocutory ruling pertaining to the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In advocating for the contrary conclusion, the Board cites <em>Stevens, </em>337 Md. at 476-77, 654 A.2d 877 which remarked, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>passing, that under Rule 8\u2014131(d), \u201con appeal from an order constituting a final judgment, other orders, even if interlocutory, are generally reviewable by the appellate court.\u201d The Board concludes that because we can consider the discovery order under the collateral order doctrine, we may also consider any other orders in the case, including the order of default. The Board misreads <em>Stevens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">In <em>Stevens </em>the Court of Appeals did not employ the collateral order doctrine as a vehicle to review and decide issues other than the discovery order that permitted the depositions of administrative decision-makers. The <em>Stevens </em>Court decided no issues pertaining to the merits of the case. Instead, the Court simply said that because the collateral order doctrine permitted the Chief of Police to take an immediate appeal of the order that required him to submit to the deposition, it need not consider whether his co-appellants, the other County and local officials, had the right to appeal the discovery orders affecting them as well. <em>See Stevens, </em>337 Md. at 476, 654 A.2d 877. The Court cited Rule 8-131 (d) to indicate that because it had appellate jurisdiction to consider the discovery order concerning the Chief, it would also consider the accompanying orders concerning the other officials. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>In short, we have appellate jurisdiction to decide the validity of the discovery order of June 17, 2014, and of no other order. Under <em>Snowden, </em>we do not have jurisdiction to consider or decide unrelated orders, such as the subsequent order of default or other orders pertaining to the merits of the case, merely because we have jurisdiction to consider a collateral order, such as the discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Accordingly, in proceeding to the merits of this case, we shall limit our discussion to the discovery order. Therefore, we grant the motion to dismiss Case No. 2256, concerning the order of default. As previously stated, however, our decision on the discovery order may, affect the circuit court\u2019s evaluation of how to treat the order of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">II. The Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In its order of June 17, 2014, the circuit court compelled the Board to produce the records of its pre-decisional deliberations in the administrative proceedings against Dr. Geier\u2019s partner, John L. Young, M.D., and communications between the Board\u2019s attorneys and Joshua Shafer, an investigator for the Board. We shall address each of those rulings in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">A. Dr. Young\u2019s Files</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">In the circuit court, the Board asserted two grounds for withholding documents pertaining to the proceedings against Dr. Young: the deliberative privilege and [\u00b6] \u00a7 14-410\u2019s general statutory prohibition against the discovery and admission of the Board\u2019s proceedings, records, or files.

To the contrary, the Board, which is a party to the proceeding involving Dr. Young, emphatically objects to the release of those files to the Geiers. Consequently, section 14-410 prevents the disclosure of the Dr. Young file unless the Geiers\u2019 case comes within subsection (b)\u2019s exception for a \u201ccivil action brought by a party to a proceeding before the Board ... who claims to be aggrieved by the decision of the Board.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">The Geiers argue that they come within subsection (b) because they \u201cclaim[ ] to be aggrieved by [a] decision of the Board\u201d and have brought \u201ca civil action.\u201d Although it is not completely clear whether the Geiers claim to have been aggrieved by the decisions in the administrative proceedings against them, by the decision to issue the cease and desist order disclosing their confidential medical information, or by some other decision, the circuit court agreed with the Geier\u2019s interpretation. We reject that interpretation, because it is inconsistent with the policy of section 14-410 to allow one party who \u201cwho claims to be aggrieved by the decision of the Board\u201d to obtain \u201c[t]he proceedings, records, or files of the Board\u201d in a proceeding involving a completely different party.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In <em>Baltimore Sun v. Univ. of Maryland Med. Sys., </em>321 Md. 659, 584 A.2d 683 (1991), the Court of Appeals discussed the discoverability of the confidential, peer-review records of a medical review committee under a statutory predecessor of what is now [\u00b6] \u00a7 l-401(d). Much like [\u00b6] \u00a7 14-410(a), the former statute, [\u00b6] \u00a7 14\u2014601(d)(1) (1981, 1986 Repl.Vol.), provided that \u201cthe proceedings, records, and files of a medical review committee are not discoverable and are not admissible in evidence in any civil action arising out of matters that are being reviewed and evaluated by the medical review committee.\u201d Much like [\u00b6] \u00a7 14-410(b), however, the following subsection created an exception, under which the general prohibition on discovery and admissibility did not apply to \u201c[a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>civil action brought by a party to the proceedings of the medical review committee who claims to be aggrieved by the decision of the medical review committee.\u201d [\u00b6] \u00a7 14-601(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">In responding to the certified question, the Court of Appeals recognized that the general rule against the discovery and admission of medical review committee materials \u201cis premised upon legislative appreciation that a high level of confidentiality is necessary for effective medical peer review.\u201d <em>Baltimore Sun v. Univ. of Maryland Med. Sys., </em>321 Md. at 668, 584 A.2d 683. \u201cBy protecting those records from public access in those situations covered by [former HO] \u00a7 14-601(d), the legislature recognized that a system of effective medical peer review outweighs the need for complete public disclosure.\u201d <em>Id.; accord Cardiac Surgery Assocs., </em>392 Md. at 94, 896 A.2d 304 (quoting <em>id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">On the other hand, the \u201cexception to the broad statutory protection afforded by [former HO] \u00a7 14-601(d)\u201d made it \u201cplain,\u201d in the Court\u2019s view, \u201cthat <em>that protection has no application in a civil action initiated </em>... <em>by a physician who is the subject (a party to the proceedings) of the medical review committee.\u201d Baltimore Sun v. Univ. of Maryland Med. Sys., </em>321 Md. at 668, 584 A.2d 683 (emphasis added). The Court went on to explain that the exception \u201cis premised on <em>the due process rights of a physician aggrieved by the decision of the medical review committee.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). The \u201call encompassing\u201d \u201crule of confidentiality\u201d yields only so far as \u201cto allow a physician who is the subject of a peer review to obtain the records for use in that physician\u2019s challenge to the peer review conclusions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670, 584 A.2d 683 (Rodowsky, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In other words, to protect their own due process rights, physicians may discover their own files\u2014the files from the cases in which they were \u201cthe subject\u201d or \u201ca party.\u201d They cannot, however, discover someone else\u2019s files. The concurring opinion made this point more acutely: \u201cthe rule of confidentiality is suspended only to the extent necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>achieve the purpose of the suspension.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670, 584 A.2d 683 (Rodowsky, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">By analogy to [\u00b6] \u00a7 14-410, <em>Baltimore Sun </em>compels the conclusion that the Geiers have no right to discover the \u201c[t]he proceedings, records, or files of the Board\u201d in the matter concerning Dr. Young. Subsection (a) makes those \u201cproceedings, records, or files\u201d undiscoverable and inadmissible without \u201cexpress stipulation and consent of all parties to a proceeding,\u201d which the Geiers do not have. Subsection (b) creates an exception, under which the \u201cproceedings, records, or files\u201d concerning Dr. Young may become discoverable and admissible in a civil action brought <em>by Dr. Young, </em>in which <em>Dr. Young </em>\u201cclaims to be aggrieved by the decision of the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The exception serves to permit Dr. Young to vindicate his rights if he is aggrieved by the Board\u2019s decision. <em>Baltimore Sun v. Univ. of Maryland Med. Sys., </em>321 Md. at 668, 584 A.2d 683. It does not, however, permit the Geiers, or anyone else besides Dr. Young, to discover \u201c[t]he proceedings, records, or files of the Board\u201d in the matter concerning Dr. Young. <em>See id.; see also id. </em>at 670, 584 A.2d 683 (Rodowsky, J., concurring). Any other rule would drastically curtail the important principle of confidentiality in Board deliberations, as it would allow any person who claims to be \u201caggrieved\u201d by some \u201cdecision of the Board\u201d to discover the Board\u2019s \u201cproceedings, records, or files\u201d concerning any other person, subject only to the broad definition of \u201crelevance\u201d for purposes of discovery. The circuit court, therefore, erred in compelling the Board to produce \u201c[t]he proceedings, records, or files of the Board\u201d in the matter concerning Dr. Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">2. The Deliberative Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The Board argues that the circuit court erroneously rejected its claim that the common-law deliberative privilege excused it from disclosing Dr. Young\u2019s file. We vacate the circuit court\u2019s order because, in determining that the privilege did not apply, the court did not expressly balance \u201cthe need for confidentiality against the [Geiers\u2019] need for disclosure and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the impact of nondisclosure upon the fair administration of justice.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Verdow, </em>287 Md. at 563, 414 A.2d 914.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The deliberative privilege is a species of executive privilege <em>(see id. </em>at 561, 414 A.2d 914), \u201cwhich has been considered part of the common law of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 414 A.2d 914. The terms \u201cdeliberative privilege\u201d and \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d are used interchangeably in the relevant case law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5680 Official Information\u2014Deliberative Process Privilege, 26A Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Evid. \u00a7 5680 (1st ed.) (\u201c[T]he privilege has also been known by a variety of other names,\u201d including \u201cgovernmental or deliberative process privilege,\u201d and \u201cfrank communications exemption\u201d); <em>see also City of Colorado Springs v. White, </em>967 P.2d 1042, 1048-49 (Colo. 1998) (noting that the terms \u201cdeliberative\u201d and \u201cexecutive\u201d are used interchangeably, referring to the same privilege).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In the United States, the privilege traces its roots to the treason trial of Aaron Burr, in which Chief Justice Marshall acknowledged that President Jefferson might prevent the disclosure of a letter that allegedly contained state secrets. <em>Hamilton, </em>287 Md. at 556-57, 414 A.2d 914 (citing <em>United States v. Burr, </em>25 Fed.Case. 187, 191-92 (Cir.Ct.Va.1807)).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In explaining the rationale for the privilege, the Court of Appeals, in an opinion by Judge Eldridge, stated, \u201c[I]t is apparent from the very nature of government that a legitimate necessity exists for the protection from public disclosure of certain types of official information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556, 414 A.2d 914. The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The necessity for some protection from disclosure clearly extends to confidential advisory and deliberative communications between officials and those who assist them in formulating and deciding upon future governmental action. A fundamental part of the decisional process is the analysis of different options and alternatives. Advisory communications, from a subordinate to a governmental officer, which examine and analyze these choices, are often essential to this process. The making of candid communications by the subordinate may well be hampered if their contents are expected to become public knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 558, 414 A.2d 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The Court quoted Archibald Cox Jr., the Watergate special prosecutor who had pursued the tapes of President Nixon\u2019s conversations with his aides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">[TJhere are two reasons for preserving the confidentiality of intragovernmental documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising parts of the process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated: (1) to encourage aides and colleagues to give completely candid advice by reducing the risk that they will be subject to public disclosure, criticism and reprisals; [and] (2) to give the President or other officer the freedom to \u201cthink out loud,\u201d which enables him [or her] to test ideas and debate policy and personalities uninhibited by the danger that his [or her] tentative but rejected thoughts will become subjects of public discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting Archibald Cox, Executive Privilege, 122 U. Pa. L.Rev. 1383,1410 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Similarly, the Court quoted <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974), in which the Supreme Court rejected President Nixon\u2019s claim of an \u201cabsolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.\u201d Notwithstanding its decision on the merits, the Supreme Court nonetheless recognized that \u201c \u2018those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appear-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>anees and for their own interests to the detriment of the decision-making process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hamilton v. Verdow, </em>287 Md. at 558-59, 414 A.2d 914 (quoting <em>Nixon, </em>418 U.S. at 705, 94 S.Ct. 3090); <em>see also id. </em>at 559, 414 A.2d 914 (quoting <em>Kaiser Alum. &amp; Chem. Corp. v.

[B]y the same token the integrity of the administrative process must be equally respected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hamilton v.

Verdow, </em>287 Md. at 562, 414 A.2d 914. Executive privilege, however, \u201cdiffers from many other evidentiary privileges\u201d in that \u201c[i]t is for the benefit of the public and not the governmental officials who claim the privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563, 414 A.2d 914. In addition, \u201c[a]part from diplomatic, military or other sensitive matters, the privilege is not an absolute one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cRather,\u201d the privilege \u201cattempts to accommodate the competing interests of a just resolution of legal disputes with the need to protect certain confidential government communications.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\u201c[W]hen a formal claim of executive privilege is made for confidential communications of the chief executive, or confidential communications of other government officials of an advisory or deliberative nature, there is a presumptive privilege, with the burden upon those seeking to compel disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, \u201c[i]n many situations the courts have engaged in a balancing process, weighing the need for confidentiality against the litigant\u2019s need for disclosure and the impact of nondisclosure upon the fair administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In particular, the courts have engaged in this balancing process when, as in this case, \u201cthere is an allegation of government misconduct,\u201d or \u201cthe government itself is a party in the underlying litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563-64, 414 A.2d 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u201cWhere the government is a party,\u201d the Court of Appeals added, \u201ca question of unfair litigation advantage may arise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564 n. 8, 414 A.2d 914. \u201c[T]he government may be in a position of asserting or defending a claim while at the same time depriving its opponent of information needed to overcome the government\u2019s position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn these circumstances,\u201d the Court explained, \u201ccourts have weighed the government\u2019s need for confidentiality against its opponent\u2019s need for information.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In summary, if the government asserts executive or deliberative privilege in a case in which the government itself is a party, or in which the government has been accused of wrongdoing, the circuit court should \u201cweight] the need for confidentiality against the litigant\u2019s need for disclosure and the impact of nondisclosure upon the fair administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563, 414 A.2d 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In the hearing that preceded the June 17, 2014, discovery order, however, the circuit court did not expressly balance the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the Board\u2019s deliberations concerning Dr. Young against the Geiers\u2019 need for disclosure of those documents and the impact of nondisclosure upon the fair administration of justice. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the court referred to an earlier hearing, on the Geiers\u2019 first motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>to compel, when it had balanced the public interest in confidentiality against the Geiers\u2019 need for other information, which principally concerned the Board\u2019s rationale for publicly disclosing the Geiers\u2019 confidential medical information.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">In our view, the balancing that the court had done in the past cannot substitute for the balancing that the court was required to do again when the Board asserted a different claim of deliberative privilege as to a different set of documents. Simply put, the court was not relieved of the obligation to conduct the required balancing as to the Board\u2019s deliberations about Dr. Young merely because it had previously balanced the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of other documents against the Geiers\u2019 need for those other documents. Because the court did not conduct the requisite balancing, we shall vacate the discovery order and remand the case to the circuit court so that it can do so, on a document-by-document basis.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">B. Attorney-Client Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The circuit court compelled the Board to produce some putatively privileged communications between the Board\u2019s attorneys and Joshua Shafer, an investigator for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Board. According to the Board\u2019s privilege log, most of the communications concerned the administrative proceedings against the Geiers, but some concern this case. Although we would ordinarily not have appellate jurisdiction to consider an interlocutory appeal from a discovery ruling that rejects a claim of attorney-client privilege <em>(Kurstin v. Bromberg Rosen-thal LLP, </em>420 Md. 466, 480, 24 A.3d 88 (2011)), we shall consider the ruling in this case, because it forms part of a ruling that we have jurisdiction to review. <em>See Stevens, </em>337 Md. at 476, 654 A.2d 877.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Even though Shafer is an agent or employee of the Board,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the Geiers argued that the attorney-client privilege could not apply to his communications with the Board\u2019s attorneys. The Geiers reason that Shaffer was a \u201cstranger\u201d to the attorney-client relationship between the Board and its attorneys. They based that contention on their interpretation of a State policy, the Guidelines for Administrative Adjudicatory Proceedings. Those guidelines prohibit ex parte communications between the Assistant Attorneys General who investigate and prosecute administrative proceedings before the Board and the Assistant Attorneys General who advise the Board and require them to maintain separate files. <em>See </em>http://www.mbp. state.md.us/forms/ag_guidelines.pdf (last viewed Aug. 26, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>On their face, these guidelines do nothing more than establish a firewall to separate an agency\u2019s attorney-advocates from the agency\u2019s attorney-advisors during the course of an administrative prosecution. The guidelines have no effect on the confidentiality of communications between Board employees, such as Shaffer, and the Board\u2019s attorneys. The guidelines certainly have no effect on the confidentiality of communications between Board employees and the attorneys who represent them as parties or witnesses <em>in this case. </em>If the Geiers contend that the Board\u2019s attorneys violated the guidelines, they may have a remedy thereunder. They do not, however, have the remedy of voiding the attorney-client relationship between the Board\u2019s agents or employees and the Board\u2019s attorneys. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 2010 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 6-106(b) of the State Government Article (stating that Attorney General \u201cis the legal adviser of and shall represent and otherwise perform all of the legal work for each officer and unit of the State government\u201d); Md. Const. Art. V, \u00a7 3(a)(2) (\u201cThe Attorney General shall ... Investigate, commence, and prosecute or defend any civil or criminal suit or action or category of such suits or actions in any of the Federal Courts or in any Court of this State, or before administrative agencies and quasi legislative bodies, on the part of the State or in which the State may be interested, which the General Assembly by law or joint resolution, or the Governor, shall have directed or shall direct to be investigated, commenced and prosecuted or defended\u201d).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The circuit court, therefore, erred in rejecting the claim of privilege on the ground that the guidelines made Shafer into a \u201cstranger\u201d to the attorney-client relationship between the Board and its attorneys. On remand, the court should consider whether the Board has met its burden <em>(see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Forma-Pack, Inc., </em>351 Md. 396, 406, 718 A.2d 1129 (1998)) of establishing that the communications in question otherwise satisfy the requirements of the attorney-client privilege. <em>See generally Newman v.

The Geiers\u2019 unsuccessful petitions for judicial review were not decided by the circuit court judge who made the rulings that are at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">. The record does not fully support the Board's claim that it had the right to disclose a patient\u2019s confidential medical information to the public. In an email that the Board disclosed in discovery, one of the Board\u2019s attorneys advised the Board that \"[w]e are clearly violating\u201d one of the Board\u2019s own regulations. In the same email trail, the Board\u2019s chair, Paul Elder, M.D., reacted with astonishment to the news that the Board had publicly disclosed a patient\u2019s confidential medical information on its website. He agreed that the Board should \"cease this activity asap!!!\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b147-8\">. As one basis for its motion to dismiss, the Board asserted that it, its members, its staff, and the administrative prosecutor had absolute quasi-judicial immunity from suit under <em>Ostrzenski v. Seigel, </em>177 F.3d 245 (4th Cir.1999). Because the court regarded the record as inadequate to evaluate the applicability of any immunities at that early stage of the proceedings, it rejected the immunity argument without prejudice to the Board\u2019s right to reassert it on summary judgment. At present, the Maryland appellate cases do not unequivocally resolve the question of whether the Board had the right to an immediate appeal of an interlocutory order rejecting a claim of quasi-judicial immunity. <em>See State v. Keller-Bee, </em>224 Md.App. 1, 3-5, 119 A.3d 80 (2015) (holding that court clerk had right to take immediate appeal of ruling denying motion to dismiss based on absolute judicial immunity). In any event, the Board did not appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\">. The court later learned that, although the designee had been on vacation outside of the State during the week before the deposition, she had returned to Maryland by the date of the deposition. Her \"professional scheduling conflict\u201d was that she had arranged to take off from work on the first day of the deposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b150-9\">. The circuit court eventually denied the protective order, as well as a motion to limit the designee deposition to one, seven-hour day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b151-12\">. The Geiers\u2019 fourth motion for sanctions concerned the Board's counsel's conduct at other depositions. The circuit court has not ruled on that motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b152-5\">. The Board also relies on <em>Baltimore City Dep\u2019t of Social Services v. Stein, </em>328 Md. 1, 612 A.2d 880 (1992). <em>Stein </em>held that a government agency, which was <em>not </em>a party to the case, could take an immediate appeal of an order compelling it to produce confidential information without first disobeying the order and being held in contempt. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21, 612 A.2d 880. In reaching its decision, the <em>Stein </em>Court likened the non-party agency to a government official claiming immunity, who, the Court suggested, could take an immediate appeal of an order rejecting a claim of immunity. <em>See id. </em>at 18-20, 612 A.2d 880. In subsequent decisions, however, the Court of Appeals has dramatically curtailed the ability of government officials to take immediate appeals of interlocutory orders that reject immunity defenses. <em>See, e.g., Daw-kins, </em>376 Md. at 65, 827 A.2d 115 (holding that, \"[a]s a general rule, interlocutory trial court orders rejecting defenses of common law sovereign immunity, governmental immunity, public official immunity, statutory immunity, or any other type of immunity, are not appealable under the Maryland collateral order doctrine\u201d). In the aftermath of <em>Dawkins, Stein </em>is best understood as permitting a <em>non-party </em>to take an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>immediate appeal of an order compelling it to provide discovery. <em>See Cardiac Surgery Assocs., </em>392 Md. at 89-91, 896 A.2d 304. Because the Board <em>is </em>a party, <em>Stein </em>does not advance its cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\">. On the merits, the Court held that, in an action for judicial review of an administrative decision, a party may depose individual administrative decision-makers only where the party \u201cmakes a strong showing to the court of bad faith or impropriety[.]\u201d <em>Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. at 218, 477 A.2d 759. Because Patuxent Valley had not made that showing, the Court held that the circuit court abused its discretion in allowing the depositions to go forward. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\">. On the merits, the <em>Stevens </em>Court held that the circuit court had erred in requiring discovery from the administrative decision-maker. <em>Id. </em>at 486, 654 A.2d 877.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b156-10\">. In <em>Fisher, </em>this Court held that the circuit court had erred in ordering depositions, but had not abused its discretion in requiring in camera review of the minutes. <em>Fisher, </em>123 Md.App. at 328, 329, 718 A.2d 627. In <em>Johnson, </em>which was not an action for judicial review, this Court barred the County Executive\u2019s deposition, because the only relevant information concerned his mental processes while performing discretionary acts. <em>See Johnson, </em>199 Md.App. at 328-30, 21 A.3d 199.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b157-6\">. <em>See, e.g., Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. at 214, 477 A.2d 759 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>313 U.S. 409, 422, 61 S.Ct. 999, 85 L.Ed. 1429 (1941)) (just as a party may not depose a judge about his or her decisional processes, \" 'so the integrity of the administrative process must be equally respected\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\">. <em>Compare Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Mardi-rossian, </em>184 Md.App. 207, 223, 964 A.2d 713 (2009) (holding that court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the deposition of administrative decision-makers because the party \"disavowed any intent to question the Commissioners' mental processes\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\">. In arguing that the collateral order doctrine does not permit an immediate appeal in this case, the Geiers cite <em>County Comm'rs of St. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>Mary\u2019s County v. Lacer, </em>393 Md. 415, 903 A.2d 378 (2006). In that case, the Court of Appeals held that the collateral order doctrine did not allow the county commissioners to take an immediate appeal of an order that allowed a former employee to inquire into their discussions, in executive session, when they discussed the termination of his contract. The <em>Lacer </em>Court distinguished <em>Patuxent Valley </em>and <em>Stevens </em>because the order \"permitt[ed] only an objective investigation into the facial statements and actions of the Board during the closed session meeting\u201d and did not pertain to \"the thought processes of the decision-makers.\u201d <em>Lacer, </em>393 Md. at 430, 903 A.2d 378. <em>Lacer </em>differs from this case, because the circuit court's discovery order unquestionably permits the Geiers to inquire into \"the thought processes of the decision-makers.\u201d In fact, the whole purpose of the Geiers' discovery requests is to inquire into the Board's thought processes and motivations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\">. <em>Snowden </em>concerned the scope of former Rule 887, which was substantially identical to Rule 8-131(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b164-5\">. Aside from <em>Stevens, </em>the Board cites <em>In re Guardianship of Zealand </em>W., 220 Md.App. 66, 102 A.3d 837 (2014); <em>Tschechtelin v. Samuels, </em>124 Md.App. 389, 722 A.2d 414, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>353 Md. 508, 727 A.2d 929 (1999); and <em>Bradley v. Fisher, </em>113 Md.App. 603, 688 A.2d 527 (1997). In <em>Zealand W., </em>the court, while addressing an interlocutory appeal that was permitted by statute, discussed other issues \"(1) to decide issues that were the appropriate subject of an interlocutory appeal; and (2) for the guidance of the circuit court upon remand.\u201d <em>Zealand W., </em>220 Md.App. at 79, 102 A.3d 837. In <em>Bradley, </em>an interlocutory appeal under the collateral order doctrine, this Court declined to consider any rulings other than the collateral order itself. <em>Bradley, </em>113 Md.App. at 605-06, 688 A.2d 527. In <em>Tschechtelin, </em>another interlocutory appeal under the collateral order doctrine, this Court followed <em>Bradley </em>and again declined to consider any rulings other than the collateral order itself. <em>Tschechtelin, </em>124 Md.App. at 400, 722 A.2d 414. Notably, both <em>Bradley </em>and <em>Tschechtelin </em>involved appeals from the denial of dispositive motions on grounds of sovereign immunity. Under a subsequent Court of Appeals decision, however, those rulings are no longer immediately appealable. <em>Dawkins, </em>376 Md. at 65, 827 A.2d 115.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\">. Appellate courts ordinarily review discovery decisions for abuse of discretion, but the applicability of a privilege is a question of law. <em>See, e.g., 100 Harborview Drive Council of Unit Owners v. Clark, </em>224 Md.App. 13, 36, 119 A.3d 87 (2015) (applying <em>de novo </em>standard of appellate review to trial court's legal determinations regarding privilege and interpretation of statute regarding discovery). Consequently, we conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the circuit court\u2019s decisions regarding privilege.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b166-11\">. For a discussion of the meaning of the \u201cproceedings, records, or files\u201d under the related statutory privilege for medical review committees, <em>see Cardiac Surgery Assocs., </em>392 Md. at 91-103, 896 A.2d 304.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">. Citing <em>Hamilton v. Verdow, </em>287 Md. at 566, 414 A.2d 914, the Geiers assert that the Board did not properly present its claim of executive or deliberative privilege, because it failed to submit an affidavit. We disagree. While the State employed an affidavit (from the Governor) to present its claim of privilege in <em>Hamilton, </em>the Court of Appeals required only a \"formal claim\" of privilege <em>(id. </em>at 563, 414 A.2d 914), not a claim of privilege supported by an affidavit. In the circumstances of this case, the Board satisfied that requirement, because it gave the court adequate information about the identity of the putatively privileged documents and the basis for the asserted privilege.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\">. As part of the balancing process on remand, the circuit court should assess the Board\u2019s immunity claims, because the Geiers can establish no \"need for disclosure\u201d <em>(Hamilton v. Verdow, </em>287 Md. at 563, 414 A.2d 914), and nondisclosure cannot affect the \"fair administration of justice\u201d <em>(id.), </em>if an immunity insulates the defendants from liability or from suit. The Fourth Circuit has held that a peer reviewer engaged by the Board has absolute quasi-judicial immunity from federal claims. <em>Os-trzenski v. Seigel, </em>177 F.3d 245, 253 (4th Cir.1999). In addition, although no Maryland court has yet to squarely decide the issue, the Board argues that it, its members, and staff have absolute quasi-judicial immunity from state-law claims under the Fourth Circuit's <em>Ostrzenski </em>decision and under <em>Parker v. State, </em>337 Md. 271, 653 A.2d 436 (1995), which concerns judicial (rather than quasi-judicial) immunity. The Board also argues that the administrative prosecutor has absolute quasi-prosecutorial immunity under <em>Gill v. Ripley, </em>352 Md. 754, 724 A.2d 88 (1999), which concerns the immunity of criminal prosecutors. We express no opinion on the applicability of these immunities, or on the interrelationship between them and the qualified, statutory immunity under [\u00b6] \u00a7 14-412, as none of those issues are properly before us at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b175-5\">. In addition to arguing that the circuit court compelled the production of attorney-privileged communications, the Board argues that the court compelled the production of (unspecified) materials that are protected by the work-product doctrine. The Board's brief, however, contains no argument concerning work-product. Consequently, we do not consider that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\">. <em>See </em>[\u00b6] \u00a7 14-204(e)(2) (requiring Secretary of Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to assign sufficient number of investigators to Board). The Geiers suggest that because the Secretary \"assigns\u201d the investigators to the Board, the investigators cannot partake of the Board\u2019s attorney-client privilege. Their argument is untenable: because the investigators are \"assigned\u201d to the Board, they act for and on behalf of the Board. There is no reason why the attorney-client privilege would not apply to an investigator's communications with the Board's attorney, provided that the other requirements of the privilege are met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b176-6\">. The Board appeared to assume that the circuit court\u2019s ruling applied not only to communications with Shaffer, but to communications with Christine Farrelly, the Board\u2019s Executive Director. The Geiers do not appear to share that assumption. If the ruling did, however, apply to Farrelly as well as Shaffer, it is erroneous as to Farrelly for the same reasons that it is erroneous as to Shaffer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">. In the circuit court, the Geiers argued that the Board had waived the attorney-client privilege because Dr. Elder, a Board member, testified at his deposition that he had received legal advice, but did not recall the advice that he had received. The Geiers appear to have abandoned that argument on appeal. Insofar as it has not been abandoned, the argument has no merit: a party does not waive the attorney-client privilege merely by affirming that he or she has received legal advice. A party waives the privilege only by disclosing the confidential legal advice. <em>Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 151, 345 A.2d 830.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\">. The parties debate whether the June 17, 2014, order compels the Board to produce the audio recordings of its deliberations in the Geiers\u2019 disciplinary cases, or whether an earlier discovery order compelled the production those documents. We leave that issue to the circuit court on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b178-5\">FRIEDMAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AN\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">I join fully in the majority opinion. I write separately to make one additional point.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In Section II.A.2 of the Court\u2019s opinion, we find that the circuit court erred by not evaluating the Board of Physicians\u2019 claim of deliberative process privilege by weighing the Board\u2019s, and through it the public\u2019s, need for the confidentiality of its internal processes as expressed in documents against the Geiers\u2019 need to obtain these documents for use in this lawsuit. Maj. Op. at 147-52, 123 A.3d at 620-24. In note 23, we give the circuit court some guidance about how to conduct this weighing on remand, directing it to \u201cassess the Board\u2019s immunity claims, because the Geiers can establish no \u2018need for disclosure,\u2019 and nondisclosure cannot affect the \u2018fair administration of justice,\u2019 if an immunity insulates the defendants from liability or from suit.\u201d Maj. Op. at 152 n. 22, 123 A.3d at 624 n. 22 (internal citations omitted). I wholeheartedly agree but would go one step further.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">I would also direct that the circuit court consider whether every document sought by the Geiers and whose production is sought to be prevented by the Board through a claim of deliberative process privilege, is germane to the appropriate scope of discovery. The Geiers can have no need (and thus they can offer no counterweight to the Board\u2019s, and through it, the public\u2019s right to confidentiality) for documents that are not relevant, or that are no longer relevant, to their lawsuit. While my brethren prefer to leave that discussion for another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>day, in the circumstances and given the parties\u2019 conduct of discovery so far, I would reach it today.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">It is my view that the only documents relevant to this lawsuit are those that are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence related to: (1) the Board\u2019s decision to issue the cease and desist order on January 25, 2012; (2) the decision to reveal the Geiers\u2019 confidential medical information in that cease and desist order; and (3) the duration of time that the cease and desist order was publicly available. The Geiers are entitled to any non-privileged documents related to those three topics and if they find evidence of malice in them they are entitled to present that evidence to a jury. But that\u2019s it.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The Geiers have sought (and the circuit court thus far permitted) discovery into the Board\u2019s conduct of the disciplinary proceedings against the Geiers, because they claimed that they were searching for evidence of the Board\u2019s alleged malice toward them. Maj. Op. at 124-26, 123 A.3d at 607-08. For even more attenuated reasons, the Geiers have sought documents related to Dr. Young. Maj. Op. at 126, 123 A.3d at 608. In light of the circuit court and this Court\u2019s decisions affirming the Board\u2019s decisions in those disciplinary proceedings, I would hold today that the Board\u2019s conduct of those disciplinary proceedings was non-malicious as a matter of law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> irrelevant to the proper scope of the Geiers\u2019 present claims, and that, therefore, in the circuit court\u2019s weighing required by the assertion of the deliberative process privilege, the Geiers\u2019 desire for these documents can offer no counterweight to the Board\u2019s need for confidentiality.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">. It seems incontrovertible to me that a finding by a reviewing court that physician disciplinary proceedings are warranted (and all the more so when the imposition of discipline is confirmed on appeal) precludes, as a matter of law, that the disciplinary proceedings could have been conducted with malice, in much the same way that a conviction or a judgment is a bar to claims for malicious prosecution and malicious use of process. <em>Havilah Real Property v. Early, </em>216 Md.App. 613, 624-25, 88 A.3d 875 (2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
