His adoptive parents are now deceased. Appellant has long been interested in learning whatever information he can about his birth parents, and has been able to access redacted portions of his adoption case file. The process has stalled, however. This appeal addresses the denial of appellant\u2019s request to access any of the information about his birth father that was redacted from the original adoption case file. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County denied appellant\u2019s motion, and stated that \u201c[t]here is no further information for the Court to release to the [appellant] as there is no non-identifying information to which the [appellant] is entitled pursuant to Family Law Article \u00a7\u00a7 5-3A-40 and 41.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Appellant contends on appeal that the circuit court\u2019s denial of his motion was both an error of law and an abuse of discretion because, he argues, the information he seeks\u2014 which was used by an intermediary and a professional investigator in a fruitless but \u201cexhaustive\u201d attempt to locate his birth father\u2014is necessarily non-identifying information, and, under FL \u00a7 5-3A-40, he is entitled to all non-identifying information without a showing of need. No other party has filed a brief in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Appellant presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">1. Whether the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s unopposed motion requesting additional information about his birth father was erroneous as a matter of law because it incorrectly interpreted the category of \u201cidentifying information\u201d defined at Annotated Code of Maryland, Family Law Article, \u00a7 5-3A-01(d) to include information that revealed neither his birth father\u2019s identity nor location?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">2. Whether the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s unopposed motion requesting additional information about his birth father was an abuse of discretion in failing to recognize that the special and compelling reasons presented by appellant\u2019s motion outweigh the interests of the birth parents and to issue written findings as to the interests sought to be protected by the order?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">For the reasons that follow, we will remand this case, without affirmance or reversal, to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Appellant was born at the Florence Crittenton Maternity Home in Washington, D.C., on May 1, 1958. His natural mother was an unmarried 33-year-old secretary who had concealed her pregnancy from her parents, quit her job \"with the federal government, and entered a maternity home sometime after Christmas in 1957. According to the 1958 Report of Adoption Investigation, appellant\u2019s mother was \u201canxious that no hint of the pregnancy become known to [her] parents, who are very substantial, conservative people, as she knew they would be very hurt.\u201d For the first thirteen days after appellant\u2019s birth, he was cared for in the maternity home by his birth mother. He was then placed in the care of an adoption agency on May 14, 1958. The agency\u2019s (heavily redacted) records indicate that appellant was placed with his adoptive family on June 11, 1958, and that his adoption was finalized on December 22,1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The record of the circuit court proceedings in this case reveals that, in 2002, appellant contacted the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services \u201cto learn about his adoption and birth history.\u201d Helen Clark, an adoption social worker with the Department, acted as an intermediary, and reviewed appellant\u2019s sealed adoption records. Ms. Clark wrote appellant a letter on May 23, 2002, summarizing the non-identifying information she had learned about the circumstances of his birth and adoption. Ms. Clark\u2019s letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">Your birth mother was described as being healthy, exceptionally tall and slender. She was thirty-three years of age when she gave birth to you. At that time, she had no other children. She was one of two children, with a younger brother who was aware of her pregnancy. Your birth mother was very dependent upon her parents and she found it difficult to break away from home because she believed her mother would be depressed at the prospect of both of her children being away from her. They were unaware of her pregnancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Your birth mother completed two years of college and worked as a secretary. The record indicated that your birth parents knew each other very briefly and that your birth father was your birth mother\u2019s first sexual experience. After your birth, your birth mother gave you personal care during the thirteen days you were together in a maternity home. She was pleased to know something of your adoptive parents and expressed satisfaction with the adoption plan. The record also indicated that whenever your birth mother returned to her family she wrote two or three letters and sent a card while on a trip. However, it is unclear from the record as to whom the letters and card were addressed or sent. The items were not in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">There is very little information in your record regarding your birth father. Nothing was known regarding his health. He was a college graduate and employed as an architectural engineer. His age was not provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">At birth, you weighed six pounds, fourteen ounces and were nineteen inches long. You were born at 1:41 p.m. Forceps were used, causing a right occipital hematoma that completely disappeared within a few weeks. No birth father is listed on your original birth certificate. You were placed into foster care on May 14, 1958, and placed with your adopt[ive] family on June 11,1958.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">I hope this information is helpful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">On July 20, 2009, appellant filed a Verified Motion to Unseal Adoption Records and Petition for Inspection of Non-Identifying Information and Appointment of an Intermediary, along with a request for hearing. Appellant represented that he was seeking \u201caccess to his adoption records to the greatest extent permitted by law\u201d and \u201cthe opportunity to inspect his sealed adoption records <em>firsthand, </em>to the greatest extent possible in view of the confidentiality laws protecting the privacy wishes and identifying information of his birth mother.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) In the motion, appellant cited FL \u00a7 5-3A-40(a)(2) in support of his argument that, as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>adoptee, he was entitled to the release of non-identifying information from his adoption case file without a showing of need. In addition, appellant asserted that he had a variety of \u201cspecial and compelling reasons\u201d that entitled him to access to \u201cas much information as is possible under Md. R. 16\u20141009[.]\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant pointed to the fact that his then-11-year-old son was of abnormally short stature, and family health information \u201cwould allow [appellant] and his wife to make an informed decision regarding treatment for their son\u2019s abnormal growth rate and consider the usefulness of endocrine treatment,\u201d which was of a time-sensitive nature. Appellant\u2019s motion was denied without a hearing, as was his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Appellant appealed to this Court, but, before this Court could consider the merits of that appeal, the parties filed a consent motion to remand, which we granted via order of December 2, 2010. <em>See Scott W.V.[] v. Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services, </em>No. 0034, September Term, 2010, order entered December 2, 2010. We ordered the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to enter orders</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">directing the custodian of the appellant\u2019s adoption case record to permit the appellant to personally inspect and copy the index of the adoption case record, if there is an index that is kept apart from the docket itself, and provided that all identifying information is redacted from the index prior to inspection; and ... [to] permit the appellant, pursuant to Md.Code Ann., Family Law \u00a7 5-3A-40(a)(2)(b), to personally inspect and copy the non-identifying information contained in the record, provided that all identifying information is redacted prior to inspection; and ... [to] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>schedule a full adversary hearing on the appellant\u2019s motion under Md. R. 16-1009 concerning access to the parts of the case record not otherwise subject to inspection; and ... [to] schedule] a hearing on appellant\u2019s request for the appointment of an intermediary to contact his birth father to obtain urgently needed medical information, pursuant to Family Law \u00a7 5-3A-41.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Upon remand, a guardian <em>ad litem </em>was appointed for the birth mother, and a confidential intermediary was appointed to attempt to contact appellant\u2019s birth mother. In the order appointing the confidential intermediary, the court directed the intermediary to attempt to ask the birth mother certain questions embodied in a three-page attachment to the order. On September 27, 2011, the intermediary was able to converse with appellant\u2019s birth mother via telephone. According to the intermediary\u2019s confidential memorandum of that phone call, the birth mother was \u201ccooperative,\u201d but also \u201cvery firm and adamant that she will not respond to the list of questions that was attached to the order.\u201d The birth mother also told the intermediary that she \u201cdid not recall the height of the birth father, and only knew his first name.\u201d It was the opinion of the intermediary that, based on the \u201cvery limited information from the birth mother, as well as information from the court\u2019s adoption record,\u201d the intermediary \u201cdid not, and does not currently, have sufficient information to identify, locate and contact the birth father, or determine if he is deceased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">On April 12, 2012, the court entered an order appointing a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the birth father, specifying that \u201cthe overriding interest\u201d of the guardian \u201cshall be to protect [the birth father\u2019s] privacy rightsf.]\u201d The order gave the birth father\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>access to appellant\u2019s unredacted adoption case file. It also recognized that the parties had recently discovered the name of the private adoption agency that handled (or was the successor to the entity that in 1958 had handled) appellant\u2019s adoption, and the order directed that agency, upon appellant\u2019s request, to redact its records pertaining to appellant\u2019s adoption and to provide the redacted records to the guardians <em>ad litem. </em>The order further directed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>guardians <em>ad litem </em>to review the redacted records and notify the court whether they approved the release of the redacted records to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-3A-41, the April 12, 2012, order also appointed an intermediary, Bethany Stahl, who was a licensed graduate social worker, \u201cto perform a diligent search to identify, locate and try to contact the birth father to obtain urgently needed medical information ... that would be likely to assist [appellant\u2019s] family in making an informed decision about treatment\u201d of their son\u2019s growth issues. The intermediary was granted full access to the unredacted adoption case record. The order provided that, \u201c[a]t [appellant\u2019s] expense, and at the intermediary\u2019s discretion, the intermediary may engage a private investigator or other search and trace services to assist in locating the birth father using the identifying information contained in the court and agency records, taking care that no identifying information is released to the [appellant][.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The April 12 order also included the following provision which contemplated the release of additional information to appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">[It is further ordered] that, if the identity and location of the birth father is still unknown to the intermediary to the birth father after an exhaustive search is made by her or at her direction, the Court shall consider the release to [appellant] of additional information about the birth father from the Court\u2019s sealed adoption case record and the private adoption agency\u2019s record (subject to the review and recommendations of the Guardian Ad Litem appointed to represent each birth parent) on the basis that this information would be by definition non-identifying information to which [appellant] is entitled under law[.] (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">As ordered, the court-appointed intermediary commenced a search for appellant\u2019s birth father, and enlisted the help of a private investigator. On October 10, 2013, the intermediary filed a summary of her investigation, along with a summary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the efforts made by the private investigator. In her summary, the intermediary mentioned having shared the original adoption record with the private investigator, \u201c[although there was less information in the file than we believed there would be[.]\u201d Despite the paucity of information, the intermediary and the investigator spent over a year attempting to identify appellant\u2019s birth father, but, in the end, their efforts were unsuccessful. The intermediary stated: \u201cI have been unable to reach out to the birth father, because we were unable to identify him based on the little information we had been provided.\u201d The intermediary\u2019s summary concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">Mr. Pennacchia [the private investigator] also attempted to search for professional or educational societies that the alleged birth father could have belonged to, and also for women who may have been in the same maternity home as the birth mother, and thus may have known her. After those attempts were inconclusive, Mr. Pennacchia and I concluded that there is not enough information in the file we received from the original agency to identify the actual birth father. <em>The information about the birth father is sparse, and Mr. Pennacchia and I are doubtful as to the veracity of the little information that is provided. </em>For instance, no one at the agency ever met the alleged birth father, so they relied solely on self-report from the birth mother for information about him. [ONE SENTENCE REDACTED] As a licensed social worker working in the field of adoption, my clinical judgment causes me to be skeptical of this scenario. I have worked with a number of women who have given false information about birth fathers at the time of placement. At times, they have done this to protect themselves or the birth fathers; and at other times because it is easier than telling a difficult truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The private investigator, Mr. Pennacchia, was able to use the bits and pieces of information in the original adoption record to locate and contact the birth mother\u2019s brother, but the trail to appellant\u2019s birth father went cold, and the mother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>brother adamantly refused to provide any further information. Mr. Pennacchia summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">I read and re-read the information contained in the original documents from the Adoption Agency. I found much of it to be imaginary, embellished, and unreliable. [ONE SENTENCE REDACTED] She knew that the man was Protestant, the University he graduated from, the city he worked in. I tend to believe in what has not been written. The Mexico trip with the girlfriend, most likely an alibi to protect someone else. If the birth mother undertook the trip with a male colleague from her DC job, would this not throw us off track? With this in mind, I pointed my attention to the birth mother\u2019s brother. According to the original reports, he was the person closest and most dedicated to her during the rough times. [TWO SENTENCES REDACTED] I wrote him a letter date[d] Aug. 30, 2012, via FedEx overnight (copy attached).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">I waited approximately ten days, received no reply[.] I telephoned Mr. [REDACTED]. I mentioned the letter, he acknowledged receiving it. I was surprised and stunned by his hostility and anger. He requested that I never contact him again, that he thought this person (his nephew <em>[ie., </em>appellant]) was \u201cbarking up the wrong tree\u201d, that so much time had gone by, that we must leave he and his sister in peace and [he] terminated the contact. I concluded that the information we seek may remain with the mother and uncle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">After a hearing on January 13, 2014, the guardians <em>ad litem, </em>reviewed the summary reports of the intermediary and the investigator referenced above, and agreed on redactions that needed to be made to those documents to remove identifying information. The circuit court reviewed the reports and made additional redactions. On January 28, 2014, the parties reconvened for a brief hearing, after which the redacted documents were released to appellant\u2019s counsel. The following colloquy, which is relevant to the issues presented in the instant appeal, occurred after the court ruled that appellant was entitled to the redacted reports of the intermediary and the investigator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>[BY THE COURT]: I\u2019m not entirely sure that there is anything else for the Court to do from here, that is to say that perhaps the Court\u2019s role in this process is completed at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">[BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor? First of all, just to clarify, my assumption is that the intermediary was not able to identify, locate, and contact the birth father?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAY\">A [BY THE COURT], That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">Q [BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL], Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">A [BY THE COURT]. The letter will tell you that, but that is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">Q [BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]. Okay. And I\u2019m pleasantly surprised to hear that the investigator made an effort to contact I guess the mother\u2019s brother, which I think we have some\u2014that\u2019s not new to me that there was a brother out there. I don\u2019t know who he is, but I heard that at some point. So that\u2019s encouraging at least that he took certain steps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">A [BY THE COURT]. Right. And I mean, the documents will tell you that those efforts were complete, let\u2019s just say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">Q [BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL], When you say complete, have you determined\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">A [BY THE COURT], You\u2019ll be able to tell from the letter that the investigator reached the brother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-11\">Q [BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]. Okay. Okay. And, Your Honor, have you decided if you consider the search to have been exhaustive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-12\">A [BY THE COURT], Yes, I have. I do believe it is. I believe that\u2019s what you\u2019ll also get from the letter that the investigator and the intermediary, each of their letters I guess is what I mean\u2014will be, I think it\u2019s clear\u2014that they both believe they\u2019ve gone as far as one can expect to go under these circumstances. I mean, one of the things that\u2019s true here is that [appellant] is roughly my age. So these people are elderly. So other people who might be in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>picture would also be elderly, well over 80 years old. And so they may not be alive is my point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">\u25a0Q [BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]. I guess\u2014we wanted to know if\u2014it sounds like the answer is yes\u2014but just to clarify here that the search was exhaustive, because all sorts of reasonable leads were followed, as opposed to if the search had been done differently or better or something like that\u2014you feel like an exhaustive search has been made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">A [BY THE COURT]. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">Q [BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL], Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">A [BY THE COURT], And largely for the reason I just articulated, that it\u2019s hard to follow this kind of a trail at this point, 50 years hence, with people who are\u2014well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything that\u2019s not in the letter\u2014unwilling to cooperate further. So there\u2019s no way to get more information from them. And I, frankly, think that the kind of commitment that we make in these cases about anonymity in these kinds of adoptions has also to be balanced here. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to go further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">Q [BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL], Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">A [BY THE COURT]. Any way that would be in the\u2014 let\u2019s say would be compliant with what the statute says about where this trail has to end once we\u2019ve done everything that we can. And I believe everything that can be done has been done. [\u00b6]... ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">\u2014I will say I think the trail has been exhausted. And there\u2019s nothing that I can see the Court doing further here. [\u00b6]... ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">I\u2019m trying to help you understand that, while I recognize that this result may be a disappointment in some ways, because the answer didn\u2019t get reached, <em>I see no other </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>avenue to take and no other information in any part of the court file that would assist.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Three months later, on April 29, 2014, appellant filed a Motion to Release Limited Additional Information, the denial of which led to this appeal. In that motion, appellant cited the provision of the April 12, 2012, order that referred to considering the release of additional information, and appellant argued that, because a diligent and exhaustive search for appellant\u2019s birth father undertaken by professionals using the unredacted adoption record proved fruitless, then, by definition, the information in the unredacted record about the birth father was \u201cnon-identifying,\u201d and therefore, appellant was entitled to see it. In his motion, appellant specifically requested a \u201cfresh review\u201d of certain redactions which, he asserted, appear to pertain only to his birth father. These redactions related to the birth father\u2019s first name, the university he attended, the name of his employer, race or color, and any background history that might have been provided in the adoption agency\u2019s 1958 investigation leading up to appellant\u2019s adoption. The specific information that had been previously redacted and withheld from appellant, which he now asked the court to release pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-3A-40 as \u201cnon-identifying\u201d in light of the fact that a professional investigator with access to that information was unable to identify the birth father, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">Given the search history, revelation to the petitioner of the following few redactions pertaining only to his birth father should neither impinge on either of his birth parents\u2019 privacy interest nor lead to their identity or location:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">a. In the Court\u2019s own records:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">i. On page 7 of the Report of Adoption Investigation dated December 12, 1958, the entry concealed by the black marker redaction of the response to the prompt calling for the first name of \u201cChild\u2019s father.\u201d A copy of the page is attached as Exhibit A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>2. On page 8 of the same Report of Adoption Investigation, which is a continuation of the section begun on the prior page titled \u201cCircumstances in child\u2019s own family that have bearing on his being available for adoption,\u201d specifically in the third full paragraph on page 8, the redactions concealing what appears to petitioner\u2019s birth father\u2019s school and California employer. A copy of page 8 is attached as Exhibit B. In light of the previously mentioned idea that there may be a correlation between petitioner\u2019s chosen profession and that of his birth father, any information about where his birth father was educated or worked might help to corroborate this interesting familial similarity,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF6\">b. In the agency records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">i. In the Report of Adoption Investigation dated August 1, 1958, on page 7, the black marker redactions covering the name, birthdate and birthplace section concerning \u201cChild\u2019s Father\u201d, as well as the sections, going on to the following pages 8 and the very top blacked out line of page 9, titled \u201cCircumstances in child\u2019s own family that have bearing on his being available for adoption\u201d and \u201cPhysical history of child\u2019s own family.\u201d A copy of the pages are attached as Exhibit C. Petitioner is in no position to gauge whether there is any material in the original, unredacted version of those sections that might pertain to his birth father, but if there is, petitioner asks the Court here to consider this also as a request for the disclosure of such information to the extent it falls within the type of material requested by this motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">ii. On the next page of the agency records, the Certification of Adoption for Maryland State Department of Health shows a blank entry for the prompt on the form calling for \u201cFather\u2019s name\u201d or \u201cRace or color.\u201d It is unclear if this was redacted or by whom, but if it was, petitioner asks the Court to consider a request for a second review of that line as well. A copy is at Exhibit D.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>iii.

Samu-els, <em>The Idea of Adoption: An Inquiry into the History of Adult Adoptee </em>Access <em>to Birth Records, </em>53 Rutgeks L.Rev. 367, 368 (2001) (footnotes omitted). \u201cIn the mid~1920s, there were virtually no confidentiality or secrecy provisions in adoption law.... By the mid-1930s to the early 1940s, there were more state provisions for confidentiality with respect to the general public\u2019s access to court records, but still few provisions for secrecy among the participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374. However, \u201c[wjith respect to court records rather than birth records, contemporary evidence indicates that by the late 1940s and early 1950s a significant, if not a dramatic, shift had occurred: court records by that time were apparently closed in many states to all persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">By 1939, Maryland \u201chad foreclosed adult adoptee access to original records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377 n. 57. As Professor Samuels noted in the referenced article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">When one searches the historical record from the 1930s through the 1960s to understand how and why the adoption process became cloaked in secrecy\u2014specifically why court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>records in most states came to be closed to all, and birth records in many states came to be closed even to adult adoptees\u2014one finds through the 1950s a chorus of influential, authoritative voices supporting the complete closure of <em>court records </em>while recommending that <em>original birth records </em>remain available to adult adoptees. More generally, throughout the entire period, one finds that the reasons proffered for confidentiality and secrecy focus solely on protecting adoptees from embarrassing disclosure of the circumstances of their births and on protecting adoptive parents and their adoptive children from being interfered with or harassed by birth parents, as it was believed they might be if birth parents and adoptive parents who were unknown to one another were to learn one another\u2019s identity. Among the legal, social service, and other social science commentators, there appears to be no or virtually no discussion of a need to protect birth parents from adult adoptees seeking and acquiring information about their birth families.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH8\"><em>Id. </em>at 385 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The author of a 2005 note similarly surveyed the history of the closure of adoption records and placed Maryland among the twenty states, plus the District of Columbia, which \u201callow[ed] adoptees to gain access to their adoption records by court order only, subject to a showing of good cause,\u201d citing the then-applicable FL \u00a7 5-329.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Caroline B. Fleming, Note, <em>The Open-Records Debate: Balancing the Interests of Birth Parents and Adult Adoptees, </em>11 Wm. <em>&amp; </em>Mary J. Women <em>&amp; </em>L. 461, 472 (2005) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The statute under which appellant sought relief in this case is FL \u00a7 5-3A-40, which was introduced during the 2005 legislative session as Senate Bill 710 (\u201cSB 710\u201d). SB 710 was entitled the \u201cPermanency for Families and Children Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>2005,\u201d and it effected a number of changes in various Maryland statutes. For instance, FL \u00a7 5-329 was repealed, and some of its provisions were transplanted elsewhere, including FL \u00a7 5-3A-40. The preamble to SB 710 provided, as relevant to FL \u00a7 5-3A-40, that it was meant to \u201cdelineat[e] procedures for private agency guardianship and adoption\u201d and \u201crestat[e] provisions relating to records[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Despite the 2005 changes in the statutes, one aspect that remained constant was the prohibition against a court releasing information identifying an adoptee\u2019s birth parents. <em>Cf </em>(former) FL \u00a7 5-329(b) (\u201cThe court may not order opened for inspection any part of a record that contains any information that reveals the location or identity of the individual\u2019s birth parents.\u201d) <em>with </em>(current) FL \u00a7 5-3A-40(b) (\u201cA court may not order opened for inspection under this section any part of a record that contains identifying information.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Appellant contends that the circuit court necessarily erred in denying his motion because the court misinterpreted the statutory definition of \u201cidentifying information.\u201d He argues that, if the court-appointed intermediary, and the professional investigator she hired, were unable to successfully use the information that has been redacted and withheld from appellant to identify or locate appellant\u2019s birth father, then, logic compels the conclusion that the redacted information appellant seeks\u2014which did not \u201creveal[ ] the identity or location of an individual\u201d\u2014is not \u201cidentifying information\u201d within the purview of the statute, and should now be made available to him as contemplated by the circuit court\u2019s order of April 12, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Key principles governing statutory construction were summarized as follows by the Court of Appeals in <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 274-77, 987 A.2d 18 (2010) (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature. A court\u2019s primary goal in interpreting statutory language is to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by the statutory provision under scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\">To ascertain the intent of the General Assembly, we begin with the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute. If the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction. We neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, and we do not construe a statute with \u201cforced or subtle interpretations\u201d that limit or extend its application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">We, however, do not read statutory language in a vacuum, nor do we <em>confine </em>strictly our interpretation of a statute\u2019s plain language to the isolated section alone. Rather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute. We presume that the Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, and, thus, we seek to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute, to the extent possible consistent with the statute\u2019s object and scope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">Where the words of a statute are ambiguous and subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, or where the words are clear and unambiguous when viewed in isolation, but become ambiguous when read as part of a larger statutory scheme, a court must resolve the ambiguity by searching for legislative intent in other indicia, including the history of the legislation or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the legislative process. In resolving ambiguities, a court considers the structure of the statute, how it relates to other laws, its general purpose, and the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>In every case, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical, or incompatible with common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Here, appellant contends that the statutory phrase \u201cidentifying information\u201d should be interpreted to mean <em>information that directly identifies </em>the birth parent rather than <em>information that may lead to the discovery of the identity </em>of the birth parent. Appellant emphasizes that the General Assembly defined \u201cidentifying information\u201d to mean \u201cinformation that reveals the identity or location of an individual.\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201creveals\u201d rather than \u201cleads to,\u201d or even \u201ccould reveal,\u201d is significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">But we are not persuaded that the phrase should be interpreted as narrowly as appellant urges. The General Assembly did not say \u201cdirectly reveals\u201d or \u201cimmediately reveals\u201d or \u201cindependently reveals.\u201d And we are not persuaded that it was the intent of the legislature to restrict the definition of identifying information in that manner. It seems to us that there could be many items of information that do not, when considered in isolation, reveal the identity of an individual, but could nevertheless provide key identifying information to a party seeking to identify a parent. We are not persuaded that the General Assembly intended that every bit of information must be released unless the identity of the person is immediately apparent from that particular item of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">We have considered whether we might find guidance from the statute\u2019s enumeration of the policies and purposes supporting the enactment of Family Law Title 5, Subtitle 3A. When the General Assembly passed Subtitle 3A to Title 5 of the Family Law Article, it explained, at \u00a7 5-3A-03, its \u201cpurpose, aim, or policy in enacting\u201d this particular statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">(a) The General Assembly finds that the policies and procedures of this subtitle are desirable and socially necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">(b) The purposes of this subtitle are to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">(1) timely provide permanent and safe homes for children consistent with their best interests;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>(2) protect children from unnecessary separation from their parents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">(3) ensure adoption only by individuals fit for the responsibility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">(4) protect parents from making hurried or ill-considered agreements to terminate parental rights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">(5) protect prospective adoptive parents by providing them information about prospective adoptees and their backgrounds; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">(6) protect adoptive parents from a future disturbance of their relationship with adoptees by former parents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Although this statement of policy and purpose makes no mention of protecting the identities of birth parents, it provides little guidance about protecting the identity of any person. And the statutory definition of protected \u201cidentifying information\u201d is applicable to any \u201cindividual\u201d in this subtitle, not just birth parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">We note that the General Assembly has adopted a broad definition of the term \u201cidentifying information\u201d in connection with the statutory crime of identity fraud. Maryland Code (2002, 2012 RepLVol., 2014 Supp.), Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 8-301(a)(6) provides the following definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">(6) (i) \u201cPersonal identifying information\u201d includes a name, address, telephone number, driver\u2019s license number, Social Security number, place of employment, employee identification number, health insurance identification number, medical identification number, mother\u2019s maiden name, bank or other financial institution account number, date of birth, personal identification number, unique biometric data, including fingerprint, voice print, retina or iris image or other unique physical representation, digital signature, credit card number, or other payment device number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">(ii) \u201cPersonal identifying information\u201d may be derived from any element in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, alone or in conjunction with any other information to identify a specific natural or fictitious individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Although this statutory definition was adopted specifically to address identity fraud, it illustrates that information that does not independently reveal a person\u2019s identity can nevertheless be considered personal identifying information.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Consequently, we conclude that a broader definition of the identifying information protected from disclosure under FL \u00a7 5-3A-01(d) is more likely the legislative intent, and that \u201creveals\u201d should be construed to mean \u201ccould reasonably lead to the discovery of\u2019 the identity of the protected individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Assuming that to be the proper definition of identifying information, we are nevertheless unable to effectively review whether the circuit court applied that definition when it considered appellant\u2019s motion. The court provided no explanation of why the court concluded that any of the specific bits of redacted information requested by appellant were deemed to be \u201cidentifying information\u201d even though the aggregate of such redacted information did not enable the investigator and intermediary to identify the birth father. The court\u2019s denial noted simply that \u201c[t]here is no further information for the Court to release to [appellant] as there is no non-identifying information to which [appellant] is entitled pursuant to Family Law Article \u00a7\u00a7 5-3A-40 and 41.\u201d Appellant\u2019s motion had requested \u201ca fresh review\u201d of specific redactions in the records, which were redactions appellant believed \u201cpertained only to his birth father.\u201d The circuit court\u2019s blanket denial gives us no clue whether appellant\u2019s belief was right or wrong, and even if he was right, why the court deemed each redaction to be information \u201cthat reveals the identity or location of an individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Appellant asked only for the information that had been redacted from the record as it pertained to his birth father. It may well be that there is no such information. It may be that the redacted information is somehow identifying information relative to someone else. But we cannot determine, on the basis of this record, whether and to what extent the trial court conducted an item by item analysis of the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>In <em>Sumpter v. Sumpter, </em>427 Md. 668, 50 A.8d 1098 (2012), a mother contended that she was prejudiced at her custody trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City because that court apparently had an unwritten policy or rule sharply restricting access to reports prepared by the court\u2019s custody-evaluation unit. According to the mother, only counsel for the parties\u2014 not the parties themselves\u2014were permitted to view a copy of such a report at the Family Division Clerk\u2019s Office, during business hours only. Counsel could not copy the report, and could only make notes of the report\u2019s contents. Counsel could not copy verbatim passages. Apparently, unrepresented parties were allowed to view only the portions of the report that pertained to themselves, not the opposing party. The Court of Appeals expressed reservations about the propriety of this unwritten policy, but concluded ultimately that a remand, without affirmance or reversal, was necessary because \u201c[e]f-fective review of the Circuit Court policy or rule is not possible given the paucity of the present record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683, 50 A.3d 1098. In its remand decision, the Court of Appeals specifically made reference to Maryland Rule 16-1009:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">When sealing or limiting access to a case record, a trial judge must make findings about the interest sought to be protected from inspection, supported by specific findings. Md. Rule 16-1009(d)(2); see also <em>Balt. Sun Co. v. Colbert, </em>323 Md. 290, 305, 593 A.2d 224, 231 (1991) (citing <em>In re Knight Publ\u2019g Co., </em>743 F.2d 231, 235 (4th Cir.1984) (\u201cA court ruling on a motion to seal judicial records should articulate the interest sought to be protected by the seal, supported by specific findings.\u201d)). When determining whether to preclude or limit inspection of a case record, as was the case here, the trial judge must consider \u201cwhether a special and compelling reason exists\u201d to justify restricted access. Md. Rule 16-1009(d)(4)(A). The trial court\u2019s final order that precludes or limits inspection of a case record \u201cshall be as narrow as practicable in scope and duration to effectuate the interest sought to be protected by the order.\u201d Md. Rule 16\u20141009(d)(3); see also <em>Colbert, </em>323 Md. at 306, 593 A.2d at 231. Moreover, the trial court must state why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>alternatives to sealing or limiting access to the case record were rejected. <em>Balt. Sun v. Thanos, </em>92 Md.App. 227, 246, 607 A.2d 565, 574 (1992) (discussing requirements for sealing a pre-sentencing report in a first-degree murder case).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">The limited record before us does not illuminate sufficiently the full contours of the Circuit Court policy or rule, its origin, the balancing of the interests sought to be protected by it against competing interests, whether less restrictive alternatives were considered and why they were rejected, and any special or compelling reasons to prohibit the parties\u2019 attorneys from receiving a copy of the custody investigation report. Effective review of the Circuit Court policy or rule is not possible given the paucity of the present record. <em>Thanos, </em>92 Md.App. at 246, 607 A.2d at 574. Therefore, remand to the Circuit Court for supplementation of the record is appropriate. <em>Colbert, </em>323 Md. at 307, 593 A.2d at 232; <em>Thanos, </em>92 Md.App. at 246, 607 A.2d at 574.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 682-83, 50 A.3d 1098 (footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">As in <em>Sumpter, </em>here, the limited record before us does not reveal enough about the circuit court\u2019s analysis of the requested information for us to determine whether the court\u2019s ruling was sound. Accordingly, we remand this case pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-604(d), without affirmance or reversal, for the circuit court to make findings comparable to those required in <em>Sumpter. </em>The court should specifically address each of the redactions that appellant identified, and either make the redacted information available or explain why the redacted information constitutes identifying information which must be withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In his second contention on appeal, appellant asserts that the court abused its discretion, and violated Rule 16-1009, when it failed to issue written findings explaining its denial of his motion. We note that appellant made no mention of Rule 16-1009 in the motion which is the subject of this appeal, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>he raised no argument in the circuit court regarding the application of Rule 16-1009 to the motion that is the subject of this appeal. Consequently, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">JUDGMENT NEITHER AFFIRMED NOR REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
