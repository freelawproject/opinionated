The court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the murder conviction and concurrent sentences on the other convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">Appellant subsequently filed a motion seeking \u201csome type of reconsideration and reduction\u201d relating to the life sentence imposed on the conviction for murder, arguing that the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>in announcing its verdict on the murder count, failed to state whether it found him guilty of murder in the first degree or murder in the second degree. Although he styled his <em>pro se </em>motion as a Motion to Revise Sentence, we shall treat it as a motion to correct an illegal sentence. The circuit court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">On appeal, appellant, still proceeding <em>pro se, </em>presents three questions for our review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>which we have consolidated and rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">Where the jury finds the defendant guilty of murder without specifying the degree of murder as required by statute, is the conviction for first-degree murder a nullity if the evidence and instructions supported a verdict only with respect to first-degree felony murder?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer that question in the negative, and we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">We need not recite in detail the evidence adduced at trial in support of appellant\u2019s convictions. Those facts are set out in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>our recently reported opinion affirming the circuit court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of actual innocence. <em>See McGhie v. State, </em>224 Md.App. 286, 120 A.3d 828 (2015). For the purpose of this appeal, it is sufficient to note that the evidence supported a finding that appellant conspired with several others to rob a store in Montgomery County, and during the attempted robbery, one of appellant\u2019s co-conspirators shot and killed one store owner and shot and wounded another person. Appellant was not in the store when the attempted robbery and shootings took place.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The State argued that appellant was an accomplice and proceeded on the murder charge under the theory of felony murder. Appellant\u2019s defense, as made clear in his counsel\u2019s opening remarks, was that he was not involved in the robbery plan, and the shooter acted without appellant\u2019s knowledge or assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the court discussed jury instructions with counsel. The transcript reflects that the proposed verdict sheet initially had two options for the murder charge, felony murder and premeditated murder, both of which constitute first-degree murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After defense counsel objected to the verdict sheet referring to premeditated murder and stated that there was no evidence to support \u201cany degrees of murder other than felony murder,\u201d the State agreed to withdraw its request to have premeditated murder appear on the verdict sheet. Defense counsel then stated that, \u201cif this verdict sheet goes in ... count one should say murder, period, without the word \u2018felony.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The prosecution did not oppose this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>At the conclusion of the discussion, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">[I]t is the State\u2019s allegation that the defendant was what they call a principal in the second degree, not the one who actually committed the offense, but an aider and abettor, and with that in mind, let me first then go through\u2014count one is the charge of murder, and that, in effect, alleges a first degree felony murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">In order for the defendant to be convicted of first degree murder or felony murder, the State must prove,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">one, that the defendant or another participating in a crime with the defendant committed the offense of robbery or armed robbery, that the defendant\u2014or, actually, the defendant Or another participating in this crime killed Randy Covington, the victim, and that the act resulting in the death of Randy Covington occurred during the commission of that crime of robbery or armed robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">Felony murder does not require the State to prove that the defendant or [the shooter] intended to actually kill him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">It does not require premeditation of first degree murder; it is that a death or homicide occurs during the course of a felony, and the felony alleged is the armed robbery of the [store].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">In closing argument, the prosecutor noted that accomplice liability was the heart of the State\u2019s case. He stated that there was no doubt that there was a \u201cfelony murder\u201d that occurred in the midst of a robbery, and the only real issue was appellant\u2019s involvement in planning the robbery. The prosecutor told the jury that intent to kill was not required for felony murder, but rather, \u201cthe law says if you take someone\u2019s life during the execution of a felony, you are liable for felony murder.\u201d Defense counsel 'argued in closing that the State had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant conspired with the shooter (and others) to rob the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">When the jury completed their deliberations, they returned to the courtroom and announced their verdict as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>THE CLERK: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">THE JURY: We have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">THE CLERK: Who shall say for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">THE JURY: Our foreman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">THE CLERK: Mr. [Fjoreman, please stand. How do you find the defendant as to Count One, Murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">THE FOREMAN: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">THE CLERK: Count Two, Use of a Handgun in a Crime of Violence or a Felony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">THE FOREMAN: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">THE CLERK: Count Three, Attempted Murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\">THE FOREMAN: Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-14\">THE CLERK: Count Four, Attempted Robbery with a Dangerous Weapon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-15\">THE FOREMAN: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-16\">THE CLERK: Count Five, Use of a Handgun in a Crime of Violence or Felony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-17\">THE FOREMAN: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-18\">THE CLERK: Count Six, Conspiracy to Commit Robbery with a Dangerous Weapon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-19\">THE FOREMAN: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-20\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-21\">The jury was then polled, but the polling was not transcribed for the record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court then directed that the verdict be recorded, stating that there was \u201cno need to hearken\u201d the verdict. <em>See State v. Santiago, </em>412 Md. 28, 37, 985 A.2d 556 (2009) (\u201c \u2018A poll of the jury serves the same purpose as that of hearkening.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Smith v. State, </em>299 Md. 158,166, 472 A.2d 988 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Motion To Revise Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In November 2011, after appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction, he filed a Motion to Revise Sentence, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(b), arguing that there was an \u201cirregularity\u201d in the verdict because \u201cthe jury failed to pronounce the degree of murder in their verdict\u201d as required by law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant argued that \u201cthe jury\u2019s failure to ascertain in their verdict the degree of murder is a deviation from proper \u2018process or procedure\u2019 set by the General Assembly of Maryland,\u201d and therefore, it \u201cconstitutes an irregularity within the meaning of Maryland Rule 4-345(b).\u201d Appellant requested that the circuit court \u201clook beyond the label\u201d of his <em>pro se </em>motion and \u201cmake a determination based on ... substance.\u201d On December 14, 2011, the circuit court denied the motion. It stated that the \u201cremedy for the error [appellant] alleges was by way of direct appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Appellant contends that his life sentence for murder should be vacated because it is an \u201cillegal\u201d sentence. In support, he argues that the guilty verdict was a nullity because the jury failed to announce whether it found him guilty of murder in the first degree or in the second degree. He notes that, in 1994, when appellant was convicted, Md. Code (1992 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27 \u00a7 412(a) provided: \u201cIf a person is found guilty of murder, the court or jury that determined the person\u2019s guilt shall state in the verdict whether the person is guilty of murder in the first degree or murder in the second degree.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The State responds in two ways. First, it contends that a denial of a motion to modify a sentence is not an appealable order, and therefore, we should dismiss this appeal. Second, the State argues that, if we consider appellant\u2019s contention, it should be rejected. It asserts that the concern underlying the requirement that the jury state with specificity the degree of murder for which they are convicting the defendant is unanimity in the verdict, and here, because the jury was instructed on the murder charge only with respect to first degree felony murder, the jury\u2019s only choice was to find appellant \u201cguilty or not guilty of first degree felony murder.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, it argues, the announcement of \u201cguilty\u201d on the count of murder undoubtedly was a unanimous verdict of first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">We address first the State\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal. Appellant acknowledges that he \u201cinartfully titled the motion to revise sentence pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(b) arguing irregularity,\u201d as opposed to arguing, as he does on appeal, that his life sentence for murder was \u201cillegal\u201d under Rule 4-345(a). He nonetheless urges this Court to consider the illegal sentence argument he raises on appeal, noting that the court may correct an illegal sentence at any time. The State responds that appellant \u201ccannot transform an unappealable motion into an appealable one by renaming it,\u201d and accordingly, it asserts that this appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Maryland Rule 4-345 provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acq\">(a) Illegal sentence. The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>(b) Fraud, Mistake, or Irregularity. The court has revisory power over a sentence in case of fraud, mistake, or irregularity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">To be sure, appellant sought to \u201crevise\u201d his sentence pursuant to Rule 4-345(b), based on an \u201cirregularity\u201d in the jury\u2019s announcement of the verdict. He also requested, however, that the circuit court \u201clook beyond the label\u201d of his <em>pro se </em>motion and \u201cmake a determination based on ... substance.\u201d Given the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision \u201cto construe liberally filings by <em>pro se </em>inmates,\u201d <em>Douglas v. State, </em>423 Md. 156, 182, 31 A.3d 250 (2011), and because an illegal sentence may be corrected \u201cat any time,\u201d Rule 4-345(a), we deny the State\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">We thus turn to the merits of appellant\u2019s contention, that his life sentence for murder was illegal. A sentence is \u201cillegal\u201d and subject to correction under Rule 4-345(a) only in limited circumstances. A sentence is illegal in this regard where there is no conviction warranting any sentence or where the sentence imposed is not a permitted one. <em>Chaney v. State, </em>397 Md. 460, 466, 918 A.2d 506 (2007). <em>Accord Garner v. State, </em>442 Md. 226, 251, 112 A.3d 392 (2015) (A sentence is \u201cillegal\u201d for purposes of Maryland Rule 4-345(a) where \u201cthere either has been no conviction warranting any sentence for the particular offense or the sentence is not a permitted one for the conviction upon which it was imposed and, for either reason, is intrinsically and substantively unlawful.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Here, appellant contends that there was no valid conviction on which a life sentence could have been imposed. In support, he asserts that his murder conviction was null and void because the jury did not, as statutorily required, announce the degree of murder on which it was convicting appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The Court of Appeals first addressed the statutory requirement that a guilty verdict of murder include the degree of murder more than 150 years ago. In <em>Ford v. State, </em>12 Md. 514 (1859), the defendant was charged with \u201cwilful murder\u201d of another man \u201cby shooting him with a pistol.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>When the jury was asked to give its verdict, the foreman stated that the verdict was \u201cGuilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547. Defense counsel asked that the jury be polled. <em>Id. </em>The court then directed the clerk</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">to ask the jury, when he polled them, \u201cWhether they found the prisoner guilty of murder in the first degree, or murder in the second degree?\u201d To which question, when it was put to the jury, the foreman answered for the jury, in the words, \u201cGuilty of murder in the first degree,\u201d in an audible voice; and each of the remaining eleven jurors, when polled, responded, \u201cGuilty,\u201d without specifying the degree of murder in words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Ford argued that there was no unanimity in the verdict regarding the degree of murder on which he was found guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 534. The Court of Appeals agreed, stating that Article 19 (now 21) of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides that, in all criminal prosecutions, a man has the right to, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca speedy trial by an impartial jury, <em>without whose unanimous consent he ought not to be found guilty.\u201d Id. </em>at 549. The Court stated: \u201c \u2018The verdict is the <em>unanimous </em>decision made by a jury and reported to the court, on the matters lawfully submitted to them in the course of the trial.\u2019 <em>Unanimity </em>is indispensable to the sufficiency of the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 10 <em>Bacon\u2019s Abridg. Title Verdict </em>306 (1832)).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The Court of Appeals held that, under the circumstances of that case, where the foreman initially said \u201cguilty\u201d for the panel, and when the entire jury was polled, eleven of them replied \u201cguilty,\u201d without specifying the degree in words, Ford was not found guilty of murder in the first degree by each member of the jury. <em>Id. </em>Because the jury, in their verdict, did not unanimously find Ford guilty of murder in the first degree, there was \u201cno valid and sufficient verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The Court addressed this issue again in <em>Williams v. State, </em>60 Md. 402 (1883). In that case, the defendant was tried on an indictment for murder, and the foreman announced the jury\u2019s verdict as \u201cguilty of murder in the first degree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>The defense requested a poll of the jury, and each individual juror stated its verdict as \u201cguilty,\u201d without specifying the degree of murder. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals held that the verdict rendered on the poll was a defective verdict because \u201cnot a single juror\u201d finding Williams guilty \u201cascertained the degree of murder as required by the Code.\u201d Accordingly, the general verdict of \u201cguilty\u201d was a nullity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">These cases make clear that, to support a first-degree murder conviction, the jury verdict must reflect that the jurors unanimously found the defendant guilty, not just of murder, but of murder in the first degree. The Court of Appeals subsequently made clear, however, that each juror need not utter those specific words. <em>Strong v. State, </em>261 Md. 371, 275 A.2d 491 (1971), <em>vacated, </em>408 U.S. 939, 92 S.Ct. 2872, 33 L.Ed.2d 760 (1972) (vacating death sentence). In <em>Strong, </em>the forelady announced the verdict as: \u201cGuilty. Guilty of first degree murder, the first degree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373, 275 A.2d 491. During the subsequent polling, the individual jurors merely responded: \u2018Yes,\u201d or \u201cYes, it is,\u201d when asked if their verdict was the same as the forelady\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 373-74, 275 A.2d 491. On appeal, Strong argued, relying on <em>Williams, </em>that the murder verdict was defective because the individual jurors did not mention the degree of murder. <em>Id. </em>at 374, 275 A.2d 491. The Court of Appeals held that the verdict was valid, stating that the jurors\u2019 response to the polling question \u201cwas the equivalent of each juror saying: T find the accused guilty of murder in the first degree.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Here, the foreman stated that the verdict on the charge of murder was \u201cguilty.\u201d Although a poll of the jury was conducted, a transcript of the polling was not included in the record.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Accordingly, the record as presented to us does not reflect a jury verdict that contained a specific statement by the jury members designating whether appellant committed murder in the first degree or second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">As indicated, <em>supra, </em>a verdict failing to state the degree of murder on which the defendant was found guilty rendered the murder conviction a nullity in <em>Ford </em>and <em>Williams. </em>The question we must address is whether that same result applies here, where a finding of guilty of second degree murder was not a viable option for the jury and the verdict clearly represented a unanimous finding of guilt of first degree murder. We conclude that, under these circumstances, appellant\u2019s murder conviction was not a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">We find support for this conclusion in opinions of courts in other jurisdictions containing a statutory requirement that the jury state in the verdict the degree of murder for which the defendant is found guilty. For example, in <em>Fiegehen v. State, </em>121 Nev. 293, 113 P.3d 305, 306 (2005), where Fiegehen was charged with murder, burglary and other charges, the Supreme Court of Nevada addressed the same issue we are presented with here. In Nevada, as in Maryland, a jury finding a defendant guilty of murder is required by statute to designate whether the murder was first or second degree. <em>Id. </em>at 306. In that case, however, when the jury returned its verdict, it merely found Fiegehen guilty of \u201cmurder with the use of a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">In addressing the argument that the conviction was a nullity, the Nevada Supreme Court recognized the \u201cconsistent line of cases\u201d holding that, pursuant to statutory directive, a failure to designate the degree of murder renders the verdict a nullity. <em>Id. </em>at 308. Under the circumstances of that case, however, the court rejected Fiegehen\u2019s argument that his murder conviction was invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 312. The court held that, where \u201cthe verdict as a whole unequivocally establishes a finding of felony murder, the verdict satisfies the command of [the statute requiring the jury to announce the degree of murder] because felony murder is first-degree murder as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 806. Because second-degree murder was not an option where the defendant was charged solely with first-degree felony murder, and the jury clearly found the defendant guilty of the predicate felony, a finding of first-degree felony murder could clearly be \u201cdiscerned solely from the jury\u2019s verdict as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310. In that situation, the court stated, \u201creversing the conviction based on the jury\u2019s failure to expressly include the words \u2018first-degree murder\u2019 in its verdict would merely elevate form over substance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the court held that, because the verdict established a finding of first-degree murder as a matter of law, it satisfied the statutory requirement that the jury designate that the guilty verdict of murder was of the first or second degree. <em>Id. Accord Gaines v. Leverette, </em>164 W.Va. 754, 266 S.E.2d 451, 452-53 (1980) (where there is \u201cno doubt about the degree of murder found by the jury despite its failure to so specify,\u201d the verdict was not void because it failed, as required by statute, to specify the degree).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We agree with that analysis. We hold that, where the verdict makes clear that the jury found the defendant guilty of first-degree felony murder as a matter of law, the verdict satisfies the statutory requirement that the jury state the degree of murder on which the defendant is found guilty. In that situation, a murder conviction is not void or a nullity based on the failure of the jury to state the specific words \u201cfirst degree\u201d murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Here, the verdict unequivocally established that the jury unanimously found appellant guilty of first-degree felony murder. The evidence presented, and the State\u2019s argument, related only to first-degree felony murder, and the parties agreed that the court should instruct the jury on the murder charge only with respect to felony murder.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And because neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>second-degree murder nor manslaughter are lesser included offenses of first-degree felony murder, the verdict of the jury had to be \u201cfirst-degree murder or nothing.\u201d Charles Moylan, Jr., <em>Criminal Homicide Law, </em>\u00a7 5.1 (MICPEL 2002). <em>Accord West v. State, </em>124 Md.App. 147, 161, 720 A.2d 1253 (1998) (\u201c[T]he jury was not required to be instructed on second-degree murder because it is not a lesser included offense of first-degree felony murder.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>353 Md. 270, 725 A.2d 1068 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Under these circumstances, where the jury\u2019s verdict clearly was a unanimous verdict of guilty of first-degree murder, the failure of the jury to specifically use the words \u201cfirst degree\u201d in its verdict did not render the verdict invalid. Therefore, appellant\u2019s claim that the resulting life sentence on the murder conviction was illegal is without merit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">APPELLEE\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS DENIED.

Criminal Law Code \u00a7 2-302, Article 27 \u00a7 412(a), and Chapter 138 \u00a7 3[is] mandatory, if so, did the sentencing court error imposing life sentence on appellant when no sentence should have been imposed because [the] jury never orally announced degree of murder in their verdict in open court as required?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-15\">2. ) Did the trial court err surmising jury meant first-degree murder although jury did not orally announce such finding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-16\">3. ) Did [the circuit court] err in denying relief in light of this courtf\u2019s] holding in <em>[Gantt v.

Prior to appellant\u2019s trial, the shooter, Edward Borrero, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and other offenses. Mr. Borrero testified for the State at appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\">. <em>See </em>Md. Code (2012 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 2-201(a) of the Criminal Law Article (\"CR\u201d), previously codified at Md. Code (1992 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27 \u00a7 407.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\">. A verdict sheet was not included in the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b480-22\">. It is the appellant's responsibility to order \"a transcription of any proceeding relevant to the appeal.'' Md. Rule 8-411(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\">. Appellant did not raise this issue in his direct appeal. Nor does it appear that he raised it in any of his various requests for relief postconviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b481-10\">. This provision currently is codified as Md. Code (2012 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 2-302 of the Criminal Law Article (\"CR''), which provides: \"When a court or jury finds a person guilty of murder, the court or juiy shall state in the verdict whether the person is guilty of murder in the first degree or murder in the second degree.\u201d This law was enacted in 1809 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>when the General Assembly divided murder into degrees and mandated that the penalty for first-degree murder was \"death, by hanging\u201d and the penalty for second-degree murder was a minimum term of imprisonment of five years and a maximum term of eighteen years. <em>See </em>1809 Md. Laws, ch. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 3 &amp; 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\">. With respect to Count three, the attempted murder charge, the court did instruct the jury regarding both first and second degree murder. The conviction and sentence for attempted murder are not challenged here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\">. It occurs to us that polling of the jury, by itself, potentially could show compliance with the statute, i.e., where the foreman says the verdict is guilty, but on polling, each juror says that he or she found appellant guilty of first degree murder. <em>See Smith v. State, </em>299 Md. 158, 168, 472 A.2d 988 (1984) (jury may correct the verdict until the case is removed from its province). The State, however, does not make this argument or argue that the transcript of the polling is critical to resolve this appeal. Therefore, we will not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\">. At the time of appellant\u2019s trial, the \"felony murder statute\u201d provided: All murder which shall be committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any rape in any degree, sexual offense in the first or second degree, sodomy, mayhem, robbery, burglary, kidnapping ... storehouse breaking ... or daytime housebreaking ... or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the escape or attempt to escape from the Maryland Penitentiary, the house of correction, the Baltimore City jail, or from any jail or penal institution in any of the counties of this Sate, shall be murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Md. Code (1992 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27 \u00a7 410 (emphasis added). This statute currently is codified as CR \u00a7 2-201(a)(4). Second-degree murder is murder that \"is not in the first degree under [CR] \u00a7 2-201.\u201d CR \u00a7 2-204(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\">. When appellant was convicted in 1994, the penalty for first-degree murder was death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole. <em>See </em>former Art. 27 \u00a7 412(b). In 2013, however, the legislation repealed the death penalty. 2013 Md. Laws, ch. 156.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
