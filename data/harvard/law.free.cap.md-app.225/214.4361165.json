Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">This appeal arises from a Master Settlement Agreement (\u201cMSA\u201d) between appellees, who are numerous cigarette manufacturers (the \u201cParticipating Manufacturers\u201d or \u201cPMs\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and appellant, the State of Maryland (\u201cMaryland\u201d), along with 51 other states and territories (collectively, the \u201cSettling States\u201d). Specifically, it involves the multi-state arbitration of an MSA dispute over the \u201cNon-Participating Manufacturer Adjustment\u201d (\u201cNPM Adjustment\u201d)\u2014a potential reduction to the annual payment that the PMs make to the Settling States under the MSA, which is allocated among those states who failed to diligently enforce certain obligations under the MSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">During the arbitration of the 2003 NPM Adjustment dispute, the PMs reached a settlement (\u201cTerm Sheet\u201d agreement) with 22 states (the \u201cTerm Sheet States\u201d) before it was determined whether those states were diligent or non-diligent. Maryland and the other \u201cNon-Term Sheet States\u201d were also offered the settlement, but declined to join. In light of this partial settlement, the arbitrators (a \u201cPanel\u201d of three former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>federal judges) were tasked with resolving how the 2003 NPM Adjustment should be allocated to any Non-Term Sheet States who were found non-diligent. On March 12, 2013, the Panel interpreted the MSA\u2019s language and concluded that the NPM Adjustment should be allocated post-settlement pursuant to the \u201cpro rata\u201d method of judgment reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">After holding individual evidentiary hearings for the Non-Term Sheet States, whose diligence for 2003 was still contested, the Panel concluded that Maryland and five other Non-Term Sheet States were non-diligent and thus subject to the 2003 NPM Adjustment. On September 11, 2013, after assessing Maryland\u2019s enforcement record for 2003, the Panel found that Maryland lacked \u201ca culture of compliance\u201d and that its efforts \u201cfell short of its efforts in earlier years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Maryland filed motions in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to vacate the Panel\u2019s awards for the 2003 NPM Adjustment that adopted the pro rata judgment-reduction method and that found Maryland to be non-diligent. On November 12, 2013, Maryland also filed a motion to compel the PMs to arbitrate Maryland\u2019s diligence for 2004 in a state-specific arbitration, rather than as part of a multi-state arbitration of the entire 2004 Adjustment dispute. On July 28, 2014, the circuit court denied all three motions, and on August 20, 2014, Maryland noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">II. Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">We have rephrased Maryland\u2019s questions as follows:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>1) Did the circuit court err in refusing to vacate the Panel\u2019s award which adopted the pro rata judgment-reduction method in reallocating the 2003 NPM Adjustment only among the non-diligent, Non-Term Sheet States?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">2) Did the circuit court err in refusing to vacate the Panel\u2019s finding that Maryland was not diligent in 2003?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">3) Did the circuit court err in failing to order the PMs to arbitrate Maryland\u2019s diligence for 2004 in a state-specific arbitration?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">For the reasons that follow, we answer only the first question in the affirmative, and reverse the circuit court\u2019s judgment regarding that issue. Accordingly, we remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">III. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">A. MSA</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">In 1998, Maryland and the 51 other Settling States entered the MSA, thus settling their claims for \u201cwrongful marketing and advertising of cigarettes, as well as damages based upon the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses,\u201d against three major cigarette manufacturers\u2014Philip Morris USA, Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., and Lorillard Tobacco Co. (collectively, \u201cOriginal Participating Manufacturers\u201d or \u201cOPMs\u201d). <em>State v. Philip Moms Inc., </em>179 Md.App. 140, 142-43, 944 A.2d 1167 (2008). Since then, more than forty subsequent participating manufacturers (\u201cSPMs\u201d) have joined the MSA. <em>Id. </em>at 145 n. 2, 944 A.2d 1167. In exchange for the dismissal of \u201cany pending action and [a] release [of] all past and future claims\u201d against them, the PMs agreed \u201cto restrict the manner in which they market and advertise tobacco products and ... to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>substantial annual payment to be allocated among the settling states.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 944 A.2d 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Pursuant to the MSA, the PMs do not make the annual payment (\u201cMSA Payment\u201d) directly to the Settling States. <em>Id. </em>Rather, each PM is \u201crequired to make a single, nationwide annual payment into an escrow account on or before April 15\u201d of each year, the exact amount of which is calculated annually by an \u201cIndependent Auditor ... pursuant to a comprehensive formula contained within the MSA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145-46, 944 A.2d 1167. \u201cThe calculation begins with each original participating manufacturer paying into an escrow account its relative market share of the base amount for the calendar year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 944 A.2d 1167 (citing MSA \u00a7 IX(e)(l)). That amount is then subject to several reductions and adjustments, including the NPM Adjustment. <em>Id. </em>(citing MSA \u00a7\u00a7 IX(c)(j), XI(a)(l)). Thereafter, the funds are \u201callocated among the settling states according to formulae set forth in the MSA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146 n. 3, 944 A.2d 1167. Pursuant to the \u201callocable shares,\u201d Maryland is entitled to 2.2604570 percent of the PMs\u2019 annual payment. <em>Id. </em>(citing MSA \u00a7 II(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The NPM Adjustment, governed by Section IX(d) of the MSA, is a payment reduction designed to address the PMs\u2019 concern that \u201cthey would incur a competitive disadvantage to the non-participating manufacturers [ (\u201cNPMs\u201d) ], who were not subject to the MSA\u2019s strict marketing restrictions and payment obligations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146-47, 944 A.2d 1167. Each year, PMs \u201cmay be eligible to take a NPM Adjustment if (1) the independent auditor determines that, during the year in question, the participating manufacturers collectively lose more than two percent of their pre-MSA market share to nonparticipating manufacturers and (2) an economic consulting firm determines that the MSA was a \u2018significant factor\u2019 contributing to that loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 944 A.2d 1167 (citing MSA \u00a7 IX(d)(l)). If these conditions are satisfied, then the PMs are entitled to the NPM Adjustment on their annual payment as to all Settling States, subject to one exception\u2014the \u201cdiligence exception.\u201d <em>See </em>MSA \u00a7 IX(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Pursuant to the diligence exception, \u201c[a] Settling State\u2019s Allocated Payment shall not be subject to an NPM Adjustment ... if such Settling State continuously had a Qualifying Statute ... in full force and effect during the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the payment in question is due, and diligently enforced the provisions of such statute during such entire calendar year.\u201d MSA \u00a7 IX(d)(2)(B). The MSA defines a \u201cQualifying Statute\u201d as a \u201cstatute, regulation, law and/or rule ... that effectively and fully neutralizes the cost disadvantages that the [PMs] experience vis-\u00e1-vis [NPMs] within such Settling State as a result of [the MSA].\u201d MSA \u00a7 IX(d)(2)(E). \u201cMaryland enacted the model \u2018qualifying statute\u2019 contained in Exhibit T to the MSA, which is codified as Maryland\u2019s Escrow Act [Md. Code (1992, 2010 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 16-401 <em>et seq. </em>of the Business Regulation Article].\u201d <em>Philip Morris Inc., </em>179 Md.App. at 147, 944 A.2d 1167. It requires all NPMs to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Z\">deposit into escrow a fixed sum per cigarette sold that is slightly less than the per-cigarette cost imposed by the MSA on participating manufacturers. These escrowed funds may ultimately be used to satisfy a judgment that the State may obtain against a non-participating manufacturer. If the funds are not so used within twenty-five years, they are returned to the nonparticipating manufacturer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 148, 944 A.2d 1167 (internal citations omitted). \u201c[I]f a state has a \u2018qualifying statute\u2019 in full force and effect and diligently enforces that statute, the auditor must reallocate that state\u2019s share of the NPM Adjustment among the other states that do not qualify, \u2018pro rata in proportion to their respective Allocable Shares.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 944 A.2d 1167 (quoting MSA \u00a7 IX(d)(2)(C) (\u201cReallocation Provision\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In other words, to incentivize the Settling States to be diligent, the MSA provides that the non-diligent States are collectively responsible for the total available NPM Adjustment, including what would have been the shares of the diligent states. Accordingly, the greater the number of diligent states, the larger the amount of NPM Adjustment that is reallocated to non-diligent states. <em>See id. </em>at 163, 944 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>1167 (\u201c[Tjhe granting of an exemption to one Settling State will inexorably lead to the reallocation of its allocated portion of the NPM Adjustment to all other non-exempt Settling States. Each Settling State thus has a vital interest in the granting or denial of each other Settling State\u2019s individual claim for exemption.\u201d) (Citation omitted); <em>Com. ex rel. Kane v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., </em>114 A.3d 37, 44 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct. 2015) (\u201cGenerally, as the number of diligent states increase, the burden on non-diligent states increases. This is because an increase in the number of diligent states means that there is more adjustment reallocated among a smaller group.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">B. 2003 NPM Adjustment</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In the present appeal, the primary dispute concerns the NPM Adjustment for 2003. Although the PMs were entitled to take an NPM Adjustment that year, the Independent Auditor decided not to apply it because the Settling States\u2019 diligence in enforcing their respective Qualifying Statutes had not yet been determined. <em>See Philip Morris Inc., </em>179 Md. App. at 148-49, 944 A.2d 1167 (\u201c[T]he participating manufacturers requested that the auditor apply the 2003 NPM Adjustment to their April 2006 payments. Maryland and the other settling states, however, urged the auditor to deny the NPM Adjustment on the ground that the settling states \u2018diligently enforced\u2019 their qualifying statutes.\u201d). Therefore, the PMs requested arbitration pursuant to MSA \u00a7 XI(c), <em>id. </em>at 143, 944 A.2d 1167, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to calculations performed by, or any determinations made by, the Independent Auditor (including, without limitation, any dispute concerning the operation or application of any of the adjustments, reductions, offsets, carry-forwards and allocations described in subsection IX(j) or subsection XI(i)) shall be submitted to binding arbitration before a panel of three neutral arbitrators, each of whom shall be a former Article III federal judge. Each of the two sides to the dispute shall select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select the third arbitrator. The arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>shall be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act [9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 <em>et seq.].</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">On May 18, 2006, Maryland asked the Circuit Court for Baltimore City \u201cfor declaratory relief, declaring that the auditor properly determined not to reduce the participating manufacturers\u2019 MSA payments to reflect a NPM Adjustment.\u201d <em>Philip Morris Inc., </em>179 Md.App. at 149, 944 A.2d 1167 (footnote omitted). After hearing arguments on October 5, 2006, the circuit court issued an order on January 19, 2007, compelling arbitration, and we affirmed that decision on March 27, 2008. <em>Id. </em>at 150,167, 944 A.2d 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In December, 2008, the PMs entered into an Agreement Regarding Arbitration (\u201cARA\u201d) with almost every Settling State, including Maryland. According to the ARA, \u201c[t]he 2003 NPM Adjustment shall be resolved through [a nationwide arbitration] pursuant to Section XI(c) of the MSA\u201d in order to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">1. Whether the Independent Auditor was correct in not applying the 2003 NPM Adjustment to the [PMs\u2019] 2006 or prior annual payments....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">2. Whether the June 2003 settlement agreements release in whole or in part, or provide a basis for excluding evidence relating to, the 2003 NPM Adjustment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">3. Whether individual Settling States diligently enforced a Qualifying Statute in 2003....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\">4. (a) Whether under Section XI(i)(2)(A) of the MSA, a transfer from the Disputed Payments Account to a [PM] should be accomplished through a transfer from the Disputed Payments Account to such [PM] or through an offset in favor of such [PM] accompanied by a transfer to the Settling States; and (b) under Section XI(i)(l)(B) of the MSA, under what circumstances, if any, should a transfer be made from the Disputed Payments Account to a Settling State that is determined to have diligently enforced a Qualifying Statute or whose diligent enforcement the [PMs] no longer contest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>5. To the extent a Settling State may assert that the 2008 NPM Adjustment should be applied to another Settling State pursuant to Section IX(d)(2) of the MSA, a determination as to the validity of any such assertion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The Panel<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> began proceedings on July 2, 2010, and entered various preliminary orders governing the conduct of the hearings. For example, on January 19, 2011, it concluded that the Settling States \u201cmust bear the burden of proving that they diligently enforced their respective Qualifying Statutes for purposes of the 2003 NPM Adjustment.\u201d In particular, the Panel determined that \u201cno language in the MSA supports a finding that the States can by-pass an inquiry regarding whether they satisfied their contractual obligation for avoiding a payment adjustment through the NPM Adjustment.\u201d (Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">By order dated May 23, 2011, the Panel added that \u201calthough the conditions to application of the NPM Adjustment under section IX(d)(l) had been met, without the diligent enforcement determination, there was no \u2018Available NPM Adjustment for the Auditor to apply and there would be no Available NPM Adjustment unless and until the diligent enforcement determination was made.\u2019 \u201d Thus, according to the Panel, the Independent Auditor could not apply the 2003 NPM Adjustment and properly declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Then, in an order dated July 1, 2011, the Panel concluded, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">(3) Any Settling State whose diligent enforcement for the year 2003 is not contested by any PM or State[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] will be deemed [ ] by the Independent Auditor for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Section IX(d)(2)(B)-(C) of the MSA as a Settling State that diligently enforced its Qualifying Statute for that year only and is therefore [ ] not subject [to] the 2003 NPM Adjustment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">(4) The share of the 2003 NPM Adjustment (if any) of a Settling State whose diligent enforcement is not contested by any PM or State, will be governed by the reallocation provisions of Sections IX(d)(2) and IX (d)(4) of the MSA, and will thus be reallocated among all Settling States that did not diligently enforce a Qualifying Statute during 2003 as provided in those provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In that order, the Panel noted that \u201c[b]ecause a state bears the burden of proof when its claim of diligent enforcement [ ] is not challenged does not mean that there must be a hearing when the claim is unchallenged.\u201d Rather, \u201cthe burden to prove diligent [] enforcement comes into play only when a state\u2019s contested claim is required to [be] resolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">On or about November 3, 2011, the PMs filed a notice of their intent to contest the diligence of 35 Settling States, including Maryland. Thereafter, the Panel scheduled individual evidentiary hearings for each of those 35 Settling States. A hearing devoted to Maryland\u2019s enforcement evidence took place from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on October 22-23, 2012, and from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on October 24, 2012. During that time, Maryland presented the testimony of two lay witnesses, one document summary witness, and three expert witnesses. Meanwhile, the PMs had three expert witnesses testify on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">On or about December 17, 2012, before the Panel had finished all of the state-specific hearings, the PMs and 19 of the Settling States \u201cagreed to a Term Sheet for settlement\u201d that purported to \u201cresolve[ ] the 2003-12 NPM Adjustments as to the signatory States and revise[ ] the NPM Adjustment provision as to those States for the years following 2012.\u201d All of the remaining Settling States were invited to join the settlement, and three more did. Maryland declined the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The 22 total Term Sheet States had an aggregate allocable share of approximately 46% of the NPM Adjustment. Of those 22 states, the PMs had contested the diligence of 20. The Term Sheet, which was to become binding \u201cupon the Panel\u2019s approval,\u201d did not address the MSA\u2019s Reallocation Provision\u2014in particular, its effect on the reallocation of the 2003 NPM Adjustment among the Non-Term Sheet States.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">In January 2013, the PMs and Term Sheet States filed a Proposed Stipulated Partial Award with the Panel, presenting alternatives for \u201chow the 2003 NPM Adjustment will be allocated among the [Non-Term Sheet] States in light of the settlement.\u201d On February 22, 2013, many of the Non-Term Sheet States, including Maryland, filed a brief in opposition to the Proposed Stipulated Partial Award. In pertinent part, they argued that \u201cthe reallocation provisions of the proposed award are contrary to the MSA, adversely affect the majority states, and are not remedied by the proposed set-offs.\u201d Particularly, they urged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">If the Panel chooses to enter an award regarding the settlement, the order should instruct the Independent Auditor to treat any contested [Term Sheet] State as non-diligent for purposes of calculating the allocation of the NPM Adjustment. That result is mandated by the plain language of the MSA unless and until the contested [Term Sheet] States prove their diligence. The MSA\u2019s reallocation structure requires a determination as to the diligence of each State because each State\u2019s potential exposure to an NPM Adjustment depends on every other State\u2019s diligence. The MSA\u2019s reallocation procedure requires that each State be determined diligent or not diligent and contains no exception for a partial settlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">After hearing argument on the issues surrounding the Proposed Stipulated Partial Award, the Panel issued a Stipulated Partial Settlement and Award (\u201cPartial Settlement Award\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>on March 12, 2013.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the outset, the Panel noted that \u201cthe MSA does not directly speak as to the process to be used when some States settle diligent enforcement and some do not.\u201d The Panel then ruled that it \u201cha[d] jurisdiction to rule on the issues raised concerning the MSA reallocation provisions and to determine how the 2003 NPM Adjustment will be allocated among the [Non-Term Sheet] States in light of the settlement.\u201d According to the Panel, its \u201cjurisdiction to interpret and determine the operation of the reallocation provisions is no less where a State is no longer contested because of a settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Turning to the merits, the Panel concluded, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">1. In light of the settlement, the 2003 NPM Adjustment will be allocated among the [Non-Term Sheet] States as follows. The dollar amount of the 2003 NPM Adjustment will be reduced by a percentage equal to the aggregate Allocable Shares of the [Term Sheet] States as of the date of the Panel\u2019s Final Award---- The Independent Auditor will treat the [Term Sheet] States as not subject to the 2003 NPM Adjustment, as that Adjustment amount is reduced as provided above, will be governed by the reallocation provisions of Sections IX(d)(2) and IX(d)(4) of the MSA, and will thus be reallocated among all [Non-Term Sheet] States that did not diligently enforce a Qualifying Statute during 2003 as provided in those provisions. The maximum portion of the 2003 NPM Adjustment that can be applied to a [Non-Term Sheet] State remains as provided by Section IX(d)(2)(D) of the MSA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">2. This judgment reduction is appropriate and adequate under the MSA and governing law. Where multiple parties have a potential shared contractual obligation and some of them settle and some do not, the non-settling parties cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>necessarily block the settlement, but may be entitled to a judgment reduction. The \u201cthree standard methods for reducing judgment against non-settling defendants after a partial settlement\u201d are <em>\u201cpro rata </em>(court divides the amount of the total judgment by the number of settling and non-settling defendants, regardless of each defendant\u2019s culpability), proportionate fault (after a partial settlement and trial of the non[-]settling defendants, the jury determines the relative culpability of all the defendants and the non-settling defendant pays a commensurate percentage of the total judgment), and <em>pro tanto </em>(the court reduces the non-settling defendant\u2019s liability for the judgment against him by the amount previously paid by the settling defendants, without regard to proportionate fault).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">3. Where non-settling defendants are given the protection of the applicable judgment-reduction method required under the contract and law, they are not prejudiced by the partial settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">4. Under Paragraph 1, the [Non-Term Sheet] States receive the <em>pro rata </em>reduction, under which the dollar amount of the 2003 NPM Adjustment will be reduced by a percentage equal to the aggregate Allocable Shares of the [Term Sheet] States. Construing the parties\u2019 contract, the Panel concludes that the MSA reallocation provisions indicate that the <em>pro rata </em>method is appropriate. These provisions use the specific term \u201cpro rata,\u201d stating that the shares of diligent States are to be \u201creallocated among all other Settling States <em>pro rata </em>in proportion to their respective Allocable Shares.\u201d MSA \u00a7 IX(d)(2)(C) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>MSA \u00a7 IX(d)(2)(D) (\u201cpro rata in proportion to their respective Allocable Shares\u201d). More fundamentally, the MSA also provides that the reallocation is not done on a relative fault basis. The amount of a diligent State\u2019s share that is reallocated is its <em>pro rata </em>share of the whole, not an amount derived from its particular fault level. Likewise, the amount of reallocated share that a non-diligent State receives is derived from its <em>pro rata </em>share of the liable States, not its fault level. If the reallocation of diligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>States\u2019 shares is done on a <em>pro rata </em>basis in this way, the Panel reads the MSA as likewise meaning that a judgment reduction arising from some States\u2019 settlement of the diligent enforcement issue should be <em>pro rata </em>as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">(Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Addressing the Non-Term Sheet States\u2019 objections, the Panel stated that the Partial Settlement Award and the Term Sheet \u201cdo not legally prejudice or adversely affect the [Non-Term Sheet] States.\u201d It continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">The Panel does not agree with the Objecting States\u2019 contention that all [Term Sheet] States must be treated as non-diligent for the purposes of the 2003 NPM Adjustment. There is no basis in the facts to assume that every [Term Sheet] State was non-diligent in 2003. Moreover, the Objecting States\u2019 position does not reflect any of the three standard methods of judgment reduction. Such an assumption would produce a considerably larger reduction in the [Non-Term Sheet] States\u2019 potential obligations than any of the standard methods. It is also contrary to the underlying principle of judgment reduction that, because a settlement is not tantamount to an admission of liability, settling defendants are not regarded as necessarily culpable or liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">The Objecting States argue that the MSA reallocation provisions must be wholly inapplicable to a State\u2019s share unless there is an actual determination that the State was diligent. They claim that any approach by which any State\u2019s share is otherwise subject to reallocation is an \u201camendment\u201d to the MSA requiring their consent. But the MSA does not directly speak as to the process to be used when some States settle diligent enforcement and some do not. It is thus within the Panel\u2019s jurisdiction to interpret the contract in light of governing law to determine what the appropriate process and judgment reduction is where there is a partial settlement of diligent enforcement involving fewer than all of the States. There is thus no \u201camendment\u201d to the MSA in the Panel doing so. Should any Objecting State, found by the Panel to be non-diligent, have a good faith belief that the <em>pro rata </em>deduction does not adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>compensate them for a [Term Sheet] State\u2019s removal from the re-allocation pool, their relief, if any, is by appeal to their individual MSA court. The cut-off date for interstate suits set forth in the Panel\u2019s \u201cno contest\u201d order, is not applicable to such procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">(Internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">On September 11, 2013, the Panel issued diligence rulings for the remaining 15 Non-Term Sheet States whose diligence had been contested by the PMs (\u201cFinal Awards\u201d). The Panel determined that six of those states, including Maryland, failed to diligently enforce their Qualifying Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In its Final Award for Maryland, the Panel began its analysis with \u201ccommon\u201d findings and conclusions for all States, including the general standard and specific factors that it had used to objectively assess the diligence of each contested State. The Panel explained that it had interpreted \u201cdiligent enforcement\u201d to mean \u201can ongoing and intentional consideration of the requirements of a Settling State\u2019s Qualifying Statute, and a significant attempt by the Settling State to meet those requirements, taking into account a Settling State\u2019s competing laws and policies that may conflict with its MSA contractual obligations.\u201d \u201cIn order to objectively assess a Settling State\u2019s diligent enforcement in light of that definition,\u201d the Panel also considered a list of eight factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">a.

Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">On March 26, 2013, following the Panel\u2019s issuance of the Partial Settlement Award but prior to its issuance of the Final Awards, Maryland filed a \u201cPetition to Vacate Arbitration Award\u201d in its MSA court, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In its petition, Maryland argued that the Partial Settlement Award \u201cvastly exceed[ed] the scope of the Panel\u2019s power under the MSA, purported] to alter the terms of the MSA without the concurrence of Maryland and other states, and fail[ed] to adhere to clear and undisputed contractual language.\u201d Acknowledging that \u201cthe full implications of the Partial [Settlement] Award [would] not be known until the arbitration is fully concluded,\u201d Maryland requested that the circuit court \u201center an order setting the briefing and hearing schedule [as proposed by Maryland], or, in the alternative vacating the Partial [Settlement] Award without further argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">On November 12, 2013, Maryland filed a \u201cMotion to Compel a Maryland-Specific Arbitration on the Issue of Whether Maryland Diligently Enforced during 2004.\u201d In that request, Maryland averred that \u201c[t]he MSA entitles the State to its own arbitration of the dispute over whether it diligently enforced\u201d its Qualifying Statute in 2004. Furthermore, Maryland argued that \u201c[a] State-specific arbitration would advance the fairness, efficiency, and other purposes of arbitration, while the only alternative to an individual arbitration, a multi-state arbitration, would defeat those same purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Soon thereafter, on November 18, 2013, Maryland filed a \u201cPetition to Vacate Arbitration Award Finding that [Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>land] Did Not Diligently Enforce its Qualifying Statute During 2003.\u201d In that petition, Maryland contended that \u201c[t]he Panel\u2019s Final Award must be vacated because the Panel refused to hear evidence material to the controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Following a hearing on the motions on February 19, 2014, the circuit court entered a memorandum opinion and order on July 28, 2014, denying all three of Maryland\u2019s petitions. In reviewing the Panel\u2019s decisions, the court applied the vacatur standards of the FAA, which provide that \u201ca reviewing court shall vacate an arbitration award, if the arbitrators exceeded their powers due to an error in their construction of the agreement; or the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct or misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">With regard to the Panel\u2019s issuance of the Partial Settlement Award, the circuit court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">[T]he Partial Settlement Award and the NPM reallocation adjustment disputes do arise from the MSA; and are all clearly subject to the arbitration agreement and within the Panel\u2019s authority. Accordingly, this Court finds that the Panel did not lack jurisdiction, nor did it exceed its powers in interpreting the MSA and determining the appropriate method for reallocating the 2003 NPM Adjustment post-settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">Further, this Court finds the Panel\u2019s conclusion of the <em>pro-rata </em>method to be based on a reasonable analysis of the MSA and review of applicable judgment-reduction principles of contract law....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">While Maryland argues that the Panel disregarded the plain language of the MSA, this Court finds this argument to be without merit as the Panel did not and could not disregard the language of the MSA, as \u00a7 IX(d)(2)(C)-(D) of the MSA is silent on the issue of the reallocation of the NPM Adjustment among non-settling states <em>where diligence is no longer contested due to </em>settlement.... This Court does not find any indication in the Panel\u2019s Award that the Panel was substituting its own notions of fairness and/or economic justice. Rather, the Panel was engaged in a good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>faith interpretation of the MSA and applicable law. Therefore, this Court finds that Maryland has failed to meet the requisite burden to establish that the Panel, in issuing the Partial Settlement Award, engaged in misconduct by failing to construe the MSA or by substituting its own notion of fairness and/or economic justice....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">(Internal citations and footnotes omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">With regard to its denial of Maryland\u2019s request for a state-specific arbitration, the circuit court concluded that \u201cthe only reasonable interpretation of the MSA is that nationwide arbitration is required.\u201d The court explained that, under the text of the MSA\u2019s arbitration provision, the \u201ctwo sides to the dispute\u201d are \u201cthe MSA States in opposition to the downward adjustment, and the PMs.\u201d The circuit court also stated that \u201c[t]he only way for the payment structure to remain \u2018nationwide and unitary,\u2019 as intended, is for the arbitration itself to be nationwide and unitary, since the diligence determinations made at the arbitration are directly tied to the reallocation provision.\u201d (Citing <em>Philip Moms, Inc., </em>179 Md.App. at 162, 944 A.2d 1167) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Finally, with regard to the Panel\u2019s Final Award, the circuit court found that the Panel did not \u201crefuse[ ] to hear pertinent and material evidence,\u201d as Maryland alleged, because \u201cMaryland never requested the Panel to consider the comparative non-diligence of the contested \u2018term sheet states,\u2019 \u201d nor did Maryland make \u201cany substantive argument to the Panel that the Panel needed to consider the enforcement record of the \u2018term sheet states\u2019 when making diligence determinations for the non-settling states.\u201d The court also noted that Maryland\u2019s argument failed on the merits because \u201cit [was] clear that the Panel\u2019s diligence determination focused on the objective standard and assessing diligence that was common to all states, and then applying that standard to each State\u2019s individual enforcement for 2003,\u201d instead of comparing Maryland with any other contested state. (Emphasis and citation omitted). The court then concluded by noting that \u201c[e]ven if some, most or all of the \u2018term sheet states\u2019 were less diligent than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Maryland, from the facts there is no guarantee that the Panel would have found Maryland to be diligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Additional facts will be included as they become relevant to our discussion, below.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">IY. Standard op Review</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">At the outset, we must determine the applicable standard of review in a case such as this, where the Panel issued an award in an arbitration governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d)\u2014as mandated by the MSA\u2014but directed aggrieved parties to appeal to their respective state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Maryland contends that \u201cthe standard of review is governed by Maryland law and is <em>de novo.\u201d </em>Although Maryland acknowledges that this Court may rely on decisions interpreting the FAA because the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act (\u201cMUAA\u201d) is the FAA\u2019s state analogue, Maryland maintains that we are not bound by the federal procedural provisions of the FAA. Instead, Maryland avers that this Court must look to the pertinent state law relating to arbitration agreements to determine whether the circuit court erred in denying the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">In response, the PMs argue that the circuit court correctly applied \u201cthe FAA\u2019s extremely narrow judicial-review standards,\u201d and that Maryland\u2019s claim that a <em>de novo </em>standard applies is \u201cboth waived and wrong.\u201d First, the PMs contend that \u201cMaryland waived [its] argument by not raising it below.\u201d Specifically, the PMs note that Maryland \u201crepeatedly acknowledged that the MSA requires application of the FAA\u201d through its opening and subsequent briefs, and its post-hearing submission. Second, relying on the MSA, the PMs aver that \u201cthe FAA will \u2018govern\u2019 MSA arbitrations\u201d and, thus, the circuit court acted properly in applying the vacatur standards of the FAA. Third, the PMs argue that \u201cto the extent ... that Maryland law would authorize broader judicial review in this case, it would be <em>preempted </em>by the FAA.\u201d (Emphasis in original). Lastly, the PMs contend that \u201cthe Maryland standard of review is equally or nearly as narrow as the FAA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>standard,\u201d and its application would not, therefore, lead to a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">We agree with Maryland that judicial review of the arbitrator\u2019s decision in this case is governed by Maryland law. We explain and address each of the PMs\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The PMs first argue that Maryland waived its present claim by not raising it in the circuit court, but they cite no authority to support their position that the applicable standard of review can be waived. Indeed, although no Maryland court has ruled on this matter, several federal courts have stated that \u201ca party cannot \u2018waive\u2019 the proper standard of review by failing to argue it.\u201d <em>Brown v. Smith, </em>551 F.3d 424, 428 n. 2 (6th Cir.2008) (citations omitted); see <em>also Ward v. Stephens, </em>777 F.3d 250, 257 n. 3 (5th Cir.2015) (\u201cA party cannot waive, concede, or abandon the applicable standard of review.\u201d) (Citations omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>U.S. No. 14-10033 (June 2, 2015); <em>Gardner v. Galetka, </em>568 F.3d 862, 879 (10th Cir.2009) (holding that \u201cthe standard of review under AEDPA cannot be waived by the parties\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Vizcaino v. Microsoft Corp., </em>120 F.3d 1006, 1022 n. 4 (9th Cir.1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (O\u2019Scannlain, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201c[A] party cannot, by waiver or estoppel, change the applicable standard of review.\u201d); <em>Ingle v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>947 F.Supp.2d 1163, 1167 (N.D.Okla.2013) (citing <em>Izzarelli v. Rexene Products Co., </em>24 F.3d 1506, 1519 (5th Cir.1994), and stating that \u201cat least one circuit court has explicitly held that a party cannot waive the standard of review in an ERISA case\u201d). This is because it is \u201cthe court, not the parties, [who] must determine the standard of review[.]\u201d <em>Worth v. Tyer, </em>276 F.3d 249, 262 n. 4 (7th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). Therefore, \u201c[s]uch a determination remains for this court to make for itself.\u201d <em>K &amp; T Enterprises, Inc. v. Zurich Ins. Co., </em>97 F.3d 171,175 (6th Cir.1996).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Next, citing the MSA, the PMs argue that judicial review of the Panel\u2019s decision is governed by the FAA. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>advancing this argument, the PMs correctly note that, pursuant to MSA \u00a7 XI(c), NPM Adjustment disputes are subject to an <em>\u201carbitration </em>[that] \u2018shall be governed by the [FAA].\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added). But, they fail to acknowledge that the MSA does not mandate that <em>judicial review </em>of such an arbitration award would be governed by the FAA as well. Rather MSA \u00a7 XVTII(n), entitled \u201cGoverning Law,\u201d provides that the MSA \u201cshall be governed by the laws of the relevant Settling State, without regard to conflict of law rules of such Settling State.\u201d <em>See also </em>MSA \u00a7 VII(a) (stating that the MSA Court retains exclusive jurisdiction); and MSA \u00a7 II(p) (defining \u201cCourt\u201d as the \u201crespective court in each Settling State\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Alternatively, the PMs contend that \u201cthe FAA standard would govern under constitutional preemption principles\u201d because applying a broader state law review standard \u201cwould undercut the FAA\u2019s national policy favoring arbitration with just [a] limited review\u201d and \u201cwould thwart the FAA\u2019s primary purpose of ensuring that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms.\u201d (Citations omitted). Contrary to the PMs\u2019 contention, however, the Maryland Court of Appeals has repeatedly stated that \u201cour procedural rules are not preempted by national policy favoring arbitration^]\u201d <em>Addison v. Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, </em>411 Md. 251, 287, 983 A.2d 138 (2009) (citing <em>Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B., </em>363 Md. 232, 242, 768 A.2d 620 (2001) (\u201cwe conclude that Maryland procedural law ... is not preempted by the FAA\u201d)); <em>accord Walther v. Sovereign Bank, </em>386 Md. 412, 423, 872 A.2d 735 (2005) (\u201cIn enforcing ... the FAA, however, state courts are not bound by the federal procedural provisions of the FAA ... but may generally apply their own procedures.\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In fact, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>United States Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[t]he FAA contains no express pre-emptive provision, nor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration.\u201d <em>Volt Info. Sciences, Inc. v. Bd. of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., </em>489 U.S. 468, 477, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 108 L.Ed.2d 488 (1989) (citation omitted). Instead, \u201cstate law may ... be pre-empted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law\u2014that is, to the extent that it \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941)).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Therefore, in order for the PMs to prevail on their argument, it must be evident that application of the Maryland standard of review would not only serve to frustrate the underlying goals of the FAA, but would also result in a failure to carry out the arbitration provision of the MSA as the parties had intended. Application of the Maryland standard of review does neither. As the PMs recognize in their briefs and as we shall further explain below, \u201c[t]he Maryland arbitration statute is virtually identical in substance to the FAA,\u201d and would also promote the goal of enforcing arbitration agreements. (Citation omitted). <em>See Hall St. Assocs., L.L.C. v.

Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">A. Partial Settlement Award</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Maryland first argues that \u201cthe Panel exceeded its powers when it amended the MSA without Maryland\u2019s consent,\u201d by ratifying the Term Sheet and by issuing the Partial Settlement Award. According to Maryland, the Partial Settlement Award \u201cimpermissibly allowed the contested Term Sheet States to bypass a diligence inquiry and treated them as not subject to the NPM Adjustment.\u201d Maryland further contends that, in ruling as it did, the Panel\u2019s actions \u201cconflicted with rules of conduct and ethics for arbitrators\u201d and \u201cdetrimentally affected Maryland.\u201d Accordingly, Maryland argues that the circuit court erred in refusing to vacate the Partial Settlement Award, and it now urges us to reverse that judgment and remand with instructions to have the Independent Auditor \u201ctreat all of the Term Sheet States [whose diligence was contested] as non-diligent for the purpose of calculating Maryland\u2019s NPM Adjustment liability for 2003.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>In response, the PMs aver that \u201cthe circuit court correctly held that the Panel did not exceed its powers in entering the [Partial] Settlement Award\u2019s <em>pro rata </em>judgment-reduction ruling,\u201d and its decision \u201cfurthered the strong policy in favor of settlements.\u201d According to the PMs, the court acted properly in applying the FAA standard and finding that the Panel not only had jurisdiction to interpret the MSA, but also acted in good faith in issuing the Partial Settlement Award.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Alternatively, the PMs contend that, even when reviewed under Maryland\u2019s standard, \u201cthe Panel\u2019s <em>pro rata </em>judgment-reduction ruling was also a rational interpretation of the MSA.\u201d In that regard, the PMs argue that \u201cMSA \u00a7 IX(d)(2) simply does not say what [Maryland] alleges[;]\u201d rather, they insist that the Panel\u2019s interpretation was warranted because \u201c\u00a7 IX(d)(2) does not \u2018directly speak\u2019 to, and is indeed \u2018silent on,\u2019 the proper method for reallocating the NPM Adjustment after a partial settlement.\u201d Finally, the PMs contend that Maryland waived its argument because it vehemently opposed the Panel\u2019s adoption of the proportionate fault judgment-reduction method, which would have allowed the Panel to conduct diligence hearings for any Term Sheet States.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In its reply brief, Maryland argues that the PMs\u2019 argument \u201cbegins at the wrong place.\u201d We agree. As Maryland stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">The [PMs\u2019] argument takes as its starting point a presumption that the Panel was confronted with a need to fashion an appropriate method of judgment reduction due to an absence of guidance from the MSA. Leaping from that faulty premise, they would ask this Court to determine that the Panel\u2019s choice of a <em>pro rata </em>methodology was, in that context, a rational one. However, the issue raised in this appeal is not whether the Panel made the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>selection among available judgment reduction methodologies, but whether it was empowered to look outside the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">MSA to find a judgment reduction methodology at all. (Internal citations omitted). Our analysis begins with the MSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">MSA \u00a7 XI(c) provides that \u201c[a]ny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to calculations performed by, or any determinations made by, the Independent Auditor ... shall be submitted to binding arbitration before a panel of three neutral arbitrators\u201d in an arbitration governed by the FAA. The Supreme Court has stated that, in order \u201c[t]o resolve disputes about the application of a[n] ... agreement, an arbitrator must find facts\u201d and is free to \u201cinterpret[ ] ... the contract.\u201d <em>United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union, AFL-CIO v.

Stated differently, by ratifying the Proposed Stipulated Partial Award and issuing the Partial Settlement Award, the Panel disregarded MSA \u00a7 IX(d)(2)(B), which provides that \u201c[a] Settling State\u2019s Allocated Payment shall not be subject to a NPM Adjustment ... if such Settling State continuously had a Qualifying Statute ... <em>and diligently enforced </em>the provisions of such statute during such entire calendar year.\u201d (Emphasis added).

But, in this case, certain Term Sheet States\u2019 Allocated Payments were deemed not subject to an NPM Adjustment even though the Panel never found that such states diligently enforced their respective Qualifying Statutes. As such, the Panel\u2019s error did not lie simply in reallocating the 2003 NPM Adjustment and in doing so according to the <em>pro rata </em>method of judgment reduction;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> its error was in doing both before determining the diligence of all contested states.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">We agree with the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania that \u201c[although the MSA does not address the effect of a partial settlement on the reallocation, it is not ambiguous.\u201d <em>Com. ex rel. Kane, </em>114 A.3d at 62. Indeed, the PMs\u2019 main contention is not that the MSA was ambiguous; rather, they argue in large part that the Panel properly issued the Partial Settlement Award because the MSA was silent on how to reallocate the NPM Adjustment \u201cwhere only some parties settle and consent.\u201d We have previously recognized, however, that \u201c[a] contract\u2019s silence on a particular issue does not, by itself, create ambiguity as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Azat v. Farruggio, </em>162 MdApp. 539, 551, 875 A.2d 778 (2005) (citing Richard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>A. Lord, <em>Williston on Contracts, </em>\u00a7 30.4 at 47-51 (4th ed. 1999)). Silence creates ambiguity only \u201cwhen it involves a matter naturally within the scope of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Here, although the MSA was silent on the effect of a partial settlement regarding the NPM Adjustment, that settlement\u2014or Term Sheet\u2014was not a matter naturally within the scope of the MSA and, thus, did not create an ambiguity. As such, the Panel was not empowered to bypass the diligence determination in reallocating the NPM Adjustment. <em>See Com. ex rel. Kane, </em>114 A.3d at 63 (\u201cRegardless of who bore the burden, relief from the NPM Adjustment and Reallocation Provision depended on a determination of diligence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Likewise, the Panel erred in concluding: \u201cWhere multiple parties have a potential shared contractual obligation and some of them settle and some do not, the non-settling parties cannot necessarily block the settlement.\u201d Although \u201c[t]he general rule ... is that a non-settling party does not have standing to object to a settlement between other parties,\u201d as the Panel noted, that rule cannot apply in cases such as this, where the settlement <em>(i.e., </em>Term Sheet) went against the provisions of an underlying agreement <em>(i.e., </em>MSA) involving both the settling and non-settling parties <em>(i.e., </em>Term Sheet and Non-Term Sheet States, respectively). By issuing the Partial Settlement Award, the Panel violated MSA \u00a7 XVIIRj), which governs \u201cAmendment and Waiver,\u201d and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">This Agreement may be amended by a written instrument executed by all Participating Manufacturers affected by the amendment and by all Settling States affected by the amendment. The terms of any such amendment shall not be enforceable in any Settling State that is not a signatory to such amendment. The waiver of any rights conferred hereunder shall be effective only if made by written instrument executed by the waiving party or parties. The waiver by any party of any breach of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of any other breach, whether prior, subsequent or contemporaneous, nor shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>such waiver be deemed to be or construed as a waiver by any other party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">As Maryland correctly notes, the Panel\u2019s Partial Settlement Award \u201cimposed an unauthorized amendment to the MSA by changing the MSA\u2019s method for reallocating the NPM Adjustment among states that did not prove their diligence.\u201d <em>See Com. ex rel. Kane, </em>114 A.3d at 63 (\u201cBy treating the Term Sheet States as diligent and allowing them to shift their share of the reallocation, the panel departed from the MSA\u2019s clear terms and \u2018amended\u2019 the MSA without agreement of \u2018all\u2019 parties \u2018affected by the amendment.\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, the Panel erred in concluding that the Partial Settlement Award and the Term Sheet \u201cdo not legally prejudice or adversely affect\u201d the Non-Term Sheet States. And, we need not engage in speculation as to how much Maryland stands to gain or lose to determine that it and the other non-diligent, Non-Term Sheet States were adversely affected by the Panel\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The PMs place great weight on the fact that no Settling State contested the diligence of other Settling States. Their argument, however, is flawed because it assumes that a Term Sheet State whose diligence had been contested by another Settling State would have benefited by a diligence determination by the Panel. But, we do not know whether such Term Sheet State would have been found diligent, as was the case with Term Sheet States whose diligence was contested by the PMs, but were deemed not subject to the 2003 NPM Adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">In sum, the Panel exceeded its powers, in violation of CJP \u00a7 3-224(b)(3), when it reallocated the 2003 NPM Adjustment without first determining the diligence of all contested states. Not only did the Panel lack jurisdiction to issue the Partial Settlement Award pursuant to MSA \u00a7 XVIIKj), its decision lacked rationality in light of MSA \u00a7 IX(d)(2)(B). In turn, the circuit court erred in affirming the Panel\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">In order to bring the Partial Settlement Award in line with the MSA, we now grant Maryland\u2019s request and reverse the circuit court\u2019s denial of Maryland\u2019s Petition to Vacate Arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>tion Award. We remand the case to the circuit court so that it may vacate the Partial Settlement Award and instruct the Independent Auditor to treat the 20 Term Sheet States, whose diligence was contested but not determined,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> as non-diligent, when reallocating the 2003 NPM Adjustment. As Maryland states, \u201cgiven that the arbitration was closed,\u201d this is \u201cthe only possible remedy at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">B. Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Next, Maryland argues that \u201cthe Panel\u2019s Final Award should be vacated because the Panel\u2019s refusal to hear material evidence deprived Maryland of a full and fair hearing.\u201d Specifically, Maryland avers that in implementing the Partial Settlement Award, the Panel \u201crefus[ed] to allow Maryland and other states to put at issue the diligence of the contested Term Sheet States,\u201d but later \u201cconsidered the evidence regarding all of the states for which it made diligence determinations when the Panel rendered its [diligence] decisions.\u201d Acknowledging that it did not advocate comparative diligence determinations nor attempt to introduce evidence regarding the diligence of other states, Maryland contends that \u201conce the Panel [decided] to engage in a comparative analysis, and actually did so in the context of an arbitration governed by the ARA, it was improper\u2014and beyond any legitimate justification\u2014for the Panel to refuse to hear material evidence regarding the contested Term Sheet States.\u201d As such, Maryland argues that the circuit court erred failing to' vacate the Final Award.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In response, the PMs argue that the circuit court correctly held that the Panel did not commit evidentiary misconduct and properly refused to vacate the Final Award. In making their argument, the PMs emphasize that: (1) \u201cMaryland never requested, and actively opposed, [a] comparative state analysis;\u201d (2) the Panel found Maryland to be non-diligent \u201cbased solely on an objective analysis of state-specific circumstances\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>and \u201cnot on a relative analysis that compared [Maryland] against other contested states;\u201d and (3) Maryland fails to demonstrate that any prejudice occurred as a result of the Panel\u2019s alleged error. Applying the vacatur standards of the FAA, the PMs assert that the circuit court properly denied Maryland\u2019s Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award Finding that [Maryland] Did Not Diligently Enforce its Qualifying Statute During 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Following the motions hearing in this case, the circuit court found that the Panel did not refuse to hear pertinent and material evidence as Maryland alleged. In pertinent part, the court reasoned that Maryland never requested the Panel to consider the enforcement record of all contested Term Sheet States; that the Panel\u2019s diligence determination focused on the objective standard; and that \u201c[e]ven if some, most or all of the \u2018term sheet states\u2019 were less diligent than Maryland, from the facts there is no guarantee that the Panel would have found Maryland to be diligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Although the circuit court erred in applying the FAA\u2019s vacatur standards in issuing its ruling, we ultimately reach the same conclusion after applying the Maryland standard of review. Initially, we note that, as we are remanding the case with instructions for the Independent Auditor to consider all contested Term Sheet States as non-diligent, Maryland will already receive part of the relief it seeks when the 2003 NPM Adjustment is reallocated among a larger number of non-diligent states. But, to the extent that Maryland challenges the Panel\u2019s finding that Maryland was not diligent in enforcing its Qualifying Statute, we perceive no error on the Panel\u2019s part and, accordingly, affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">As previously mentioned, CJP \u00a7 3-224(b)(4) authorizes courts to vacate an arbitral award when the arbitrators \u201crefused to hear evidence material to the controversy ... as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party.\u201d \u201cThe party challenging the arbitration award bears the burden of proving the existence of one of the grounds for vacating it.\u201d <em>Mandl, supra, </em>159 Md.App. at 86, 858 A.2d 508 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The question we must address on appeal, then, is whether, on the facts, the Panel \u201cas a matter of law improperly refused to hear evidence material to the parties\u2019 controversy, to the substantial prejudice of [Maryland\u2019s] rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91-92, 858 A.2d 508 (citing CJP \u00a7 3-224(b)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Citing the ARA and the Panel\u2019s July 1, 2011 order regarding burden of proof, Maryland contends that \u201c[t]he Panel\u2019s failure to hear the contested Term Sheet States\u2019 enforcement records violated the Panel\u2019s own prior orders and Maryland\u2019s legitimate contract expectations.\u201d In particular, Maryland looks to the Panel\u2019s statement that \u201c \u2018the reallocation provisions of the MSA do not apply unless and until diligent enforcement determinations are made for those states <em>whose diligence is contested by either the [PMs] or the states,\u2019\u201d </em>(emphasis added by Maryland), as well as the following ARA provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">The Arbitration panel shall <em>not </em>disclose or otherwise make known its determinations as to whether any Settling State diligently enforced a Qualifying Statute during 2003 until after the conclusion of <em>the presentation of all evidence </em>and written or oral argument in the Arbitration proceeding with respect to the diligent enforcement of <em>all Settling States that join the arbitration </em>by the date that the third arbitrator is selected and whose diligent enforcement the Signatory PMs contested in the Arbitration----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">ARA \u00a7 2(i) (emphasis added by Maryland).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Maryland\u2019s reliance on those statements, however, is misplaced because in issuing the Partial Settlement Award, the Panel believed (albeit mistakenly) that diligent enforcement determinations had already been made for all contested states. More importantly, those statements do not provide support for Maryland\u2019s assertion that \u201conce the Panel [decided] to engage in a comparative analysis, ... it was improper ... for the Panel to refuse to hear material evidence regarding the contested Term Sheet States.\u201d Nothing in the record reflects that the parties to the ARA and the Panel agreed to employ a comparative method in determining each state\u2019s diligence; nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>does Maryland point to any case law to indicate that such was the proper procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Overall, Maryland failed to meet its burden of proving that the Panel refused to hear evidence material to the controversy, to the substantial prejudice of Maryland\u2019s rights, when the Panel found that Maryland was not diligent in enforcing its Qualifying Statute. We agree with the circuit court that \u201cthe Panel\u2019s diligence determination focused on the objective standard and assessing diligence that was common to all states, and then applying that standard to each State\u2019s individual enforcement for 2003.\u201d It was not irrational for the Panel to do so. <em>See Downey, supra, </em>428 Md. at 258, 51 A.3d 573; <em>Snyder, supra, </em>79 Md.App. at 37, 555 A.2d 523. As the Panel explained in its Final Award for Maryland, \u201c[i]t is ... not a useful exercise, or even valid, to compare the decision as to one State against the decision as to another\u201d because the Panel considered the various factors relating to diligence \u201cin the over-all [sic] context of a Settling State\u2019s existing policies and circumstances in 2003.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Furthermore, based on the record, there was enough evidence to support the Panel\u2019s finding of non-diligence on Maryland\u2019s part. Assessing Maryland based on the eight relevant factors, the Panel first noted that Maryland\u2019s collection rate of 47% for 2003 was less than its rates in the year before (75.4%) and after (55.3%). Second, the Panel stated that although \u201c[e]scrow was not paid on 68.2 million NPM cigarettes sold in 2002\u201d and \u201cMaryland identified lawsuits as being an important part of the enforcement effort,\u201d it \u201cfiled only one lawsuit in 2003.\u201d Third, with regard to gathering reliable data, the Panel found that Maryland \u201creceived little help and insufficient sales data from the Comptroller\u2019s Office, which basically was a non-participant in enforcement efforts.\u201d Fourth, the Panel determined that \u201cMaryland\u2019s enforcement efforts were seriously hampered by lack of sufficiently] committed and trained personnel.\u201d Fifth, the Panel noted that although Maryland may have been well-positioned for diligent enforcement in 2004, its efforts were \u201cnot enough to credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Maryland for an \u2018ongoing and intentional consideration of the requirements of a State\u2019s Qualifying Statute.\u2019 \u201d Sixth, the Panel recognized that \u201c[although Maryland passed its Qualifying Statute and Complementary Legislation in a timely manner, it did little to implement it until ... toward the end of 2003.\u201d Seventh, the Panel concluded that Maryland\u2019s record in the area of \u201cActions Short of Legislation\u201d was \u201cextremely poor.\u201d For example, \u201cit conducted no desk or field audits,\u201d \u201cconducted retail inspections for state excise tax but none for escrow compliance,\u201d and \u201csent notice letters, but only two demand letters were sent to non-compliant NPMs.\u201d Lastly, the Panel found \u201clittle, if any, information\u201d about the eighth factor, \u201cEfforts to be Aware of NAAG and Other States\u2019 Enforcement Efforts.\u201d As \u201cfactual findings by an arbitrator are virtually immune from challenge,\u201d <em>Mandl, </em>159 Md.App. at 92, 858 A.2d 508, we cannot say that the circuit court erred in refusing to vacate the Panel\u2019s finding of non-diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Finally, we agree with the circuit court that \u201c[e]ven if some, most or all of the \u2018term sheet states\u2019 were less diligent than Maryland, from the facts there is no guarantee that the Panel would have found Maryland to be diligent.\u201d As the PMs state in their brief, Maryland \u201cfailed to identify adequate evidence that it would have benefited from a comparison to the contested [Term Sheet] States,\u201d because the most that Maryland can assert is that \u201csome \u2018evidence ... suggests that the contested [Term Sheet] States would not have compared favorably.\u2019 \u201d The use of such conclusory statements, however, is inadequate to show substantial prejudice. <em>See, e.g., Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Garrett, </em>343 Md. 500, 525, 682 A.2d 1143 (1996) (stating that \u201cconclusory allegations\u201d of prejudice are \u201ccertainly not sufficient\u201d); <em>Forensic Advisors, Inc. v.

Acc. Ins. Co. v. Scott, </em>107 Md.App. 603, 616, 669 A.2d 773 (1996) (stating that \u201cconclusory allegations\u201d are \u201cinsufficient, as a matter of law, to raise a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>genuine dispute as to whether [a party] suffered actual prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">C. State-Specific Arbitration</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Finally, Maryland argues that the circuit court erred in denying Maryland\u2019s motion to compel state-specific arbitration. First, Maryland contends that pursuant to the plain meaning of the MSA, Maryland, by itself, constitutes a single \u201cside\u201d to the dispute to be submitted to arbitration, \u201cwith at least the [PMs], and perhaps other states, on the other side.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Next, Maryland avers that \u201c[n]othing in ... the MSA\u2019s arbitration clause, or any other provision of the MSA, can reasonably be read to require [a multi-state arbitration].\u201d Similarly, Maryland argues that although this Court, in <em>Philip Morris Inc., supra, </em>179 Md.App. 140, 944 A.2d 1167, held that Maryland must arbitrate the dispute over the 2003 NPM Adjustment, we did not decide \u201cwhether [Maryland] was required to arbitrate that dispute in a multi-state proceeding.\u201d Lastly, Maryland contends that \u201cthe public interest supports a Maryland-specific arbitration\u201d as it would \u201censur[e] that a panel of arbitrators could give their attention to Maryland\u2019s enforcement of [its] statute\u201d and \u201cMaryland\u2019s interest in defending its practices would no longer be frustrated by the need to compromise with other states that have different interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In response, the PMs contend that the circuit court acted properly in denying Maryland\u2019s motion for a state-specific arbitration. According to the PMs, \u201cthis Court in Philip Morris ... already decided that the MSA requires NPM Adjustment disputes ... to be arbitrated in a nationwide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>arbitration.\u201d In addition, the PMs argue that \u201cthe MSA\u2019s text, its structure, and extensive, uniform authority from other [jurisdictions] ... all confirm the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d Lastly, the PMs aver that Maryland\u2019s policy argument is \u201cirrelevant and meritless\u201d because it does not explain how \u201cthe myriad proceedings necessary to determine the diligence of each of the other 27 States would function more equitably than a nationwide arbitration.\u201d We agree with the PMs.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In <em>Philip Morris, Inc., </em>179 Md.App. at 162-63, 944 A.2d 1167, we determined that the structure of the MSA requires arbitration due, in part, to the \u201c[n]eed for uniformity:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">The State contends that \u201c[a] nationwide arbitration concerning the diligence of [fifty-two] states and territories in enforcing their own laws might well represent the ultimate in \u2018chaos.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">The State, however, cannot explain how a proceeding that is subject to one final and binding determination would be less workable or expeditious than litigating the issue fifty-two times in fifty-two separate court systems with the imminent possibility of delays and appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">The MSA\u2019s payment structure is nationwide and unitary. The independent auditor calculates and determines the participating manufacturers\u2019 annual payments and then allocates those funds among the settling states. In the case of diligent enforcement, a single decision-maker is vitally important because the determination for one state affects every other settling state pursuant to \u00a7 IX(d)(2)(C)\u2019s \u201creallocation\u201d provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">The question of diligent enforcement cannot be made in a vacuum. We concur with the numerous jurisdictions that have held that the present dispute must be resolved under one clear set of rules that apply with equal force to every settling state. We find the rationale of the Superior Court of Connecticut particularly compelling:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">The problem is even more acute, however, when the resolution of a dispute as to calculations and determinations by the Independent Auditor will necessarily have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>different effects on different Settling States. Unless such disputes are presented to and decided by tribunals that have the power to hear from and bind each affected Settling State as a party, great mischief can be done and substantial unfairness can result. Where, for example, as in this case, it is claimed that an individual Settling State is exempt from the NPM Adjustment for a given year because it diligently enforced a Model Statute that was in full force and effect throughout that year, the decision of the tribunal deciding that issue will not only affect the interests of the Settling State seeking to qualify for the exemption, but those of all other Settling States as well. This is so because the granting of an exemption to one Settling State will inexorably lead to the reallocation of its allocated portion of the NPM Adjustment to all other nonexempt Settling States. Each Settling State thus has a vital interest in the granting or denial of each other Settling State\u2019s individual claim for exemption, and for obvious reasons, their interests are conflicting. Submitting such a dispute to a neutral panel of competent arbitrators affords all interested parties the right to be heard on a level playing field where no interested party enjoys an apparent home-field advantage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><em>Connecticut v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>279 Conn. 785, 905 A.2d 42, 50-51 (2006)....</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Although Maryland is correct that this Court\u2019s original opinion included language that more definitively supported a requirement that Maryland participate in multi-state arbitration, and that such language was removed pursuant to Maryland\u2019s motion to reconsider, the final version of our opinion clearly still contemplated a single, nationwide arbitration.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To the extent that we previously did not hold as such, we do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">First, there is no merit to Maryland\u2019s argument that, when considering the terms of the MSA, Maryland constitutes a single \u201cside\u201d to the dispute to be submitted to arbitration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\u201cwith at least the [PMs], and perhaps other states, on the other side.\u201d When the Panel convened to hear this matter, the parties agreed that the dispute centered on whether the PMs were entitled to the 2003 NPM Adjustment. Particularly, \u201cthe participating manufacturers requested that the auditor apply the 2003 NPM Adjustment to their April 2006 payments. Maryland and the other settling states, however, urged the auditor to deny the NPM Adjustment on the ground that the settling states \u2018diligently enforced\u2019 their qualifying statutes.\u201d <em>Philip Morris Inc., </em>179 Md.App. at 148, 944 A.2d 1167. Thus, the circuit court correctly recognized the \u201ctwo sides to the dispute\u201d to be \u201cthe MSA States in opposition to the downward adjustment, and the PMs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Next, in addition to our previous determination that having \u201ca single decision-maker is vitally important\u201d in light of the MSA\u2019s \u201cnationwide and unitary\u201d payment structure, <em>id. </em>at 162, 944 A.2d 1167, Maryland\u2019s proposed state-specific arbitration would not necessarily advance the public interest. As the PMs point out, \u201cevery State would have an interest in the decision on diligence for every other state\u201d and in each state-specific proceeding, \u201cup to 27 other States would need to intervene to protect their interest, which would multiply exponentially the cost, complexity, and burden of resolving the 2004 NPM Adjustment dispute.\u201d This would have a tremendous effect on all parties, especially the SPMs, which are smaller companies with more limited resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Lastly, our holding is supported by courts in other jurisdictions. <em>See McGraw v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>224 W.Va. 211, 681 S.E.2d 96, 112 (2009) (\u201cAll courts addressing arguments ... against the requirement of a single, nationwide arbitration of the diligent enforcement determination have consistently and logically rejected the same. Both the structure and plain meaning of the MSA require a uniform determination of this issue due to the impact the determination relevant to one settling state will have upon all other settling states.\u201d); <em>State, ex rel. Carter v. Philip Morris Tobacco Co., </em>879 N.E.2d 1212, 1220 (Ind.Ct.App.2008) (\u201cBoth the language and the structure of the MSA require that the dispute concerning the 2003 NPM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Adjustment, including the Settling States\u2019 claims of diligent enforcement of their Qualifying Statutes, must be submitted to a single, national arbitration panel.\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Riley v. Lorillard Tobacco Co., </em>1 So.3d 1, 14 (Ala.2008) (\u201cwe conclude that the agreement requires a national, as opposed to a local, arbitration proceeding\u201d); <em>State v.

We agree.\u201d) (Citation omitted); <em>State v. Phillip Morris, Inc., </em>279 Conn. 785, 905 A.2d 42, 51 n. 12 (2006) (noting that the language of the MSA \u201cenvisions that the settling states would select one arbitrator and the participating manufacturers would select one arbitrator\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>State of N.M. ex rel.

Philip Morris Inc., </em>51 A.D.3d 523, 858 N.Y.S.2d 134 (2008) (\u201cThis Court rejected ... arguments that each Settling State constituted a \u2018side\u2019 to the dispute, under section XI (c) of the Master Settlement Agreement, with the right to select its own arbitrator\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>People v. Lorillard Tobacco Co., </em>372 Ill.App.3d 190, 310 Ill.Dec. 222, 865 N.E.2d 546, 554 (2007) (\u201cMoreover, we agree with those courts before us that have pointed out the \u2018compelling logic to having these disputes handled by a single arbitration panel of three federal judges, rather than numerous state and territorial courts.\u2019 \u201d) (Citation omitted). Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in denying Maryland\u2019s motion to compel a state-specific arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s denial of Maryland\u2019s Petition to Vacate Arbitration, and affirm its denial of Maryland\u2019s Motion to Compel a Maryland-Specific Arbitration on the Issue of Whether Maryland Diligently Enforced during 2004 and Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award Finding that [Maryland] Did Not Diligently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Enforce its Qualifying Statute During 2003.

In its brief, Maryland asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">1) Did the Arbitration Panel exceed its authority when it approved a side agreement between the Participating Manufacturers and the Term Sheet States that altered the MSA\u2019s reallocation provision, where the MSA prohibits amendments absent specific agreement by all affected parties, Maryland and other parties to the MSA expressly objected to the Panel's approval of the side agreement, and the Panel\u2019s approval of the side agreement operated to the substantial detriment of Maryland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">2) Did the Arbitration Panel refuse to consider material evidence related to the enforcement efforts of the contested Term Sheet States, given that all of the states had entered an agreement for a national <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>arbitration to determine, in one proceeding, the diligence of each of the states?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">3) Did the circuit court err in failing to order the Participating Manufacturers to arbitrate in a Maryland-specific proceeding their claim that Maryland did not diligently enforce the provisions of its Qualifying Statute during 2004, in light of the terms of the MSA and the prejudice Maryland experienced in the multi-state arbitration for 2003?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\">. The Panel consisted of Judge William G. Bassler, selected by the PMs; Judge Abner J. Mikva, selected by the Settling States; and Judge Fern M. Smith, selected by Judges Bassler and Mikva.

The Partial Settlement Award largely tracked the Proposed Stipulated Partial Award, with one significant addition\u2014namely that the \u201crelief, if any,\u201d for objecting states that believe they are negatively affected by the Partial Settlement Award, would be an \"appeal to their individual MSA court.\u201d Maryland\u2019s MSA court is the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\">.
