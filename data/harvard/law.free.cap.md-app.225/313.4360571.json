The Commissioner found that CashCall had arranged, from 2006 to 2010, more than 5,000 loans for Maryland consumers, loans which were issued by two federally insured out-of-state banks, at interest rates significantly greater than the rates permitted by Maryland law. Then, three days after the issuance of each and every loan, CashCall, pursuant to an agreement it had with each of the two out-of-state banks, promptly purchased the loan from the issuing bank and thereafter collected all payments, interest, and fees due on that loan from the borrowing Maryland consumer. Concluding that CashCall and Reddam had engaged in the \u201ccredit services business\u201d without a license to do so and without complying with any of Maryland\u2019s remedial statutes governing such enterprises, the Commissioner ordered appellees to cease and desist from such activities and imposed upon them a civil penalty for each of the more than 5,000 loans they had arranged for interested Maryland consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Vigorously disagreeing with the Commissioner\u2019s assessment of its business activities in Maryland, CashCall petitioned the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for judicial review. Before that court, as it did before the Commissioner, CashCall insisted that, at no time, during its marketing, facilitation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>ultimate acquisition of the loans it arranged, was it acting as a \u201ccredit services business,\u201d as defined by the MCSBA, because it never received any compensation \u201cdirectly\u201d from a Maryland consumer for its services and, therefore, under extant Maryland caselaw, did not qualify as such a business. The Baltimore City circuit court agreed and reversed the Commissioner\u2019s order, prompting the Commissioner to note this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Because we believe that the Commissioner was correct in concluding that CashCall was a \u201ccredit services business,\u201d under the MCSBA, we shall reverse the decision of the circuit court and remand for that court to affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">CashCall, a California corporation, and its president and sole share-holder, John Paul Reddam, were engaged in the business of marketing small loans, through a range of media outlets, to Maryland consumers. The loans were to be issued, at interest rates significantly greater than those permitted by Maryland law, by two federally insured out-of-state banks: First Bank &amp; Trust, a South Dakota-chartered state bank; and First Bank of Delaware, a chartered bank of that state. Three types of loans were offered by CashCall to interested Marylanders: a loan of $5,025 at an annual interest rate of 59%; a loan of $2,600 at an annual interest rate of 96%; and a loan of $1,025 at an annual interest rate of 89%. From January of 2006 through the end of 2010, CashCall arranged 5,651 such loans for Maryland consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">CashCall\u2019s advertisements directed interested Maryland consumers to its website where they could obtain a loan application and instructions on how to complete that form. They also provided a telephone number that consumers could call to obtain assistance in filling out the website\u2019s loan application. And, once a loan application was completed by an interested Maryland consumer, CashCall would forward that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>application to one of the two federally insured out-of-state banks for approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Once the application was approved by one of the two banks, that bank would disburse the loan to the consumer, though subtracted from the amount of the loan was an \u201corigination fee,\u201d that is, \u201ca fee charged by a lender for preparing and processing a loan.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Illustratively, for an approved loan of $2,600, the Maryland consumer received only $2,525 from the bank, that is, the loan amount less a $75 origination fee. The consumer was then to pay the bank, or whomever thereafter held the loan, $2,600, the origination fee having been rolled into the loan amount, plus interest. Thus, the consumer ultimately paid the origination fee as he or she repaid the loan in monthly installments to whomever held the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">After the loan was made, CashCall, under the contract it had entered into with each of the two out-of-state banks, would promptly purchase the loan from the issuing bank. Although its initial contracts with the two banks required CashCall to purchase the loan \u201con the same business day\u201d that the loan was issued, those agreements were later amended to grant CashCall three days to purchase the loan after it was disbursed to the consumer. The purchase price for each loan, as noted, was the amount of the loan actually received by the consumer plus the origination fee. Thus, for the $2,600 consumer loan described earlier, CashCall would purchase the loan from the bank for $2,600\u2014that figure comprised the $2,525 actually loaned to the consumer plus the $75 \u201corigination fee\u201d to be paid by the consumer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The banks, in turn, paid CashCall a \u201croyalty fee\u201d of between $5.00 and $72.22 per loan, depending on the amount of the loan and which of the two out-of-state banks had made the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Upon purchasing a loan, CashCall acquired the right to enforce the loan\u2019s terms and to collect the payments that were to be made by the borrowing consumer under the terms of the loan, including all interest, penalties, and fees. Indeed, if a consumer mistakenly sent a loan payment to the bank, rather than to CashCall, after CashCall had purchased the loan, the bank was, pursuant to its contract with CashCall, obligated to \u201cpromptly\u201d forward that payment to CashCall.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Thus a Maryland consumer, who used CashCall to obtain such a loan, never paid any loan payments or, for that matter, any fees or other payments of any nature, to the out-of-state bank that initially issued the loan, but, instead, made all such payments directly to CashCall. That meant, in making loan payments to CashCall, the consumer paid CashCall the origination fee, which had been \u201crolled into\u201d the amount of the loan, a fact that will play a role in our pending analysis of whether CashCall was a \u201ccredit services business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">From 2007 to 2009, the Commissioner received complaints from fourteen Maryland consumers \u201cconcerning high-interest loans which [CashCall] arranged for them\u201d and its \u201ccollection activities\u201d with respect to those loans. At the hearing that was held before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) on this matter, testimony was provided that showed that the consumers, who contacted CashCall seeking a loan, were often responding to difficult and pressing situations, such as loss of employment or the death of a family member. Moreover, in the words of the ALJ who presided over that hearing, the \u201cborrowers who availed themselves of CashCall\u2019s services\u201d were \u201cpushed to borrow more than they wanted\u201d by CashCall, encountered \u201cserious difficulty in determining a payoff amount\u201d when they sought to pay off their loans early, and were \u201cunable to extricate themselves from the burden of the debts they had incurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">On June 23, 2009, after investigating CashCall\u2019s business activities, the Commissioner issued a summary order<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> direct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ing CashCall to, among other things, \u201ccease and desist\u201d from engaging in its current business activities in Maryland, which, in the Commissioner\u2019s view, amounted to the unlicensed provision of \u201ccredit services.\u201d In response to that preliminary order, CashCall requested a hearing in the Office of Administrative Hearings. After that request was granted, the aforementioned hearing was held before an ALJ. And, following that hearing, the ALJ issued, on December 3, 2010, a \u201cproposed decision,\u201d recommending that the Commissioner find that CashCall had violated the MCSBA and the Maryland Consumer Loan Law by engaging in the credit services business without a license to do so, that the Commissioner issue a final cease and desist order prohibiting CashCall from operating a \u201ccredit services business\u201d in Maryland, and that Cash-Call be directed to pay a civil penalty for each of the 5,651 loans it had assisted consumers in obtaining. Then, generously treating each of the 5,651 loans as a \u201cfirst offense,\u201d rather than as a \u201csecond\u201d or \u201csubsequent offense,\u201d the ALJ suggested that CashCall be ordered to pay a penalty of $1,000 per loan<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for a total civil penalty of $5,651,000. On January 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>2011, the Commissioner issued a \u201cproposed order\u201d adopting those recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">CashCall thereafter filed exceptions to the Commissioner\u2019s \u201cproposed order.\u201d The hearing on those exceptions, however, was subsequently stayed, at CashCall\u2019s request, pending the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>427 Md. 128, 46 A.3d 443 (2012). When that decision was issued, the stay was lifted and a hearing was held before the Commissioner on November 8, 2012. Upon the conclusion of that hearing, the Commissioner issued a \u201cfinal order,\u201d requiring both CashCall and Reddam to cease and desist from engaging in \u201ccredit services business\u201d activities in Maryland, and he imposed a civil penalty of $5,651,000, for which appel-lees were jointly and severally liable. On December 7, 2012, CashCall\u2014but not Reddam\u2014filed a petition for judicial review and a motion to stay enforcement of the Commissioner\u2019s order in the Baltimore City circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Four months later, on April 11, 2013, CashCall and Reddam filed an amended petition for judicial review, adding Reddam as a petitioner. The circuit court, however, dismissed their joint petition as \u201cuntimely.\u201d That ruling, in effect, eliminated Reddam as a party to the judicial-review proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">After observing that CashCall \u201cmay very well\u201d be a \u201cpredatory entity preying on\u201d Maryland consumers that has \u201cdeveloped a scheme to evade the usury laws of Maryland,\u201d the circuit court nonetheless reversed the Commissioner\u2019s final order, declaring that, under the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Gomez, </em>CashCall was not a \u201ccredit services business,\u201d under the MCSBA and therefore was not required to comply with the terms of that act. A supplemental order was thereafter issued by that court to make it clear that its reversal of the Commissioner\u2019s final order pertained only to CashCall and not Reddam, as Reddam was not a party to the original and only extant petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The Commissioner then noted an appeal from that decision, which was followed by a cross-appeal filed by CashCall and Reddam, challenging the court\u2019s dismissal of their amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>petition for judicial review and the scope of its order reversing the Commissioner\u2019s decision. That cross-appeal, however, does not merit further discussion as the issues it raises are rendered moot by our holding that CashCall did, in fact, violate the MCSBA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">It is undisputed that CashCall was assisting Maryland consumers to obtain loans from the two federally insured out-of-state banks. The Commissioner therefore contends that he was correct in determining that CashCall was operating as an unlicensed \u201ccredit services business\u201d in Maryland in violation of the MCSBA. CashCall, of course, claims otherwise. It maintains, and the circuit court agreed, that, under the Court of Appeals\u2019 then recent decision in <em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>427 Md. 128, 46 A.3d 443 (2012), which considered the MCSBA\u2019s definition of a \u201ccredit services business,\u201d CashCall was not a credit services business because it did not receive \u201cdirect payment\u201d from consumers for its services, a requirement CashCall asserts is, under <em>Gomez, </em>a prerequisite for the MCSBA to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u201cIn an appeal from a circuit court\u2019s judicial review of an administrative agency proceeding, we review the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>decision of the agency, not the circuit court.\u201d <em>Md. Dept. of Transp. v. Maddalone, </em>187 Md.App. 549, 571, 979 A.2d 229 (2009). And that review is generally \u201ca narrow and highly deferential inquiry.\u201d <em>McL-Nat. Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Greater Baden-Aquasco Citizens Ass\u2019n, </em>412 Md. 73, 83, 985 A.2d 1160 (2009). Indeed, our review is \u201climited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. Cnty., </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226 (1994). In making that determination, the test we apply is \u201cwhether a reasoning mind could reasonably have reached the conclusion reached by the agency, consistent with a proper application of the controlling legal principles.\u201d <em>HNS Dev., LLC v. People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. Cnty., </em>200 Md.App. 1,14, 24 A.3d 167 (2011) (quotations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Moreover, in reviewing an agency\u2019s conclusions of law, we afford \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d to the \u201cagency\u2019s application of the statutory and regulatory provisions that are regularly administered by the agency,\u201d <em>Md. Bd. of Physicians v. Elliott, </em>170 Md.App. 369, 408, 907 A.2d 321 (2006), though an agency\u2019s construction of a statute \u201cis not entitled to deference ... when it conflicts with the unambiguous statutory language,\u201d <em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>427 Md. 128,170 n. 35, 46 A.3d 443 (2012) (internal citation omitted). In other words, it is \u201calways within our prerogative to determine whether an agency\u2019s conclusions of law are correct.\u201d <em>Crofton Convalescent Ctr. v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>413 Md. 201, 215, 991 A.2d 1257 (2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The MCSBA, in conjunction with the Maryland Consumer Loan Law,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> grants the Commissioner broad licensing, investigatory, and enforcement authority over what the MCSBA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>deems to be a \u201ccredit services business,\u201d a business that is defined by the MCSBA as one in which a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">person [<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] who, with respect to the extension of credit by others, sells, provides, or performs, or represents that such person can or will sell, provide, or perform, any of the following services <em>in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration: </em>... (ii) Obtaining an extension of credit for a consumer; or (iii) Providing advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to [obtaining an extension of credit for a consumer].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Com. Law \u00a7 14\u20141901(e)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The act defines an \u201cextension of credit\u201d as \u201cthe right to defer payment of debt or to incur debt and defer its payment, offered or granted primarily for personal, family, or household purposes,\u201d Com. Law \u00a7 14\u20141901(f), and a \u201cconsumer\u201d as \u201cany individual who is solicited to purchase or who purchases for personal, family, or household purposes the services of a credit services business,\u201d Com. Law \u00a7 14-1901(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The MCSBA requires a \u201ccredit services business\u201d to, among other things, secure a license from the Commissioner, Com. Law \u00a7 14\u20141903(b); maintain a surety bond, Com. Law \u00a7\u00a7 14-1908-1909; and provide an interested Maryland consumer with a written information statement, Com. Law \u00a7\u00a7 14-1904-1905, which describes the duties and obligations of the credit services business (such as the obligation to provide a complete and detailed description of the services to be performed by the credit services business and the total amount the consumer will have to pay for those services) and the rights of the Maryland consumer (such as the right to file a complaint with the Commissioner against a credit services business). It further requires that any contract such a business enters into with a consumer include a statement that the consumer has the right to \u201ccancel th[e] contract at any time prior to mid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>night of the third business day after the date of the transaction.\u201d Com. Law \u00a7 14-1906.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">In assisting a Maryland consumer in obtaining a loan, however, the credit services business may not help a consumer secure a loan with an interest rate that exceeds the maximum interest rates permitted by Maryland law. Under Maryland law, the maximum annual interest rate for a loan of $2,000 or less is 33%, and for a loan greater than $2,000, 24%. Com. Law \u00a7 12\u2014306(a)(6). But\u2014of particular relevance to Cash-Call\u2019s business practices\u2014Maryland limits on interest rates for consumer loans do not apply to federally insured out-of-state banks, and \u201ca federally insured depository institution, whether federal or state-chartered, may charge the interest rate permitted in its home state to borrowers across state lines, regardless of the legal rate in the borrower\u2019s state.\u201d <em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>427 Md. 128, 163, 46 A.3d 443 (2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">But, though federal law permits federally insured out-of-state banks to charge what would otherwise be usurious rates of interest on loans issued to Maryland consumers, the MCSBA prohibits a \u201ccredit services business\u201d from \u201cassisting] a consumer to obtain an extension of credit at a rate of interest which, except for federal preemption of State law, would be prohibited\u201d under state law. Com. Law \u00a7 14-1902(9). That is to say, a credit services business may not, under the MCSBA, assist a consumer in obtaining a loan, from any in-state or out-of-state bank, at an interest rate prohibited by Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">As to whether CashCall was a \u201ccredit services business\u201d under the MCSBA\u2019s definition of that term, both Cash-Call and the Commissioner direct us to the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>427 Md. 128, 46 A.3d 443 (2012). In <em>Gomez, </em>Maryland\u2019s highest court was asked to decide whether a \u201ctax preparer\u201d was acting as a \u201ccredit services business\u201d when, in the course of preparing tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>returns for its clients, it also assisted those clients in obtaining a \u201crefund anticipation loan,\u201d acronymically known as a \u201cRAL.\u201d To provide that service, the tax preparer in <em>Gomez, </em>Jackson Hewitt, had entered into an agreement with a lender, Santa Barbara Bank &amp; Trust (\u201cSBBT\u201d), pursuant to which SBBT would \u201coffer, process and administer,\u201d to Jackson Hewitt customers, a RAL, specifically, a \u201chigh interest loan ... secured by the consumer\u2019s expected income tax refund,\u201d which enables \u201cthe consumer to receive a tax refund roughly ten days sooner than the IRS would deliver it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133-34 &amp; n. 4, 46 A.3d 443. To promote and facilitate such loans, Jackson Hewitt would customarily inform its clients of the availability of these RALs and assist interested clients in filling out applications for those loans. <em>Id. </em>at 134-36, 46 A.3d 443. Upon approving a loan, SBBT paid a \u201cfixed annual fee as well as variable payments tied to growth in the [RAL] Program\u201d to Jackson Hewitt for the \u201cperformance of services\u201d rendered by Jackson Hewitt \u201con behalf of SBBT.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134, 46 A.3d 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">After preparing the federal income tax return of Alicia Gomez, Jackson Hewitt helped her obtain a RAL in accordance with its arrangement with SBBT. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 46 A.3d 443. The loan Gomez received from SBBT had an 85.089% annual interest rate for a total loan amount of $2,323. <em>Id. </em>at 136, 46 A.3d 443. But the bank did not disburse the total amount of the loan to Gomez. <em>Id. </em>It paid to her just $1,950.97 of the $2,323 loan, retaining $88.03 as fees and paying $284 of the loan amount to Jackson Hewitt, the \u201ctax preparation fee,\u201d which Gomez owed Jackson Hewitt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Gomez subsequently brought suit against Jackson Hewitt, contending that Jackson Hewitt was a \u201ccredit services business,\u201d that it was therefore subject to the MCSBA, and that it had violated the MCSBA by arranging her RAL without complying with the duties and obligations imposed by that act on such businesses. <em>Id. </em>at 137-38, 46 A.3d 443. When Jackson Hewitt moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that Jackson Hewitt was not a \u201ccredit services business\u201d and therefore the MCSBA did not apply to it, the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>court granted that motion, a decision that was subsequently affirmed by this Court. <em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>198 Md.App. 87,16 A.3d 261 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Disappointed but undeterred, Gomez then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Court of Appeals, hoping to obtain a more favorable resolution of this issue. That petition, in turn, elicited both a motion to intervene and joint petition for a writ of certiorari from the Commissioner and the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Maryland Attorney General, asking the Court of Appeals to determine whether the MCSBA applied to a tax preparer that facilitates RALs but receives no direct payment from the consumer for that service. <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 132-33 &amp; n. 1-2, 46 A.3d 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Following the grant of those petitions, Gomez, the Consumer Protection Division, and the Commissioner contended, before the Court of Appeals, that the plain language of the MCSBA\u2019s definition of a \u201ccredit services business,\u201d as well as the act\u2019s legislative history, rendered it applicable to Jackson Hewitt. <em>Id. </em>at 142, 46 A.3d 443. Jackson Hewitt responded that it did not qualify as a \u201ccredit services business\u201d because it did not, under the language of the MCSBA, assist Gomez in obtaining a RAL <em>\u201cin return </em>for the payment of money or other valuable consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 46 A.3d 443 (emphasis in original). Rather, it maintained, it was paid, at most, \u201cindirectly\u201d by Gomez when SBBT, after issuing the RAL to Gomez, paid to Jackson Hewitt a portion of the loan amount for its services in preparing Gomez\u2019s tax return. <em>Id. </em>at 136, 46 A.3d 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The Court of Appeals agreed with Jackson Hewitt\u2019s interpretation of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 178, 46 A.3d 443. After quoting the MCSBA, that to be subject to that act, an entity must provide credit services <em>\u201cin return </em>for the payment of money or other valuable consideration,\u201d the Court expounded that, \u201cin the context of the [MjCSBA,\u201d the term \u201c \u2018in return\u2019 can reasonably be understood to envision an exchange of assistance for payment between the consumer and the provider of that assistance and to mean that any payment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>credit services business for such assistance in obtaining an extension of credit must come <em>directly </em>from <em>the consumer.\u201d Id. </em>at 154, 46 A.3d 443 (emphasis in original). As it was undisputed that Gomez made no \u201cdirect payment\u201d to Jackson Hewitt in return for its assistance in obtaining a RAL, the Court held that Jackson Hewitt was not a \u201ccredit services business\u201d and was therefore not subject to the MCSBA. <em>Id. </em>at 155, 178, 46 A.3d 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">During its review of that issue, the <em>Gomez </em>Court undertook a thorough and comprehensive survey of the legislative history of the MCSBA to \u201cconfirm! ]\u201d that the act was \u201cnot intended to regulate RAL facilitators who do not receive compensation directly from the consumer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159, 46 A.3d 443. The salient points made by the Court, in its survey of the legislative history of the act, were the following: The MCSBA was enacted in 1987 to regulate \u201ccredit repair agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 46 A.3d 443. Its enactment was the result of the legislature\u2019s concern about the \u201cpredatory practices and misleading advertising\u201d of businesses that \u201ctake fees from consumers to improve or extend credit, or to give advice or assistance in such matters,\u201d and the MCSBA was enacted to \u201ctarget\u201d such businesses. <em>Id. </em>at 161-62, 46 A.3d 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The Court further noted that, in 2001, the legislature amended the act by adding to the list of activities that a credit services business was proscribed from engaging in: assisting a consumer in \u201cobtain[ing] an extension of unsecured closed end credit at a rate of interest which, except for federal preemption of State law,\u201d would be prohibited by Maryland law. <em>Id. </em>at 162-63, 46 A.3d 443. The purpose of this amendment was to target \u201cpayday lenders\u201d that were \u201cpartnering with a federal bank in order to \u2018import\u2019 [interest] rates into Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163, 46 A.3d 443. Specifically, the amendment was \u201caimed\u201d at third-party arrangements between \u201cfederally-insured depository institutions\u201d and \u201clocal agents (usually a check cashing business) to broker such loans,\u201d and was intended to ensure the \u201cability to enforce [Maryland\u2019s] small loan laws by <em>prohibiting a broker from arranging a loan </em>that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>otherwise illegal by state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 46 A.3d 443 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The following year, in 2002, the legislature, as the Court of Appeals observed, expanded that prohibition by amending the act to apply to \u201can extension of unsecured closed end credit or closed end credit <em>secured by personal property </em>at a rate of interest which, except for federal preemption of State law,\u201d would be prohibited by Maryland law. <em>Id. </em>at 166, 46 A.3d 443 (emphasis added). This amendment rendered the MCSBA applicable to <em>\u201cany </em>extension of credit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The focus of the 2002 amendment, however, was still on payday lenders because the 2001 enactment had, in the words of the \u201cFiscal Note\u201d accompanying this amendment when it was proposed, \u201cfail[ed] in fact to prevent payday lending as intended,\u201d and this new amendment, it was hoped, would \u201cachieve the results the legislature [had] intended\u201d to achieve the year before. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Eight years later, in 2010, the MCSBA was amended once more. That amendment prohibited a credit services business from \u201ccharging] or receiving] any money or other valuable consideration in connection with an extension of credit that, when combined with any interest charged on the extension of credit, would exceed the interest rate permitted for the extension of credit under the applicable title of this article.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 46 A.3d 443. It \u201cclarifie[d]\u201d that \u201call fees associated with a payday loan\u201d fell under Maryland\u2019s \u201cusury cap.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Quoting the \u201csponsor\u201d of the amendment, the <em>Gomez </em>Court observed that the legislature, in passing the amendment, was attempting to address \u201cthe gouging of the public by essentially one company,\u201d based in another state, which charged \u201cup to 600 percent for a payday loan\u201d once all fees were calculated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The foregoing legislative history showed, according to the Court of Appeals, that the MCSBA \u201cwas clearly industry specific,\u201d as it targeted third-party business that were \u201cpartnering with a federal bank in order to \u2018import\u2019 [interest] rates into Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169, 163, 46 A.3d 443. But \u201c[w]e are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>not persuaded,\u201d the Court advised, \u201cthat such industry-specific legislation indicates the General Assembly\u2019s intent to regulate income tax preparers that assist their clients receiving, through a third-party lender, a RAL, if they do not receive any payment directly from the consumer for that assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169, 46 A.3d 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">With that analysis of the legislative history of the MCSBA in mind, we return to the question presented by the instant appeal and specifically to CashCall\u2019s assertion that, in order to be a \u201ccredit services business\u201d under the MCSBA, it had to have received \u201cdirect payment\u201d from Maryland consumers, which CashCall maintains it did not. CashCall reasons that, because Maryland consumers did not pay a fee to CashCall for its loan arrangement services, it did not receive \u201cthe payment of money or other valuable consideration\u201d in return for obtaining extensions of credit for consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The Commissioner flatly rejected that claim below, as he now does on appeal. He maintains that he correctly determined that CashCall did, in fact, receive \u201cdirect payment\u201d from the consumers for whom it arranged loans. And, even if that did not occur, the \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement, in <em>Gomez, </em>was never intended to apply beyond the factual boundaries of that ease, and certainly it was not intended to extend to companies, like CashCall, whose \u201csole purpose\u201d is to arrange loans for Maryland consumers and thereby exclude the very businesses that the MCSBA was intended to cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">We agree with the Commissioner that the Court of Appeals, in rendering its decision in <em>Gomez, </em>did not intend to establish a universal rule, and that the \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement was not meant to apply to a company, like CashCall, which is exclusively engaged in assisting Maryland consumers to obtain small loans bearing annual interest rates that would be, under Maryland law, usurious and then, to further profit from this activity, immediately purchases the loans after their issuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>and thereafter collects all payments due on the loans from the consumer, including the \u201crolled in\u201d origination fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">We begin, as the Commissioner did in his final order, by recognizing that the Court of Appeals, in <em>Gomez, </em>was asked to address a set of facts quite different from those presently before us. The facts in <em>Gomez </em>established that there were, in the Commissioner\u2019s words, \u201ctwo separate commercial relationships\u201d between Gomez and Jackson Hewitt: one relationship for tax preparation purposes and the other for facilitating the RAL. But Jackson Hewitt\u2019s \u201cprimary commercial and contractual relationship\u201d with Gomez and its other clients was \u201crelated to tax preparation,\u201d said the Commissioner, and \u201cnot to obtaining an extension of credit.\u201d Consequently, for Jackson Hewitt to be subject to the MCSBA, \u201ca direct payment for the credit services [was] necessary to define what party fulfilled what role in these separate commercial transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">It was, indeed, this dual relationship between Gomez and Jackson Hewitt, with loan arrangement playing a relatively minor role in their business relationship, that appeared to trouble the Court of Appeals and led it to express concern about the consequences of applying the MCSBA to instances where the credit services provided by a business to a consumer are only ancillary to the primary relationship between the business and the consumer. This could lead, the <em>Gomez </em>Court noted, to \u201cabsurd results,\u201d rendering the MCSBA applicable \u201cto tremendous numbers of retailers throughout Maryland who have never registered under the [M]CSBA.\u201d 427 Md. at 138, 46 A.3d 443. It pointed out that \u201cmainstream businesses\u201d like \u201cdepartment stores, electronic retailers, big box retailers, book stores, gas stations[, and] clothing retailers,\u201d which are not primarily engaged in \u201ccredit services business\u201d with consumers but \u201croutinely offer assistance to customers with applications for credit offered by third-party banks in exchange for compensation from the banks,\u201d would be, under a broad application of the \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement, subject to the MCSBA for the assistance they provided to consumers in applying for credit offered by third parties. <em>Id. </em>at 159, 46 A.3d 443. Given the articulation of these concerns by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Court of Appeals, we believe that Maryland\u2019s highest court was impliedly suggesting that the \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement set forth in <em>Gomez </em>was intended to apply only to \u201cmainstream\u201d businesses that, like Jackson Hewitt, offer loan arrangement services as an ancillary service, separate and distinct from the principal services they provide to Maryland consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Indeed, CashCall is obviously not, as the Commissioner observed, the type of business that the Court of Appeals was confronted with, and concerned about, in <em>Gomez. </em>In contrast to Jackson Hewitt, whose primary business is tax preparation and who provided assistance in obtaining RALs as an ancillary service to its customers, CashCall\u2019s loan arrangement service was, as the Commissioner noted, the <em>only </em>service CashCall provided. There was no evidence, declared the Commissioner, that CashCall \u201cprovided any other services to the consumers\u201d other than arranging loans. And, since the nature of the commercial relationship between CashCall and Maryland consumers was clear, it was not necessary, opined the Commissioner, to make the \u201capplicability of the MCSBA contingent on whether a consumer has made a \u2018direct\u2019 payment to CashCall.\u201d We agree. The concerns that prompted the Court of Appeals in <em>Gomez </em>to require a \u201cdirect payment\u201d from the consumer to the business entity in exchange for credit services simply do not exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Moreover, the amendments made to the MCSBA in 2001, 2002, and 2010, were meant, as the Commissioner put it, to \u201cencompass[ ] third parties who, partnering with out-of-state banks, facilitate predatory lending against Maryland consumers.\u201d The legislature\u2019s intent, averred the Commissioner, was to protect Maryland consumers from \u201cschemes\u201d in which a third-party business, like CashCall, entered into an agreement with an out-of-state bank to arrange a loan, from the bank to the consumer, at interest rates prohibited by Maryland law, regardless of whether that third party received \u201cdirect payment\u201d from the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>We agree that CashCall\u2019s business practices, viewed in the light of the MCSBA\u2019s goal of protecting Maryland consumers from the lending practices of companies marketing high-interest small loans and partnering with out-of-state banks in order to charge what would otherwise be usurious rates of interest, are precisely the sort of business activities that the act and its amendments were enacted to prevent. To make the MCSBA\u2019s applicability contingent on a \u201cdirect payment\u201d from the consumer to the business entity, under any and all circumstances, would undermine the protections for Maryland consumers the legislature strove so hard to put in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Moreover, even if it were the case (though we do not believe that it is) that an enterprise, regardless of the nature of its business and the services it provides, cannot be a \u201ccredit services business\u201d unless it is directly paid by the consumers it serviced, the direct-payment requirement was, as the Commissioner found, satisfied here. CashCall did, in fact, receive direct payment from Maryland consumers for the preparation and processing of the loans it arranged for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">To illustrate how this occurred, we shall briefly revisit the loan arrangement services offered and provided by CashCall. To begin with, once CashCall had gained the attention, through its advertisements, of a Maryland consumer interested in obtaining a small loan, CashCall then assisted that consumer in applying for such a loan at an annual interest rate from 59% to 96%, a range of interest rates deemed usurious by Maryland law. That assistance consisted of offering advice, supplying a loan application form, and providing assistance, over the telephone, to the interested consumer in completing the application. Upon completion of that application by the interested consumer, CashCall would transmit the application to one of two out-of-state banks for approval. After the loan was approved, the bank would transfer the loan to the consumer\u2019s account, less an \u201corigination fee.\u201d The consumer remained obligated, however, to pay to the holder of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the loan that origination fee, which was, in the Commissioner\u2019s words, \u201crolled into the principal amount of the loan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Then, three days after the bank funded the loan, CashCall would purchase, from the bank, the loan, which encompassed the origination fee. CashCall thereafter had the right to collect, directly from the borrowing Maryland consumers, all loan payments, interest, and fees due under the loan. Thus, CashCall received, directly from each Maryland consumer for whom it had arranged a loan, payment of the origination fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">It is of no consequence that the origination fee was originally charged by the lending bank. The bank never received payment of that fee from the consumer but, as noted, Cash-Call did. Nor does it matter that the payments for the origination fee were made as part of the payments on the principal amount of the loan. That arrangement affected how payment of the origination fee was to be made, but not what the payment was for, who made it (the consumer), or who received it (CashCall).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Finally, we feel impelled to note, and express our agreement with, the statement made by the Commissioner, in his final order, that if we were to accept CashCall\u2019s contention that it received no direct payments for its services\u2014despite the fact that the out-of-state banks never actually received, from any of the recipients of those loans, any payments for the loans that they had issued, while CashCall did\u2014we would have to \u201caccept that any credit services business is permitted to redirect the path of a consumer payment through a myriad of creative business structures and transactions and avoid the MCSBA.\u201d We decline to do so and conclude that CashCall, by collecting the origination fee paid by the borrowing consumer, received \u201cdirect payment\u201d from the consumers and therefore was, if that be the standard here, a \u201ccredit services business\u201d under the MCSBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.
