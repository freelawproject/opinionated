Thus, his negligent operation of the policy holder\u2019s car that had resulted in injuries to appellants\u2014Baltimore City police Officer Teresa Rigby, tow truck operator Herman E. Griffiths, and Ashley Sims\u2014was not a \u201ccovered occurrence\u201d under Alstate\u2019s policy. Appellants disagree. Citing, among other things, his youth, the length of his residency, as well as his past and present economic reliance on and close personal relationship with the policy holder, appellants contend that the adult in question was a \u201cdependent person\u201d and in the care of the policy holder at the time of the accident at issue and was therefore an \u201cinsured person\u201d as defined by the Alstate policy. For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">In June 2011, Officer Rigby, together with tow truck operator Griffiths, were rendering assistance to Sims, the driver of a disabled automobile, parked on the shoulder of the road, when a vehicle driven by twenty-two-year-old Robert Vander-ford collided with Officer Rigby\u2019s police cruiser. The impact of that collision caused the cruiser, in turn, to strike the officer and Griffiths as well as Sims\u2019s car (in which Sims was then sitting), injuring all three individuals. At the time of the accident, Vanderford was driving an automobile owned by Lawrence Archembeault, with whom he was residing, and whose \u201cumbrella\u201d insurance policy with Allstate is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Ultimately, Officer Rigby, Sims, and Griffiths brought separate negligence actions in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Vanderford and Archembeault, which were subsequently consolidated for trial. The discovery that ensued disclosed that, at the time of the accident, Archembeault (whom we shall hereafter refer to as the \u201cpolicy holder\u201d) maintained two separate insurance policies with Allstate: One was an automobile insurance policy that provided up to $500,000 of liability coverage;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the other was an \u201cumbrella\u201d policy that supplied up to $5,000,000 of coverage for negligence and, central to this appeal, defined an \u201cinsured person\u201d to include \u201cany dependent person in your care, if that person is a resident of your household.\u201d Because the former policy\u2019s coverage did not offer sufficient recompense for the injuries and economic damages appellants sustained, they turned to the latter policy for adequate redress,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming that Vander-ford qualified as an \u201cinsured person,\u201d under that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>After securing a stay of the appellants\u2019 consolidated negligence actions, Allstate filed a declaratory judgment action against the policy holder, appellants, and Vanderford, in the same court, seeking a determination of whether the policy holder\u2019s umbrella policy provided coverage for Vanderford\u2019s negligent act. The Baltimore City circuit court declared that it did not, explicating that, at the time of the accident, Vanderford was not a \u201cdependent person\u201d \u201cin the care of\u2019 the policy holder and thus did not fall within the policy definition of an \u201cinsured person.\u201d Contesting that judgment, appellants noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">At his deposition, Vanderford testified that, in June 2008, he was living in an apartment in Albany, New York, \u201cworking two jobs\u201d and \u201ctaking care of a bunch of homeless kids.\u201d After Vanderford was rendered homeless by a fire started by one of the adolescents, he rented an apartment from the policy holder and his domestic partner, Donald Vandermark (not to be confused with our errant driver, \u201cRobert Vanderford\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Less than a month later, the nineteen-year-old Vanderford moved from Albany to the policy holder\u2019s home in the Roland Park neighborhood of Baltimore City. And, for the next three years, between June 2008 and June 2011, Vanderford lived principally at that residence together with the policy holder, his domestic partner, and the policy holder\u2019s mother, Gail Archembeault. But the continuity of that residency was periodically interrupted, when Vanderford decided to move out of the policy holder\u2019s home, only to later move back in. He did this on three separate occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">When he was living in the policy holder\u2019s home, Vanderford performed various domestic chores for the policy holder, such as cutting the lawn, raking leaves, and cleaning gutters, in exchange for room and board. He did not pay any rent for nearly two years. But, fourteen months before the accident at issue, in April 2010, he obtained full-time employment with Flextronics (a contractor for Verizon Wireless), as a telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>technician, earning $26,000 per year, and thereafter agreed to pay a rent of $600 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">After obtaining full-time employment, Vanderford also assumed responsibility for the payment of such personal expenses as the cost of his telephone, food, and clothing (which had previously been paid by the policy holder). And, while the policy holder allowed Vanderford to use his 1999 Saab automobile, the vehicle Vanderford was driving at the time of the accident, Vanderford paid for fuel for the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Although the policy holder later deponed that he acted as a \u201cmentor\u201d to Vanderford, appellants insist that the relationship was even closer than that, noting that, in a recorded statement made to an Allstate adjuster on the day of the accident, Vanderford described the policy holder as his \u201cfather\u201d and that, during Vanderford\u2019s criminal trial for traffic offenses arising out of the automobile accident at issue in this case, Vanderford\u2019s counsel referred to the policy holder and his domestic partner as Vanderford\u2019s \u201cfamily.\u201d While the semblance of a familial relationship may have existed, the policy holder never claimed Vanderford as a dependent on his tax return, never gave Vanderford any money, credit cards, or an \u201callowance,\u201d nor paid for Vanderford\u2019s medical care or designated him as a beneficiary of his health insurance policy. Moreover, the policy holder admitted that he did not exercise any control over Vanderford\u2019s comings and goings. In fact, Vanderford was, in the policy holder\u2019s words, \u201cfree to leave at any time he cho[se]\u201d and did move out on three separate occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">This appeal, as noted earlier, is from a declaratory judgment, issued by the circuit court. That court concluded that the term \u201cdependent person\u201d is not ambiguous and that Vanderford was not a \u201cdependent person\u201d as defined by the umbrella policy. It reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">Even though Defendant Vanderford lived with and was admittedly like family to Defendant Archembeault, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>not dependent upon Archembeault to live. The facts indicate that Vanderford is a 24 year old man<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> who rents, a room in Archembeault\u2019s home, has free reign of the house, and borrow[s] the car to commute to work, but if for some reason the relationship is terminated, Vanderford is able to live on his own. Thus, it cannot be said that he is a dependent of Archembeault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">Additionally, it is clear that Vanderford does not rely on Archembeault to provide the necessities of life. That is evidenced by his natural resourcefulness. Prior to meeting Archembeault and his partner, Vanderford was living in New York, working two jobs and taking care of homeless children____ Archembeault has no legal responsibility to care for Vanderford.... Once Vanderford became employed he ... provided for his own food [and] his own cell phone, and he purchased gas for the car whenever he used it.... [He] was not subject to discipline by Archembeault, who did not control his movement around the house. Vanderford was free to move out if he wanted to, and he did on two occasions, but was allowed to come back and live with Archembeault. Vanderford had the freedom to do as he pleased[.] ... Thus, Vanderford is not a \u201cdependent person\u201d pursuant to the insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avz\">Appellants noted this appeal from that judgment, presenting the following issue for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">Whether Vanderford was a \u201cdependent person\u201d and therefore an \u201cinsured,\u201d under the umbrella policy, which defines \u201cinsured\u201d to include \u201cany dependent person\u201d in the policy holder\u2019s care, \u201cif that person is a resident of\u2019 the policy holder\u2019s household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">At the outset, it appears that the parties disagree as to the proper standard of review to be applied in this case. The source of the disagreement is the parties\u2019 conflicting views as to the nature of the proceedings below. Appellants character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ize those proceedings as akin to a hearing on a motion for summary judgment, while Allstate maintains that they were tantamount to a bench trial. Under the circumstances of this case, this amounts to a distinction without a difference, as the questions before us, regardless of which of the two proceedings occurred, are subject to the same standard of review by this Court, given that the parties below were not at odds as to any material fact relevant to their dispute. In any event, the court did deny Allstate\u2019s (renewed) motion for summary judgment before moving on to the merits of the matter, and, in so doing, held what amounted to a bench trial, though no live testimony was taken, and no facts were in dispute. <em>See, e.g., Mundey v. Erie Insurance Group, </em>167 Md.App. 444, 448, 450-51, 893 A.2d 645 (2006) (applying Md. Rule 8\u2014131(c), rule applicable to appellate review of bench trials, to lower court proceeding, in which \u201c[njeither party called live witnesses,\u201d but, rather, \u201ceach proffered evidence from which the circuit court could have found\u201d the underlying facts), <em>ajfd, </em>396 Md. 656, 914 A.2d 1167 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">As this is an appeal from the decision rendered after a bench trial, we \u201creview the case on both the law and the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131 (c). We \u201cwill not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous,\u201d giving \u201cdue regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 8-131(c) \u201cdoes not apply to a trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions or conclusions of law based upon findings of fact.\u201d <em>Elderkin v. Carroll, </em>403 Md. 343, 353, 941 A.2d 1127 (2008) (quoting <em>S. Mgmt. Corp. v. Kevin Willes Constr. Co., </em>382 Md. 524, 539, 856 A.2d 626 (2004)). Those determinations are subject to de novo review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Turning next to the principles of contract interpretation that are relevant to this dispute, we note that an insurance policy, like any contract, must be construed \u201cin its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>entirety,\u201d and, \u201cif reasonably possible,\u201d we give effect \u201cto each clause,\u201d avoiding \u201can interpretation which casts out or disregards a meaningful part of the language of the writing unless no other course can be sensibly and reasonably followed.\u201d <em>Connors v. Gov\u2019t Emp. Ins. Co., </em>442 Md. 466, 480, 113 A.3d 595 (2015) (quoting <em>Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 17, 919 A.2d 700 (2007)). But, \u201cin the event that an insurance policy contains ambiguous language,\u201d the language of the policy is to be construed \u201cliberally in favor of the insured and against the insurer <em>as drafter of the instrument.\u201d Id. </em>at 482-83, 113 A.3d 595 (quoting <em>Megonnell v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>368 Md. 633, 655, 796 A.2d 758 (2002)). And a \u201cpolicy term is considered \u2018ambiguous if, to a reasonably prudent person, the term is susceptible to more than one meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482, 113 A.3d 595 (quoting <em>Cole v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>359 Md. 298, 305-06, 753 A.2d 533 (2000)). But, simply because \u201ca term cannot be precisely defined so as to make clear its application in all varying factual situations does not mean that it is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Humphrey, </em>246 Md. 492, 496, 229 A.2d 70 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The umbrella policy at issue provides in pertinent part: Allstate will pay damages which an insured person becomes legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury, personal injury or property damage, subject to the terms, conditions and limits of this policy. Bodily injury, personal injury and property damage must arise from a covered occurrence. We will not pay any punitive or exemplary damages, fines and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">The policy defines an \u201cinsured person\u201d as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">a) you, and any other person who is named on the Policy Declarations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">b) any person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>c) any dependent person in your care, if that person is a resident of your household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Because the parties agree that subsections a and b are not applicable to the facts of this case but that subsection c is, we are left to ponder whether Vanderford was, under that subsection, a \u201cdependent person\u201d and \u201cin the care of\u2019 the policy holder at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Appellants contend that the terms \u201cdependent person\u201d and \u201cin the care of\u2019 are ambiguous because the umbrella policy does not define either term and because \u201cdependent\u201d and \u201ccare\u201d are words that have \u201cmultiple meanings\u201d or \u201cmultiple shades of meaning.\u201d Those terms, they claim, should be interpreted in favor of appellants. Once that is done, we would have to conclude, they assert, that Vanderford, at the time of the accident, was \u201cdependent\u201d upon and \u201cin the care of\u2019 the policy holder, thereby rendering them entitled to recovery under his umbrella policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Although, at first glance, the terms \u201cdependent\u201d and \u201cin the care of\u2019 may suggest synonymity, they are not synonymous though they arguably partially overlap. For example, a person may be dependent upon another, in some respects, yet not in that individual\u2019s care, or a person, such as a foster child, may be in the care of his or her foster parents but is usually not financially dependent upon them but upon a state agency. See <em>e.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Falgoust, </em>160 P.3d 134, 138-39 (Alaska 2007). Moreover, to suggest that they mean the same thing would run afoul of a basic principle of contract interpretation and, that is, when \u201creasonably possible,\u201d we must give effect \u201cto each clause\u201d of an insurance policy, <em>Connors, supra, </em>at 480,113 A.3d 595 (citation and quotation omitted), and avoid treating either term as surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">In any event, although there are no Maryland decisions that address the issues before us, there are two extra-territorial decisions that provide a thoughtful analysis of one or the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>term, namely, the decision of the Supreme Court of Kansas, in <em>Girrens v. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company, </em>238 Kan. 670, 715 P.2d 389 (1986), which addressed the question of how to interpret the term \u201cdependent person\u201d in an automobile insurance policy, and the decision of the Supreme Court of Michigan, in <em>Henderson v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, </em>460 Mich. 348, 596 N.W.2d 190 (1999), which considered the issue of how to construe the term \u201cin the care of\u2019 in a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. We turn first to <em>Girrens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Lawrence Girrens was the holder of five automobile insurance policies, issued by Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cFarm Bureau\u201d), which provided coverage for \u201chis various vehicles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390. Each policy contained an \u201cidentical\u201d uninsured motorist provision, which defined an \u201cinsured\u201d to include \u201cany dependent person whose legal residence is the household of the named insured and with respect to whom the named insured or spouse is a parent or stands in loco parentis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Raymond Girrens (\u201cRaymond\u201d), Lawrence Girrens\u2019s twenty-three-year-old son, was injured, when the motorcycle he was riding collided with another motorcycle. Because, at the time of the accident, neither he nor the other motorcyclist was carrying any insurance, Raymond filed a claim against his father\u2019s automobile insurer, Farm Bureau, contending that he was covered under the uninsured motorist provisions of his father\u2019s insurance policies. <em>Id. </em>at 390, 393. When his claim was denied, he brought suit against Farm Bureau, presumably for breaching the terms of its policies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A jury trial ensued, and, following a verdict in favor of Farm Bureau, Raymond appealed, claiming: first, that the term \u201cdependent person,\u201d in each of the policies at issue, was ambiguous and must be construed in his favor and against the insurer, Farm Bureau, thereby entitling him, he believed, to uninsured motorist cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>erage under his father\u2019s policies; and, second, that the trial court erred, in instructing the jury that \u201ca \u2018dependent person\u2019 is one who relies on substantial contributions from another person, without which he would be unable to afford the reasonable necessities of life\u201d and, furthermore, that he need not \u201cestablish the status of a present total and absolute reliance upon that person for those contributions, but looks to that person and relies upon him for them with substantial regularity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391, 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">In rejecting Raymond\u2019s \u201cambiguity\u201d claim, the Kansas Supreme Court, at the outset, noted that, although \u201cthe term \u2018dependent person\u2019 may have different meanings under differing factual situations,\u201d it was not \u201cso ambiguous under the facts and insurance policy\u201d at issue \u201cas to require as a matter of law that it be construed to include\u201d the insured\u2019s son, Raymond. <em>Id. </em>at 393. Then, surveying the facts of the case before it, the Court observed that, although, at the time of the accident, Raymond \u201clived at home on the family farm,\u201d he \u201cwas employed full time as a machinist and supplemented his income with farm work\u201d and that, although his parents provided him room, board, and transportation, Raymond \u201cworked on the family farm and there was some evidence that he did so in exchange for the room, board and transportation furnished by his parents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Ultimately, in finding no merit to Raymond\u2019s claim of instructional error, the Kansas Supreme Court opined that, in \u201cthe context used in the present policy,\u201d the standard articulated by the trial court, that \u201ca dependent person\u201d requires a \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d to \u201cprovide the necessities of life,\u201d was not \u201cunreasonable\u201d and that, given that Raymond \u201cwas employed full time as a machinist with supplemental income provided from farming,\u201d the mere fact that he still lived in his parents\u2019 home did not mean that he was a \u201cdependent person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395. It therefore affirmed the judgment in favor of the insurer, Farm Bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Turning to the case before us, we begin by reiterating a standard principle of contract interpretation that we men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>tioned earlier, that is, that, simply because \u201ca term cannot be precisely defined so as to make clear its application in all varying factual situations does not mean that it is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Humphrey, supra, </em>246 Md. at 496, 229 A.2d 70. Or in other words, simply because appellants can point to several slightly different dictionary definitions of \u201cdependent\u201d does not render that term ambiguous. A \u201cdependent person,\u201d as the Kansas Supreme Court aptly expressed it, is one who relies on another to provide \u201csubstantial contributions ..., without which he would be unable to afford the reasonable necessities of life.\u201d <em>Girrens, </em>715 P.2d at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Applying that definition, Vanderford was less of a \u201cdependent person\u201d than Raymond in the <em>Girrens </em>case. Although Vanderford, like Raymond Girrens, was an adult living in the home of another, he lived with the unrelated policy holder, while Raymond lived with his actual parents. While Vander-ford, like Raymond, had a full-time job and also performed additional work for the homeowner/policy holder, Vanderford, unlike Raymond, actually paid rent in the amount of $600 per month to the policy holder, which though admittedly a low rent for living in Roland Park,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was significantly more than a nominal amount. Thus, Vanderford\u2019s circumstances lead us to conclude that the circuit court did not err in finding that Vanderford was not \u201cdependent\u201d upon the policy holder to the extent that it rendered him a \u201cdependent person\u201d under the Allstate policy at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Nor does appellants\u2019 claim that the term \u201cin the care of\u2019 is ambiguous have any merit. As did the circuit court and the parties below, we turn to the decision of the Supreme Court of Michigan in <em>Henderson v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, supra, </em>596 N.W.2d 190. There, Michigan\u2019s highest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>court addressed this very issue in interpreting a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Daniel Henderson, while visiting the residence of Bonnie Twitchell, was stabbed during an altercation \u201cwith some strangers\u201d that took place \u201cin front of the Twitchell home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192. At that time, Bonnie Twitchell lived with her twenty-year-old son, Travis Twitchell, and his eighteen-year-old girlfriend, Dawn Mysierowicz, <em>id. </em>at 192 n. 2, and maintained a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy, which defined \u201cinsured\u201d to include the policy holder and any \u201crelatives\u201d as well as \u201cany other person under the age of 21 who is <em>in the care of\u201d </em>the policy holder and a resident of the policy holder\u2019s household. <em>Id. </em>at 192 n. 1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Henderson thereafter filed a lawsuit against Travis and Dawn, alleging that their negligent provocation of the strangers had brought about his injury. <em>Id. </em>at 192. Bonnie Twite-hell\u2019s insurer, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (\u201cState Farm\u201d), agreed to defend Travis but declined to defend his girlfriend, Dawn, \u201con the basis that she was not an \u2018insured\u2019 within the meaning of the insurance policy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">After a default judgment was entered against Dawn, Henderson, in exchange for his promise not to proceed against her personal assets, obtained from Dawn an assignment of \u201call rights, benefits and claims she had against State Farm,\u201d whereupon he brought an action against State Farm. <em>Id. </em>In that suit, he alleged that it had breached the terms of its policy by failing to provide coverage for Dawn\u2019s negligence, as she was, according to Henderson, an \u201cinsured\u201d under Bonnie Twitchell\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance policy, because she was \u201cin the care of\u2019 Bonnie Twitchell at the time of the stabbing (and her purported negligence). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">After depositions were taken, Henderson and State Farm filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted State Farm\u2019s motion, concluding that Dawn was not \u201cin the care of\u2019 Bonnie Twitchell at the time of the alleged negligence, and denied Henderson\u2019s cross motion. <em>Id. </em>at 193. Although Michigan\u2019s intermediate appellate court reversed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>decision of the trial court, <em>Henderson v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>225 Mich.App. 703, 572 N.W.2d 216 (1997), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>460 Mich. 348, 596 N.W.2d 190 (1999), Michigan\u2019s highest Court took a more cautious and, for our purposes, a more instructive approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The Michigan Supreme Court first found that the phrase \u201cin the care of\u2019 was not ambiguous, reasoning that that phrase was \u201ca colloquial or idiomatic phrase that is peculiar to itself and readily understood as a phrase by speakers and readers of our language.\u201d 596 N.W.2d at 192, 194. But, because it concluded that there was conflicting evidence as to whether Dawn was \u201cin the care of\u2019 Bonnie Twitchell, it remanded with the following non-exclusive list of questions to be addressed by the trial court in determining whether \u201csomeone is \u2018in the care of someone else\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">(1) is there a legal responsibility to care for the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">(2) is there some form of dependency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">(3) is there a supervisory or disciplinary responsibility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">(4) is the person providing the care providing substantial essential financial support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">(5) is the living arrangement temporary or permanent, including how long it has been in existence and is expected to continue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">(6) what is the age of the person alleged to be \u201cin the care of\u2019 another (generally, the younger a person the more likely they are to be \u201cin the care\u201d of another);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">(7) what is the physical or mental health status of the person alleged to be \u201cin the care of\u2019 another (a person with health problems is more likely to be \u201cin the care\u201d of another); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-12\">(8) is the person allegedly \u201cin the care of\u2019 another gainfully employed (a person so employed is less likely to be truly dependent on another)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 195-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">We agree with the Michigan Supreme Court that the term \u201cin the care of\u2019 is not ambiguous and that the factors to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>be considered., as set forth in question form in <em>Henderson, </em>provide useful criteria for determining whether, under a specific set of facts, one person is \u201cin the care of\u2019 another. Applying those factors to the case before us, it is clear that seven of the eight factors weigh against a finding that Vander-ford was, at the time of the accident, \u201cin the care of\u2019 the policy holder as: (1) the policy holder had no legal responsibility to care for Vanderford; (2) the policy holder had no supervisory or disciplinary responsibility over Vanderford; (3) the policy holder was not providing \u201csubstantial essential financial support\u201d to Vanderford (or, at least, it was not clearly erroneous for the court below to so conclude); (4) Vanderford\u2019s living arrangement was temporary (or, at least, it was not clearly erroneous for the court below to so conclude); (5) Vanderford was a twenty-two-year-old emancipated adult; (6) Vanderford was in good health; and (7) Vanderford was working full-time and earning $26,000 per year. Only the second of the eight <em>Henderson </em>factors, that is, that there was \u201csome form of dependency,\u201d tilts in favor of appellants\u2019 position, as the policy holder had, in fact, allowed Vanderford to live in his home for a modest rent and to drive his car to work. Thus, there was ample evidence to support the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that Vanderford was not \u201cin the care of\u2019 the policy holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">In sum, we discern no legal error in either the circuit court\u2019s interpretation of the contractual terms at issue or its conclusions that, at the time of the accident, Vanderford was not a \u201cdependent person\u201d or \u201cin the care of\u2019 the policy holder. We therefore affirm the circuit court\u2019s declaratory judgment, asserting that Vanderford was not an \u201cinsured person\u201d under the Allstate policy at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-6\">.
