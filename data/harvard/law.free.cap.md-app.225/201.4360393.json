The petition asserted that Sanmart\u00edn Prado received ineffective assistance of counsel during his January 6, 2011 trial. Sanmart\u00edn Prado was charged with second-degree child abuse. On January 28, 2014, a <em>comm nobis </em>hearing was held, and on June 12, 2014, the circuit court denied the petition. Sanmart\u00edn Prado filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">On appeal, Sanmart\u00edn Prado asks this Court to determine whether the circuit court erred in denying the <em>comm nobis </em>petition by finding that he waived his right to a <em>comm nobis </em>complaint, and whether he received ineffective assistance of counsel. For the reasons explained below, we reverse and remand the case to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">On January 6, 2011, Sanmart\u00edn Prado, an Ecuadorian citizen and a legal permanent resident of the United States, pled not guilty on an agreed statement of facts to a charge of second-degree child abuse. Sanmart\u00edn Prado was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison, with all but two years suspended, and a two-year probation period upon his release. He did not appeal the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Sanmart\u00edn Prado has now been subjected to deportation as a result of his conviction for the second-degree child abuse conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He alleges that he was not informed by his trial counsel of the immigration consequences of his conviction. Sanmart\u00edn Prado claims that he first learned he would be deported when officers from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cI.C.E.\u201d) came to arrest him six months following the end of his probationary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">During the circuit court proceeding for the second-degree child abuse charge,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s trial attorney asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>whether it was correct that the two \u201chave had discussions with respect to [his] immigration status,\u201d to which Sanmart\u00edn Prado responded, \u2018Yes, sir.\u201d During the <em>coram nobis </em>hearing, the trial attorney testified that the \u201cdiscussions\u201d took place on December 30, 2010, while Sanmart\u00edn Prado was in the \u201cdetention center.\u201d Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s trial attorney further testified that he \u201cexplained to [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] that there could and probably would be immigration consequences as a result of the plea ... that it was a deportable or possibly deportable offense.\u201d Sanmart\u00edn Prado alleged in his petition that this advisement was insufficient as to the potential consequence of deportation resulting from his conviction and amounts to error reviewable upon petition of writ of error <em>coram nobis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">In a written opinion, the circuit court found as a fact that trial counsel met with Sanmart\u00edn Prado \u201cat the Baltimore County Detention Center before trial and explained the immigration consequences of a guilty verdict, including that the charge was a \u2018deportable offense\u2019 and Petitioner \u2018could be deported ... if the government chose to initiate deportation proceedings,\u2019 and it was \u2018possible\u2019 that Petitioner \u2018would be deported.\u2019 \u201d The court went on to state that \u201c[t]he Petitioner testified that his counsel never told him he \u2018would be deported,\u2019 but acknowledged that he did have a conversation with trial counsel regarding his immigration status.\u201d The circuit court went on to rule that \u201c[u]pon consideration of the evidence to this Court as well as the record of the plea hearing, the Court finds that the Petitioner has not rebutted the presumption that he \u2018intelligently and knowingly\u2019 failed to raise the allegation on appeal and Petitioner has made no showing that special circumstances exist for his failure to make the allegation of error on appeal.\u201d This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The common law writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>was expanded in Maryland by <em>Skok v. State, </em>361 Md. 52, 78, 760 A.2d 647 (2000), to serve as \u201ca remedy for a convicted person who is not incarcerated and not on parole or probation, who is suddenly faced with a significant collateral consequence of his or her conviction, and who can legitimately challenge the conviction on constitutional or fundamental grounds.\u201d A \u201cpresumption of regularity attaches to the criminal case,\u201d and therefore, the <em>coram nobis </em>petitioner bears the burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 78, 760 A 2d 647. This Court will not \u201cdisturb the factual findings of the post-conviction court unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Arrington v. State, </em>411 Md. 524, 551, 983 A.2d 1071 (2009) (citation omitted). While reviewing for clear error, we will make an \u201cindependent determination of relevant law and its application to the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Adams, </em>406 Md. 240, 255, 958 A.2d 295 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">I. Waiver is no longer an appropriate basis for denying a <em>coram nobis </em>petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Md.Code (2002, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-401 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d) states: \u201cThe failure to seek an appeal in a criminal case may not be construed as a waiver of the right to file a petition for writ of error <em>coram </em>nobis.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The circuit court did not cite nor rely on this statute in ruling that Sanmartin Prado waived his <em>coram nobis </em>claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A year after the circuit court\u2019s denial of Sanmartin Prado\u2019s petition, the Court of Appeals decided <em>State v. Smith, </em>443 Md. 572, 117 A.3d 1093 (2015). In <em>Smith, </em>the Court of Appeals applied CP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u00a7 8-401 to similar facts and held that the petitioner did not waive her <em>coram nobis </em>claim by failing to appeal her conviction or file a petition for post-conviction relief. <em>Id. </em>at 577, 117 A.3d 1093. <em>Smith </em>explicitly contradicts the circuit court\u2019s waiver ruling in Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Smith </em>reasoned that the petitioner was entitled to the benefit of CP \u00a7 8-401 because \u201cthe statute is both procedural and remedial and does not impair any \u2018vested right\u2019 of the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588, 117 A.3d 1093. The Court further noted that petitioner Smith satisfies the standard for <em>coram nobis </em>and is entitled to pursue her claim because she:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">[SJtands convicted of a deportable offense; is not incarcerated; is not on parole or probation; and, \u201csuddenly faced with a significant collateral consequence of [ ] her conviction, ... can legitimately challenge the conviction on constitutional or fundamental grounds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 609,117 A.3d 1093 (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">The <em>Smith </em>Court states that upholding a <em>coram nobis </em>denial on waiver grounds would \u201cundermine completely the procedural benefit the General Assembly bestowed upon the convicted defendants by its enactment of CP \u00a7 8-401.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we disagree with the circuit court on this procedural issue, reverse, and move on to the merits of Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">II. The circuit court must determine whether Sanmar-t\u00edn Prado met his burden of proof as to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">As noted, <em>supra, </em>Sanmart\u00edn Prado bears the burden of proof on his <em>coram nobis </em>complaint. <em>Skok, supra, </em>361 Md. at 78, 760 A.2d 647. Sanmart\u00edn Prado alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial attorney never advised him of the risk of deportation in the event he was found guilty after proceeding with his trial on an agreed statement of facts. The standard for reviewing ineffective assistance of counsel is set out in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), in the form of a two-pronged analysis: (1) counsel\u2019s representation must fall \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and (2) there is \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Sanmartin Prado\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is grounded in <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356,130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010). Padilla, a native of Honduras, had been a lawful permanent resident of the United States for more than forty years and had served in the United States Armed Forces during the Vietnam War. Padilla faced deportation after pleading guilty to the transportation of a large amount of marijuana in his tractor-trailer in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The Supreme Court held in <em>Padilla </em>that, under the Sixth Amendment, an attorney representing a non-citizen, in order to provide constitutionally effective representation, must inform the noncitizen client of the risk of deportation that follows a criminal conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 371, 130 S.Ct. 1473.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">After examining the critical changes in immigration law over recent decades,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the <em>Padilla </em>Court noted that \u201cif a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>noncitizen has committed a removable offense after the 1996 effective decreed date of these amendments, his removal is practically inevitable.\u201d <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 363-64, 130 S.Ct. 1473. Subsequently, professional norms of the legal profession changed to include \u201cthe deportation consequence\u201d of a criminal conviction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 372, 130 S.Ct. 1473. Because the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis instructs that the \u201cproper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052 then a noncitizen criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel requires advice on the risk of deportation. <em>Id. </em>at 363-64, 130 S.Ct. 1473; <em>see also, e.g., Denisyuk v. State, </em>422 Md. 462, 30 A.3d 914 (2011) (applying <em>Padilla </em>in Maryland).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Courts have granted writs of error <em>coram nobis </em>and vacated a petitioner\u2019s conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel claims where the attorney misadvised or failed to advise petitioner on the potential immigration consequences of his guilty plea. In <em>United States v. Akinsade, </em>686 F.3d 248, 256 (4th Cir.2012), the Fourth Circuit found that petitioner Akinsade \u201csuffered a fundamental error necessitating <em>coram nobis </em>relief.\u201d Akinsade had asked his attorney on multiple occasions \u201cabout the potential immigration consequences of a guilty plea\u201d and each time \u201chis attorney misadvised him that he could not be deported based on [his] offense,\u201d giving him advice \u201ccontrary to the law at that time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250. In <em>Denisyuk, </em>the Court of Appeals determined that counsel for petitioner Denisyuk, a 31-year old Latvian citizen who immigrated to the United States at the age of fourteen, performed deficiently by failing to advise Denisyuk of the deportation consequences of his guilty plea. 422 Md. at 485, 30 A.3d 914; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>see also United States v. Kayode, </em>777 F.3d 719, 723 (5th Cir.2014) (explaining that defense counsel provided deficient assistance by failing to inform defendant of deportation risk associated with guilty plea); <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Vega, </em>797 F.3d 781 (9th Cir.2015) (reasoning that \u201ccounsel\u2019s statements made after [petitioner] had already pled guilty, that she faced a \u2018high likelihood\u2019 of removal, [do not] satisfy his duty to accurately advise his client of the removal consequences of a plea <em>before </em>she enters into it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The <em>Padilla </em>Court emphasizes that it is now \u201cquintessentially the duty of counsel to provide [a] client with available advice about an issue like deportation and the failure to do so \u2018clearly satisfies the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 363-64, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (quoting <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 62, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985)). Advising a client about immigration consequences requires informing him that a conviction renders him \u201cdeportable.\u201d This is sufficient to explain that a conviction results in action by I.C.E. that would place the individual into immigration proceedings. Statements that qualify \u201cdeportable,\u201d such as \u201cpossibly deportable\u201d or \u201cmay be deportable,\u201d are inadequate advice as to immigration consequences because they suggest the discretion of the federal government in <em>initiating </em>immigration proceedings against a convicted noncitizen, which a trial attorney is in no position to determine. The <em>Padilla </em>Court highlights that, under current immigration law, \u201cif a noncitizen has committed a removable offense ... his removal is practically inevitable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363-64, 130 S.Ct. 1473. Thus, if the defendant committed a deportable crime,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> he is, at the moment of conviction, automatically deportable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>a trial attorney is advising his client of the immigration consequences of his conviction, any subsequent discretion the federal government may exercise in pursuing immigration proceedings or any defenses the client may have against deportation are not pertinent. The <em>likelihood </em>of deportation is relevant if and when deportation proceedings begin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, in order to unequivocally inform his client of the immigration consequences of his conviction, a trial attorney need only tell his client that he is \u201cdeportable\u201d without qualification. This is especially important when a defendant accepts a plea bargain. As explained in <em>Padilla:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">[IJnformed consideration of possible deportation can only benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants during the plea-bargaining process. By bringing deportation consequences into this process, the defense and prosecution may well be able to reach agreements that better satisfy the interests of both parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\"><em>Hernandez-Cruz v. Holder, </em>651 F.3d 1094,1111 (9th Cir.2011), (citing <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 373,130 S.Ct. 1473).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">During the <em>coram nobis </em>hearing, Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s trial attorney testified that he had explained to Sanmart\u00edn Prado while he was detained that there \u201ccould and probably would be immigration consequences\u201d from the conviction, \u201cbut that ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>immigration is a moving target[.]\u201d The trial attorney testified further that he explained to Sanmart\u00edn Prado that second-degree child abuse \u201cwas a <em>deportable </em>offense and he <em>could </em>be deported if the federal government <em>chooses </em>to deport him\u201d or that if the \u201cfederal government chooses to ... initiate deportation proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">During the trial, the circuit court asked Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s attorney to \u201cadvise Mr. Sanmart\u00edn Prado of the rights that he is waiving by proceeding\u201d with an agreed statement of facts. His trial attorney then asked Sanmart\u00edn Prado to confirm that the two had had \u201cdiscussions with respect to [his] immigration status,\u201d to which Sanmart\u00edn Prado responded, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d The trial attorney further remarked that neither he nor the judge was \u201cmaking any promises about what the federal government could possibly do in the future with respect to reviewing this conviction.\u201d Sanmart\u00edn Prado confirmed this statement as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">What the circuit court stated in its written opinion bears repeating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel testified, and the Court finds as a fact that [trial counsel] met with Petitioner at the Baltimore County Detention Center before trial and explained the immigration consequences of a guilty verdict, including that the charge was a \u2018deportable offense\u2019 and Petitioner \u2018could be deported ... if the government chose to initiate deportation proceedings,\u2019 and it was \u2018possible\u2019 that Petitioner \u2018would be deported.\u2019 The Petitioner testified that his counsel never told him he \u2018would be deported,\u2019 but acknowledged that he did have a conversation with trial counsel regarding his immigration status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">Upon consideration of the evidence to this Court as well as the record of the plea hearing, the Court finds that the Petitioner has not rebutted the presumption that he \u2018intelligently and knowingly\u2019 failed to raise the allegation on appeal and Petitioner has made no showing that special circumstances exist for his failure to make the allegation of error on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Based on the circuit court\u2019s brief recitation of its findings on the merits, it is unclear whether the court came to a resolution of the disputed facts. The one paragraph contains the thrust of each side and paraphrases the testimony before the circuit court and at the original hearing. This may well have been because the court was not relying on a finding on the merits to resolve the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">It appears that the circuit court denied the <em>coram nobis </em>petition, but declined to address the merits of his claims. Before this Court, Sanmart\u00edn Prado raises the same issue that he raised in the circuit court; therefore, despite the circuit court\u2019s avoidance of that issue, it is properly before us. <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>180 Md.App. 440, 447, 951 A.2d 875 (2008) (citing Md. Rule 8-131(a) (generally, an appellate court will not decide issues not \u201craised in or decided by the trial court\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In light of the total evidence taken below, we can only conclude that trial counsel qualified his statements to Sanmar-t\u00edn Prado as to whether a conviction would render him deport-able. The <em>Padilla </em>Court emphasizes that it is now \u201cquintessentially the duty of counsel to provide [a] client with available advice about an issue like deportation and the failure to do so \u2018clearly satisfies the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 363-64, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (quoting <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 62,106 S.Ct. 366).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Here, Sanmart\u00edn Prado established that his trial counsel did not provide him with the correct \u201cavailable advice\u201d about the deportation risk. Taken as a whole, the advice was sometimes conflicting. In fact, at the end of the State\u2019s cross-examination, trial counsel agreed that he told Sanmart\u00edn Prado that deportation, as a result of this case, was \u201cpossible.\u201d Sanmar-t\u00edn Prado\u2019s trial attorney\u2019s conduct \u201c[fell] below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and did not meet the prevailing professional norms of most criminal attorneys. <em>Denisyuk, </em>422 Md. at 481, 30 A.3d 914 (citing Padilla).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Because Sanmart\u00edn Prado has proven the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis, we remand the case to the circuit court to reach the second prong, as to whether there is a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>probability that, but for trial counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY IS REVERSED AND THE CASE IS REMANDED FOR PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

We agree that in this case Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s plea, by way of an agreed statement of facts, was equivalent to a guilty plea. The proceedings were in no sense a trial and offered no reasonable chance that there would be an acquittal. <em>Sutton v.

Second, in 1996, Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>removed \"the Attorney General\u2019s authority to grant discretionary relief from deportation\u201d to immigrants convicted of aggravated felonies. <em>Id. </em>at 363, 130 S.Ct. 1473.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b231-6\">. The Supreme Court explained that \"[fjor at least the past 15 years, professional norms have generally imposed an obligation on counsel to provide advice on the deportation consequences of a client's plea.\u201d <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 373, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2) defines the classes of \"Deportable Aliens\u201d for particular criminal offenses. <em>See also </em>note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b232-7\">.

The word \"deportation\u201d is a term of art that is used exclusively throughout the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1537, to refer to the removal of a noncitizen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>residing within the United States. Using the word \"deportable,\u201d therefore, is critical in explaining immigration consequences to a noncitizen defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\">. Congress has allocated the authority and discretion to initiate deportation proceedings against noncitizens convicted of aggravated felonies to the United States Attorney General. It has dictated specifically that \u201cthe Attorney General shall provide for the initiation and, to the extent possible, the completion of removal proceedings, and any administrative appeals thereof, in the case of any alien convicted of an aggravated felony before the alien\u2019s release from incarceration for the underlying aggravated felony.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(a)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Once deportation proceedings have been initiated and the noncitizen has been \"charged with any applicable ground ... of deportability,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(a)(3)(A), the immigration judge \"shall decide whether an alien is removable from the United States.
