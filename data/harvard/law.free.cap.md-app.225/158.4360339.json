Nick\u2019s does not dispute failing to pay taxes, but contests the amount owed and disagrees with the fraud penalty. It argues that the Comptroller\u2019s assessment that was the basis for the Tax Court\u2019s Order was fatally flawed and that the Comptroller failed to prove the necessary intent to defraud. We disagree with both arguments and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">From 1993 until 2009, Mr. Zorzit owned and operated Nick\u2019s Amusements. Nick\u2019s provided coin-operated entertainment machines to bars and restaurants, including jukeboxes, pool tables and video poker machines. Nick\u2019s retained ownership of the machines, and split the profits with the owner of the venue. With video poker machines, owners and managers of the locations made cash payouts to winning customers, with Nick\u2019s knowledge and approval, and these payouts were deducted from the profit they split. Nick\u2019s concedes that these payouts were illegal. Moreover, Nick\u2019s kept no records of the payouts\u2014indeed, as counsel for the Comptroller suggested at the Tax Court, keeping records would have been recording a criminal enterprise.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Nick\u2019s was charged criminally as a result of the video poker business many times. Mr. Zorzit testified that prior to 2009, Nick\u2019s was a defendant in more than fifteen cases in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, but none of these ever yielded a conviction. He claimed, in fact, that there was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>understanding between Nick\u2019s and the former State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore County:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">MR. ZORZIT: If [Baltimore County Police saw gambling], they\u2019d come back, [get] a search warrant, come in there with 20 people. Go through the machines, call us up and say we got your machines, can you come over and open them up. We\u2019d come over and open them up so they didn\u2019t bust them. And it was very cordial with everybody. They had my cell number....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">As soon as they would tell us, you know, what location [from which police were seizing machines], the truck would go over there with some more new ones because they were going to take those out. So the truck would be sitting there. They would be wheeling the machines that they have out, and we\u2019d be wheeling the new ones in, and that\u2019s since I was a kid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">MR. ZORZIT: And then we go to court, and [our attorney] Arnold Zerwitz, I know he testified 12 to 15 times. I think it was a little more than that. We\u2019d go to work. It\u2019s already worked out before we go in. The prosecutor ... for years said I\u2019m not prosecuting these things. This is ridiculous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">It is, of course, lawful to operate video poker machines <em>without </em>making payouts, at least so long as the machines are properly licensed and taxes are paid. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1992, 2010 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 17-405,17-408, and 17-414 of the Business Regulation Article. Video poker machines and other \u201cgames of entertainment\u201d are subject to an \u201cadmissions and amusement\u201d tax of 10% in Baltimore County. Baltimore County Code \u00a7 11-4-601. Although counties impose these taxes, businesses are required to remit admissions and amusement taxes to the Comptroller. Md.Code (1988 Repl.Vol.2010), \u00a7\u00a7 2-109, 4-201, 4-301 of the Tax General Article (\u201cTG\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">Nick\u2019s helped its Baltimore County customers obtain licenses for their video poker machines and collected the taxes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>After the machines were installed and running, Nick\u2019s \u201croute men\u201d visited each location, opened the machines, counted the cash, calculated the admission and amusement taxes to be paid on the revenue at that location, and, then-and-there, split the profits with the location\u2019s owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">But Nick\u2019s did not consider illegal payouts to be taxable, and the route men did not include payouts when calculating Nick\u2019s tax liability. What\u2019s more, Nick\u2019s route men did not keep records that would allow anyone to calculate the taxes due on payouts. <em>First, </em>the route men kept no records of payouts at all. <em>Second, </em>they did not record revenue on a per-machine basis\u2014they tallied all of the revenue by location, net of payouts, and wrote down only that total before calculating taxes and license fees, and splitting the profits. Thus, when a route man returned to Nick\u2019s office with the day\u2019s receipts, video poker revenue was indistinguishable from revenue from jukeboxes, pool tables, or any other cash revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Beginning in 2006, the Baltimore County Police Department (\u201cCounty Police\u201d) conducted a wide-scale investigation of Nick\u2019s video poker operations. After significant undercover work and speaking with informants, the County Police seized eighty-three video poker machines owned by Nick\u2019s from twenty-nine locations on January 28, 2009.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Police opened the machines and analyzed their motherboards in an effort to determine how much money was paid into the machines and how much had been won (the \u201cin-credits\u201d and \u201cout-credits,\u201d respectively). County Police officers later called to testify conceded that bar and restaurant owners likely did not pay out every credit won,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that if Nick\u2019s had purchased used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>machines, the in- and out-credits from previous owners would still be recorded on those machines. But having no way to distinguish between previous out-credits and out-credits during Nick\u2019s ownership of machines, the County Police compiled the raw data from these motherboards into a report, and turned that report over to the Comptroller\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The Comptroller independently analyzed the report. The Comptroller at no time took possession of or tested the machines. Using the figures from the motherboards, the Comptroller\u2019s Office devised a \u201cpayoff percentage,\u201d representing the percentage of out-credits to in-credits. The Comptroller assumed that every out-credit was paid, and ultimately hypothesized that <em>55% </em>of the money paid into a machine would be paid back to customers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Comptroller then applied this figure to the gross revenue that Nick\u2019s had recorded for the period of August 2003 to January 2009. Nick\u2019s had not retained records for January 2000 through July 2003, so the Comptroller devised a monthly average return for the 2003-2009 period, used that number for the months without records, then applied the payoff percentage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After estimating the amount of money bar and restaurant owners had paid out over the years, and applying a 10% admissions and amusement tax rate, the Comptroller ultimately arrived at a tax deficiency of $2,159,724.97 for the 2000-2009 period. The Comptroller then added interest on the outstanding tax bill and imposed a 100% fraud penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Mr. Zorzit later testified that after the raid, he sought access to the video poker machines from the County Police, but his request was denied. Sergeant Thomas Hench of the County Police testified, however, that no one at Nick\u2019s asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>for access to the machines to conduct their own testing of the motherboards. He also testified that the Comptroller never asked for the machines, nor asked the County Police to preserve them, and that after storing the machines for \u201c[a] year or two\u201d they were destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Nick\u2019s appealed the assessment to the Tax Court. It argued that the deficiency assessment was inadequate because the assessment (1) assumed all of Nick\u2019s revenue claimed by Nick\u2019s came from video poker; (2) used out-credits from the life of the video poker machines when a significant number of Nick\u2019s machines had been bought used; and (3) assumed that all out-credits represented payouts even though bar and restaurant management often would not pay and repairmen might accumulate out-credits while testing the machines. At the hearing, Nick\u2019s offered testimony from Ben Cummings, one of Nick\u2019s route men,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> who estimated that only 65% of Nick\u2019s revenues came from video poker, and that the payoff percentage was between 20 and 25%. Nick\u2019s also offered expert testimony from a statistician, who applied Mr. Cummings\u2019s numbers to the Comptroller\u2019s methodology and calculated a tax deficiency of only $466,016.10. Finally, Nick\u2019s disputed the fraud penalty, claiming that neither of the two CPAs they employed, nor their retained attorney, nor anyone else on staff were aware that payouts were taxable, and that Mr. Zorzit and the company lacked the requisite intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The Comptroller in turn called two police officers who had participated in investigating Nick\u2019s, Corporal Montgomery and Sergeant Hench. They described their investigation and the illegal video poker business in general. The Comptroller also called one of its auditors, Charles Drasher, who testified that Nick\u2019s did not maintain records or program the machines in a way that allowed auditors to determine which out-credits resulted in payouts and which did not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>COUNSEL: If there were statements to the effect that not all out-credits may have resulted in payments, why did the comptroller base the assessment on all of the out-credits that were made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">MR. DRASHER: Again, there was no reliable documentation as to what percentage of out-credits represented payouts. And in speaking with Sergeant Hench, he informed me that he believed [ ] all of the out-credits to be payouts. COUNSEL: Ben Cummings has provided what he called guesstimates as to the amount of money that came from the non-video poker machines and the number of out-credits that did not result in payouts. Why didn\u2019t the Comptroller take his guesstimates into account?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">MR. DRASHER: Again, there were no documents, no records to back up any estimates he may have made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Mr. Drasher echoed the testimony of Corporal Montgomery regarding the relative revenue that came from the video poker machines. He testified that one bar owner in the Nick\u2019s network ascribed roughly $50 and $300-$400 per week respectively to pool table and jukebox revenue, but that video poker devices brought in $7,000-$10,000 per week. Mr. Drasher also referred to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Genie &amp; Company, Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>107 Md.App. 551, 668 A.2d 1013 (1995), and identified the \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d that, in the Comptroller\u2019s view, supported the fraud penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The Tax Court ultimately found enough evidence of fraud under <em>Genie </em>to uphold the fraud penalty. And although the court expressed doubt about the accuracy of the assessment, it adjusted the fraud penalty to compensate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATy\">What I don\u2019t have is sufficient evidence for me to come up with the accurate percentage of how much of the total receipts come from video [poker] machines and how much come from the other sources. I know it\u2019s not a hundred percent, and I\u2019m pretty sure it was above 65 percent, but I don\u2019t know what it is in between, and I\u2019m not allowed to guess. I need sufficient evidence in the record to come up with a number, and I don\u2019t have it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The other issue I had to address is the out-credits and how much of them represented payouts. Some testimony was that it was about 25 percent on these, it looks like bartenders playing on the machines after hours, repair people putting credits onto the machines to make sure that they operated correctly. The other end of the extreme was someone who said the amount is inconsequential. Again, I don\u2019t have any testimony that gives me the ability to specify a number somewhere between 0 and 25 percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">So I will affirm the assessment that I have in front of me since I can\u2019t come up with a different number that I feel [confident] is correct. What I will do, though, is I have discretion in terms of the amount of [the] fraud penalty charge, based on the fact that I don\u2019t believe the accounting is a hundred percent accurate. As a matter of fact, I\u2019m pretty sure that it\u2019s not. I\u2019m going to reduce the fraud penalty to 50 percent, which should cover any illegal accounting by the comptroller\u2019s office, as well as allow the fact that, you know, if fraud takes place, I think there should be a penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The Tax Court\u2019s order affirmed the $2,159,724.97 assessment, charged interest through July 31, 2013 totaling $2,530,765.72, \u201cwhich interest shall accrue until the assessments are paid off in their entirety,\u201d and assessed a reduced fraud penalty in the amount of $1,079,862.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Nick\u2019s filed a Petition for Judicial Review on August 13, 2013 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The court heard argument on April 24, 2014, and on June 5, 2014, filed a Memorandum Opinion affirming the Tax Court\u2019s decision. Nick\u2019s filed a timely Notice of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Nick\u2019s presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-10\">1. Whether the Tax Court erred in imposing a civil fraud penalty without finding intent to evade payment of a tax known to be owed within the meaning of [\u00a7] 13-703 of the Tax\u2014General Article; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>2. Whether the Tax Court erred in affirming the Comptroller\u2019s assessment when the assessment was based upon inarguably and admittedly erroneous assumptions and other evidence that the Comptroller failed to preserve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Nick\u2019s argues that the Tax Court erred in assessing a penalty for civil fraud. It claims that neither the company nor its employees nor its professionals knew that the company owed tax on payouts, and that the Tax Court found as much. It argues that this ignorance belies any intent to evade payment of the tax, and without that intent, there can be no finding of fraud. Nick\u2019s also argues that the Comptroller has assessed an admittedly erroneous amount against them\u2014 exacerbated by his failure to preserve the motherboards\u2014and that the Tax Court must be reversed for affirming the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The Comptroller counters that the Tax Court properly assessed a fraud penalty under the holding of <em>Genie. </em>He further argues that substantial evidence supports the assessment, and draws our attention to the fact that a fully accurate assessment was impossible because Nick\u2019s failed to maintain adequate records. The Comptroller claims that the statutory scheme empowered him to \u201cestimate the tax owed by Nick\u2019s using the limited documents and data that were available,\u201d and he asserts that he \u201cdid [his] best to come up with a reasonable estimate under the circumstances.\u201d The Comptroller argues finally that he cannot be penalized for the destruction of the motherboards because he never possessed or even inspected them.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">We hold that the assessment was reasonable, that there were sufficient badges of fraud to sustain the Tax Court\u2019s fraud penalty, and that the Comptroller should not have been sanctioned for the destruction of the motherboards.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">We undertake a \u201cseverely limited\u201d review of Tax Court decisions. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury, Income Tax Division v. Diebold, Inc., </em>279 Md. 401, 407, 369 A.2d 77 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>(1977).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We give great deference to the Tax Court\u2019s fact-finding, and \u201cgreat weight to the Tax Court\u2019s interpretation of the tax laws, but review its application of the case law without special deference.\u201d <em>State Dep\u2019t of Ass\u2019t &amp; Taxation v. Andrecs, </em>444 Md. 585, 604, 120 A.3d 734 (2015) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">For its part, Nick\u2019s appears to take no issue with the Tax Court\u2019s fact-finding as such, but instead challenges the adequacy of the record to support the Tax Court\u2019s findings and its legal authority to assess taxes and impose penalties in the face of evidentiary gaps.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">A. <em>Rossville Vending </em>Is Controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">It is rare that a claim of \u201ctax confusion\u201d can be refuted so thoroughly, let alone by a reported decision of an appellate court old enough to drink alcohol or gamble in a casino. This is just such a case. In 1993\u2014three years before Nick\u2019s was incorporated\u2014we decided <em>Rossville Vending Machine Corp. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>97 Md.App. 305, 629 A.2d 1283 (1993), a case that involved the admissions and amusement tax liability of a nearly identical Baltimore County-based video poker business:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">Rossville owned a number of video poker machines that it placed in bars, restaurants, and other establishments frequented by the general public (collectively referred to hereafter as \u201cestablishments\u201d or singularly as \u201cestablishment\u201d). The machines were activated by patrons placing quarters in them. A player accumulated \u201cpoints\u201d or \u201ccredits\u201d as he or she played and got winning poker hands. When the player accumulated sufficient \u201ccredits\u201d or \u201cpoints,\u201d he or she would be paid winnings in cash directly by the owner, or owner\u2019s employee, of the establishment (not Rossville), based on the player\u2019s number of accumulated \u201ccredits\u201d or \u201cpoints.\u201d It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>was conceded that such payouts constituted violations of Maryland\u2019s anti-gambling laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">Rossville\u2019s financial arrangements with each owner of an establishment included a fifty-fifty split of the revenues received from the play of the machines in that establishment, after reimbursement for the owner\u2019s winnings payouts and deduction of expenses such as fees and taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ay-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 307, 629 A.2d 1283. Unlike Nick\u2019s, however, Rossville Vending received documentation of payouts from the bar and restaurant owners, and reflected the payouts in its internal accounting. <em>Id. </em>at 307-08, 629 A.2d 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Ultimately, the County Police investigated Rossville and raided its offices and various establishments where Rossville had installed, video poker machines. <em>Id. </em>at 308, 629 A.2d 1283. The County Police seized Rossville\u2019s accounting records, and turned them over to the Comptroller\u2019s office. <em>Id. </em>And although Rossville had paid taxes on profits from the machines, the Comptroller took the position that payouts to customers were also taxable, and levied a deficiency assessment against Rossville. <em>Id. </em>at 308-09, 629 A.2d 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Rossville appealed to the Maryland Tax Court, and the Tax Court affirmed the assessment. <em>Rossville, </em>97 Md.App. at 310, 629 A.2d 1283. Ultimately, so did we. We explained that the admissions and amusement tax statute has \u201ccontained the operative phrase \u2018gross receipts\u2019 as the basis for computation of the tax\u201d since it was enacted in 1936, <em>id. </em>at 316, 629 A.2d 1283, and that the plain meaning of the statute imputed tax liability for payouts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">[W]e conclude that the natural and ordinary significance of \u201cgross receipts\u201d as used in the context of the Maryland admissions and amusement tax statute, both in 1936 when it was enacted originally and today, provides no room for reasonable argument that it contemplates deductions or adjustments for expenses, partner/co-venturer reimbursements, or trade discounts before calculation of the tax due. We conclude further that there is no need for further investigation of appellant\u2019s references to foreign authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>or its arguments by analogy to other taxing situations. Where \u201cthere is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of a statute, there is usually no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 318, 629 A.2d 1283 (quoting <em>City of Baltimore v. Hackley, </em>300 Md. 277, 283, 477 A.2d 1174 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Nick\u2019s concedes that illegal payouts were made on its video poker machines and that it did not pay taxes on those payouts. Nick\u2019s also does not dispute that <em>Rossville </em>is binding here, and by implication, it does not appear to dispute that it owes <em>some amount </em>of taxes. Instead, Nick\u2019s pleads ignorance: it claims that despite Mr. Zorzit\u2019s personal relationship with the owners of Rossville Vending and knowledge of that business, no one at Nick\u2019s, nor its experienced attorney, nor its experienced accountant knew that <em>Rossville </em>was on the books until the Comptroller levied this assessment. As a result, it claims, neither Nick\u2019s nor Mr. Zorzit had or could have formed the intention to withhold taxes. <em>Second, </em>Nick\u2019s takes issue with the Comptroller\u2019s computation of tax liability, and argues that the Tax Court should have adopted their much lower estimate of the amount owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">B. Substantial Evidence Supports The Tax Court\u2019s Finding That Nick\u2019s Committed Fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Both the Comptroller and Nick\u2019s argue that <em>Genie &amp; Co. </em>controls the question of whether Nick\u2019s can properly be found to have committed fraud. Both are correct in that regard. <em>Genie </em>concerned a diesel fuel distributor. <em>Id. </em>at 554, 668 A.2d 1013. At the time the case was decided, diesel fuel that was used for transportation was taxed at a higher rate than diesel fuel used for other purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 555, 668 A.2d 1013. Although the retail purchaser of the diesel fuel usually paid the tax, the statute required distributors like Genie to collect, report, and remit the tax. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">The Comptroller investigated Genie\u2019s operations and determined that over the relevant time period, Genie had failed to collect roughly half of the taxes for which it was responsible. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 557-58, 668 A.2d 1013. The investigation demonstrated that Genie had essentially made inappropriate, tax-free sales to five large commercial customers. <em>Id. </em>at 558-59, 668 A.2d 1013. Genie ultimately conceded as much, but argued to the Comptroller, and subsequently at the Tax Court, that it had held a good-faith-but-mistaken belief that these customers were tax-exempt. <em>Genie, </em>107 Md.App. at 559, 668 A.2d 1013. The Comptroller, in addition to levying an assessment for the unpaid taxes, had imposed a penalty for fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 558, 668 A.2d 1013. Genie argued at the Tax Court, the Circuit Court, and eventually in this Court, that the penalty was erroneous as a matter of law because Genie lacked the requisite intent to defraud the Comptroller. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 668 A.2d 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">We, along with the Tax Court and Circuit Court, affirmed the fraud penalty. Noting that \u201cthe elements of tax fraud ... are seldom confessed by the accused party,\u201d we held that \u201c[djirect evidence that fraud was committed is not necessary; rather, it is more often inferred by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, 668 A.2d 1013. Because of the paucity of Maryland case law on the issue at that point, we imported the federal \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d doctrine,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and identified seven factors to guide courts in assessing the circumstantial evidence of fraud:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">The badges, indicia, or factors to look for in the tax fraud context include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">(1) consistent and substantial understatements of income (or sales, in the sales tax arena);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">(2) failure to maintain adequate records;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">(3) implausible or inconsistent explanations of behavior, including the lack of credible testimony before a tribunal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">(4) concealment of assets;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-12\">(5) failure to cooperate fully with tax authorities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>(6) awareness of the obligations to file returns, report income or sales, and pay taxes; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">(7) failure to file returns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 568, 668 A.2d 1013. Importantly, we held that \u201cno one badge or factor should be given excessive weight\u201d and that it was \u201cnot [ ] required that a specified number of badges be present to invoke the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 668 A.2d 1013. And on the record in that case, we held that substantial evidence supported the Tax Court\u2019s finding that Genie had committed at least four badges of fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 570, 668 A.2d 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">We reach the same conclusion here. Not only is there substantial evidence to find badges one, two, and four in this case, but the presence of these badges is conceded. In the unique world of video poker devices, \u201cin-credits\u201d are the equivalent of sales, and every witness for Nick\u2019s who was asked the question testified that Nick\u2019s kept no records of gross revenue on the machines. Because Nick\u2019s failed to keep records of gross revenue, it obviously failed to report sales to the Comptroller, thereby satisfying badges one and two. Although Nick\u2019s witnesses never referred explicitly to these activities as \u201cconcealment of assets,\u201d each testified that he knew the payouts were illegal. The logical conclusion is obvious: payouts (and thus gross revenue) were concealed to avoid criminal liability. If that were not enough to constitute concealment of assets, then certainly Nick\u2019s accounting methods\u2014recording only the net income by location rather than breaking down machine by machine\u2014supports a finding that Nick\u2019s intended to conceal revenue as it came in.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The Tax Court found that each of these three badges had been proven, and added badge number six: awareness of the obligation to file returns, report income or sales, and pay taxes. Nick\u2019s does not contest its awareness of its obligation to pay taxes, but professes somehow not to have known that it owed admissions or amusement taxes on gambling payouts. The Tax Court did not find in so many words that Nick\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>witnesses were lying, but did find their ignorance of the law to be awfully convenient, if not purposeful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">There was a lot of testimony about what [Nick\u2019s] knew about the obligation to pay taxes on the payouts and [Mr. Zorzit\u2019s] conversation, or lack of conversations with the CPA and internal accountant. It appeared to me that this was a subject that was never discussed. I did not get the impression that Mr. Zorzit ever specifically asked Mr. Friedman [Nick\u2019s outside CPA] or his own accountant, \u2018Do I owe admissions tax on these payouts?\u2019 in part because they were illegal and part, I guess, because he never gave it a lot of thought. So neither of them did any explicit research into whether or not there was an obligation to collect and remit taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Nick\u2019s argues that this passage represents a finding by the Tax Court that the company lacked intent to defraud. We disagree. At best\u2014and this is a stretch\u2014the Tax Court could be read as finding that Nick\u2019s opted not to research (or have its professionals research) its liability for taxes on illegal gambling income. This sort of willful blindness is close enough, especially given the deferential standard we apply to Tax Court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">In fact, Nick\u2019s own witnesses revealed a sophisticated operation engineered to generate uncertainty and deflect blame. Nick\u2019s installed video poker machines at locations that, as often as not, Mr. Zorzit owned. Nick\u2019s facilitated the licensing process. The company knew that bar and restaurant owners were making payouts, and Nick\u2019s profited directly (and handsomely) from that business. And Nick\u2019s affirmatively failed to keep any records of this revenue. Nick\u2019s touts the decades of experience that its accountants and attorney have in this field, but expected the Tax Court to believe that these seasoned professionals had no knowledge of a twenty-plus-year-old, totally-on-point appellate decision\u2014and now asks us to hold as a matter of law that the Tax Court lacked substantial evidence to reject Nick\u2019s ignorance defense. The Tax Court didn\u2019t need to find in so many words that Mr. Zorzit or Nick\u2019s or the professionals knew specifically about the <em>Rossville </em>case\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>under <em>Genie, </em>it is enough that substantial circumstantial evidence supported this fourth badge of fraud. Combined with the other three badges, we hold that the record before the Tax Court amply supported its finding from circumstantial evidence of intent to defraud, and we affirm the Tax Court\u2019s penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">C. The Tax Court Did Not Err In Adopting The Comptroller\u2019s Assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The Tax General Article authorizes counties to impose admissions and amusement taxes, TG \u00a7 4-102, and requires the Comptroller to collect those taxes. TG \u00a7 2-109. Parties subject to the tax must file returns with the Comptroller, TG \u00a7 4-201, and must ensure that those returns are accurate. TG \u00a7 4-202. The Tax General Article anticipates, however, that some parties will not keep accurate records, and empowers the Comptroller to assess taxes in these situations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">(a) If a person or governmental unit fails to keep the records required under \u00a7 4-202 of this article, the Comptroller may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">(1) compute the admissions and amusement tax by using a factor that the Comptroller develops pursuant to subsection (c) of this section; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">(2) assess the tax due.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">(b) The factor utilized by the Comptroller pursuant to this section shall be developed by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-11\">(1) a survey of the business of the person or governmental unit, including any available records;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-12\">(2) a survey of other persons or governmental units engaged in the same or similar business; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-13\">(3) other means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">TG \u00a7 13-403. No case has clearly addressed the limits of the phrase \u201cother means.\u201d But this case does not require us to engage in an extended exercise in statutory construction. \u201cIf the words of the statute, construed according to their common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d <em>Walzer v. Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 572, 911 A.2d 427 (2006) (quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994)). It is true that the plain meaning must be considered in the context of the statutory scheme as a whole. <em>See generally Breitenbach v. N.B. Handy Co., </em>366 Md. 467, 784 A.2d 569 (2001) (holding the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of a provision was rendered ambiguous, and ultimately, incorrect, by the purpose and context of the broader Act). But \u201cif the plain meaning of the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, and consistent with both the broad purposes of the legislation, and the specific purpose of the provision being interpreted, our inquiry is at an end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473, 784 A.2d 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Plainly, use of the term \u201cother means\u201d suggests the legislature intended to vest broad discretion in the Comptroller to calculate assessments against parties that have not kept complete records. Put another way, a taxpayer that fails to fulfill its legal obligation to keep records cannot, by doing so, hamstring the Comptroller from estimating and assessing taxes reasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Everybody agrees, including the Comptroller himself, that his calculations were not perfect. But in the context of this record\u2014or, more precisely, the distinct absence of the relevant financial records\u2014the Comptroller\u2019s calculations were supported by substantial evidence. As revenue came in, Nick\u2019s actively failed to track the sources of its revenue. The Comptroller was left only with revenue totals, and some evidence to suggest that the vast majority of revenue came from video poker. Indeed, the only bar owner in the Nick\u2019s network to speak to the figures told County Police that video poker devices brought in $7,000-$10,000 per week, while the pool table and jukebox brought in only $50 and $300-$400 per week respectively. Without any concrete numbers or records, the Comptroller was not out of line to assume that <em>all </em>revenue came from video poker for the sake of assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>At the same time, the County Police had seized a large number of machines from Nick\u2019s, and analyzed the accounting data contained in their motherboards. The Comptroller took this data, and calculated the amount of illegal payouts that appeared to have taken place. Using these figures\u2014the only records available\u2014the Comptroller calculated Nick\u2019s liability, as best he could.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We share the parties\u2019 rightful concern about the outer limits of the Comptroller\u2019s discretion to devise assessment methods, but this case does not present such an extreme question. Nick\u2019s asks us to find as a matter of law that the Comptroller <em>was required </em>to rely on the uncorroborated guesstimate\u2014his word\u2014of a former employee and friend to calculate the unpaid tax liability over the Comptroller\u2019s best estimate. As imprecise as the Comptroller\u2019s calculation might be, Nick\u2019s alternative would reward exactly the sort of tax-evasive behavior the law is meant to deter and sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In his own words, here is Mr. Zorzit\u2019s take on the illegal payouts made to his customers, and Nick\u2019s institutional knowledge of payouts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">Q: Okay. So you knew from day one, even back to [your previous business], that illegal payouts were being made to customers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">A: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">Q: I want you to describe for the Court why you believe the Comptroller\u2019s methodology for calculating tax associated with payouts made by bar owners is incorrect or flawed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">A: Well, it\u2019s several things ... I\u2019ve never seen their numbers, but, you know, they took their numbers in account for all the reasons why you would knock off plays. There\u2019s probably more. But sitting here right this minute, I\u2019m drawing a blank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Q: Okay. My question to you is, did you have any records, or data, that you could have given to the Comptroller for [2000-2003]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">A: In 2009?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">Q: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">A: If we did, we gave it to you, and I don\u2019t think we had anything, did we?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">Q: Not that I\u2019m aware of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">A: Well, then our office gave everything we had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">Q: You didn\u2019t keep track of the payouts that you made? A: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-11\">Q: Okay. Well, you would agree with me that if you [had] done that, you would be creating records of a criminal enterprise, wouldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-12\">A: I didn\u2019t even in my wildest dreams think that this is criminal, [Counsel]. When the Comptroller\u2019s Office, when the Baltimore County Police Department, when the Baltimore City Police Department\u2014there is nobody hiding nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-13\">Q: But Mr. Zorzit, my question is, wouldn\u2019t you agree that if you kept records of illegal payouts, you would be creating evidence of a criminal enterprise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-14\">A: I never thought of it that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-15\">Q: Okay. And on paragraph c [of Nick\u2019s plea agreement with the federal government], under paragraph 3, the elements of offense, paragraph C says that, \u201cthe principals of Nick\u2019s Amusements knew that the property was derived from criminal activity.\u201d And since you were the only principal of Nick\u2019s, you are talking about yourself, that you were aware that the property was derived from criminal activity; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-16\">A: That\u2019s what it says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Q: Now it sounds as though Nick\u2019s has taken the position that not all out-credits that were recorded on some of these video poker machines resulted in payouts. Did you keep any records of how many out-credits would or would not result in payouts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">A: I didn\u2019t keep any records, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">Q: Do you know if the bar owners did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">Q: And you didn\u2019t require the bar owners to account for [ ] out-credits and how many payments were made based on how many out-credits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">Q: Okay. Now Mr. Cummings testified that ... his estimate, or he called it a guesstimate, of 25 percent [of money paid in would be paid out in winnings] was based on his experience and his observations. Do you know from your own involvement with Mr. Cummings whether he could have based it on anything else, any records, or data or anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">A: Well, there\u2019s nobody better than him to base it, because he works with it on a daily basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">Q: As far as you know, did he have any personal records that he could have looked back on to base that estimate on? A: He wouldn\u2019t have no reference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">To summarize: Nick\u2019s ran an illegal gambling operation for years, one that consistently and by design failed to keep records of its criminal activity. Its proprietor, Mr. Zorzit, has no idea how much taxable money was paid out, and the only basis that he offers for changing the Comptroller\u2019s assessment\u2014the testimony of Ben Cummings\u2014is corroborated by zero documentation, recordkeeping, or even with additional interested witness testimony. Mr. Zorzit has not even seen the Comptroller\u2019s data, so he cannot know what it is that he disagrees with, or by how much. And as his reward for failing to keep adequate records for the last ten years of his business, and failing to retain any records at all for the years 2000-2003, Mr. Zorzit asks us to find that the Tax Court erred as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>matter of law by relying on the Comptroller\u2019s calculation instead of Mr. Cummings\u2019s self-described \u201cguesstimate.\u201d If we were to adopt this argument, no rational Maryland company would keep records or file tax returns\u2014instead, they would wait to be caught, and when the Comptroller came around for an audit, smile and refer the Comptroller to the unverifiable memory of an employee. That cannot be what the law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">D. Nick\u2019s Spoliation Arguments Are Unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\"><em>Finally, </em>Nick\u2019s argues that the Comptroller\u2019s assessment must be set aside because the County Police destroyed the motherboards of the seized video poker machines, spoliation that, Nick\u2019s claims, the Comptroller was obliged to prevent. Nick\u2019s cites four cases for this proposition, all inapposite. These cases all stand for the unremarkable proposition that a party with possession or access to discoverable evidence bears the burden of notifying its opponent before allowing the evidence to be destroyed. <em>See Silvestri v. GMC, </em>271 F.3d 583 (4th Cir.2001) (plaintiff in a products liability case conceded that he had had unlimited access to the product, and an ability to prevent its destruction, and conceded that manufacturer could have and should have been given notice of his intent to sue before vehicle was destroyed, but was not); <em>Klupt v. Krongard, </em>126 Md.App. 179, 728 A.2d 727 (1999) (a party, who had always been in possession of discoverable evidence, first concealed, and then intentionally destroyed that evidence); <em>Anderson v. Litzenberg, </em>115 Md.App. 549, 694 A.2d 150 (1997) (party in possession of discoverable evidence destroyed that evidence). But here, the Comptroller neither possessed nor had access to the motherboards. He received a report from County Police based on <em>their </em>analysis of the motherboards. This report was produced to Nick\u2019s, and Nick\u2019s expert relied extensively on that report. The evidentiary advantage or gamesmanship that the spoliation rule seeks to prevent does not exist here\u2014both parties had the same access to the same evidence, and there is no misbehavior to sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.
