In March 2013, Hilltop notified Kirk that, because of numerous leasehold violations, it was terminating her lease effective April 12, 2013, and directed her to vacate the apartment by that date. When she did not do so, Hilltop filed a breach-of-lease action in the District Court of Maryland for Prince George\u2019s County seeking repossession of the property. Kirk, in turn, demanded a jury trial, claiming that the amount in controversy exceeded $15,000, the threshold sum for such a proceeding,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>thereafter transferred to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Hilltop then filed a motion to strike Kirk\u2019s jury demand, contending that the amount in controversy was, in fact, less than $15,000 and that, therefore, the District Court had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter. The circuit court agreed and, struck Kirk\u2019s demand for a jury trial, and remanded the case to the District Court for trial. From that ruling, Kirk noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">This appeal raises the question of how the \u201camount in controversy\u201d is to be calculated in disputes of this nature. A party to a landlord-tenant action may request a jury trial where \u201ceither\u201d the claim for \u201cmoney damages\u201d or \u201cthe value of the right to possession\u201d of the leased premises is over $15,000. <em>Bringe v. Collins, </em>274 Md. 338, 347, 335 A.2d 670 (1975). Because neither party asserted a claim for money damages, the only issue before us is whether Kirk\u2019s right to possession of the leased premises exceeds $15,000. If it does, Kirk\u2019s demand for a jury trial should not have been struck by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Kirk reasons that, because her lease, by its express terms, automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless terminated for good cause, she has a right to possess the apartment for an \u201cindefinite period of time\u201d and, thus, the value of her right to possess the premises should have been calculated by multiplying the annual fair market rental payment by the number of years of her remaining estimated life expectancy, the product of which, it is undisputed, exceeds $15,000. The circuit court, however, rejected Kirk\u2019s claim of what it described as an \u201cindefinite tenancy or a never-ending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>lease\u201d and endorsed, instead, the approach advocated by Hilltop, that is, that the value of Kirk\u2019s right to possess the premises should be calculated, not by multiplying her annual rent by her estimated life expectancy, but by multiplying her monthly rental payment by the number of months that remained on her current lease, which was due to expire on December 31, 2013 (approximately nine months after Hilltop notified Kirk that it was terminating the lease). In accordance with that conclusion, the court then multiplied the apartment at issue\u2019s monthly fair market rent of $1,412 by the remaining months of her lease term and found that the value of Kirk\u2019s right to possession of the premises was $12,708, and hence the amount in controversy was less than that required for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we believe that the method of computation proposed by Kirk was the correct approach to this issue, and, therefore, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s order striking Kirk\u2019s demand for a jury trial and remanding this case to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\n<em>The Lease </em>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Hilltop and Kirk executed a \u201cModel Lease For Subsidized Programs\u201d (a form lease issued by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development), in which Hilltop agreed to lease to Kirk a two-bedroom apartment in a federally subsidized \u201cproject-based\u201d Section 8 housing development located in District Heights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The earliest lease between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>parties that is in the record before us provided that the \u201cinitial term of this Agreement\u201d would \u201cbegin on January 1, 2010 and end on December 31, 2010.\u201d At the conclusion of this \u201cinitial term,\u201d the Agreement was to \u201ccontinue for successive terms of one year each unless automatically terminated as permitted\u201d under the terms of the agreement. But if the landlord wished to terminate the lease, it had to do so \u201cin accordance with HUD regulations, State and local law,\u201d which among other things, meant that it had to provide the tenant with a \u201ctermination notice\u201d specifying the date of termination and the reasons the landlord was terminating the agreement. After listing ten grounds upon which the landlord could terminate the tenancy, the lease then stated that the landlord could also terminate the agreement for \u201cother good cause.\u201d Such a termination could only occur, however, \u201cas of the end of any initial or successive term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">After Kirk\u2019s initial lease term ended, her lease was renewed for successive one-year terms. A second lease, utilizing the same \u201cModel Lease For Subsidized Programs\u201d (Form HUD-90015-a 12/2007), was executed by the parties for the time period from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012, and, as in the earlier 2010 lease, it provided that \u201cthe Agreement will continue for successive terms of one year each unless automatically terminated as permitted\u201d for \u201cgood cause.\u201d Although it does not appear that a subsequent Model Lease was executed for the lease term running from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, there is no indication in the record that either party terminated the lease, and the parties do not dispute that the 2012 agreement did, in fact, continue for another one-year term.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\n<em>The Breach of Lease</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">A letter from Hilltop dated March 7, 2013, notified Kirk that Hilltop was terminating her \u201cLease Agreement dated January 11, 2012.\u201d The letter explained that Hilltop was terminating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Bark\u2019s lease, effective April 12, 2013, because she had \u201cmaterially breached\u201d her lease by \u201callowing a fire to damage\u201d her apartment; by failing to reimburse Hilltop for that damage; by permitting her guests to engage in \u201ccriminal activity\u201d on the premises; by failing to maintain the apartment and surrounding common areas; and by \u201cdisturbing the peace and comfort\u201d of her neighbors in the apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Specifically, the letter alleged that the apartment was damaged by a fire when the stovetop was left on and unattended; that Kirk had not reimbursed Hilltop the $3,847.30 for that fire damage; that children \u201coccupying\u201d her apartment \u201cwere lighting matches and allowing them to burn holes in the staircase to the common area\u201d; that, upon inspection of her apartment, Hilltop discovered \u201cbroken blinds, broken door knobs, missing sprinkler covers, and buckling walls\u201d; that other Hilltop residents had \u201csubmitted regular complaints of noise and heavy traffic of non-residents coming from\u201d her apartment; that \u201csecurity and police have visited the property on reports of illegal activity, including use of marijuana\u201d; that an \u201caltercation involving a knife and a baton\u201d occurred in her apartment that \u201cled to significant injury\u201d to some of her guests and that one or more of them had been \u201csent to the hospital for bleeding from the head and abdomen\u201d; and finally, that, on one occasion, there were \u201cloud, verbal arguments\u201d between her guests.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">As noted, when Kirk refused to vacate her unit, Hilltop filed a breach-of-lease action in the District Court seeking repossession of her apartment. In response, Kirk demanded a jury trial and the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County where Kirk filed an Answer to the complaint in which, among other things, she denied that she had breached the lease and maintained that her eviction was unwarranted. Hilltop then moved to strike the jury trial request and to have the case remanded to the District Court for trial, on the grounds that the amount in controversy was less than the requisite $15,000 needed for a jury trial in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\n<em>The Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">On November 6, 2013, the circuit court held a hearing on Hilltop\u2019s motion to strike Kirk\u2019s demand for a jury trial. At that hearing, the parties agreed that, in a landlord-tenant action involving federally subsidized housing, the value of a tenant\u2019s right to possession of the leased premises is determined by multiplying the fair market monthly rental payment for the housing unit by \u201cthe time period for which the tenant has a right to continued possession\u201d of the premises. <em>See Carroll v. Housing Opportunities Commission, </em>306 Md. 515, 525, 510 A.2d 540 (1986). The parties also agreed that the fair market rental value of Kirk\u2019s apartment was $1,412 per month and that that figure should be multiplied by the remaining months of the tenancy to determine the value of Kirk\u2019s right to possession of the leased premises and, hence, the \u201camount in controversy.\u201d The parties disagreed, however, as to the period of time for which Kirk had \u201ca right to continued possession\u201d of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Hilltop asserted that Kirk was entitled to possess the property only until the current lease term expired on December 31, 2013. Accordingly, Hilltop claimed that the amount in controversy was $12,708, that is, $1,412 times the nine months remaining before Kirk\u2019s present lease term expired. Kirk disagreed, maintaining that, because her lease automatically renewed for successive one-year terms (unless terminated for \u201cgood cause\u201d), she was entitled to remain in possession of the property indefinitely and, therefore, the $1,412 fair market rental payment should be multiplied by the remainder of her projected lifespan. She then pointed out that she, who was then 42 years old, needed to live only an additional eleven more months (which was just two months more than her current lease term) for the value of her right to possession of the apartment to exceed $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In support of her position, Kirk invoked the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Carroll, supra, </em>and its subsequent decision in <em>Cottman v. Princess Anne Villas, </em>340 Md. 295, 666 A.2d 1233 (1995), both of which had endorsed her method of calcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>lating the amount in controversy. Hilltop responded by claiming that, because of changes in the federal subsidized housing regulations enacted in the late 1990s, <em>Carroll </em>and <em>Cottman </em>were no longer applicable, but that a later case, <em>Carter v. Maryland Management Co., </em>377 Md. 596, 835 A.2d 158 (2003), where Hilltop claimed the Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion, was. The circuit court agreed with Hilltop that <em>Carter </em>was controlling and, based on its interpretation of that case, ruled that Kirk did not have an \u201cindefinite tenancy or a never-ending lease\u201d and, therefore, it adopted Hilltop\u2019s method of calculating the amount in controversy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The parties on appeal make the same arguments they did below, that is, Kirk contends the correct method of determining the value of her continued right to possession of the leased premises is to multiply the yearly fair market rent by the expected number of years comprising her remaining lifespan. That is the correct method of calculation, Kirk maintains, because, until a court determines that her landlord has good cause to evict her, she has the right \u201cto possess her home indefinitely.\u201d As she did in the circuit court, Kirk relies on <em>Carroll, swpra, </em>and <em>Cottman, supra, </em>in support of her position. Hilltop maintains, however, that <em>Carroll </em>and <em>Cottman </em>have been superseded by <em>Carter, </em>which it claims, in effect, resolves this issue in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The issue before the Court of Appeals in <em>Carroll </em>was whether the circuit court erred in determining that a tenant of a federally subsidized housing complex had not satisfied the \u201camount-in-controversy\u201d required for a jury trial after her landlord had instituted a \u201ctenant-holding over action\u201d in the District Court of Maryland.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals began its analysis by observing that, \u201cin determining the value to the tenant of remaining in possession, one must consider\u201d the \u201cfair market rent for comparable housing in the area\u201d and \u201cthe time period for which the tenant has a right to continued posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>sion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525, 510 A.2d 540. The Court of Appeals then explained that, \u201c[w]hile the lease states that the tenancy is month to month, under applicable [federal] regulations and case law, [the tenant] has a right to remain in her townhouse indefinitely until the [landlord] can establish good cause for eviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201cthe value of this potential flow of future federal rent subsidies,\u201d declared the Court, was a \u201ccritical factor\u201d in calculating the amount in controversy. <em>Id. </em>Then, after noting that other \u201ccourts have computed the value of the right to occupy federally subsidized housing over the tenant\u2019s remaining life span, or a least over a period of years,\u201d the Court of Appeals adopted that method of computation and found, using that approach, that \u201c[t]here can be no doubt that ... the value of [the tenant\u2019s] right to possession\u201d exceeded the amount in controversy necessary for a jury trial and reversed the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>at 527, 510 A.2d 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Nine years later, the Court of Appeals in <em>Cottman, supra, </em>\u201creaffirm[ed]\u201d that \u201cthe amount in controversy in an action for possession of leased premises is determined by the fair market rent for the period of possession involved in the controversy,\u201d 340 Md. at 297, 666 A.2d 1233, and that, the period of possession, where the lease automatically renews unless otherwise terminated for good cause, is the tenant\u2019s remaining lifespan. <em>Id. </em>at 299, 666 A.2d 1233. In sum, <em>Carroll </em>and <em>Cottman </em>clearly support Kirk\u2019s position that, when calculating the amount in controversy in this case, the correct approach to determining the value of her right to possession of her federally subsidized apartment is to multiply the yearly fair market rent by the number of years comprising Kirk\u2019s remaining life span. Hilltop, however, disagrees and, as noted earlier, suggests that the Court of Appeals\u2019 more recent decision in <em>Carter, supra, </em>disapproved, at least implicitly, the holdings of <em>Carroll </em>and <em>Cottman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In <em>Carter, </em>the Court of Appeals addressed whether a landlord participating in the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program may use Maryland\u2019s tenant-holding-over statute to evict a tenant receiving low-income housing assistance under HUD\u2019s voucher program under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>377 Md. at 598, 835 A.2d 158. Generally, the tenant-holding-over statute, Real Prop., \u00a7 8-402, permits a landlord to recover possession of leased property upon finding that the tenant\u2019s lease has expired, that notice to quit was given, and that the tenant has refused to vacate. <em>Id. </em>at 598, 835 A.2d 158. Rhonda Carter, the tenant in this case, argued that she was not a tenant holding over because the duration of her lease was \u201cindefinite,\u201d given the fact that federal regulations prohibited the landlord from terminating the lease absent \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">At issue in <em>Carter </em>was a townhome, leased to Carter, in a project owned by Maryland Management Company as part of the \u201cSection 8 Tenant-Based Assistance Rental Voucher Program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599, 835 A.2d 158. In 2001, several years after certain federal regulations relating to the requirements for terminating leases under the <em>voucher </em>program were changed, Carter entered into a new lease with her landlord. That lease had a one-year lease term, which was renewable thereafter on a month-to-month basis. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 835 A.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Upon discovering that Carter had violated certain provisions of the lease agreement, the landlord sent Carter notice that it intended to terminate the lease. <em>Id. </em>at 601, 835 A.2d 158. When Carter failed to vacate the home, the landlord filed, in the District Court of Maryland, both a breach-of-lease action under Md.Code, Real Prop. \u00a7 8-402.1 and a tenant-holding-over suit under Real Prop. \u00a7 8-402. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 835 A.2d 158. After finding that there was good cause for termination of the lease and that Carter was, in fact, a tenant holding over, the District Court entered judgment in favor of the landlord under the tenant-holding-over statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Carter sought review of that decision by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, contending that her lease term was indefinite and without any fixed term, that the tenant-holding-over statute was therefore inapplicable, and that her landlord, in any event, had failed to establish \u201cgood cause\u201d to terminate her tenancy. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 835 A.2d 158. Finding no merit to either of these contentions, the circuit court affirmed, <em>id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>602, 835 A.2d 158, whereupon Carter petitioned the Court of Appeals for writ of certiorari, which that Court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">While acknowledging that a landlord participating in the federal low-income tax credit program could \u201cnot terminate the tenancy of a low-income tenant other than for good cause,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 608, 835 A.2d 158, the Court of Appeals rejected the argument that the \u201cgood cause\u201d termination requirement gave Carter \u201ca right or entitlement to continued occupancy\u201d of the housing unit and thereby \u201ceffectively convert[ed] a fixed lease term into an indefinite one that continues in existence and does not expire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609, 835 A.2d 158. The Court, relying on 1998 statutory and regulatory changes which \u201cconsolidated the certificate and voucher programs in a new [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1437f(o),\u201d <em>id. </em>at 611, 835 A.2d 158, noted that, although the federal regulations \u201ccontinue to require an initial lease of one year ..., <em>gone are the provisions requiring automatic renewal.\u201d Id. </em>at 612, 835 A.2d 158 (emphasis added). Indeed, there are new provisions, the Court pointed out, \u201crequiring the lease to conform with standard leases in the community and with State landlord-tenant law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">Whether [the pre-1998 version of \u00a7 1437f, and the regulations implementing it] would have gone further and supported the notion of an indefinite tenancy is a moot point now, as the provisions in the old law that may have supported that proposition have been deleted in favor of the requirement that voucher program leases be consistent with leases generally used in the community, leases, like the one in this case, that ordinarily carry fixed expiration dates and permit eviction under the State tenant holding over law. The new, current, provisions clearly militate against the notion of an indefinite tenancy\u2014a never ending lease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 612, 835 A.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">In ruling on Hilltop\u2019s motion to strike Kirk\u2019s demand for a jury trial on the grounds that the amount in controversy was less than $15,000, the circuit court determined that <em>Carter </em>was \u201cbinding\u201d and, in accordance with that decision, concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>that Kirk did not have \u201can indefinite tenancy or a never-ending lease\u201d and, therefore, the amount in controversy was less than $15,000. The circuit court\u2019s reliance on <em>Carter, </em>however, was misplaced. <em>See McDaniel v. Baranowski, </em>419 Md. 560, 574, 19 A.3d 927 (2011) (the \u201clegal relationship between landlord and tenant is governed by the contract between the parties, as well as by any statutory authority.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">As noted, the parties executed a \u201cModel Lease For Subsidized Programs\u201d\u2014a form lease HUD issued in 2007. In fact, as stated on the lease itself, the property owner was <em>\u201crequired to use the HUD model lease </em>which includes terms normally covered by leases used in the housing rental industry plus terms required by HUD for the program under which the project was built and/or the program providing rental assistance to the tenants.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Paragraph two of the Model Lease stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">The initial term of this Agreement shall begin on January 01, 2012 and end on December 31, 2012. After the initial term ends, the Agreement will continue for successive terms of one year each unless automatically terminated as permitted by paragraph 23 of this Agreement[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Later on in that lease, Paragraph 23 addressed \u201cTermination of Tenancy,\u201d stating that \u201c[a]ny termination of this Agreement by the Landlord must be carried out in accordance with HUD regulations, State and local law, and the terms of this Agreement.\u201d The lease then listed ten specific reasons for which the lease could be terminated, including the tenant\u2019s \u201cmaterial noncompliance with the terms\u201d of the lease agreement and the tenant\u2019s (or the tenant\u2019s household member or guest\u2019s) engagement in criminal activities in or near the premises. Finally, it provided that the lease could be termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>nated, \u201ceffective as of the end of the initial or any successive term,\u201d for \u201cother good cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">It is thus clear that Kirk\u2019s lease had no expiration date, but instead, would automatically renew for \u201csuccessive one year terms,\u201d unless good cause for ending the lease could be shown. Hence, Kirk, unlike Carter, had what amounted to a continuing right to possession of the premises for an indefinite period of time. This alone sinks Hilltop\u2019s claim that <em>Carter </em>requires us to affirm the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">But if that were not enough, we note that, in rejecting the notion of an \u201cindefinite tenancy\u201d in <em>Carter, </em>the Court of Appeals relied upon changes to the subsidized housing regulations that were enacted in the late 1990s and concluded that, while the federal regulations \u201ccontinue to require an initial lease of one year ..., <em>gone are the provisions requiring automatic renewal.\u201d </em>377 Md. at 612, 835 A.2d 158 (emphasis added). That observation, while perhaps applicable to the <em>tenant-based voucher </em>program at issue in <em>Carter, </em>is not relevant to the <em>project-based </em>housing program here, as Kirk\u2019s lease\u2014on a standard form issued by HUD four years after <em>Carter </em>was decided\u2014does, in fact, expressly provide for automatic renewal of the lease term.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">And that is the conclusion that we recently reached in <em>Grady Management, Inc. v. Epps, </em>218 Md.App. 712, 98 A.3d 457 (2014), a case that also addressed a landlord-tenant dispute involving a <em>project-based </em>federal housing program. <em>Id. </em>at 716 n. 2, 98 A.3d 457. In that case, a \u201cmodel lease\u201d was executed between a tenant and a property owner for a unit in a subsidized apartment project regulated under the Section 8 New Construction Program. <em>Id.. </em>As Kirk\u2019s lease did, the lease between the property owner and the tenant, Jesse Epps, provided that, \u201c[ajfter the initial term ends, the Agreement will continue for successive terms of one Year each unless automatically terminated as permitted by paragraph 23 of this Agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Paragraph 23 of that lease then set forth the same grounds for termination as those that appeared in Kirk\u2019s model lease, including termination for the tenant\u2019s \u201cmaterial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>noncompliance\u201d with the lease terms or for \u201cother good cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 716-717, 98 A.3d 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">When the landlord filed a \u201ctenant-holding-over\u201d action in the District Court seeking to evict Epps, Epps demanded a jury trial, whereupon the matter was transferred to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. <em>Id. </em>at 719, 98 A.3d 457. The circuit court ultimately granted Epps\u2019s motion for summary judgment, agreeing with him that the tenant-holding-over statute did not provide a legal basis for evicting him because his lease had no \u201cdefinite term\u201d and it could only be terminated for good cause. <em>Id. </em>at 720, 98 A.3d 457. The landlord appealed and we affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">After stressing that \u201cthe differences in the federal leasing programs and the leases involved in <em>Carter </em>and in <em>[Grady Management v. Epps </em>] are important,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 728, 98 A.3d 457 we noted that Epps\u2019s lease was distinct from the tenant\u2019s lease in <em>Carter </em>as Epps\u2019s lease (as Kirk\u2019s lease did) provided for \u201cautomatic renewal\u201d and could only be terminated for \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732, 98 A.3d 457. We further stated that, \u201c[bjecause Mr. Epps\u2019 lease continues for successive terms, his right to possession continues for an indefinite period, and thus, until termination for good cause, he is in possession under what at that point in time is an \u2018unexpired lease.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Cottman, supra, </em>340 Md. at 298, 666 A.2d 1233.) <em>Id. </em>at 733-734, 98 A.3d 457. Reiterating that, \u201cin a project-based subsidized lease program, such as the New Construction Program, the lease term continues, rather than expires,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 735, 98 A.3d 457 we then affirmed the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Epps\u2019s favor, stating, in part: \u201cNot only was Mr. Epps not a holdover tenant when the tenant holding over action was initiated, he does not reach holdover status until good cause has been established under the R.P. \u00a7 8-402.1 standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 738, 98 A.3d 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In short, the decisions in <em>Carroll, Cottman, </em>and <em>Epps </em>compel us to conclude that it is well-established that, unless \u201cgood cause\u201d exists to terminate Kirk\u2019s lease, her right to possess the premises continues indefinitely. Accordingly, the correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>method of calculating the amount in controversy in this case, that is, the value of Kirk\u2019s right to possession of the leased premises, should be determined by multiplying the annual fair market rental payment by her remaining estimated life expectancy, a product which the parties agree exceeds the amount required for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED.
