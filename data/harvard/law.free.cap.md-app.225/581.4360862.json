Immanuel requested a list of the top 5,000 \u201cunclaimed property accounts ... that have been with your agency for 24 months or more ... formatted from largest account values to smallest account values.\u201d The Comptroller denied Immanuel\u2019s MPIA request on the grounds that the information requested contained individual financial information, which is prohibited from disclosure under the MPIA. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2014), \u00a7 4-336(b) of the General Provisions Article (\u201cGP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">On May 4, 2012, Immanuel filed a petition for judicial review of the Comptroller\u2019s denial in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County. By order dated July 13, 2012, the court directed the Comptroller to comply with Immanuel\u2019s MPIA request. Immanuel also filed a motion to seal the case record on the grounds that the record contained his trade secrets, which the court granted. The Comptroller filed an appeal to this Court, which reversed and remanded the case in a published opinion, <em>Comptroller of Treasury v. Immanuel, </em>216 Md.App. 259, 85 A.3d 878 (2014) <em>(\u201cImmanuel I </em>\u201d). In <em>Imman-uel I, </em>we concluded that \u201cImmanuel should emerge on remand with a list of claims that tracks the Comptroller\u2019s disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>obligations under the Abandoned Property Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 85 A.3d 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">On remand, on July 21, 2014, the circuit court ordered Immanuel to submit a modified MPIA request, limited to accounts received by the Comptroller within 365 days with a value of $100 or greater, without any sorting by value or other financial information. In addition, the court vacated its order to seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">On appeal, Immanuel presents two questions for our review, which we have slightly rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">1. Did the circuit court err or abuse its discretion by not following this Court\u2019s mandate on remand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">2. Did the circuit court err by vacating its order to seal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">We answer both questions in the negative and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The background for this case is set forth in <em>Immanuel I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADG\">In his role as legal custodian of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of unclaimed property, the Comptroller enters and stores in a database information regarding the property he is holding and who might be entitled to claim it. As the Comptroller receives each piece of abandoned property, his staff logs data about the property, its value, and the likely owner into the Comptroller\u2019s database. The Comptroller is required by the Abandoned Property Act to publish annually, in local newspapers, the names and last known addresses of those individuals who appear to be the owners of property valued at $100 or more, although the published list does not disclose either the nature of unclaimed items of property or their value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">[] Immanuel is a \u201ctracer,\u201d someone who locates the owners of unclaimed property held by the Comptroller and, for a fee, assists those people in obtaining their property. On November 3, 2011, [] Immanuel sent a letter to the Comptroller requesting \u201ca printout of all unclaimed proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ty accounts\u201d that had been unclaimed for two years or longer. In addition to requesting publicly available information\u2014specifically, the names and last-known addresses of those entitled to the property\u2014he asked the Comptroller to format the list \u201cfrom largest account values to smallest account values\u201d and to provide him \u201cwith the listing of the top 5,000 accounts after this formatting is done.\u201d In his request, [ ] Immanuel acknowledged that the Public Information Act prohibited him from receiving \u201cinformation concerning the specific value of each account or a description of the property,\u201d and he asked that, once the list was sorted, the specific values be removed. Although the Comptroller, with the help of his information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) department, has the ability to perform [ ] Immanuel\u2019s request, the Comptroller denied it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">Since 1978, [ ] Immanuel has submitted requests asking for lists of names and addresses sorted by value. The Comptroller granted those requests until 1992. That year, however, the Attorney General issued an opinion stating that the Public Information Act prohibited the Comptroller from disclosing the monetary value of individual items of unclaimed property to members of the public. [ ] Immanu-el, nonetheless, made five other requests in the years since, all five of which, including the one at issue, the Comptroller denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">[On May 4, 2012,] Immanuel filed a petition seeking judicial review of the Comptroller\u2019s most recent denial in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County. The court held a hearing [on June 7, 2012,] and took testimony from [] Immanuel and Eric Eichler, the Assistant Manager of the Comptroller\u2019s Unclaimed Property Unit. According to [] Eichler, the Comptroller\u2019s IT staff logs information about each piece of unclaimed property into a database as the Comptroller receives it. From there, the IT staff can extract and sort data from the database, and does so for non-agency requesters with enough regularity that he maintains (and publishes on a \u201cform letter\u201d) a schedule of fees. [ ] Eichler acknowledged that the Comptroller maintains \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>list available for the public if they need to, but it\u2019s not sorted by dollar value.\u201d He also testified that the Comptroller extracts and produces lists from this database in batches of 10,000 records in the normal course, for which it charges $500, and that the Comptroller\u2019s fee schedule includes at least some forms of sorting. (\u201cQ. But if my client were willing to pay for the [dollar-value] sort, doesn\u2019t this fee schedule cover that potential? A. Yes, depending on what the sort is, I assume.\u201d)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court declared that \u201c[t]aking the additional step of formatting the list before redacting the financial information does nothing to reveal prohibited information.\u201d Then, observing that \u201cdisclosure of public records is favored\u201d in Maryland, the court granted [ ] Immanuel the relief he sought \u00e1nd ordered the Comptroller to provide him with the information in the format he had requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 263-65, 85 A.3d 878 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The circuit court issued an Opinion and Order on July 13, 2012, ordering the Comptroller to \u201ccomply with [Immanuel\u2019s MPIA] request and provide the unclaimed property records in the manner requested therein.\u201d On July 23, 2012, Immanuel filed a Motion to Seal or Otherwise Limit Inspection of a Case Record (Rule 16-1009(a)(l)(A)) (\u201cMotion to Seal\u201d) on the grounds that the record contained his trade secrets. On August 9, 2012, the court granted Immanuel\u2019s motion to seal the case record (\u201corder to seal\u201d). Also on August 9, 2012, the Comptroller filed his notice of appeal of the court\u2019s July 13, 2012 Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">On April 18, 2013, Immanuel filed a Motion to Seal the Record with this Court. We granted Immanuel\u2019s Motion to Seal the Record on May 9, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">On January 29, 2014, this Court decided <em>Immanuel I. </em>We stated therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">[W]e hold that, in light of the Abandoned Property Act, the request seeks information that the Comptroller is required to disclose. That said, we also hold that a list sorted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>dollar value would reveal additional individual financial information [that] Immanuel is not entitled to have, and we find that his request may be overbroad in one other way as well. So although [ ] Immanuel is entitled to the bulk of the information he has requested, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings for the limited purpose of determining the precise scope and format of the list the Comptroller must produce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">216 Md.App. at 262-68, 85 A.3d 878 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">On February 5, 2014, Immanuel filed a second MPIA request with the Comptroller, asking \u201cthat the top 100 accounts be made available to [him], include all data that is available to [him] that will not be considered private or confidential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">On February 5, 2014, Immanuel filed a Motion to Seal the Opinion with this Court, requesting that we change the designation of <em>Immanuel I </em>to unreported. Also, on February 20, 2014, Immanuel filed a Motion to Redact the Opinion with this Court, requesting that we redact the opinion of <em>Immanuel I </em>and change its designation to unreported. On February 28, 2014, the Comptroller filed with this Court a motion for partial reconsideration and opposition to Immanuel\u2019s motions to seal and redact the opinion. The Comptroller noted in its motion that Immanuel\u2019s February 5, 2014 MPIA request</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">demonstrates [that] the Court\u2019s decision could be read to permit requesters to obtain comparative financial information about unclaimed property owners and to effectively allow these requesters to create their own ranking of claims by value\u2014a type of information that this Court explicitly held was exempt from disclosure. The Comptroller therefore respectfully requests that the Court reconsider its decision and hold that [ ] Immanuel is not entitled to a list of any \u201ctop number\u201d of claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">On March 5, 2014, this Court denied Immanuel\u2019s motions to seal and redact <em>Immanuel I. </em>On March 27, 2014, we denied the Comptroller\u2019s motion for partial reconsideration, because \u201c[t]he issues raised by the Comptroller in the Motion for</p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Partial Reconsideration must be considered, in the first instance, by the circuit court and upon an appropriate record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">On July 11, 2014, the Comptroller filed a Memorandum of Law on Remand with the circuit court. Immanuel filed his own memorandum on July 17, 2014. On July 21, 2014, the court held a hearing pursuant to our remand order. After the hearing and on the same day, the court issued an Order (1) directing Immanuel to submit a \u201cmodified\u201d MPIA request, limited to accounts received by the Comptroller within 365 days with a value of $100 or greater, without any sorting by value or other financial information, and (2) ordering the Comptroller to comply with such request. In addition, the court denied Immanuel\u2019s oral request to continue to seal the case and vacated its earlier order to seal. On August 18, 2014, Immanuel filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Maryland Rule 8\u2014604(d)(1) provides that, \u201c[u]pon remand, the lower court shall conduct any further proceedings necessary to determine the action in accordance with the opinion and order of the appellate court.\u201d Rule 8-606(e) states that, upon receiving the appellate court\u2019s mandate, \u201cthe lower court shall proceed in accordance with its terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">This Court has stated the following regarding a trial court\u2019s obligations following the issuance of an appellate opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbQ\">While the Maryland cases and rules describe generally the importance of the court\u2019s mandate and the procedures to be followed by the trial <em>court\u2014ie., </em>\u201cin accordance with the tenor and direction thereof\u2019\u2014they have not clearly described exactly what comprises the complete \u201corder\u201d or \u201cjudgment\u201d of the court. As we construe these rules, and the cases discussing them, it is apparent that, in Maryland, the opinion, at the very least, may be an integral part of the appellate court\u2019s order or mandate when that order or mandate provides for a remand for proceedings consistent with the opinion. Moreover, when it is apparent from the opinion itself that a simplified \u201corder\u201d or mandate, <em>e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u201cJudgment Reversed,\u201d is ambiguous, then the opinion may be referred to and considered an integral part of that mandate. There may be, as we discuss <em>infra, </em>many types of unitary judgments or mandates, as opposed to multiple, severable parts of judgments, in which such a \u201cJudgment Reversed\u201d order or mandate would not be ambiguous and there would be no need to refer to the opinion. Generally, however, any direction in an order or mandate that proceedings on remand are to be consistent with the opinion would necessarily require the opinion to be considered as an integral part of the judgment. This position is consistent with the law of mandates as stated by most, but not all, of the few foreign jurisdictions that have squarely addressed the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\"><em>Harrison v. Harrison, </em>109 Md.App. 652, 665-66, 675 A.2d 1003 (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 Md. 564, 683 A.2d 177 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">In <em>Immanuel I, </em>we concluded our opinion by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">[W]e reverse the judgment below and remand for further proceedings for the limited purpose of allowing the circuit court to determine the precise boundaries of the production the Comptroller must make to [ ] Immanuel. In practical terms, [ ] Immanuel should emerge on remand with a list of claims that tracks the Comptroller\u2019s disclosure obligations under the Abandoned Property Act, but that is not sorted by dollar value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">216 Md.App. at 275, 85 A.3d 878 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">Our mandate then read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-13\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMI-CO COUNTY REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

Circuit Court\u2019s Order on Remand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"alx-dedup-0\">Immanuel argues that the circuit court erred by not following this Court\u2019s mandate on remand. First, Immanuel contends that the court erred by ignoring \u201cthe instructions given to it by this Court and ordered [him] to submit a new modified request for information and thereby start the entire [M]PIA request all over.\u201d Immanuel contends that <em>Immanuel I </em>did not alter the circuit court\u2019s original judgment ordering the Comptroller to comply with his MPIA request within thirty days, and that the court should have ordered the Comptroller to submit an alphabetized list of the top 5,000 claims, without any information regarding the monetary value of such claims, to Immanuel within thirty days. Next, Immanuel argues that the circuit court\u2019s order \u201cwent beyond the purpose of the remand\u201d by requiring that his new request be limited to all accounts over $100 received by the Comptroller within 365 days prior to the date of the order, because (1) the circuit court \u201cdid not specifically order the Comptroller to provide the list of [the top] 5,000 accounts,\u201d and (2) the 365-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>day requirement \u201conly applies to the Comptroller\u2019s publication of recently obtained abandoned property,\u201d and \u201cignores the legislative requirement that [Immanuel\u2019s] fee agreement would be unenforceable if 24 months (730 days) had not passed since the property was delivered to the Comptroller\u2019s Office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Comptroller responds that the circuit court complied with this Court\u2019s remand instructions by entering an order that tracked the requirements of the Abandoned Property Act. The Comptroller argues that the circuit court\u2019s decision to require Immanuel to submit a modified request was an appropriate exercise of the discretion accorded it by this Court to \u201cdetermine the appropriate scope and mechanics of the Comptroller\u2019s production.\u201d <em>See Immanuel </em>I, 216 Md.App. at 263, 85 A.3d 878. According to the Comptroller, \u201cthis issue will soon become moot, as the Comptroller will, in the near future, be producing to [ ] Immanuel the information described in the circuit court\u2019s order without waiting for [] Immanuel to submit a modified request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Next, the Comptroller argues that Immanuel continues to seek a value-based list of claims to which he is not entitled, because the Abandoned Property Act only allows for disclosure of property valued at $100 or more, not \u201cother value-based differential of claims.\u201d According to the Comptroller, \u201ca list of the most valuable 5,000 claims necessarily provides additional individual financial information about the size of those 5,000 claims relative to\u201d claims that would appear on the larger list of property valued at $100 or more. Furthermore, the Comptroller contends that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asp\">if [ ] Immanuel were to succeed in requesting a list of the 5,000 most valuable claims, it is unclear what would stop him from subsequently submitting iterative requests for the 4,900 most valuable claims, the 4,800 most valuable claims, and on down until he had a tiered list providing essentially the same information this Court has already said he is not entitled to receive about the relative value of claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ar-dedup-0\">According to the Comptroller, such contention is not \u201cidle speculation,\u201d because Immanuel has already made a second MPIA request for a list of the top 100 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>As an initial matter, we agree with the Comptroller that Immanuel\u2019s claim of error relating to the trial court\u2019s order requiring a new MPIA request is moot, because the Comptroller agreed to disclose the information specified in the circuit court\u2019s order without a new MPIA request. At oral argument before this Court, the Comptroller\u2019s counsel disclosed that, on the day before oral argument, he e-mailed to Immanuel\u2019s counsel a list of <em>all </em>claims of unclaimed property in its possession, with no restriction by time. This list contained approximately 900,000 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">As for Immanuel\u2019s contention that the circuit court\u2019s order went beyond the purpose of the remand, we hold that the circuit court did not err or abuse the discretion that we delegated to it. In <em>Immanuel I, </em>instead of specifying exactly which information Immanuel was entitled to receive from the Comptroller, we delegated this authority to the circuit court \u201cto determine the precise boundaries of the production the Comptroller must make.\u201d 216 Md.App. at 275, 85 A.3d 878. Rather than stating that the Comptroller should disclose a list of the top 5,000 claims from the past twenty-four months or older, as Immanuel had requested, we stated that \u201cImmanuel should emerge on remand with a list of claims <em>that tracks the Comptroller\u2019s disclosure obligations under the Abandoned Property Act\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The Abandoned Property Act requires the Comptroller to disclose (1) <em>all </em>claims valued at $100 or greater, <em>not </em>merely the top 5,000 claims; (2) limits the list of claims to those received within 365 days, <em>not </em>twenty-four months or more; and (3) requires the Comptroller to list such claims in alphabetical order of the owners\u2019 names, <em>without </em>disclosing any financial information. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2013), \u00a7 17-311 of the Commercial Law (III) Article (\u201cCL\u201d). Because the circuit court ordered the Comptroller to disclose to Immanuel</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">information received by the [Comptroller] within 365 days prior to the date of this Order, said information to be limited to an alphabetical list of the names and last known addresses of individuals owning property with a value of one hundred dollars or more; said information shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>include a list of claims sorted in order of value or other financial information[,]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">its order properly tracks the Comptroller\u2019s disclosure obligations under the Abandoned Property Act, and thus complies with our instructions to that court. <em>See Immanuel I, </em>216 Md.App. at 275, 85 A.3d 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">On remand, the circuit court received memoranda of law from both parties and held a hearing. The new information obtained by the court included Immanuel\u2019s new MPIA request to the Comptroller for the \u201ctop 100\u201d most valuable claims. We agree with the Comptroller\u2019s contention that (1) not only does a list of the top 5,000 claims reveal additional individual financial information, namely that such 5,000 claims are more valuable than all other claims valued over $100 that the Comptroller is required to disclose; but (2) if we ordered the Comptroller to disclose the top 5,000 claims, Immanuel would be able to bypass our express prohibition against value-ranked claims by subsequent MPIA requests like the one that he has already submitted. <em>See Immanuel I, </em>216 Md.App. at 274, 85 A.3d 878 (stating that a value-ordered list \u201cdiscloses incremental financial information about the claim beyond the information the Abandoned Property Act requires the Comptroller to disclose\u201d). Simply put, the <em>only </em>individual financial information that the Abandoned Property Act requires the Comptroller to disclose is that the public list contains claims valued at over $100 and received within the last 365 days.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 17-311.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>At oral argument before this Court, the Comptroller\u2019s counsel stated that, although the circuit court\u2019s order was proper because it tracked the Comptroller\u2019s disclosure obligations under the Abandoned Property Act, the Comptroller does not object to releasing a list of claims older than 365 days in response to an MPIA request. In fact, as stated above, the Comptroller released to Immanuel\u2019s counsel a list of every single claim valued at over $100 that it had on file, a total of over 900,000 claims. The Comptroller stated that it would not object to MPIA requests for claims limited by time (e.g., all claims received in within the last five years), but it would continue to object to MPIA requests for claims ranked or identified by value (e.g., the top 500 most valuable claims or all claims over one million dollars). We agree with the Comptroller that a list of any specific number of claims ranked or identified by value is barred from disclosure by the MPIA, as limited by the Abandoned Property Act, because releasing such information would reveal the relative value of such claims in comparison with other claims in the Comptroller\u2019s possession, which would constitute disclosure of individual financial information. <em>See </em>GP \u00a7 4\u2014336(b); CL \u00a7 17-311; <em>see also Immanuel I, </em>216 Md.App. at 267-68, 85 A.3d 878. Nothing in our decision, however, precludes the Comptroller from releasing information on claims older than 365 days or within a specified time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">We note that, to the extent that our holding today revises or modifies our prior holding in <em>Immanuel I, </em>such modification is proper, because, in denying the Comptroller\u2019s motion for partial reconsideration of <em>Immanuel I, </em>we stated that the issues raised in the Comptroller\u2019s motion need to \u201cbe considered, in the first instance, by the circuit court and upon an appropriate record.\u201d In other words, we did not determine that the Comptroller\u2019s position in the motion was meritless; rather, we decided that the circuit court was the proper court to consider such position upon a more complete record. The circuit court did just that, and we agree with its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>\n<em>II. Circuit Court\u2019s Order to Unseal the Record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Immanuel argues that the circuit court erred by vacating its order to seal. Immanuel contends that, because the Comptroller never challenged the sealing of the court records in its original appeal, the order to seal is a final judgment. As a result, according to Immanuel, such order cannot be revised absent a finding of fraud, mistake, or irregularity, none of which was made by the court. In addition, Immanuel notes that he \u201cwas given no notice that the court might vacate its previous order,\u201d especially considering that <em>Immanuel I </em>did not include the sealing of the record as one of the issues to be addressed on remand. Finally, Immanuel argues that, when this Court granted his Motion to Seal on May 9, 2013, the \u201csealing of the record of the case thereby became the law of the case,\u201d which was binding on the circuit court. According to Immanuel, this Court\u2019s decision to publish <em>Immanuel I </em>\u201cdid not render [his] right to keep his trade secrets private moot.\u201d We disagree and shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Both civil and criminal trials are presumptively open to the public, as the Court of Appeals has recognized \u201ca common law right to inspect and copy judicial records and documents.\u201d <em>Balt.

Thus it appears that the trial court issued its order to seal without making the necessary findings under Rule 16-1009. Moreover, Immanuel never produced <em>any </em>evidence of trade secrets.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the order to seal was proper under Rule 16-1009, appellant claims that the circuit court erred in vacating such order, because it was a final judgment. Under Rule 2-535, after thirty days after entry of a final judgment, a court may only \u201cexercise revisory power and control over the judgment in case of fraud, mistake, or irregularity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\"> We conclude that the order to seal was not a final judgment pursuant to Rule 2-535. <em>See Waterkeeper Alliance, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>Inc. v. Md. Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>439 Md. 262, 277, 96 A.3d 105 (2014) (noting that \u201cRule 2-535 is applicable only to final judgments\u201d). The Court of Appeals stated in <em>Waterkeeper Alliance </em>that \u201cnon-final orders are subject to revision ... without regard to Rule 2-535.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\">An order will constitute a final judgment if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) it must be intended by the court as an unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy; (2) it must adjudicate or complete the adjudication of all claims against all parties; and (3) the clerk must make a proper record of it on the docket. In other words, for an order to qualify as a final judgment, it must adjudicate each and every claim and be reflected in a docket entry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 278-79, 96 A.3d 105 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the order to seal did not adjudicate or complete the adjudication of all claims against all parties, because it did not adjudicate Immanuel\u2019s MPIA claim\u2014that claim was adjudicated by the court\u2019s July 13, 2012 Opinion and Order. As a result, the order to seal was not a final judgment, and thus was subject to revision by the circuit court without regard to Rule 2-535. <em>See Waterkeeper Alliance, </em>439 Md. at 278-79, 96 A.3d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Contrary to his contention, Immanuel was on notice that the circuit court would be reviewing its order to seal, because Immanuel himself brought up the order at the remand hearing. At the hearing, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anu\">[IMMANUEL\u2019S COUNSEL]: And the last point I wanted to make was, originally when we were here two years ago I had requested that the records of this matter be sealed and this Court did grant that request based upon my client\u2019s trade secrets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">THE COURT: Oh, really? Did I? I don\u2019t remember that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqc\">[IMMANUEL\u2019S COUNSEL]: Although the Court of Special Appeals published it, I think, you know, reporters, other people would have less ability to understand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>argument by reading a published opinion as opposed to, you know, actually we were looking at the members who were present in this courtroom. And we would still request that it continue to be sealed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t even remember doing that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abj\">[IMMANUEL\u2019S COUNSEL]: And there was no opposition from the State when we requested that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m not sure, is it a second really? I\u2019m just curious. I mean, your client is not the only person in the world who does this, apparently. According to [the Comptroller\u2019s counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">[IMMANUEL\u2019S COUNSEL]: The State has put my client\u2014your business is called what ... the Court of Special Appeals used ... Tracers. The State of Maryland has put tracers out of business in this state. And my client, there used to be a lot of competition for these accounts, and then when the Attorney General\u2019s office came up with their opinion, it basically put them out of business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">THE COURT: Okay. Well, I\u2019m going to have to read the thing again....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">The above colloquy makes clear not only that Immanuel raised the order to seal with the circuit court, but also that the court questioned the need for the sealing of the record. Thus the court signaled that there was a potential issue with continuing to seal the record in this case, and appellant had the opportunity to, and did, argue such issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Finally, the law of the case doctrine does not preclude the vacating of the order to seal. In <em>Kline v. Kline, </em>we explained such doctrine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">The law of the case doctrine provides that once a decision is established as the controlling legal rule of decision between the same parties in the same case it continues to be the law of the case. Specifically, a ruling by an appellate court upon a question becomes the law of the case and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>binding on the courts and litigants in further proceedings in the same matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">93 Md.App. 696, 700, 614 A.2d 984 (1992) (citation omitted). We disagree with Immanuel that this Court\u2019s May 9, 2013 order sealing the case in the previous appeal is the law of the case, because, after we issued that order, we not only published <em>Immanuel I, </em>but also denied Immanuel\u2019s subsequent motions to seal and redact the published opinion. <em>See </em>216 Md.App. at 259, 85 A.3d 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In sum, we hold that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in vacating its earlier order to seal, because (1) there is a presumption for open public records; (2) the order to seal did not contain the requisite findings under Rule 16-1009(d); (3) the order to seal was a non-final order subject to revision; (4) Immanuel was on notice that sealing the record may no longer be appropriate; and (5) this Court decided to publish <em>Immanuel I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMI-CO COUNTY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\">. Although Immanuel is correct that the Abandoned Property Act requires him to wait two years before assisting in the recovery of abandoned property, such requirement concerns Immanuel\u2019s own obligations under the Act, not the \"Comptroller\u2019s disclosure obligations\" under the Act. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2013), \u00a7 17-325 of the Commercial Law (III) Article (\"All agreements to pay compensation to recover or assist in the recovery of property made within 24 months of the date the property is paid or delivered to the abandoned property office are unenforceable.\u201d); <em>see also Comptroller of Treasury v. Immanuel, </em>216 Md.App. 259, 275, 85 A.3d 878 (2014) (\u201cImmanuel should emerge on remand with a list of claims that tracks the Comptroller's disclosure obligations under the Abandoned Property Act.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\">. Courts are mandated by statute to \"preserve the secrecy of an alleged trade secret by reasonable means,\u201d such as by sealing a court record. Md. Code (1975, 2013 Repl.
