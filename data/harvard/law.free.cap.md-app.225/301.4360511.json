Under the circumstances of this case, we answer \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">This appeal arises from the 2012 conviction in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County of appellant Penny McCrimmon for embezzlement and misappropriation of funds by a fiduciary and from the court\u2019s sentence that included an order for restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">On March 31, 2011, the State filed a criminal information in the circuit court charging McCrimmon with three counts: theft of property valued at least $10,000 to $100,000, obtaining the property of a vulnerable adult, and fraudulent appropria- , tion by a fiduciary of the victim\u2019s money or property (embezzlement). The victim is appellant\u2019s cousin, Reginald Gant. On January 18, 2012, appellant pleaded guilty to the third count, and the State agreed to enter a nolle prosequi on the remaining two charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s recital of the facts at the guilty plea hearing included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">STATE: Mr. Gant ... would identify Penny McCrimmon, seated next to Mr. Smith here in Court, they are first cousins. What Mr. Gant would have testified today, if he was called to testify, was that between April the 1st of 2010 and February the 17th of [2011], while he was residing at the Chapel Hill Nursing Home, which is located over in the Randallstown area of Baltimore County. That during that time period that he had given Ms. McCrimmon a Power of Attorney.... The Power of Attorney granted her ability to manage his funds. He was in a very bad medical condition ... and he relied upon Ms. McCrimmon during that time. He entrusted her with his money and that she was going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>use it as intended, to take care of his medical bills and for his benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">It turned out that appellant was collecting Gant\u2019s income, but diverting this money for her own benefit, and not paying Gant\u2019s bills. According to the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">[The victim\u2019s] money then ... flowed, moved by Ms. McCrimmon into the other account, the 3979 account, at which time she then spent it and she didn\u2019t spend it on Mr., Mr. Gant during this time period, but instead, she went to McDonald\u2019s [and other retailers, and] she ... spent that money. Now, this continued each month until February of 2011 and if called to testify, Mr. Gant would indicate that she did not have permission to spend this money this way. He had not given her permission to spend it for her own personal gain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Mr. Gant eventually realized that his obligation to Chapel Hill was not being met.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">He owed a bill of $19,718. The original bill actually was much, much larger and Mr. Ryan Evans is here from Chapel Hill, he was a former administrator there, he worked with Mr. Gant during this time period and he was familiar with Ms. McCrimmon as well. He had spoken to Ms. McCrimmon and Ms. McCrimmon said that she was, in fact, spending down his money so that he could qualify for medical assistance. He didn\u2019t really get into that but he knew that this bill was large and looming. The bill originally was, I think, in the forties and they agreed to reduce the amount to $19,718. That\u2019s the bill that Mr. Gant owes today. That bill has never been paid by Ms. McCrimmon. She never used any of his money for that purpose and, again, because of what the evidence is from the banking statements, she used it for her own personal gain in violation of the trust that she was given by Mr. Gant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The prosecutor introduced into evidence a number of documents. The first was a fill-in-the-blank \u201cDurable Unlimited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Power of Attorney\u201d form.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The document spoke in general terms of the financial agent\u2019s power to act with regard to Gant\u2019s financial and business transactions, but did not mention Chapel Hill or a duty to pay the nursing home. This instrument was dated June 8, 2010, just two months after Gant\u2019s admission to Chapel Hill. It was witnessed by two employees of the Home: a licensed social worker associate (LSWA) and an administrator of the facility. The second document was a \u201cMaryland Advance Directive: Planning for Future Health Decisions\u201d (\u201cAdvance Directive\u201d). It was also dated June 8th and named McCrimmon as health care agent for Gant. It was witnessed by the LSWA, who also attested to Gant\u2019s competence. The final document was a \u201cRevocation of Power of Attorney\u201d and Appointment of Healthcare Agent, dated February 4, 2011 and also witnessed by the LSWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Gant was also called as a witness. When the court asked if there was anything he wanted to say, he responded, \u201cIt\u2019s just that I have a bill to pay, you know, and I\u2019m going to do it, I\u2019m going to pay it....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The circuit court accepted the plea and sentenced appellant to five years\u2019 incarceration, suspended in favor of five years of unsupervised probation. The court also ordered appellant to pay restitution to Chapel Hill Nursing Home in the amount of $19,718.73.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">On December 17, 2012, appellant filed a petition for post-conviction relief. On July 10, 2013, the circuit court granted the petition in part and allowed appellant leave to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>belated application for leave to appeal. All other relief was denied. After the application was filed in this Court and the State responded, this Court, on September 10, 2014, transferred the case to the direct appeal docket.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">1. Whether the Chapel Hill Nursing Home was an entity entitled to restitution in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">2. Whether the circuit court erred in failing to address whether McCrimmon had the ability to pay restitution before ordering her to do so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">3. Whether there was sufficient evidence to justify a restitution award of $19,718?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">We answer the first question in the negative and need not address the last two issues. However, because Gant was clearly a victim entitled to restitution, which he apparently would seek to redirect to Chapel Hill, we remand for further proceedings on the issue of restitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aa6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">An appellate court reviews the circuit court\u2019s restitution order for an abuse of discretion. <em>Silver v. State, </em>420 Md. 415, 427, 23 A.3d 867 (2011). However, if an order of restitution is illegal in any respect, we review it as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-345(a) (\u201cThe court may correct an illegal sentence at any time\u201d); <em>Carlini v. State, </em>215 Md.App. 415, 443, 81 A.3d 560 (2013). When we interpret a statute, we review that legal question <em>de novo. Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Anderson, </em>395 Md. 172, 181, 909 A.2d 694 (2006) (citing <em>Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 446, 452, 879 A.2d 1111 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>In <em>Blue v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>434 Md. 681, 689, 76 A.3d 1129 (2013), the Court of Appeals described our process for determining legislative intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">Our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals have aptly summarized this quest, based on this Court\u2019s past decisions, as one that requires an examination of the statutory text in context, a review of legislative history to confirm conclusions or resolve questions from that examination, and a consideration of the consequences of alternative readings. Text is the plain language of the relevant provision, typically given its ordinary meaning, viewed in context, considered in light of the whole statute, and generally evaluated for ambiguity. Legislative purpose, either apparent from the text or gathered from external sources, often informs, if not controls, our reading of the statute. An examination of interpretive consequences, either as a comparison of the results of each proffered construction, or as a principle of avoidance of an absurd or unreasonable reading, grounds the court\u2019s interpretation in reality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">(Internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Restitution, as applied in a criminal case under Maryland\u2019s Criminal Procedure Article, is a criminal sanction, not a civil remedy. It serves at least three distinct purposes. First, it is a form of punishment for criminal conduct. Second, it is intended to rehabilitate the defendant. Lastly, it affords the aggrieved victim recompense for monetary loss. <em>Pete v. State, </em>384 Md. 47, 55, 862 A.2d 419 (2004) (Citations omitted). The \u201cpredominant and traditional purpose\u201d of restitution is to \u201creimburse the victim for certain kinds of expenses ... incurred as a direct result of the defendant\u2019s criminal activity.\u201d <em>Chaney v. State, </em>397 Md. 460, 918 A.2d 506, (2007). Because restitution statutes are penal in nature, they must be strictly construed. <em>Addison v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 159, 180, 990 A.2d 614 (2010) (citing <em>In re John M., </em>129 Md.App. 165, 185, 741 A.2d 503 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Restitution is governed by Title 11, subtitle 6 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCrim.Proc.\u201d), Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2014 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 11-601 <em>et seq. </em>We focus on three sections in this subtitle.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Section 11\u2014601(j) defines a \u201cVictim\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">(1) a person who suffers death, personal injury, or property damage or loss <em>as a direct result of a crime </em>or delinquent act; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">(2) if the person is deceased, the personal representative of the estate of the person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Under \u00a7 ll-603(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">A court may enter a judgment of restitution that orders a defendant or child respondent to make restitution in addition to any other penalty for the commission of a crime or delinquent act, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-11\">(1) <em>as a direct result of the crime </em>or delinquent act, property of the victim was stolen, damaged, destroyed, converted, or unlawfully obtained, or its value substantially decreased;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-12\">(2) <em>as a direct result of the crime </em>or delinquent act, the victim suffered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-13\">(i) actual medical, dental, hospital, counseling, funeral, or burial expenses or losses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-14\">(ii) direct out-of-pocket loss;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-15\">(iii) loss of earnings; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-16\">(iv) expenses incurred with rehabilitation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-17\">(3) the victim incurred medical expenses that were paid by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene or any other governmental unit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-18\">(4) a governmental unit incurred expenses in removing, towing, transporting, preserving, storing, selling, or destroying an abandoned vehicle as defined in \u00a7 25-201 of the Transportation Article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>(5) the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board paid benefits to a victim; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">(6) the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene or other governmental unit paid expenses incurred under Subtitle 1, Part II of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Finally, \u00a7 ll-606(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">The court may order that restitution be paid to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">(1) the victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">(2) the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, or any other governmental unit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\">(3) <em>a third-party payor, including:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-12\">(i) an insurer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-13\">(ii) <em>any other person that has, under Part I of this subtitle:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-14\">1. <em>compensated the victim for a property or pecuniary loss; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-15\">2. <em>paid an expense on behalf of a victim;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-16\">(4) any person for whom restitution is authorized by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-17\">(5) <em>a person who has provided to or for a victim goods, property, or services for which restitution is authorized under \u00a7 11-608 of this subtitle.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-18\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-19\">Emphasizing the restrictive language of these provisions, particularly the \u201cdirect result\u201d requirement and the express inclusion in \u00a7 11-603 and \u00a7 11-606 of specific creditors, Maryland appellate courts have held that the creditors of a victim are generally not entitled to restitution. <em>In re Ryan S., </em>369 Md. 26, 56, 797 A.2d 39 (2002); <em>Breakfield v. State, </em>195 Md.App. 377, 396-402, 6 A.3d 381 (2010); <em>Chilcoat v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 394, 413-14, 843 A.2d 240 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-20\">In this case, Chapel Hill is, in a general sense and possibly in common parlance, a victim of McCrimmon\u2019s embezzlement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>But under the tailored definitions and \u201ccarefully constructed\u201d language of \u00a7 11\u2014601(j) and \u00a7 ll-603(a), <em>In re Ryan S., </em>369 Md. at 56, 797 A.2d 39, is a nursing home\u2014which is also clearly a creditor of a \u201cdirect\u201d victim\u2014itself a \u201cvictim\u201d under the restitution statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In many respects, the nursing home here appears to be more than a mere creditor. Even on the sketchy record before us, it is obvious that Chapel Hill\u2019s thumbprints are all over the form that made McCrimmon Gant\u2019s financial agent. Both the Durable Unlimited Power of Attorney Form and the Advance Directive were witnessed by an employee or employees of Chapel Hill, most likely at the facility. And it is safe to say that absent Gant\u2019s admission to the nursing home, such forms would have never been executed and the opportunity to embezzle would have never been presented. Significantly, as the Attorney General told residents in his consumer manual on nursing homes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">If you have a financial agent, that person must pay the nursing home using your resources. The agent does not accept personal responsibility for your debts, but does accept responsibility to use your resources to pay your debts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Attorney General\u2019s Office, <em>Nursing Homes: What You Need to Know, </em>at 42-43 (2012).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Similarly, the Attorney General\u2019s manual goes on to note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">If you are a nursing home resident\u2019s financial agent, you must use the resident\u2019s money appropriately. <em>In most cases, </em>this means using their money to pay for the resident\u2019s nursing home care. If you are a financial agent, you should not use the resident\u2019s money for your personal benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 44 (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Adding to this description of industry practices is the fact that Gant apparently wants the nursing home to be paid for its services.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">On the opposite side of the ledger, the Durable Unlimited Power of Attorney Form speaks in the most general terms of the financial agent\u2019s duties with respect to Gant\u2019s financial and business transactions and does not specifically mention obligations to the nursing home. This document does not treat a nursing home any differently from any other creditor of Gant that McCrimmon was authorized to pay. Under these circumstances, to treat a nursing home as an entity suffering loss as a \u201cdirect result\u201d of the embezzlement\u2014even if Gant consented to the restitution order\u2014would eviscerate the clear text of the restitution statutes. Nor would such a construction further the purpose of the restitution statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The restitution statutes do not make a Maryland court a collection agent for any indirect losses suffered by a direct victim. <em>See In re Tyrell A., </em>442 Md. 354, 372, 112 A.3d 468 (2015) (Section 11-601 \u201climits victims for purposes of restitution generally to only those injured as a direct result of the acts that made the conduct illegal\u201d); <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 61, 862 A.2d 419 (\u201cThe General Assembly has required a direct result between the qualifying crime committed and the damages inflicted before restitution may be ordered\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 66, 862 A.2d 419 (\u201c[T]he General Assembly crafted explicit statutory requirements allowing restitution under limited circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In addition, given this limited purpose of the restitution statutes, the exclusion of Chapel Hill as a direct victim does not lead to an absurd or unreasonable result. Perhaps, the outcome would be different if any and all victims and creditors were the beneficiaries of the statute. However, that is not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>case. In our view, the nursing home is not included in the statutory definition of \u201cvictim\u201d under the restitution laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Alternatively, the State argues that restitution would be authorized by CP \u00a7 11\u2014606(a)(3) as a \u201cthird-party payor\u201d who \u201ccompensates\u201d the victim for pecuniary loss or pays \u201can expense\u201d on behalf of a victim. As fetching as is this contention, we note that Chapel Hill, while it may have lost revenue, did not \u201cpay\u201d anything. In our opinion, this provision is not triggered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">To leave no stone unturned, we turn to \u00a7 11\u2014606(a)(5),' which authorizes restitution to a person who has provided to a victim \u201cservices for which restitution is authorized under \u00a7 11-603 of this subtitle.\u201d Clearly, Chapel Hill is an entity that has provided services to Gant, the victim here. However, this provision goes on to point us in the direction of 11\u2014603(a). And the statutory categories of restitution beneficiaries listed there do not include a general creditor such as Chapel Hill.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">For these reasons, we conclude that the $19,718 restitution-ary order cannot stand. The State has requested that if we vacate the restitution order, then the case should be remanded for a correct determination of the amount of restitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On remand, McCrimmon is also free to urge the court to find under \u00a7 11\u2014605(a)(1) that she does not have the ability to pay the judgment of restitution. Finally, because Gant has previously indicated that he wants to see Chapel Hill\u2019s bill paid, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>State may seek a restitution order for Gant as a true victim of McCrimmon\u2019s offence. And, if he so chooses, the victim may assign the judgment to Chapel Hill as provided in Maryland Rule 2-624. <em>See also </em>46 Am.Jur.2d Judgments \u00a7 431 (2015). Of course, he is under no obligation to make such an assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">ORDER OF RESTITUTION VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY FOR RE-SENTENCING AND FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
