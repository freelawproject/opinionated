A jury of the Circuit Court for Prince <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>George\u2019s County convicted him of first degree assault and related crimes, including, and of interest to us for the purposes of this appeal, illegally possessing a firearm after a disqualifying conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Mr. Smith raises two issues. First, he argues that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the convictions for illegal possession of a firearm because the prosecutor failed to present evidence of the disqualifying conviction to the jury during the State\u2019s case-in-chief. We do not agree. Second, he asks us to undertake plain error review to decide whether his complaint of prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument warrants reversal. This is not an appropriate case for plain error review. We will affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">This appeal arises out of a dispute between Smith and a friend, Herbert Mungo, over a credit card reader. Their disagreement degenerated into an altercation during which Smith shot Mr. Mungo. Smith was charged with attempted second degree murder, first degree assault, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and possession of cocaine. Additionally, he was charged with violating Public Safety Article (\u201cPS\u201d) \u00a7 5-133(b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014illegal possession of a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a disqualifying crime (Count <em>5); </em>PS \u00a7 5-133(c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2014illegal possession of a regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>lated firearm after a felony conviction for violating Criminal Law Article (CL) \u00a7 5-602<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Count 6); and PS \u00a7 5-144<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2014 possession of a firearm in violation of Subtitle 5 of the Public Safety Article (Count 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The jury acquitted Smith of the attempted murder charge, but found him guilty on the remaining counts. At sentencing, the trial court merged the convictions for violating PS \u00a7 5-133(b) and PS \u00a7 5-144 with the conviction for violating PS \u00a7 5-133(c) and imposed a sentence of five years\u2019 incarceration, to run concurrently with a sentence of twenty-five years\u2019 incarceration for the first-degree assault conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">1. The Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"AH9\">1.1. Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Normally, when reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction, we decide \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>cution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Derr v. State, </em>434 Md. 88, 129, 73 A.3d 254 (2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2723, 189 L.Ed.2d 762 (2014) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in <em>Jackson)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Smith\u2019s sufficiency challenge, however, calls other principles into play. His attack upon the legal adequacy of the evidence supporting the firearms possession convictions is limited to his assertion that the State failed to present evidence of a disqualifying conviction in the State\u2019s case-in-chief. In response, the State contends that the parties stipulated to the disqualifying conviction and that there was no requirement that the. stipulation be presented to the jury prior to the close of the State\u2019s case. Smith disagrees with both of these contentions. Certainly, if an element of the offense has not been established, then the conviction fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">As we will relate, the trial court concluded that the parties had in fact agreed to stipulate that Smith had been convicted of a disqualifying crime. We will review this finding for clear error. Whether the State was required to present the stipulation to the jury prior to the close of its case is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">1.2. The Use of Stipulations in Prosecutions for Illegal Possession of Firearms</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">In pertinent part, \u00a7 5-133 of the Public Safety Article makes it illegal for persons convicted of certain crimes to possess a firearm. <em>Hicks v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 112, 134, 984 A.2d 246 (2009). In order to secure a conviction for violating PS \u00a7\u00a7 5\u2014133(b)(1), (c)(i), or (c)(ii), the State must establish that the handgun involved was a regulated firearm, that the defendant possessed this firearm, and that he was precluded from doing so because of a disqualifying status, in this case certain prior convictions. <em>See Nash v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 386, 394, 991 A.2d 831, <em>cert. denied, </em>415 Md. 42, 997 A.2d 792 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Where, as in the case before us, an element of the illegal possession charge is a predicate prior conviction, a prosecutor has the opportunity \u201cto introduce evidence of the sort generally explicitly forbidden by the propensity rule, and to do it in circumstances where the element of predicate felon status is uncontestable and uncontested by the defendant.\u201d D. Michael Risinger, <em>John Henry Wigmore, Johnny Lynn Old Chief, and \u201cLegitimate Moral Force,\u201d </em>49 Hast. L.J. 403, 420 (1998). The prejudicial effect of such evidence can be very serious. One way of avoiding, or at least minimizing, these effects is for the parties to stipulate that the defendant has been convicted of a disqualifying offense. In <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 185, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997), the Supreme Court held that a trial court abused its discretion by refusing to accept a defendant\u2019s stipulation to the existence of a prior disqualifying conviction in a felon-in-possession case.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The Court of Appeals adopted the approach sanctioned by <em>Old Chief </em>in <em>Carter v. State, </em>374 Md. 693, 722, 824 A.2d 123 (2003), explaining that \u201cwhen a defendant admits or the parties stipulate to the previous-conviction element of a charge under [the predecessor to PS \u00a7 5-133], the trial judge should inform the jury that the defendant admits that he or she has been convicted of a [disqualifying] erime[.]\u201d The <em>Carter </em>Court went slightly further, deciding that fewer details should be disclosed, and stated that \u201cthe name or nature of a previous conviction must always be withheld from the jury in a felon-in-possession case in which the defendant offered to stipulate or admit to that previous conviction.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>374 Md. at 720 n. 8, 824 A.2d 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">1.3. What happened at trial</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Prior to jury selection, the parties and the trial court discussed the manner by which Smith\u2019s disqualifying convictions should be addressed (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The appropriate method is for the State to provide certified conviction that, in fact, he is a felon, <em>which I would stipulate.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>THE COURT: Okay. And if that\u2019s the case, then I have not received any sort of certification from the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akr\">[PROSECUTOR]: We normally don\u2019t give certifications. We show them in court, but I don\u2019t have\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Typically I have received it in discovery from other prosecutors and in other counties, including this county, but I\u2019ve not received it from [the prosecutor]. And so the appropriate method pursuant to the Court of Special Appeals is that ... bifurcation is not the appropriate method.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">THE COURT: [B]ifurcation [is] not appropriate, okay. <em>We\u2019ll deal with that when [we] come to it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>Thank you, Your Honor. Whatever [the prosecutor] prefers.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The prosecutor did not address the issue of Smith\u2019s disqualifying conviction during the State\u2019s case. After the State closed, Smith moved for judgments of acquittal. As to counts 5, 6, and 7, that is, the counts that charged Smith with knowingly possessing a firearm after conviction of a disqualifying crime, defense counsel asserted that \u201cthere is no evidence that my client did knowingly participate in the illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>possession of a regulated firearm, no evidence has been generated as to Count 5, 6 and 7.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Following argument, the trial court remarked (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">THE COURT: As to Count 6, a firearm, possession after a felony conviction we talked about this yesterday. <em>We decided it was not going to be a bifurcated thing, but a stipulation with regard to the felony convictions. Is that your recollection, [defense counselJ?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>Yes, sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">THE COURT: With that stipulation let me move on....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">The discussion turned to the question of proving Smith\u2019s status, namely, that he was disqualified from possessing a firearm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I would just like to put on the record that certainly as it relates to yesterday, when the comment came up as to bifurcation on Counts 5, 6 and 7, I did say certainly those are things that we would stipulate to. However, the stipulation has to be introduced into evidence before the State closes their case. The State did not use that stipulation at the close of the State\u2019s. If that had been done, it would have been without any objection from the defense because that\u2019s what I agreed to.... [T]hough we may agree of, yes, we will stipulate, the stipulation still has to be put on the record and presented in the body of the State\u2019s case and is that the only reason why I\u2019m making that motion at this time as it relates to Counts 5, 6, and 7. Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">In response, the prosecutor asked permission to reopen its case-in-chief so that \u201cwe could put the stipulation on the record.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defense counsel objected to this as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>After a brief recess, and outside of the jury\u2019s presence, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\">During the break I wanted to research just a little about whether or not the State could reopen its case at this juncture, and then I took a look at my notes and I have in my notes that on the record in the discussion yesterday about whether we bifurcate[,] the defendant stipulated to [the] prior conviction.... But again, my notes show yesterday that that stipulation was made on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The State then inquired as to how the stipulation would be entered into the record. Defense counsel responded that \u201cI would not object to the stipulation being that Mr. Nathaniel Smith, Senior, by law, is not permitted to possess a firearm.\u201d After the jurors returned, the trial court did not expressly indicate whether it granted or denied the State\u2019s motion to reopen its case. Instead, the court informed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">During the break we have a stipulation for you. And that stipulation is that the parties agree the State and the defense agree that by law Mr. Nathaniel Smith is prohibited from possessing a firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The defense did not object and then rested its case. The trial court and parties then discussed jury instructions. The trial court indicated that it intended to \u201cmention the stipulations\u201d during its instructions. Neither party objected and, in the course of its instructions, the court referred to the stipulation and told the jury that \u201cit should be considered proven ... [that] the defendant, Mr. Smith, is prohibited by law from possessing a regulated firearm.\u201d Defense counsel objected to this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">1.4. Appellant\u2019s Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Smith first asserts that he never agreed to stipulate to his prior conviction. He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">Certainly, when a defendant stipulates to the prior conviction element of the offense, the judge should inform the jury that the defendant admits that he has been convicted of a [disqualifying] crime.... The problem here is that there did not appear to be a final agreement to stipulate nor a recitation of a stipulation read into the record in the State\u2019s case in chief. When the trial court was alerted to this fact, it concluded, in error, that the defense had stipulated to the prior conviction on the previous day. Review of the transcriptions of the trial reveals that the court was mistaken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">We read the record differently. Without belaboring the point, we believe that the transcript is clear that defense counsel expressly agreed to stipulate to the existence of Smith\u2019s prior disqualifying conviction; indeed, defense counsel\u2019s offer to stipulate triggered the initial discussion between the court and counsel. Moreover, defense counsel\u2019s statement that he would be satisfied with \u201cwhatever\u201d\u2014within reason, presumably\u2014the prosecutor wanted in terms of the wording and presentation of the stipulation, hardly suggests that Smith was withholding approval until the parties agreed upon specific wording of the stipulation. The trial court\u2019s finding that Smith had agreed to the stipulation is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Second, we turn to Smith\u2019s argument that the State\u2019s failure to introduce the stipulation before the close of its case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>undermines the sufficiency of his convictions for illegal possession of a regulated firearm. Without evidence as to the form of the stipulation in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief, his theory goes, the status element for these offenses is not satisfied. Neither this Court nor the Court of Appeals appears to have addressed this precise issue. However, appellate courts in other jurisdictions have considered Smith\u2019s contention, and variations on it, on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">A representative decision is <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>204 F.3d 236 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 911, 121 S.Ct. 262, 148 L.Ed.2d 190 (2000), an unlawful possession of a firearm case. At trial, Harrison stipulated to the two elements of the offense, including his status as a prior offender, but the stipulations were not formally read to the jury. Nor did the government offer any other evidence on those elements. 204 F.3d at 237-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The jury convicted Harrison, and he appealed, seeking to overturn his conviction as unsupported by the evidence\u2014 specifically emphasizing that two crucial elements for a felon-in-possession conviction were absent, notwithstanding the parties\u2019 stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Rejecting Harrison\u2019s challenge to the conviction, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held \u201cthat Harrison has, by stipulating, waived any right to contest the absence of proof on the stipulated elements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">The premise of the waiver theory is simple: Upon entering into a stipulation on an element, a defendant waives his right to put the government to its proof of that element. A stipulation constitutes an express waiver made ... preparatory to trial by the party or his attorney conceding for the purposes of trial the truth of some alleged fact ... thereafter to be taken for granted; so that the one party need offer no evidence to prove it and the other is not allowed to disprove it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">It is well settled that a defendant, by entering into a stipulation, waives his right to assert the government\u2019s duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>to present evidence to the jury on the stipulated element. The only possible point of contention is whether a defendant can contest the government\u2019s failure to read the stipulation itself to the trier of fact. We conclude that a defendant cannot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><em>Id. </em>(citations, internal quotation and punctuation marks omitted). The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">We conclude that there is little to be gained from holding that a stipulation, which unarguably waives a defendant\u2019s right to require the government to produce any evidence regarding that stipulation, nevertheless fails to waive the defendant\u2019s right to require that stipulation to be read to the jury. Surely, the government\u2019s failure formally to read stipulations is not \u201cwise trial practice.\u201d____ However, nothing in either law or logic compels us to reverse a conviction when the defendant enters into a stipulation on an element and then seeks a windfall from the government\u2019s failure to formally read the stipulation to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 242 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">In <em>United States v. Hardin, </em>139 F.3d 813 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 898, 119 S.Ct. 225, 142 L.Ed.2d 185 (1998), another felon-in-possession case, Hardin and the government entered into a written stipulation that he had a prior conviction. Neither party filed the stipulation with the clerk before trial. Defense counsel told prospective jurors about Hardin\u2019s status, the district court mentioned this status during the preliminary jury instructions, the prosecutor, without objection, told the jurors that the felon status was not an issue, and defense counsel acknowledged this during her opening statement. 139 F.3d at 814. The prosecution \u201cdid not read, publish or otherwise offer the stipulation into evidence[,]\u201d and Hardin\u2019s felon status did not come up again until a brief reference during the government\u2019s summation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">On appeal from his conviction, Hardin maintained that the government\u2019s failure to offer the stipulation into evidence undermined his conviction. The Eleventh Circuit disagreed and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>In holding that Hardin\u2019s stipulation eliminated the government\u2019s burden to produce evidence of his felon status, we in no way imply that failing to offer a stipulation into evidence is wise trial practice. It is fair to assume that, in this case, the government had every intention of offering the stipulation for admission as evidence.....Hardin, however, has no legal or equitable basis to contest the government\u2019s mistake. He received his benefit of the bargain-prejudicial information about his prior conviction never entered into the jury\u2019s deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 817 (citations omitted). Other courts have reached the same conclusion on similar facts. <em>See United States v. Ayoub, </em>498 F.3d 532, 545-47 (6th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>555 U.S. 830, 129 S.Ct. 37, 172 L.Ed.2d 49 (2008); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>472 F.3d 752, 753 (10th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Muse, </em>83 F.3d 672, 678-79 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 904, 117 S.Ct. 261, 136 L.Ed.2d 186 (1996) (dicta); <em>State v. Wolf, </em>134 Wash.App. 196, 139 P.3d 414, 418 (2006), <em>rev. denied, </em>160 Wash.2d 1015,161 P.3d 1028 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The reasoning reflected in these decisions is both sensible and fair. We hold that, by consenting to a stipulation, Smith relieved the State of its obligation to prove that he had previously been convicted of a disqualifying crime as part of its case-in-chief. We conclude, as did the <em>Hardin </em>Court, that Smith received exactly what he bargained for when he agreed to the stipulation and suffered no prejudice when the stipulation was presented to the jury by the court instead of by the prosecutor during the State\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">2. An Improper Rebuttal Argument?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">In the State\u2019s rebuttal argument, the prosecutor twice characterized Smith\u2019s case as consisting of \u201csmoke and mirrors.\u201d Smith asserts that these statements constituted \u201crepeated improper and prejudicial statements denigrating defense counsel and his role at trial.\u201d Acknowledging that he did not object to these statements, Smith urges that the trial court\u2019s lapse in correcting what he characterizes as an egregious closing argument constituted plain error and asks us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>reverse his convictions. However, non-error does not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Smith is correct that a prosecutor may not impugn the ethics or professionalism of defense counsel in closing argument. When prosecutors cross the line, and defense counsel objects, trial courts should do something about it. <em>See Reidy v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 169, 172-79, 259 A.2d 66 (1969). But contrary to Smith\u2019s assertions, the State\u2019s closing argument was not improper\u2014the \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d comments were clearly directed to defense counsel\u2019s argument and did not impute impropriety or unprofessional conduct to defense counsel. Smith\u2019s claims of error and unfair prejudice are without basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">THE JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY ARE AFFIRMED.

Thus, whether the stipulation was that the court would determine the prior conviction element or that the parties stipulated to the fact of the prior conviction, the trial proceeded as a bifurcated trial, with the jury considering only the issue of possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-11\">[W]e hold that bifurcation of the elements of the offense of possession of a regulated firearm by a person previously convicted of a crime of violence is improper, even if agreed to by the parties. The court here erred in proceeding in this fashion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b545-12\">. The trial court had the authority to grant the State's request to reopen its case. Md. Rule 5-611(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In <em>Wisneski v. State, </em>169 Md.App. 527, 553-55, 905 A.2d 385 (2006), <em>aff'd, </em>398 Md. 578, 921 A.2d 273 (2007), we held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the State to re-open its case to allow the court to read a stipulation to the jury regarding the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for a disqualifying offense. In reaching this result, we set out the applicable standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">The critical issue in determining whether a court abused its discretion in reopening the case is whether its doing so impaired the ability of the defendant to answer and otherwise receive a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">Usually, whether the reopening of evidence impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to receive a fair trial is answered by reference to the State\u2019s intention in withholding the evidence, i.e., whether it did so in order to gain an unfair advantage from the impact later use of the evidence likely would have on the trier of facts, the nature of the evidence, and its relationship to evidence already in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 554, 905 A.2d 385 (quoting <em>Cason v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 379, 391, 780 A.2d 466 (2001)) (quotation marks and internal citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
