There is no evidence in the record of any sales or deliveries made in the district.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On one occasion Veague, defendant\u2019s Chicago sales manager, took representatives of the Santa Fe Railroad and the Jewel Tea Company, prospective <em>customers, </em>to a Southern Pacific freight car, located within the district, which was equipped with the accused device. There he demonstrated the operation of the device, with the car both loaded and empty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-20\">Plaintiff contends that these demonstrations by Veague for the purpose of making a sale constituted an infringing \u201cuse\u201d and therefore satisfied the venue statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It also urges the \u201cbroader proposition\u201d that defendant\u2019s systematic and continuous solicitation of orders for the accused device from a regular and established place of business in the district, in and of itself, is sufficient to sat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>isfy the venue requirement. We think the true rule in the case at bar is that the systematic and continuous solicitation plus the two demonstrations is sufficient to establish venue on the basis of plaintiff\u2019s allegation of selling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">A mistaken reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in W. S. Tyler Co. v. Ludlow-Saylor Wire Co., 236 U.S. 723, 35 S.Ct. 458, 59 L.Ed. 808 (1915), seems to have led courts into believing that there is a necessity for holding that demonstrations for the purpose of sale constitute infringing \u201cuse\u201d for venue purposes, rather than considering the demonstrations as part of a sales effort. For example, the district courts have found infringing \u201cuse\u201d sufficient for venue in Transmirra Prod. Corp. v. Magnavox Co., 110 F.Supp. 676 (S.D.N.Y.1953), where defendant displayed its products in two trade shows; in Ronson Art Metal Works, Inc. v. Brown &amp; Bigelow, Inc., 104 F.Supp. 716 (S.D.N.Y.1952), where the defendant supplied the accused cigarette lighters to its salesmen for exhibition and demonstration to customers; and in Patent Tube Corp. v. Bristol-Myers Co., 25 F.Supp. 776 (S.D.N.Y.1938), where defendant\u2019s salesmen distributed some of the accused devices to physicians and dentists within the district for advertising purposes. But in those cases, as here, it appears that the infringement complained of was defendant\u2019s manufacture or sale of the accused device.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">This has resulted in a rather strained interpretation of infringing \u201cuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">In the case at bar plaintiff charges \u201cselling\u201d and presumably will offer proof of \u201csale\u201d at trial and not proof of \u201cuse.\u201d The demonstrations are proper proof of \u201csale\u201d and not proof of \u201cuse\u201d because in them the accused article was not used for the purpose for which it was intended. Its intended use was to divide loads in freight cars, not for demonstration to intended customers. We believe it is illogical to lay venue on \u201cuse\u201d where proof is to be of a \u201csale\u201d and we prefer, not to nourish that procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">In W. S. Tyler Co. v. Ludlow-Saylor Wire Co., 236 U.S. 723, 35 S.Ct. 458, 59 L.Ed. 808 (1915), the Court, relying on Westinghouse Elec. &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Stanley Elec. Mfg. Co., 116 F. 641 (C.C.S.D.N.Y.1902), said that if the sale was consummated outside the forum it did not constitute an infringement within the district where the suit was brought. However, in Tyler the first and decisive holding was that defendant did not have a regular and established place of business within the district. Therefore what was said about the consummation of a sale outside the district not amounting to an act of infringement within the district was dicta.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Westinghouse did hold as the Supreme Court said it did, but there Judge Lacombe\u2019s opinion cited no authority for his holding. The necessity of finding a \u201ccompleted sale\u201d to support venue had its genesis in Judge Lacombe\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-9\">\u201cBut when the commission of an act of infringement is essential to jurisdiction, the completed act must be proved. There must be proof either of a manufacture, a use, or a sale within the district, contracts to manufacture, threats to use, negotiations for a sale, will not be sufficient, for the reason that the statute requires proof of the completed act.\u201d 116 F. at 641.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">The necessity for a \u201ccompleted sale\u201d or a \u201ccompleted act of infringement\u201d had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>the apparent approval of the Second Circuit in Bulldog Elec. Prod. Co. v. Cole Elec. Prod. Co., 134 F.2d 545 (2d Cir. 1943), pet. for mandamus denied, 322 U.S. 714, 64 S.Ct. 1256, 88 L.Ed. 1556 (1944), and the Ninth Circuit in Endrezze v. Dorr Co., 97 F.2d 46 (9th Cir. 1938). But in each of those cases Tyler and Westinghouse are cited to dicta. The Fourth Circuit in Dow Chemical Co. v. Metlon Corp., 281 F.2d 292 (4th Cir. 1960), did hold, as its decisive rule of law, that a \u201ccompleted act\u201d is necessary, and that the conduct in that case did not amount to a \u201ccompleted act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">We do not think the dicta in Tyler, Bulldog, and Endrezze compels us to decide that a completed sale was necessary for a finding of venue. The \u201ccompleted sale\u201d notion derived from the formulation of a rule, without authority cited, by a single judge of the old circuit court of the Southern District of New York. We think the Fourth Circuit\u2019s reliance on that rule weakens its decision in Dow Chemical that a \u201ccompleted act\u201d of infringement is necessary to establish venue; and that we are not impelled to decide that a \u201ccompleted sale,\u201d in the case before us, is necessary for venue purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">The Second Circuit, despite its earlier apparent approval of Judge Lacombe\u2019s rule, noted in Kaz Mfg. Co. v. Chesebrough-Ponds, Inc., 317 F.2d 679 (2d Cir. 1963), that there is a distinct difference between the \u201cdegree of use required\u201d to determine whether an act of infringement occurred in the district when venue is challenged than when establishing a substantive offense. The test is less strict when venue is challenged, for otherwise a disposition of the venue question would also be one on the merits wherever venue was sustained. Ronson Art Metal Works, Inc., v. Brown &amp; Bigelow, Inc., 104 F.Supp. 716, 725 (S.D.N.Y.1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">We think the test is likewise l\u00e9ssstrict in determining, for venue purposes;, whether defendant\u2019s acts of selling-amounted to a \u201csale.\u201d Technically the-sales solicited by defendant were not; completed within this district, Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co. v. International Plastic Corp., 159 F.2d 554 (7th Cir. 1947), but we have already concluded, that a \u201ccompleted sale\u201d is not necessary.. This court in Shelton v. Schwartz, 131 F.2d 805, 808 (7th Cir. 1942), said that the term \u201ca regular and established place-of business\u201d in \u00a7 1400(b) should not \u201cbe-narrowed or limited in its construction.\u201d' The same should be said of \u201cacts of infringement,\u201d the other element of venue-in \u00a7 1400(b). Therefore, the technicalities of sales law should not control' whether defendant\u2019s degree of conduct, within the district was sufficient to constitute \u201cacts of infringement\u201d for venue-purposes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The degree of selling in the-case before us is a sufficient impairment of plaintiff\u2019s \u201cright to exclude others from making, using, or selling\u201d its invention<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> so as to constitute an act of' infringement within the district for venue purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">We hold that the two demonstrations of the accused device, added to the systematic and continuous solicitation of' orders within the district, constitute, for venue purposes, a sufficient degree of' selling to amount to \u201cinfringing sales.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">We do not reach plaintiff\u2019s \u201cbroader proposition\u201d that mere solicitation as-part of a systematic and continuous sales-effort is sufficient for venue purposes.. We need not discuss, therefore, James. P. Marsh Corp. v. United States Gauge Co., 129 F.2d 161 (7th Cir. 1942), and Shelton v. Schwartz, 131 F.2d 805 (7th. Cir. 1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">Finally, defendant contends that sex*vice of process was insufficient since it was made on Veague\u2019s secretary at defendant\u2019s Chicago office. Since Veague was out of the office 75 to 80 per cent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>\u2022 of the time, and since notice of the summons was communicated immediately, at Veague\u2019s direction, to defendant at its home office, the service was sufficient.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceeding \u2022consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1034-11\">. Venue in patent infringement suits is governed solely by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(b), Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Prod. Corp., 353 U.S. 222, 77 S.Ct. 787, 1 L.Ed.2d 786 (1957). Venue is conferred on any disti\u2019ict \u201c * * * where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-12\">Infringement is defined by \u00a7 271(a) of the Patent Act: \u201c * * * whoever without authority makes, uses or sells any patented invention, within the United States * * * infringes the patent.\u201d 66 Stat. 811 (1952), 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a) (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1034-15\">.

After judgment the district court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion under Pule 75(h), Fed. R.Civ.P., to add a number of \u201cpapers\u201d to the record which would have shown delivery of the accused device to a customer within the district. We must act upon the record as it was at the time the court ruled, and cannot consider these \u201cpapers\u201d in determining whether the court\u2019s ruling was erroneous. Dempsey v. Guaranty Trust Co., 131 F.2d 103, 104-05 (7th Cir. 1942), cert. denied, 318 U.S. 769, 63 S.Ct. 761, 87 L.Ed. 1139 (1943).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1034-22\">.
