MOORE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">Plaintiff appeals from a judgment in favor of defendant entered after a trial to court and jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">Plaintiff, a Chinese cook, was injured When struck, while standing at the edge of the westbound platform of defendant\u2019s Carle Place station, by the grab iron of the locomotive of a train moving at a high rate of speed in an easterly direction. Defendant was authorized to use the westbound track for its eastbound trains. 'This \u201creverse signal operation\u201d was for the purpose of using both tracks in a Westerly direction in the morning and in \u2022an easterly direction in the evening so as to handle the heavy commuter traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">Plaintiff claims that he heard the noise of an approaching train, went to the edge of the platform, peered to the east from which direction he expected the train to come,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> saw nothing to the east although his view was unobstructed, did not look in the other direction and that he thought that the oncoming train was on the other track. He was struck on the right shoulder while still facing to the east and injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-16\">At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, defendant moved for the direction of a verdict (1) for failure to establish negligence; and (2) because of contributory negligence. Both motions were renewed at the close of the entire case. Decisions were reversed. The court then submitted the case to the jury (1) for a general verdict, and (2) for a special verdict based upon written questions. The first question called for a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer to negligence and proximate cause. The second question, only to be answered if a \u201cyes\u201d answer were returned, related to plaintiff\u2019s proof by a fair preponderance that he was not guilty of contributory negligence. Upon the jury\u2019s return to the courtroom, the Clerk inquired, \u201cWhat is your verdict?\u201d The foreman then replied, \u201cFor the defendant.\u201d Upon inquiry from the Court as to whether the special verdict had been filled out, the foreman replied, \u201cYes.\u201d The jury was polled and all said that they found \u201ca verdict for the defendant.\u201d In chambers, the court then advised counsel of the answer to the special verdict questions, namely, negative as to negligence. In addition, eight of the jurors had subscribed to the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-17\">\u201cWe believe that the defendant was guilty of not providing sufficient safeguards for all passengers following the adoption of reverse traffic policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-18\">\u201cHowever, we must find for the defendant on the question (1) because of the evidence in this particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-19\">\u201cWe recommend that some solution be found to make it possible to alert all passengers under these conditions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>so <em>that a </em>similar accident may be prevented in the future.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The court proceeded to pass upon the motions as to which decision had been reserved and granted them, as he said, \u201cto clear the record.\u201d He added, \u201cThis being a jury verdict, I am not inclined to set any such verdict aside in any event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Plaintiff contends that the jury\u2019s verdict was inconsistent and ambiguous. There is nothing in the record to support this claim. The court said, \u201cI ask you to give a general verdict as well as a special or written verdict.\u201d The jury followed this request. Plaintiff creates his own confusion by choosing to misname the written comments by eight of the jurors as a \u201cwritten verdict.\u201d Obviously, it was not, and only represented the thoughts of eight jurors as to general safeguard procedure unrelated to the facts of this particular action.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">The judgment read \u201cand the jury having rendered a verdict in favor of the defendant, it is Adjudged: That the defendant have judgment against the plaintiff.\u201d To the judgment was annexed \u201cAn Extract of the Minutes\u201d which read in part \u201cJury returns verdict for Defendant\u2019s. Jury polled. Plaintiff defers motion. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss granted.\u201d The notice of appeal was from a final judgment in favor of defendant. Additionally, plaintiff appealed from orders granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case and at the end of the entire case but there was no order \u201cgranting defendant\u2019s motion dismissing the complaint and directing judgment for the defendant at the end of the entire ease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Plaintiff also argues that the judgment must be set aside because of defense counsel\u2019s alleged appeal on summation to religious and racial prejudice and because of the court\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>inquiry into plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs. The court\u2019s inquiry was not only justified but required in order to determine whether an oath or affirmation was to be administered. Plaintiff stated that he believed in Buddha. The court then directed affirmation. During the summation, defense counsel, while arguing credibility, said to the jury that they should consider \u201cthat all of the witnesses except the plaintiff swore, and I use the word \u2018swore\u2019 in its proper connotation, on a Bible to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Since the plaintiff is not a believer in the Bible or in God, he only affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">\u201cNow the difference between an oath and an affirmation is considerably different. That\u2019s just something to think of when you realize that he, and he alone,, is the one that tries to make out his, case.\u201d <em>: </em>M</p>\n<p id=\"b797-15\">These comments of defense counsel, were highly improper. There are many peoples of the world who do not accept, the Bible or God. For them affirmation, acceptable in lieu of oath, is provided.. No reason in law exists for differentiation-in the quality of truth between oath and', affirmation. Plaintiff\u2019s capacity to tell the truth and the truthfulness of his testimony were not diminished in any way by his failure to take an oath and no statement that they might have been should have been made. But whether this constituted reversible error is quite another question. Plaintiff was represented by an experienced and able veteran of the courtroom in the negligence field. He did not. object to these remarks when made. It, is not for us to speculate whether this-, was purposeful strategy or inadvertence.. In any event, the record discloses that he, in his subsequent summation, fully brought home to the jury the American principle that believers in Confucius, Buddha, or gods other than the Christian God are entitled to equal justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-16\">In our view of the ease, this reference could not have affected the verdict of the jury. Plaintiff\u2019s version of the accident may be accepted in its entirety and be consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict. The undisputed facts establish the eight-inch white warning curb along the edge of the platform, plaintiff\u2019s presence at the edge of the platform so close as to be-struck by a seven-eighths-inch overhang,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>the rapidly moving train, the reverse signal operation, the noise of the oncoming train, his facing to the east, and his unlimited view in both directions. Upon all the facts, the jury found for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-20\">. No westbound train was scheduled at that hour.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b798-5\">KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">I concur in the result. Like Judge MARSHALL, I believe that the plaintiff failed to produce any evidence of negligence, and I would interpret Judge Levet\u2019s granting of the motion to dismiss as a recognition of this fact. It is for this reason alone that the grossly improper comments of defendant\u2019s attorney on summation do not require reversal of the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b798-7\">MARSHALL, Circuit Judge (concurring) .</author>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">My separate concurrence is to emphasize that if there were the slightest probative evidence of negligence to warrant a verdict for the plaintiff, I would vote to reverse for the error of permitting defendant\u2019s attorney to comment on plaintiff's religious beliefs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
