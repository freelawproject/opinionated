We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"AGq\">The authorities are quite well collected in the briefs. From a reading of them, it is evident that this is just another ease in which management and labor see the invoked statute, Sec. 301, differently, and management\u2019s view is wrong.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AaH\">The Fifth Circuit has been responsive to the fashioning of Sec. 301 law by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The decision of the court below was contrary to the uniform course of decisions not only in the Supreme Court but in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-16\">.
