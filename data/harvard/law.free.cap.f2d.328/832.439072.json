The complaint sought a decree \u201cadjudging and decreeing that Texas Crude Oil Company has neither earned nor acquired any rights\u201d in the mineral transactions described; \u201cordering and \u25a0decreeing the cancellation and termination\u201d thereof; \u201cdirecting the Clerk of \u25a0Court of St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, to cancel and erase said transfer and \u25a0sublease from the records\u201d; and also for an accounting and money judgment for amounts due resulting from such cancellation and forfeiture. On a record described by the District Judge as \u201cmost voluminous, consisting of approximately :20 pounds of affidavits, pleadings, depositions, and exhibits,\u201d the District Court \u25a0concluded that there was no genuine issue \u25a0of fact as to any one or more or all of the seven specified defaults giving rise to the claimed forfeiture. The nature of the underlying mineral transactions, the \u2022contentions of the parties, the legal and factual controversies presented are all .set forth in the able opinion of the District Court, Iberian Oil Corporation v. Texas Crude Oil Co., D.C.La., 1963, 212 F.Supp. 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">Considering that this was, as the District Judge described it an \u201caction to \u25a0cancel an oil, gas and mineral lease\u201d and is therefore \u201can equitable proceeding * * * subject to judicial control\u201d requiring that \u201cthere must be a substantial breach of the contract\u201d to \u201cjustify application of [such] remedy,\u201d 212 F.Supp. 941, 945, we agree that, under the circumstances therein outlined, summary judgment denying this relief was properly granted. This voluminous but carefully prepared record demonstrates that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact which would have supported the drastic relief sought. The summary judgment did not undertake to, nor does it, adjudicate any more than that. Cf. F.R.Civ.P. 56(c) (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
