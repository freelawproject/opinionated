However, in following the highly desirable practice of conducting a conference on jury instructions at the close of the evidence and before the arguments and jury charge,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial judge, during this conference, was put on notice by counsel for plaintiff-appellants that the North Carolina law concerning rights of way at intersections was objectionable. Thus the defendant-appellee\u2019s contention that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the plaintiff-appellants have failed to comply with Rule 51, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is well taken as to appellants\u2019 point concerning the charge on contributory negligence. Rule 51, providing that \u201cno party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection\u201d has been invoked by this Court many times in instances such as appellants\u2019 complete failure to object to the charge as it relates to contributory negligence. Seaboard Air Line Railway Company v. Horowitz, 5th Cir., 1960, 277 F.2d 738; Sims v. Texas &amp; N. O. R. Co., 5th Cir., 1959, 267 F.2d 37; Cain v. Illinois Central R. Co., 5th Cir., 1959, 266 F.2d 942; DeFonce Construction Co. v. City of Miami, 5th Cir., 1958, 256 F.2d 425, cert. denied 358 U.S. 875, 79 S.Ct. 115, 3 L.Ed.2d 105; Ford v. United Gas Corporation, 5th Cir., 1958, 254 F.2d 817, cert. denied 358 U.S. 824, 79 S.Ct. 40, 3 L.Ed.2d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">As to appellants\u2019 contention that the trial judge\u2019s charge on the North Carolina intersectional right-of-way law was inapplicable and prejudicial, and as to defendant-appellee\u2019s countercontention that no specific objection was made to that instruction, it appears from the Minutes of the Conference on Jury Instructions that the trial judge was adequately put on notice as to plaintiff-appellants\u2019 objection. Rule 51 does not require formality in making the objection, and the form of the objection is not important as long as it is clear that the trial judge was informed as to the possible errors and was given an opportunity to correct them. Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, 2d Ed., Vol. 5, Section 51.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Plowever, it is not necessary for this Court to make a firm determination in this respect, since a reading of the entire charge convinces us that there was no error in giving the charge on the North Carolina intersectional law that substantially prejudiced the rights of the plaintiff-appellants. Nesbit v. Everette, 5th Cir., 1957, 243 F.2d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The judgment of the District Court is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-26\">. The Minutes of the Conference on Jury Instructions were ordered by this Court to be reproduced and made a part of the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
