I Love You\u201d a temporary injunction against the manufacture and sale of records embodying performances of them by The Beatles \u2014 whom we identify for posterity as four long-haired British \u201crock and roll\u201d performers currently enjoying a <em>succ\u00e9s fou. </em>Defendant Vee Jay Records, Inc. has been manufacturing the records from master recordings by The Beatles to which it was entitled under an agreement with Transglobal Music Co., Inc., admittedly not the copyright proprietor. Vee Jay's opposition to the grant of the injunction, below and here, rested on the alternative grounds. (1) that it was entitled to manufacture and sell the records under the compulsory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>license provision of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(e), because the copyright \u2022 owner had licensed mechanical reproduction in Great Britain; and (2) that affiliations among plaintiffs, Transglobal and other corporations made it inequitable for plaintiffs to deny the li- \u25a0 censes Vee Jay had sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">It would be quite unreasonable to construe the condition of the compulsory license clause, \u201cthat whenever the owner of a musical copyright has used or permitted or knowingly ac- \u25a0 quiesced in the use of the copyrighted work upon the parts of instruments serving to reproduce mechanically the musical work,\u201d as being satisfied by the manufacture of records in a foreign country, at least when these have not been brought into the United States. \u201cRules \u25a0of United States statutory law * * * \u25a0apply only to conduct occurring within, \u2022or having effects within, the territory of the United States, unless the contrary is \u25a0clearly indicated by the statute.\u201d American Law Institute, Restatement of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States (Proposed Official Draft), \u00a7 38; American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U.S. 347, 355, 29 S.Ct. 511, 53 L.Ed. 826 (1909); Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U.S. 281, 69 S.Ct. 575, 93 L.Ed. 680 (1949). Defendants\u2019construction would lead to the absurd conclusion that a foreign copyright owner who licenses mechanical reproduction in his own country, without any intention of ever entering the United States market, must promptly file a notice in the copyright office in Washington or else lose even the 2 cent per record royalty given by the compulsory license clause. The discussion in the House report, H.R.Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong.2d Sess. (1909), cited by defendants, is much too inconclusive to carry the day for them. Congress was concerned lest, as applied to the case at hand, any single record manufacturer should be able to monopolize the purveying of The Beatles\u2019 message to the American record buying public \u2014 not to accelerate the public\u2019s opportunity to hear their recordings of \u201cmusical compositions\u201d with which the copyright proprietor has not yet chosen to favor us. Although Ferris v. Frohman, 223 U.S. 424, 32 S.Ct. 263, 56 L.Ed. 492 (1912), dealt with a different claim of extraterritorial application of the Copyright Act, it points strongly against defendants\u2019 view.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">As to defendants' second ground, it suffices to say that the affidavits were far from easting such doubt on the plaintiffs\u2019 probability of success as to make the issuance of the temporary injunction an abuse of discretion. Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Safeway Properties, Inc., 307 F.2d 495, 497, 500 (2 Cir.1962). However we are somewhat concerned over the amount of the bond, $5,000, which would be quite inadequate if it should ultimately be decided that the injunction was wrongly issued. See Russell v. Farley, 105 U.S. 433, 437-447, 26 L.Ed. 1060 (1881); Lawrence v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry., 278 U.S. 228, 233, 49 S.Ct. 106, 73 L.Ed. 282 (1929). Defendants should have leave to apply for a larger bond and also to move for a speedy trial. On that basis the order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
