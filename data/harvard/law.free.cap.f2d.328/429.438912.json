Alabama gives a taxpayer the right to appeal an assessment to the Circuit Court of Montgomery County within thirty days of the assessment. Section 140, Title 51, Code of Alabama (1958). The taxpayer appealed on the thirty-first day. The Circuit Court held that the appeal was not timely filed, sustained the State\u2019s plea of abatement, and dismissed the taxpayer\u2019s appeal. See Dowda v. State, 1962, 274 Ala. 124, 145 So.2d 830. The taxpayer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>has not appealed from that judgment. Instead, the taxpayer filed a <em>de novo </em>proceeding in the district court attacking the validity of the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">We agree with the judgment of the district court, 216 F.Supp. 74. The State of Alabama provided \u201ca plain, speedy, and efficient remedy\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1341. The district court very properly refused to issue an injunction against the State Commissioner of Revenue. Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Co. v. Huffman, 1943, 319 U.S. 293, 63 S.Ct. 1070, 87 L.Ed. 1407.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
