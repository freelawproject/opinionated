UNITED STATES of America, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b639-20\">No. 18121.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b639-21\">United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b639-23\">Argued Dec. 19, 1963.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b639-24\">Decided Feb. 6, 1964.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b640-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Mr. J. Albert Woll, Washington, D. C. (appointed by this court), for appellant. \u25a0 Mr. John A. Terry, Asst. U. S. Atty., with whom Messrs. David C. Acheson, U. S. Atty., Frank Q. Nebeker and Harold H. Titus, Jr., Asst. U. S. Attys., were on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b640-7\">Before Bast\u00edan, Buegee and Weight, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b640-8\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">In this criminal appeal appellant contends that under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(e) (1958), he was entitled to production at trial of certain documents alleged to be \u201cstatements\u201d of the witness Robertson in the possession of the Government. The existence of these documents \u2014 an unsigned ostensible account of Robertson\u2019s projected testimony before the grand jury (Exhibit B) and a police incidental (Exhibit A) \u2014 was not ascertained until a post-trial hearing on appellant\u2019s application to appeal without prepayment of costs. Although the trial court denied appeal without prepayment, it did not specifically decide whether these documents were \u201cstatements\u201d producible under the Jencks Act; this despite Robertson\u2019s testimony that he had given a pre-trial statement to the police concerning the alleged crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">As we see it, this testimony of Robertson required that a hearing be conducted outside the jury\u2019s presence to discover whether any \u201cJencks statements\u201d relating to Robertson were in the possession of the Government. Any additional material producible under the Jencks Act would also have come to light in such hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">We therefore remand the record to the District Court to conduct a hearing;</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">(1) to identify what transaction Robertson was referring to in his testimony and whether any conversations in which he had engaged with government representatives had been transcribed in any manner;</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">(2) to examine in camera such statement or statements, if any, to examine the police incidental (Exhibit A) and the projected grand jury testimony (Exhibit B) to determine which, if any, should have been produced as \u201cstatements\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(e) (1958) ;</p>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">(3) if any Jencks-type statement is found, to decide whether failure to produce it was prejudicial to appellant\u2019s defense at trial. Williams v. United States, 117 U.S.App.D.C.-, 328 F.2d 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-17\">Remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
