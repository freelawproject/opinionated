Bone, Jr., Trustee in Bankruptcy for John D. Schindler, bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">Claimant, Cecil F. Shopen, a real estate broker and auctioneer with offices in St. Louis, Missouri, urges that the Referee and District Court erred as a matter of law in refusing to recognize an unsecured- claim against the bankrupt\u2019s estate emanating from a valid contract of employment between Shopen Realty Auction Company and the bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">The facts in main are uncontroverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">Schindler and his wife owned a farm consisting of 2,015 acres located in Au-drain County, Missouri. There was a first deed of trust against this land held by The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. Schindler became in default under this loan and he and his attorney, Ralph Alexander of Columbia, Missouri, advised Equitable that arrangements would be made to pay the delinquencies on the loan or the property would be sold by February 1, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">Sometime prior to January, 1961, the bankrupt and his wife made contact with the claimant, and on January 5, 1961, Shopen went to Columbia, Missouri and to the Schindler farm for an inspection and met with the Schindlers and their attorney. A contract for employment of claimant as auctioneer for sale of the Schindler farm was prepared and signed by the parties in the office of Attorney Alexander. The first parties in the contract were Schindler and his wife, and second party was Shopen Realty Auction-Company. It provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-15\">\u201cParties of the first part do by this contract employ and authorize Shopen Realty Auction Company to arrange for and conduct a public auction on the following described real estate, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-16\">\u201c2015 acres improved in AudrainCounty, Missouri.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-17\">\u201c * * * (T)he parties of the first, part agree to pay Shopen Realty-Auction Company for their services-, in conducting said auction of the-above described real estate as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-18\">\u201cFive Percent of the last bid made- or received plus cost of advertising, said sum not to exceed the sum of' $2,500.00, and said commission and. advertising due and payable on day-of auction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-19\">In addition to providing that first parties agree to furnish merchantable abstract of title and deliver premises by-warranty deed, the contract\u2019s disputed! paragraph stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-20\"><em>\u201cFirst parties hereby authorize second party to accept the proceeds of the sale of above property </em>and to insert the name or names of the purchasers of said property in the warranty deed as grantees, said deed' being signed and left in the hands of' Ralph L. Alexander * * * as part of the consideration for their services rendered herein; <em>and to completely close the transaction, remitting the proceeds from sale price\u201e less expense as set out above, </em>plus-abstracting fees, revenue stamps and! any delinquent taxes.\u201d (Emphasis; supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>The contract contained no stipulation requiring claimant to. obtain a fixed price for the realty to be auctioned. Furthermore, claimant made no oral guarantees to the owners to this effect. After the employment contract was executed, claimant prepared an illustrated brochure advertising the farm and setting forth details of the sale which was mailed to over three thousand people. The mailing list included all Missouri banks, the South Central Business Association and other selected groups. The brochure described the terms of the sale as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aom\">\u201cThis splendid farm is selling for cash over the existing balance on an original $300,000.00 loan \u2014 said balance being $250,000.00. Favorable rate \u2014 5% per cent \u2014 long-term loan. Buyer deposits day of sale \u2014 -15 per cent of the purchase price, with balance above existing indebtedness payable on or before 30 days. All 1960 taxes paid. Possession on March 1, 1961. Buyer gets half of 230 acres of wheat now growing on farm, and seller will apply liquid nitrogen needed and combine wheat, each taking one-half. If desired, splendid manager of entire operation can be furnished. Farm selling as a total of 2015 acres. Abstract of title and warranty deed furnished purchaser.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Total advertising expense paid out by claimant amounted to the sum of $2,-188.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">On January 27, 1961, an auction was conducted by claimant at the City Hall in Centralia, Missouri, at which three hundred and fifty people were present. Prior to the auction sale a deed had been executed in blank by the grantors, Mr. and Mrs. Schindler, and left with their attorney, Alexander. At the conclusion of the auction, a written contract was executed in Alexander\u2019s office between the Schindlers and three vendees whose joint bid of $359,000.00 was high. The contract called for a down payment of $53,-850.00 which was made and deposited with Alexander.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The real estate contract provided that the sellers furnish the buyers a complete-abstract of title within twenty days of the sale. The buyers had ten days thereafter to examine the abstract. If the-title was found to be good, the deed conveying the property free and clear of encumbrances and liens was to be delivered forthwith, but if the title proved defective, the buyers were required to specify their objection in writing within ten days; after delivery of the abstract. The sellers had thirty days thereafter to rectify any defects. If the defects could not be-rectified within such time, it was provided, \u201cthis contract shall be null and void, and the money deposited\u201d returned, to the buyers. The contract stipulated' all such tenders pertinent to closing of' the title were to be performed at the-office of the vendors\u2019 attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">It subsequently developed that the-sellers could not give clear title, because-the $359,000.00 sale price was insufficient .to pay off existing liens. In addition to the loan mentioned in the brochure of sale, which was the deed of trust held by Equitable, there was, unbeknown to&gt; claimant at the time of the auction, a second deed of trust securing notes held by two banks. This latter deed of trust, had a balance due of approximately $52,-000.00 and the Equitable mortgage had' a balance due of $318,666.11 at the time-trustee in bankruptcy subsequently sold the property under order.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Due to the combination of the defective title and Schindler\u2019s subsequently filing a petition in bankruptcy on March 13,. 1961, the auction sale was never consummated. The real estate contract was; subsequently rejected by the trustee in-bankruptcy as an executory contract, the-purchasers were returned their deposit of $53,850.00, and the trustee in bankrupty, by private negotiation, sold the-realty to other parties for $425,000.00. One of the purchasers at the private sale was one of the unsuccessful bidders at the auction. According to appellant, the trustee subsequently allowed the first purchasers\u2019 claim against the bankrupt\u2019s estate for breach of the real estate con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>tract for an amount equal to the difference between their bid and the $425,-000. 00 received by private sale.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Based upon five per cent of $359,000.00, the highest bid at the auction, the commission allegedly due Shopen was $17,-950.00 plus $2,188.93 for advertising expense, or a total of $20,138.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The Referee found that the claim for advertising expenses in the amount of $2,188.93 was allowable but denied the claim for commission. The District Court confirmed the Referee\u2019s order finding that the employment contract precluded claimant from earning his commission in the event the sale was not consummated because the property failed to bring an amount sufficient to pay off all existent liens thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">This appeal turns upon two decisive questions: (1) Did the employment contract expressly condition the real estate broker\u2019s commission upon his consummation of the conveyance of title to the property previously sold at auction? (2) Was the real estate broker chargeable with advance knowledge of the property\u2019s defective title which prevented consummation of the sale so as to estop him from recovery of his commission?</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">An employment contract for the sale of realty is to be construed from the intent to be gathered from the language within the four corners of the instrument, Spears v. Carter, 224 Mo. App. 726, 24 S.W.2d 717 (1930), and an auctioneer, in selling property for another, is the vendor\u2019s agent, with rights and liabilities governed by the general principles of the law of agency. Pasley v. Ropp, 334 S.W.2d 254, 80 A.L.R.2d 1231 (Mo.App.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">While Missouri recognizes the general principle entitling an agent or broker to his commission once he has produced a purchaser ready, willing and able to buy on the terms proposed by the vendor, such a right, by express stipulation, may be contingent to vesting upon the occurrence or performance of other conditions or duties set forth in the contract of employment. Tant v. Gee, 348 Mo. 633, 154 S.W.2d 745 (1941) ; Bowman v. Rahmoeller, 331 Mo. 868, 55 S.W.2d 453 (1932); Pratt v. Irwin, 189 S.W. 398 (Mo.App.1961). And so it has been held that a broker had not earned his commission where he did not procure a purchaser ready, willing and able to pay a fixed price for the property as provided in the contract. Tant v. Gee, supra, Rosenblatt v. Multin, 222 S.W.2d 587 (Mo.App.1949) ; Proctor v. Gentry, 214 S.W.2d 746 (Mo.App.1948). Likewise, failure to produce a purchaser within the employment contract\u2019s specified time period or before its cancellation will defeat the broker\u2019s right to a commission. Bowman v. Rahmoeller, supra; Clarkson v. Standard Brass Mfg. Co., 237 Mo.App. 1018, 170 S.W.2d 407 (1943). In these instances the conditions preceding vesting of the broker\u2019s right to a commission failed to materialize due to either the reluctance of the purchaser to perform or the fault of the broker himself. However, we have found no authority for the proposition that even should we hold under the contract that claimant\u2019s fee was contingent upon consummation of the sale, his right to compensation for services performed may be defeated by his employer\u2019s own inability to tender a merchantable title. To the contrary, cases abound which hold that the broker has earned his commission where consummation of the sale is prevented by default of the vendor. Prugh v. Tyrrell, 209 Mo.App. 582, 235 S.W. 143 (1921) ; Smith v. Stubb, 293 S.W. 496 (Mo.App. 1927); Maddux v. St. Louis Union Trust Co., 186 Mo.App. 138, 171 S.W. 669 (1914); Vining v. Mo-La Oil Co., 312 Mo. 30, 278 S.W. 747 (1925); Knisely v. Leathe, 256 Mo. 341, 166 S.W. 257 (1914); Perrin v. Kimberlin, 110 Mo. App. 661, 85 S.W. 630 (1905); Keeney-Toelle Real Estate Co. v. Hillinghorst, 319 S.W.2d 675 (Mo.App.1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number> It would be grossly incongruous for the parties to have agreed, as they did in one paragraph of the contract, that the vendors bear the burden of tendering a merchantable title and then intend in another provision indicating the broker was authorized to close the sale that the latter provision operated to cancel his right to a commission for services performed upon his employers\u2019 breach of the former provision due to a defect in their title. The ineonsonance of these results is apparent, for such an interpretation of the employment contract would destroy the parties\u2019 mutuality of obligation. The broker, once he had performed, would have no assurance of performance on the part of his employer who could preclude completion of the sale by arbitrarily creating a cloud on his title and thereby eliminate his obligation to pay the broker his fee. If the vendor wants this protection from payment of the broker\u2019s commission in the event his title proves defective and frustrates a completed sale of the property, he must specifically so provide in their contract of employment. See Prugh v. Tyrrell, supra; Gerhart v. Peck, 42 Mo.App. 644 (1890). If the vendors here had de sired such protection, it is a reasonable assumption that it would have been clearly specified in the employment contract they executed in the office of their attorney. While this agreement \u201cauthorized\u201d the claimant to close the transaction, remitting the proceeds less expenses, their own attorney was obligated and did in fact attempt to handle all matters necessary to the actual conveyance of title. It would place a strained construction on the parties\u2019 use of the word \u201cauthorize\u201d, which ordinarily denotes a power to act as opposed to an obligation to act, to hold in effect that the broker\u2019s commission remained dependent upon fulfillment of the details of the transaction\u2019s closing once this authority was alternatively delegated to the vendors\u2019 attorney pursuant to the brokerage agreement. This Court must enforce the parties\u2019 will as expressed in their written argument and not reform that instrument to reach results unprovided for.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">We also feel that the District Court erred in finding that securing a purchaser within the intendment of the agreement obligated the claimant to sell the property at a price sufficient to satisfy all liens and his fee, or otherwise his commission was unearned.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Claimant was not bound under his contract to obtain a purchaser willing to buy the property at any fixed sum. However, he was aware from information furnished him by his employer that the purchaser procured must offer a price in excess of the amount of the known lien against the property held by Equitable before the prospective vendee\u2019s offer would be acceptable to the vendors. The best bid obtainable by claimant was $359,000.00 which was accepted by the vendors in the subsequently executed real estate contract. This bid was sufficient to satisfy Equitable\u2019s lien, described in the brochure advertising the auction, as well as pay the claimant\u2019s five per cent fee. Thereafter, when the second lien came to light and the sale collapsed as a result thereof, it is argued that the claimant could no longer remit the proceeds less expenses and commission from the sale in compliance with his agreement, and thereby lost his right to a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Respectable authority exists, which holds that the mere fact the broker was to receive his compensation out of\u2019 the proceeds of the sale does not make-his right to compensation dependent at all events on the completion of the sale. If' he performed his part of the contract by obtaining a buyer acceptable to the vendor, and the trade was defeated alone by the inability of the vendor to make a. good title, then he is entitled to receive compensation for his services even though it cannot be paid as agreed out of the purchase money. Finch v. Guardian Trust Co., 92 Mo.App. 263 (1901); Perrin v. Kimberlin, supra; Vining v. Mo-La Oil Co., supra.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The remaining issue concerns estoppel of. the broker to claim his fee as earned where proven he had advance knowledge of defects in his employers\u2019 title which would cause the sale to fail. This established precedent is bottomed upon sound reasoning. The broker takes the contract to procure a purchaser ready, willing and able to buy what the broker\u2019s principal has to sell. If the broker knows that the principal has a title which the purchaser will not accept, then he has not produced a purchaser in accordance with the terms of his agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Here, actual, not constructive, notice is required for estoppel to apply, and ordinarily, it is not incumbent upon the broker to inquire as to the existence of any defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The record is devoid of any evidence that at the time the employment contract was signed and the auction performed, the claimant had any knowledge of the existence of the second deed of trust causing the defect in the vendors\u2019 title. It is safe to assume that the vendors were aware of this encumbrance executed by themselves. For some unexplainable reason, they chose not to inform the claimant of its existence prior to the auction sale and execution of the real estate contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The only Missouri appellate decision to be found squarely in point required the vendor, under similar circumstances, to pay his broker a commission on the theory that the duty lies with the vendor to inform the broker of any existent defect if he desired protection from payment of the latter\u2019s fee in the event the defect prevented consummation of the sale. Smith v. Stubb, supra. On pages 497-498 of the opinion, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">\u201cThere is no evidence * * <em>? </em>that defendant ever notified plaintiffs that the lands he employed them to sell were incumbered by a mortgage, or that they had any knowledge thereof prior to the time the written contract between defendant and (purchaser) was entered into. * * While plaintiffs\u2019 employment was general, and they were required to find a purchaser \u2018satisfactory and acceptable\u2019 to defendant, that did not mean they were bound to overcome unusual conditions relative to defendant\u2019s title of which they were uninformed. If there were leases, mortgages, or other entanglements on defendant\u2019s lands in regard to which he desired to be protected in the manner stipulated in the contract, it was defendant\u2019s duty to notify plaintiffs in regard thereto at the time of employment, or at least before a purchaser might be procured under the original terms of employment. And a broker\u2019s right to a commission * * * is not dependent upon the consummation of the contract between his principal and the purchaser, unless the contract fails of consummation through the broker\u2019s fault, or when there has been an express stipulation to that effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">See also Politte v. Wall, 256 S.W.2d 283 (Mo.App.1953); Bledsoe v. Lombard, 194 S.W. 518 (Mo.App.1917); Keeney-Toelle Real Estate Co. v. Hillinghorst, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">Applying this criterion to the facts of the instant case, we see that the vendors clearly neglected to inform the claimant of the fatal defect in their title, and their contract of employment contained no express stipulation conditioning payment of the claimant\u2019s fee upon his consummation of the sale, but rather made it due and payable the day of the auction when the buyer\u2019s offer was accepted. The claimant is, therefore, not estopped to claim his commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">Summarizing, the contract of brokerage does not require the broker to sell for a fixed price or price sufficient to pay all liens. The vendors\u2019 attorney did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>incorporate such a condition in the contract, and the Court is not at liberty to rectify this omission in the contract\u2019s terms. Furthermore, the record evidence is undisputed that the vendors executed a binding contract of sale with the purchasers secured by claimant, subsequent to the auction sale. The record evidence also undisputedly reflects that claimant had no knowledge of the second lien and was convinced the auction sale price sufficed to pay the Equitable first lien of which he was aware, all charges incident to the sale, and his commission. Under such circumstances, we have no alternative in view of the prevailing law of Missouri but to reverse the decision of the District Court with directions to allow appellant\u2019s unsecured claim for the full amount of his commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Reversed with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-11\">. Appellant averred this fact is substantiated by the records of the Bankruptcy Court which is undenied by appellee. We assume, therefore, the statement to be true.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b743-4\">. But compare with Staples v. O\u2019Reilly, 288 S.W.2d 670 (Mo.App.1956) wherein the broker was denied Ms commission for failing to consummate a sale as express<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>ly provided in Ms contract of employment which stated Ms commission was to be the balance of a fixed purchase price and was payable witMn thirty days after the closing of the transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
