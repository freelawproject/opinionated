After the auditor had filed his report recommending allowance to appellant of a fee of $500, appellant filed exceptions and objections to that report, based on the alleged inadequacy of the recommended allowance. The court, however, overruled the exceptions and objections, and directed the receiver to make distribution in accordance with the auditor\u2019s report. The receiver did make such disbursement, including a check to appellant for the $500 recommended, which check appellant accepted and cashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">We have said on several occasions that this court \u201cmay not properly set aside a judgment which rests upon findings of fact made by a special master and adopted by the trial court unless at least such findings are clearly erroneous.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dyker Bldg.
