United States, 8 Cir., 279 F.2d 688 (cert. den. 368 U.S. 935, 82 S.Ct. 374, 7 L.Ed.2d 197), 8 Cir., 303 F.2d 775 and 8 Cir., 307 F.2d 740 (cert. den. 371 U.S. 930, 83 S.Ct. 301, 9 L.Ed.2d 237).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">The attack made in the present application is that the complaint filed before the Commissioner was invalid because it did not show that the person making oath thereto had personal knowledge of the facts alleged; that the warrant issued on the complaint was invalid because it did not \u201cshow probable cause or charge a crime\u201d; and that the indictment returned against appellant was invalid because \u201cthe signature of Mr. Fallon Kelly [the United States Attorney] and Mr. George Kern [presumably the foreman of the grand jury] is plain forgery on the face of the indictment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\"> The complaint and the warrant of arrest are without relevancy to or effect upon appellant\u2019s trial, conviction and sentence, since, as his papers disclose, these rest upon proceedings had, and not objected to, under the indictment subsequently returned against him. The charge that the signatures on the indictment are forgeries, and that the indictment thus is fraudulent, is frivolous on its face, (a) in respect to the foreman, from the fact of the grand jury\u2019s return of the indictment and the court\u2019s acceptance thereof, and (b) in respect to-the United States Attorney, from the fact of the indictment having been officially proceeded on by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">In view of the inability of the grounds asserted to afford a basis for collateral attack by appellant of any nature, we do-not concern ourselves with the question of whether they otherwise might be within the scope of a writ of error coram nobis.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">Appeal docketed and dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
