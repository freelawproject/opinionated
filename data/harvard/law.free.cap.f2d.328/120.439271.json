He does not \u25a0deny that the evidence warranted the judge in finding that he stole from a mailbox a $60 Treasury check payable to \u201cA.Rivera unrem wid,\u201d meaning, as we are told, \u201cunremarried widow\u201d; that he .sought the aid of one Leary<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in cashing the check, saying falsely that it belonged to Wilkins\u2019 aunt, promising Leary $5 for Iiis pains, and adding \u201cIf we cash that \u25a0one, there are some more checks in the mailbox like this\u201d; that Leary went to the garage of a taxi company and asked an employee, Finelli, to cash the check, telling Finelli it belonged to his aunt or his friend\u2019s aunt; that Leary then endorsed \u201cA.Rivera unrem wid\u201d; and that Finelli, having himself endorsed the \u25a0check, then cashed it at the taxi company\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Wilkins\u2019 sole challenge to his conviction is a contention that the making of a false endorsement with a knowingly false oral representation of authority comes within the rationale of Gilbert v. United States, 370 U.S. 650, 82 S.Ct. 1399, 8 L.Ed.2d 750 (1962), which held that a knowingly unauthorized written agency \u25a0endorsement did not constitute a forgery .at common law nor hence under 18 U.S. G. \u00a7 495, originally enacted in 1823, 3 Stat. 771. But, as the district judge held, the case is different in the essential respect, recognized in Selvidge v. United States, 290 F.2d 894 (10 Cir. 1961), which the Supreme Court cited with approval in Gilbert, that whereas the endorsement in each of those cases \u201cwas exactly what it professed to be,\u201d here it was not \u2014 with a correspondingly different effect on the company that cashed the check, the banks through which it passed, and ultimately on the Treasury. What Leary did and Wilkins caused to be done constituted \u201cthe making or altering a writing so as to make the writing or alteration purport to be the act of some other person, which it is not\u201d \u2014 the conduct which, if done with the requisite guilty knowledge, constituted forgery at common law. In re Windsor, 6 B. &amp; S. 522, 527 (1865); Regina v. Ritson, 11 Cox\u2019s Cr.Cases 352 (1869). We could rest on the scholarly opinion of Judge Bryan, 213 F.Supp. 332, were it not for appellant\u2019s heavy reliance on two cases not discussed therein, Commonwealth v. Baldwin, 77 Mass. [11 Gray] 197 (1858), and Morgan v. State, 77 Ga.App. 164, 48 S.E.2d 115 (1948). The Baldwin decision is fairly distinguishable, whether or not we would agree with it, on the basis that the note was signed by a purported partnership containing the defendant\u2019s own name; the Morgan decision is, in our view, wrong and not supported by the authorities on which it relies. We cannot consider the answer of defense counsel to a question of Baron Parke in Regina v. White, 2 Car. &amp; K. 404, 413 (1847), concerning the effect of false oral representation of authority, as indicating what the judges would have held if that issue had been before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">The Court is indebted to Irving Younger, Esq. who, as assigned counsel, represented Wilkins both in the District Court and here, and aided us with a learned but concise brief and an effective argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-14\">. Leary, wlio was also charged, pleaded guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
