From this total of $18,517.30, the court deducted a $2,500.00 retainer fee paid to plaintiff by defendant. Accordingly, judgment in the amount of $16,017.30, with interest, was entered in favor of plaintiff. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-20\">Finding, as we do, that there is evidence in the record to support the findings of fact and conclusions of law entered by the District Court, and that these findings and conclusions are not \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d it follows that the judgment of the District Court must be and is</p>\n<p id=\"b270-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
