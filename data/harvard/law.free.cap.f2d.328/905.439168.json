The coil is described as for use in a heating and dispensing device in which it is heated to a viscous state and applied to articles to be adhered together. Appellants contend that such use eliminates the need for a molten adhesive reservoir.</p>\n<p id=\"AUi\">The references relied on are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-5\">Price 1,923,456 Aug. 22,1933</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-6\">Sussenbach 2,510,727 June 6,1950</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU7\">Shonberg 2,557,574 June 19,1951</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOS\">Alien Property Custodian Application of Dumont, Serial No. 352,-364, Published April 27, 1943.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Dumont describes the production of shaped structures, such as filaments, rods, tubes and the like from moldable synthetic resins, by extruding the shaped structures in a plastic, liquid or dissolved state from a nozzle rotating quickly around its axis, and finally cold drawing said structures in the direction of the extrusion. In one embodiment of Dumont, a filament \u201cconsisting of thermoplastic synthetic resins\u201d is extruded from a nozzle rotating in bearings. The extruded filament is then wound in coils on a cylinder rotating in bearings with a higher peripheral speed than the corresponding extrusion velocity. Dumont teaches that synthetic resins, preferably those possessing a linear structure of the polymeric molecules, may be extruded with a resulting orientation effect which greatly improves their tenacity. Dumont considers this especially true \u201cfor the superpoly-condensates * * * such as the superpolyamides and polyamide condensation products which are obtainable either from dibasic acids and dibasic .amines or from aminocarboxylic acids .and their lactames.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">Price discloses a package for enclosing ribbon-like products, such as wire, wire solder, tape and the like. The package includes a spool member, and a wrapper for encircling the ribbon-like products wound on the spool.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">Shonberg discloses wrapping solder wire or other flexible material helically around a core member, the core member forming the body of a spool.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">Sussenbach discloses a sealing composition containing a tacky, adhesive, plastic resin bonding material, chrysotile, an electrical conducting material and an organic polar solvent. In use, a round bead of the plastic sealing composition may be extruded along the margin of a metal plate, another metal plate brought into engagement with the bead, and welding electrodes applied at spaced points along the metal plates. The pressure of the electrodes forces the plates toward one another and squeezes the bead flat. Upon the passsage of the welding current through the electrodes, plates, and sealing composition, the plates are squeezed closer together and become welded together.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">The examiner rejected claim 24 on Dumont. He considered the coiled filaments or rods of Dumont to meet all the limitations as to appellants\u2019 thermoplastic material and took the position that Dumont\u2019s coiled filaments or rods obviously possess all the physical limitations defined in appellants\u2019 claim 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-13\">The examiner also rejected claim 24 as \u201clacking invention\u201d over Sussenbach in view of Price or Shonberg. He regarded Price and Shonberg as showing flexible material which has all the physical properties of the material defined in claim 24 formed into rod shape and wound into coil form and concluded that \u201cno invention\u201d would be involved in winding the \u201crod of Sussenbach\u201d into coil form.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>The examiner further rejected claim 24 as lacking invention over Price or Shonberg in view of Dumont or Sussenbach. The examiner could find no \u201cinvention\u201d involved in substituting the material of Dumont or Sussenbach for the material in Price or Shonberg, thereby providing a coil of adhesive rod. The examiner made reference to the Fibers Chart in \u201cModern Plastics\u201d \u2014 Encyclopedia issue, Sept. 1956, at pages 514 and 515, to show that nylon in filament form \u201cbecomes sticky as [sic] 400-455\u00b0F which is comparable to the temperature limitations in the claim.\u201d He also considered nylon to be flexible and took the view that, since size is not a matter of \u201cinvention,\u201d the dimensional limitations in claim 24 have no effective force.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">The Board of Appeals found no error in the examiner\u2019s decision in rejecting claim 24 over (1) Dumont, (2) Sussenbach in view of Price or Shonberg and (3) Price or Shonberg in view of Dumont or Sussenbach.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">In sustaining the examiner\u2019s rejection of claim 24 on Dumont, the board stated that \u201cWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary defines \u2018adhesive\u2019 as \u2014 sticky\u201d and that therefore Dumont\u2019s material may be \u2018adhesive\u2019 at 400\u00b0F.\u201d The board further referred to pages 174-175 of \u201cThe Technology of Adhesives\u201d by John Delmonte (1947) as \u201cshowing the use of nylon as an adhesive to be old, specifically as safety glass interlayers and for shoes, boxes, cloth, leather, wood and glass.\u201d The board considered that Dumont\u2019s references to \u201c \u2018filaments, rods * * * and the like\u2019 would suggest to one working in the art a flexible member of the thickness of about % to % inch particularly when viewed with Shonberg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">The issue facing this court is whether the board was correct in affirming the examiner\u2019s ground of rejection of claim 24 as unpatentable over (1) Dumont, (2) Sussenbach in view of Price or Shonberg and (3) Price or Shonberg in view of Dumont.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">Dumont discloses synthetic resins in the form of shaped structures such as filaments and rods. In a specific embodiment, Dumont shows a solid thermoplastic synthetic resinous filament being wound iri a coil on a cylinder. Thus we think it clear that Dumont suggests-winding thermoplastic synthetic resinous-rods in coils on a cylinder and would therefore suggest a rod in coil form as set forth in claim 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">Appellants urge that their reference to a package of \u201cadhesive,\u201d the fluid limitation and the size recitation result in structurally distinguishing claim 24 over Dumont.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">Dumont teaches that the \u201csuperpolycondensates\u201d may be formed into his shaped structures. Such \u201csuperpolyeondensates\u201d are exemplified as being \u201cthe <em>superpolyamides </em>and <em>polyamide condensation products </em>which are obtainable either from dibasic acids and dibasie amines or from aminocarboxylic acids- and their lactams.\u201d [Emphasis ours.jj</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">Although Dumont does not specify any particular polyamide nor indicate the fluidity or adhesiveness of a polyamide applicable for his invention, it is clear from the record that the use of polyamide condensation products for adhesives is old. The board referred to Delmonte\u2019s \u201cThe Technology of Adhesives,\u201d pages 174-175 (1947) as making such a showing. That reference, for example, teaches that a resin formed from triglycol diamine and adipic acid, which is soluble in water, alcohol, and dioxane, and melts at 185\u00b0C. is \u201cof potential value to the field of adhesives.\u201d Such a resin is a polyamide condensation product and Dumont discloses polyamide condensation products. Furthermore, \u201cThe Technology of Adhesives\u201d states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-12\">\u201c * * * Carothers also describes safety glass applications of these polyamides 72 <em>[</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>], </em>and other readily soluble polyamides useful for coatings, packaging materials, and <em>adhesives. </em>Ethylene diamines are reacted with fatty acids from soybean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>to form polyamides soluble in inexpensive solvents. They exhibit excellent adhesion to glassine paper, sulfite paper, lead foil cellophane, etc.73 [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">As to the fluid limitation in the range of 250\u00b0 F. to 400\u00b0F. the triglycol diamineadipic acid polyamide referred to in \u201cThe Technology of Adhesives\u201d melts at 185\u00b0C., i. e., 365\u00b0F., which is within appellants\u2019 claimed temperature range,</p>\n<p id=\"ASU\">i Claim 24 does specify \u201ca normally solid, flexible, thermoplastic mixture of <em>\u2022at least two ingredients </em>at least one of ^ which is a normally solid, thermoplastic, synthetic polymer.\u201d [Emphasis ours.] However, claim 24 does not specify what the second of appellants\u2019 \u201cat least two ingredients\u201d is. As pointed out above, Dumont shows a normally solid thermoplastic composition which may be a superpolyamide or a polyamide condensation product and the record shows the adhesive use of polyamides, having a fluidity within appellants\u2019 claimed fluidity range, to be old. Thus, although Dumont does not show a thermoplastic mixture of at least two ingredients, we do not consider the mere requirement of \u201cat least two ingredients,\u201d in the absence of any further language in the claim specifying what that other ingredient is, to patentably distinguish appellants\u2019 claim 24 over the Dumont patent. Furthermore, even though the majority of appellants\u2019 examples have at least two thermoplastic synthetic polymeric materials, appellants have indicated<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that in one of their examples there is but one thermoplastic synthetic polymeric material present and that the \u201cspecial combination of properties of the adhesive rod in solid and in heat softened condition depends on the presence of the synthetic polymer material in substantial proportion.\u201d As claim 24 reads, the second of appellants\u2019 \u201cat least two ingredients\u201d could be any type of material including a nonpolymeric material.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">Remaining for consideration is the recitation in the claim that the rod is formed of a thickness of between about % and % inch. The Dumont reference does not disclose this particular size. However, we think it does suggest formation of a rod of synthetic resinous polyamides in coil form. We consider the thickness of the rods as only an obvious matter of choice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is, of course, nothing in the claim limiting the use of the claimed package to direct through-feeding into a heating and dispensing device. Obviously the package of adhesive may be used by cutting the rods into lengths and melting the lengths in a reservoir. The use of a molten adhesive reservoir has been described by appellants as old.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">Since we consider that the appealed claim is unpatentable over Dumont, we find it unnecessary to consider the examiner\u2019s remaining art rejections.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">For the foregoing reasons the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-8\">.

Not that the problem is ever easy to solve, but here it is particularly difficult because of the claim, which is a misfortune inflicted upon us by the U. S. system of claiming. When the issue is approached only from the standpoint of the limitations in the claim and their in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>dividual relation to elements of structure, thermal characteristics, packaging methods, and the like to be found in the references, one completely loses sight of reality, of what the applicants actually invented, and reaches a result, as the majority does, which may sound good and seem logical but which rather misses the only important point \u2014 whether what the applicants <em>invented </em>is something which <em>would </em>have been obvious from the references.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">I wish, therefore, to approach the question from the standpoint of what they invented, as the record shows it, and thereafter consider how it is claimed and whether the claim defines, as well as may be, an unobvious invention. If this sounds like a peculiar approach, I would suggest that everyone familiar with this patent business knows full well that a claim considered by itself rarely conveys a clear idea of what has been invented and that the best way to arrive at an understanding of the invention is to compare the disclosure with the prior art and see what the differences are. The claim is then to be read in the light of the disclosure. I will start with the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"AiWU\">Price and Shonberg disclose the conventional, well-known spools of coiled wire solder. Solder is not an \u201cadhesive.\u201d Sussenbach discloses a sealing composition for welded seams the plasticity of which \u201cis such that it may be readily extruded from an extrusion gun to form a round bead as it is applied * * In other words, it can be laid on the work like toothpaste or caulking compound. It cannot be spooled. It is not an adhesive. The adhering is done with spot welds. Dumont (the German national\u2019s application published by the Alien Property Custodian in 1943) is concerned with improving the \u201ctenacity\u201d \u2014 i. e., tensile strength (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2nd Ed., \u201c4. <em>Physics\u201d) </em>\u2014 of any kind of \u201creversibly moldable\u201d \u2014 i. e., thermoplastic \u2014 synthetic resin by a twofold mechanical working. Extruded articles such as filaments, rods, or tubes are, first of all, extruded through a revolving extrusion nozzle which tends to orient molecules in a circular direction and, secondly, the extruded article is drawn out linearly at a faster rate than it is extruded so as to orient molecules linearly. The disclosure is that the invention applies to \u201call synthetic resins possessing preferably a linear structure of the polymeric molecules.\u201d One part of the linear drawing mechanism is a cylinder on which the extruded article is wound as it is emitted from the extruder \u201cwith a higher peripheral speed than the corresponding extrusion velocity.\u201d Thus does one end up, possibly and temporarily, with a plastic rod \u201cin coil form\u201d as an incidental result of the drawing operation. Of course, the rod must be removed from the cylinder for use and its ultimate form is not disclosed. The reference says nothing whatever about adhesives and has no bearing on adhesives, their form, composition or handling. It deals solely with the molecular orientation of thermoplastics in general by mechanical working.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">Dumont includes nylons among his thermoplastics and \u201cModern Plastics 1956\u201d is cited merely to show that nylons are \u201csticky\u201d at 400-450\u00b0F. and melt at about 415-480\u00b0F. (The majority opinion omits this reference but the solicitor did not.) The \u201cTechnology of Adhesives\u201d reference discloses that certain polyamides (which \u201cnylons\u201d are) may possibly be of value in the field of adhesives, sometimes dissolved in solvents, sometimes as \u201chot melts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b993-15\">One cannot find in the cited references any disclosure or any suggestion of an <em>adhesive </em>product, usable as such, in the form of a coiled rod. However, by the Patent Office reasoning a spool of nylon fishing line would meet the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-16\">There is other \u201cprior art\u201d of which neither the majority nor the Patent Of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>fice takes notice which has an important bearing on the issue before us. That is the prior art referred to in appellants\u2019 specification and elsewhere with respect to how the thermoplastic resin adhesive compositions were being handled in the field to which the invention pertains at the time appellants came forth with their invention. The patenting of inventions is of practical concern with reference to the promotion of the progress of useful arts and the one thing apparently given no consideration whatever by the examiner, the board, the solicitor, and the majority is the state of the relevant useful art and what the appellants did to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">The specification points out, and it has not been disputed, that before the invention thermoplastic polymeric adhesive as ' used in machines employing and applying it<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was heated in substantial quantity in a reservoir in the machine and pumped in a molten state to the point of application. This had several disadvantages. The reservoir had to be kept filled by the operator of the machine. An excessive quantity of adhesive had to be kept melted which also took too long a time to melt when a machine was started up. Continued heating had a deleterious effect on some hot melt adhesives, which decomposed. Cleaning out the reservoir was difficult and necessary whenever a change was made from one adhe- \u25a0 sive to another. These hot melt or \u201cglue pot\u201d adhesives, incidentally, were brittle compositions which were broken up into pieces to be fed to the reservoir and as such were not amenable to being made into the form of rod to be wound into a cojl and unwound again for use.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Now against this art background, what was appellants\u2019 invention? It was <em>an entirely new concept in adhesive handling. </em>It was the concept of providing a solid polymeric type adhesive in the form of an elongated coilable rod of particular strength, flexibility, and fluidity characteristics for a particular purpose, to be used in a non-existent machine which was to be developed to employ their novel concept, provided it worked out. As one of the inventors, Johnson, said in his affidavit, \u201cAt the outset, it was not apparent to either of us whether or not we could produce an adhesive formulation suitable for coiled rod formation and having the requisite properties.\u201d <em>After considerable research, </em>success was achieved and a patent application filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">The patent specification reflects what was learned in the course of the research. One may conveniently divide the specification into three parts: the broad statement of the invention, the disclosure or discussion of the considerations to be met in carrying out the invention, \u25a0 and ten specific examples of exact formulations of adhesive compositions suitable for practicing the invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">In the broad statement of the invention the appellants said: \u201cThis invention relates to a new thermoplastic adhesive article for direct through feed thermoplastic adhesive dispensing.\u201d So far as the record shows, this was a novel concept. \u201cAccording to the present invention there is provided an elongated body of solid, thermoplastic adhesive constituting a self-supporting rod of uniform cross section for cooperation as supply and control with a heated softening and dispensing passageway having a complementary cross section.\u201d No such concept is disclosed in the references. \u201cCompositions which have been completely outside of the field of materials which could be used for adhesives to be dispensed from a molten reservoir may be employed effectively in this special form.\u201d And further, \u201cThe thermoplastic adhesive rod constitutes a new tool with the aid of which a great many adhesive' problems are solved.\u201d In no reference is. there the slightest suggestion to utilize a thermoplastic resin adhesive in the form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>of a coilable rod and the \u201cnew tool\u201d characterization appears most apt. \u201cThe field of uses of the thermoplastic adhesive rod is extremely broad and a wide variety of rods of thermoplastic adhesive may be prepared for the various uses * * The breadth of the invention is summed up as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-6\">\u201cNo serious limitations exist as to physical or chemical properties except that the rod be a thermoplastic adhesive composition, that it possess sufficient flexibility and resistance to fracture at operational temperatures to be coiled and uncoiled and that it be self-supporting and possess dimensional stability such that the rod or strip does not change during storage from the shape required for cooperation with the softening and dispensing passageway.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYp\">Following these general statements, the ten specific examples are set forth. In the variety of their formulations they demonstrate that the broad concept of the invention can be carried into practice in a wide variety of ways and support the general statement made in the specification that a skilled compounding chemist, familiar with the teaching of the specification, could produce satisfactory rods other than those specifically described.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">The foregoing amply demonstrates the predicament of the applicants vis-a-vis the Patent Office which complains that the claim is \u201cfunctional\u201d in many of its limitations, which should therefore be ignored; that the temperature range stated for fluidity is not a \u201ccritical\u201d range, whatever that may be taken to mean; that it is indefinite in \u201cother ingredients\u201d than the synthetic polymer; that it does not set forth \u201cspecific ingredients\u201d; that Dumont\u2019s polymers are not distinguished from \u201cin terms of chemical structure\u201d and fail to set forth molecular weights of the components; and that there, is \u201cno limitation as to the diameter of the coil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">\u2022 If appellant\u2019s broad concept of coiled adhesive in rod form which is basically a polymeric thermoplastic resin \u25a0 is not protected by a broad claim, the practical result is that it <em>is not protected at all </em>because of the ease with which formulations other than those specifically disclosed could be devised, with which to enjoy the benefits of the invention without meeting the limitations of such a claim as the Patent Office appears to visualize as meeting its requirements. Therefore we are faced with a broad claim. Appellants would be fools to try for any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">If we center our attention on the invention as described, it is apparent that it is <em>a broad invention nowhere suggested in the references. </em>But attention has been centered on the claim instead, read without much regard to- the scope of the invention or the meanings of the terms in the claim construed in the light of the supporting disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">The main rejection rests on Dumont alone and is based on two things: that it shows some nylon, possibly in rod form, temporarily rolled on the cylinder of a machine the real purpose of which was to stretch it as it came out of the ex-truder; and that another reference says nylon gets \u201csticky\u201d if it is hotter than 400\u00b0F. (This was the Patent Office view and I appreciate that the majority abandons it for another of its own making- synthesized from \u201cTechnology of Adhesives.\u201d) I feel that appellants are right in pointing out that the claim distinguishes from Dumont in its size limitation, in its \u201cfluid\u201d limitation, and in calling for a package of \u201cadhesive\u201d which <em>becomes </em>fluid in the <em>range </em>250-400\u00b0F. It is clear to me that the board tacitly admits that Dumont teaches nothing about adhesives and further that it distorts the meaning^ of \u201cfluid\u201d to include that which is not fluid according to the common meanings of that word, so as to include that which is merely sticky.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>In utilizing Shonberg\u2019s roll of solder in sustaining another rejection it also appears to me that the board distorts the common meaning of \u201cadhesive\u201d in contending that solder is an \u201cadhesive, having all the properties as called for in the claim except containing synthetic polymer.\u201d As this court said in In re Dean, 291 F.2d 947, 48 CCPA 1072, claims are to be read in the light of the specification, not in a vacuum, and in the context of this case solder (i. e., <em>metallic </em>solder which is all the references disclose) is not an \u201cadhesive\u201d within the meaning of the claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">The acting board member, writing its opinion on rehearing (in which its first opinion\u2019s new rejection under Rule 196 (b) was wholly withdrawn), said that he \u201ccould go on and on with respect to the other \u2018properties\u2019 as claimed\u201d and it appears to me that taking the approach that was taken this is no doubt true. I think, however, that the Patent Office had already gone \u201con and on\u201d to too great an extent in synthesizing supposed suggestions for appellants\u2019 invention, as claimed, from the prior art where no such suggestions exist and in finding technical reasons for ignoring the plain meaning of the claim, properly read in the light of the specification, along with various claim limitations, so as to give the claim a semblance of <em>reading on </em>an entirely unrelated prior art disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Read in the abstract, claim 24 does seem, on first impression, to have some rather vague limitations. But read in the light of the disclosure as a bona fide effort to so define the actual invention disclosed <em>as to prbvide it with adequate protection </em>and at the same time do the necessary in <em>distinguishing in terms from the prior art </em>references, I would be at a loss to improve upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">I do not see any legal compulsion for us to present appellants with the choice of having no protection at all, which results from the majority opinion, or entirely inadequate protection, which would result from acceding to the unjustifiable requirements of the Patent Office in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">There is more than adequate precedent in the prior opinions of this court, many of which are referred to in the dissenting opinion of Judge Smith, for approving a claim such as the one before us on the ground that unobviousness may be predicated on a <em>broad novel concept </em>for doing a thing though the <em>means </em>for doing it, once the concept is given, may seem quite simple in view of prior art viewed with hindsight perception. Of course the claim must distinguish <em>in terms </em>from the prior art, but that it amply does if what it says is heeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">I fully agree with appellants\u2019 conclusion which says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-13\">\u201cWe submit that this is one of those cases in which because of seemingly slight structural differences [in the claim] <em>a very great and unobvious difference in conception has been lost sight of </em>by the Examiner and Board. Properly analyzed, the present facts show strongly that rejection as unpatentable over the four references relied on was unwarranted.\u201d [My emphasis.]</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b992-17\">. It is my view that obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 <em>is </em>the sole issue. The majority opinion uses the <em>expression </em>\u201cunpatentable over\u201d in affirming the examiner\u2019s rejection of \u201cfully met by Dumont.\u201d However, the majority admits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>to limitations of claim 24 -which are <em>not </em>to be found in Dumont, combines another reference with it not used by the examiner, and eschews the \u201cfully met\u201d language. It therefore strikes me Dumont must be treated as a section 103 reference. The other rejections are clearly based on section 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AI8\">. The practical application of the thermoplastic adhesives appears to have been of practical concern primarily in shoe manufacture and in shoe manufacturing machines. The applicants were employees of B. B. Chemical Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of United Shoe Machinery Corporation, and employees of both companies jointly developed the invention before us and machinery for utilizing the rod-form adhesive, such a machine being shown in MaeKenzie patent 2,762,716, of record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b995-8\">. The solicitor\u2019s brief acknowledges that the board\u2019s position was that \u201cfluid\u201d in the claim \u201cdoes not distinguish from the stickiness of nylon at 400\u00b0 IT.\u201d but obviously he did not relish the task of trying to support that position for no at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>tempt was made to clo so. Instead, the brief switches to the argument that there is nothing to show that 400 \u00b0F. is a \u201ccritical\u201d limit of a temperature range. I therefore regard the board\u2019s position on this point as entirely lacking in support by the solicitor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b996-8\">. Soldering with metallic solder alloys such as the references show is, moreover, an art totally unrelated to the art of securing with \u201cadhesives.\u201d The essential difference is that in soldering the work must be brought up to tbe temperature at which the solder melts, at least in the surface portion contacted by the solder, else it will not be wetted by the fluid solder and the solder will not bond. Another difference is that chemical fluxes are generally used and, furthermore, soldering is limited to the bonding of metals with metals. The asserted fact that appellants\u2019 adhesives may be used on metal does not equate adhesives with solder.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>SMITH, Judge (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">The invention claimed in rejected claim 24 is a \u201cpackage of solid flexible thermoplastic adhesive in coil form.\u201d In defining the properties of the adhesive per se, the claim also calls for the flexible thermoplastic adhesive to be \u201ca normally solid, flexible thermoplastic mixture of at least two ingredients.\u201d This mixture must also be \u201cfluid with a viscosity suitably low for adhesive application at temperatures in the range of 250\u00b0 F. to 400\u00b0 F.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">I do not find these features in Dumont. Dumont, in my opinion, does not show a material which is an \u201cadhesive\u201d within the normal context of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">Adhesives are a recognized industrial category. They all have the recognized quality of gripping another material under conditions of use despite such differences as they have in chemical composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">Dumont\u2019s material is a polyamide which is extruded and wound under controlled conditions which produce a structural condition which is asserted to have an orientation of its linear molecules in several directions. This is said to increase the \u201ctenacity\u201d of the product. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201ctenacity\u201d as, among other things, \u201ctensile strength.\u201d I am, therefore, unable to agree with the interpretation given Dumont in the majority opinion. Further, I find no suggestion in Dumont of a flexible thermoplastic adhesive consisting of \u201cat least two ingredients.\u201d Likewise, I find no showing in Dumont that the material disclosed therein when heated to the range of 250\u00b0F. \u2014 400\u00b0F., will become fluid and have a sufficiently low viscosity that it is suitable for <em>adhesive </em>application within the claimed temperature ranges. Many solids become fluid when subjected to temperatures higher than ambient temperatures. One skilled in this art would know that to be effective as an adhesive, it must possess a sufficiently low viscosity if it is to have adhesive properties in its fluid state. For example, various waxes, which become fluid at various temperatures, are not \u201cadhesives\u201d in the normal sense of the term. They lack tackiness and readily return to their amorphous state when sthe temperature is reduced. Normal glues and pressure sensitive adhesives, however, have the required low viscosity and tackiness at ambient temperatures to cause adherence of materials to which they are applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Thus, the appealed claim has not only a preamble statement referring to an adhesive product but also defines that product in terms which I think distinguish it over the Dumont disclosure. In this particular I think our decision here should be governed by our opinion in In re DeNapoli, 302 F.2d 768, 770, 49 CCPA 1056, 1059, where the court in reversing an ex parte rejection said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACW\">\u201cThe board failed to mention the reference in the preamble of the claim to \u2018a phonographic translating machine,\u2019 leaving the implication that it agreed with the examiner that the preamble \u2018is merely a statement of the suggested use and therefore lacking in patentable significance.\u2019 However, the body of the claim refers to the adjustable mirror as reflecting the image \u2018into a position to be visible to the transcribing typist.\u2019 It seems to us that, taken together, those two recitations impart a limitation to the claim which cannot be ignored in determining patentability. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">It seems clear to me that the Dumont reference does not suggest appellants\u2019 conception, even though it discloses a roll of plastic which in form may be regarded as more or less similar to appellants\u2019 claimed package of adhesive. As I see it, Dumont does not disclose what I think are important limitations in appellants\u2019 claim. Thus, since Dumont does not suggest appellants\u2019 claimed invention, I would find the rejection over Dumont to be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">In determining whether the claimed subject matter as a whole is obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>within the meaning of section 103, it is necessary to consider not only structural distinctions recited in the claims but the purpose for which the invention was conceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Thus, in In re Osplack, 195 F.2d 921, 924, 39 CCPA 932, 937, the rule is stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-7\">\u201c * * * the conception of doing a thing, the result of which is new and useful, must be considered along with the actual steps of doing it in considering the presence or absence of patentability. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">Or, as we said in In re Hortman, 264 F.2d 911, 46 CCPA 814:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOQ\">\u201c * * * [I]n determining the unobviousness of .a device, it is proper to consider \u2018the conception of a new and useful improvement * * * along with the actual means of achieving the improvement.\u2019 In re Shaffer, 229 F.2d 476, 480, 43 CCPA 758, 763, and cases there cited. * * * For, though the structure may be but a simple expedient when the novel concept is realized, that structure may not be obvious to the skilled worker in the art where the prior art has failed to suggest the problem or conceive of the idea for its elimination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-14\">Or, as Judge Learned Hand stated in H. K. Regar &amp; Sons v. Scott &amp; Williams, 63 F.2d 229 (2d Cir. 1933):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-15\">\u201c * * * When old devices are changed at all, the change may be dictated by a new conception, which it took originality to conceive. Strictly, the old device is not then put to a new use; the new use begets a new device. In such cases it requires but little physical change to make an invention. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-17\">It seems to me, therefore, that the differences which appellants are claiming over the Dumont disclosures are such that the subject matter as a whole would not have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the packaging of adhesives. I would reverse the decision of the board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
