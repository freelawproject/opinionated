The plaintiff alleged that his wife died as a result of the insured\u2019s negligence and malpractice. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s ease, the district court dismissed the action, under Rule 41(b), for failure to show a right to relief. The district court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-23\">\u201cHere the plaintiff has failed to prove by any evidence the degree or standard of care required of a physician in such a case as here involved, and has failed to prove by any evidence whatsoever that [the physician] either deviated from an accepted standard, or was in any way negligent in his treatment of Ora Lee George. This record, at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, was completely void of any such evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKv\">After a careful study of the record, including a number of depositions, we cannot say that the holding of the district court was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-24\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
