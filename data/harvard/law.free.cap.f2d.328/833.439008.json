The court then proceeded to detail which sentences on individual counts or groups of counts were to be served concurrently with or consecutively to the sentences on other counts and concluded \u201cwhich makes a total of six years\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-17\">The intention of the court to impose a cumulative sentence of six years is not only reflected by the written judgment order signed by the court but is readily apparent from the court\u2019s comment at the conclusion of the oral pronouncement \u201cwhich makes a total of six years\u201d. It is only by ignoring this comment, expository of the court\u2019s intent, and by resorting to a literal consideration limited solely to the language in which the court orally assigns a concurrent or consecutive character to the sentences on various counts, that the defendant finds a basis for the conclusion he advances as to the duration of the total sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-18\">But in resolving questions as to inconsistency or fatal ambiguity between the trial court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence and the written order of judgment and commitment we must look to the record as a whole to determine the court\u2019s intention in imposing sentence. United States v. Drake, 7 Cir., 274 F.2d 611, 612; LaClair v. United States, 7 Cir., 303 F.2d 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-19\">The statement of the court made as a part of his oral pronouncement of sentence that it was for \u201ca total of six years\u201d is a summation which clearly expresses the court\u2019s intent. The written judgment order is in conformity with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>that express intent. The District Court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion. The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-20\">. Defendant\u2019s conviction was affirmed in United States v. Gibas, 7 Cir., 300 F.2d 836.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
