SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b624-24\">This is a companion case to Orange Belt District Council of Painters No. 48, AFL-CIO v. N.L.R.B., 117 U.S.App.D.C. -, 328 F.2d 534 (1964), decided this day.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-27\">Here the agreement between the union and a general contractor in the construction industry limited subcontracting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>those who met the \u201cterms of the appropriate labor agreement.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The union subsequently threatened the general contractor with picketing because a subcontractor did not meet the required \u201cterms.\u201d On hearings on an unfair labor practices charge, the Trial Examiner found that the union\u2019s object was to have the contractor cease doing business with the \u201cnon-union\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>subcontractor and replace him with a \u201cunion\u201d contractor. The N.L.R.B. adopted this finding and found violations by the union of both \u00a7\u00a7 8(b) (4) (ii) (A) and (B)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Labor Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The union alleges that \u201cterms\u201d here means simply \u201cstandards,\u201d and that this clause merely requires subcontractors to come up to the equivalent of union level on wages, hours, and working conditions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board found that the clause requires subcontractor agreement to the full union contract, including union recognition, on penalty of a boycott by the general contractor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">We have stated our view of the applicable law in <em>Orange Belt District Council of Painters No. 48, AFL-CIO v. N.L.R.B. </em>The Board\u2019s position that this clause was a union-signatory provision is amply supported in the record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition to the face of the agreement,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> there was testimony before the Trial Examiner by a union representative that the clause required the contractor to \u201cuse signatory subcontractors who were signatory to the agreements of the various construction local unions.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The union argues here that mere observance of union standards without signing a union contract would have been sufficient under the clause. But, on this record, certainly the Board had a rational basis for deciding that the union\u2019s course of action revealed that this would not have satisfied union demands.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">Accordingly, we agree that the economic action used to enforce a subcontracting clause which implicitly blacklisted all non-union subcontractors vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>lated \u00a7 8(b) (4) (ii) (B).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s finding of a violation of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (ii) (A) cannot stand, however,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> because, as \u2022shown in <em>Orange Belt District Council of Painters No. 48, AFL-CIO v. N.L.R.B., </em>\"that section incorporates \u00a7 8(e) by reference, and \u00a7 8(e)\u2019s <em>proviso </em>exempts subcontracting clauses in the construction industry from its prohibition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-5\">. The text of the clause in question reads :</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\u201cIf the <em>Contractors, </em>parties hereto, shall subcontract work, as defined herein, provision shall be made in such subcontract for the observance by said Subcontractor of the terms of the appropriate labor agreement covering the work involved with the appropriate <em>Union </em>affiliated with the Building and Construction Trades Department of the AFL-CIO.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\">. The subcontractor did not have a collective bargaining agreement with the petitioner Council or any of its affiliates, but did have one with District 50, United Mine Workers, which represented its plastering employees. The benefits under that contract are said to have been lower than the benefits under the equivalent contracts with the unions of the Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\">. 73 Stat. 525, 542, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(b) (4) (ii) (A) and (B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b625-10\">.

Bangor Building Trades Council, AFL-CIO, 1 Cir., 278 F.2d 287 (1960), the clause sought to be enforced provided that \u201cthis Agreement binds all the subcontractors as well as the general contractor\u201d who made the agreement with the union. The court found that the clause was \u201cplainly broader than the payment of wages. It contains no exceptions, but embraces all the provisions of the Davison contract. Hence it includes union recognition.\u201d Id. at 288, 290.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b625-17\">.
