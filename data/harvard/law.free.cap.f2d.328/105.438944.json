Bus.Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 20, \u00a7\u00a7 369-a to 369-e, and issued the injunction as prayed, a claim for money damages having been waived. Defendant appeals, contending primarily that findings were clearly erroneous that plaintiff was not engaged in retailing. If it had been, this would have made its fair trade contracts agreements between retailers and with competitors and so not exempted from Sherman Act prohibitions by the so-called fair trade amendments. <em>We </em>find no error in the findings and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The principal issue on this appeal is whether sales by plaintiff to clinics and veterinarians, under provisions of its fair trade contract with retailers exempting sales by retailers to hospitals, clinics, physicians and other named agencies were sales at retail which would de-, prive plaintiff of the protection of the so-called \u201cfair trade\u201d acts. But these provisions, for the benefit of the retailers, were no restriction on the manufacturer. And neither those provisions nor any other proof offered, made Parke Davis\u2019 sales to hospitals, clinics and veterinarians sales at retail in competition at retail with its retail customers. Retail sales include \u201call marketing transactions in which the purchaser is actuated solely by a desire to satisfy his own personal wants or those of his family or friends through the personal use of the commodity * * * purchased.\u201d Roland Electric Co. v. Walling, 326 U.S. 657, 674, 66 S.Ct. 413, 90 L.Ed. 383. In a business such as plaintiff\u2019s this appears a more apt definition than one relying solely on the quantity of goods sold. These were not sales to ultimate consumers for their own use or the use of their families. The fact that Parke Davis paid New York City sales tax on some items was not an admission that they were sales at retail, for the sales tax reaches transactions other than those usually considered retail sales, i. e., rentals by plaintiff to Pfizer of encapsulating machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Finally, appellant contends that denial of a continuance to take additional depositions was reversible error. The refusal of further adjournment, June 7, 1963 when the trial date had been set, in a not overly complicated case in which discovery had commenced on July 13, 1961, was well within the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
