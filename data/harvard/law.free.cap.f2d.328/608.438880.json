It was not until the following October 23rd that it entered a full opinion, now reported in 210 F.Supp. at pp. 25-31, which concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">\u201cConsidering all of the above, and having made a careful assessment of the entire record, plus the fact that all of defendant\u2019s advertisements show it is in the mortgage loan business with headquarters in Shreveport, whereas plaintiff\u2019s advertisements show that it is in the insurance business with its home office at Skokie, Illinois, we are convinced, <em>and find as a fact, </em>that there is <em>no </em>infringement, <em>no </em>unfair competition by defendant, and <em>no </em>confusion in the public mind by defendant\u2019s use of the name <em>Allstate Investment Corporation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-14\">\u201cFor these reasons, therefore, we find that plaintiff\u2019s claims for equitable relief and for damages are without merit and should be denied. Hence, there should be judgment for defendant, rejecting plaintiff\u2019s demands at its cost.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">Allstate Insurance Co. v. Allstate Investment Corp., W.D.La.1962, 210 F.Supp. 25, 30, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-16\">The appellant urges in brief \u201cthat in the ten months that elapsed between the trial of this matter and the opinion, the many other matters considered by the learned Judge below interfered with his recollection of this trial.\u201d Impressed by the argument, we have held the case for many months in order to find time for a careful reading and study of the voluminous record, the many exhibits, and the applicable law. Having finished that task, we find ourselves in full agreement with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">One explanation for the time that elapsed between trial and decision, to which the appellant gives no heed, appears from the district court\u2019s statement at the close of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-18\">\u201cFrom the date the transcript of testimony is filed we will give the plaintiff 30 days to file a brief and the defendant will have 30 days to reply and then the plaintiff will have 15 days to reply to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-19\">\u201cCourt is adjourned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-20\">The court\u2019s opinion discloses that the evidence had received its careful and painstaking consideration, and that it had thoroughly researched the applicable law. We find no justification for appellant\u2019s complaint \u201cof the disregard of the law and the evidence throughout the opinion.\u201d The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b693-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
