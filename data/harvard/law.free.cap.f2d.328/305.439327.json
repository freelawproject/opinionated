He asserts that he has had an application for admission to practice in the Southern District pending without acceptance or denial for four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">The district judge dismissed this action for the reasons that: \u201c(1) The United States has not consented to be sued; (2) Service of summons on the United States Attorney did not confer jurisdiction in this action; and (3) The complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d. We agree with the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">It is'Jsufficient to say that the United States has not consented to be sued. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, consent is not found in 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343 (4) since there appears to be neither an authorization to commence such an action nor is there an act providing for the protection of the rights asserted. Nor may appellant find consent in 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346(2) since, contrary to his assertions, his claim is not founded upon an implied contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
