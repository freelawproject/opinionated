United States, 9 Cir., 306 F.2d 402. Soon after the dismissal, and more than three years after the offense charged, appellant waived his right to prosecution by indictment in open court and the instant information was filed against him. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal \u201cby reason of former jeopardy,\u201d and following trial to the Court, he was found guilty as charged and the sentence imposed was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The Supreme Court has recently had occasion to re-emphasize the prohibition of the Double Jeopardy Clause as not against being \u201cpunished twice,\u201d but against being twice put in jeopardy of conviction for the same offense, and that \u201c [h] arassment of an accused by successive prosecutions * * * so as to afford the prosecution a more S' favorable opportunity to convict are examples when jeopardy attaches.\u201d Downum v. United States, 372 U.S. 734, 736, 83 S.Ct. 1033, 1034, 10 L.Ed.2d 100. The test for identity of offenses charged, for purposes of double jeopardy and duplicity, is \u201cwhether the same evidence is required to sustain them.\u201d Morgan v. Devine, 237 U.S. 632, 641, 35 S.Ct. 712, 714, 59 L.Ed. 1153. And see: Beacham v. United States (10 CA), 218 F.2d 528; Rayborn v. United States, 234 F.2d 368 (6 CA); and Marshall v. United States (10 CA), 299 F.2d 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">Appellant asserts that the offense twice charged against him is illegal possession of the same firearm, as defined in \u00a7 5848(1), in violation of \u00a7 5851, and evidence of possession being statutorily sufficient to authorize conviction, only one conviction is permissible under the statute. If the two offenses involved here are statutorily provable by the same facts, they are identical for purposes of double jeopardy, and appellant must prevail. The conclusive answer is, however, that proof of possession of a fireapm defined in \u00a7 5848(1) is not statutorily sufficient to prove the offense charged in either the indictment or the information. As we shall see, each of the offenses requires proof, not essential to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">Section 5851, under which both charges were cast, is concerned with eight different regulatory revenue sections, and makes possession of a firearm, defined in \u00a7 5848(1), illegal for non-compliance with any of the enumerated sections. See: Fleish v. Johnston (9 CA), 145 F.2d 16; Montgomery v. United States (4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>CA), 146 F.2d 142; and United States v. Hardgrave (7 CA), 214 F.2d 673. Cf. Mares v. United States (10 CA), 319 F.2d 71. While possession is an essential element of each of the several offenses embraced within \u00a7 5851, each of them requires proof of additional fact of noncompliance, not essential to the others. Thus, possession of a firearm, defined in \u00a7 5848(1), without having registered the same as required by \u00a7 5841,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> does not authorize a conviction for the possession of the same firearm without the maker having declared his intention to make the same and having paid the tax thereon, as required by \u00a7 5821. Indeed, \u00a7 5841 specifically provides that compliance with \u00a7 5821 obviates the necessity of compliance with \u00a7 5841. See: Footnote 2. If prior to the making of the firearm, the maker has declared his intention to do so and paid the tax thereon, he is not required to register the same after it is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Section 5848(1) describes the physical characteristics of the firearms to which the provisions of \u00a7 5851 are applicable. But, the enumerated sections in \u00a7 5851 describe the illegal attributes of firearms, the possession of which is condemned by \u00a7 5851. This section, i. e., \u00a7 5851, then provides that proof of possession of \u201csuch firearm * * * shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction * * The phrase, \u201csuch firearm\u201d has reference not only to a firearm defined in \u00a7 5848(1), but also to a firearm which is illegally possessed for non-compliance with one of the enumerated regulatory sections, viz., a firearm \u201cwhich has at any time been made in violation of section 5821,\u201d or \u201cwhich has not been registered as required by section 5841.\u201d It is, therefore, incumbent upon the Government to prove, not only possession of a firearm defined in \u00a7 5848(1), but that the firearm is one illegally possessed, for failure to comply with one of the enumerated regulatory sections. Though the firearm is physically the same, the possession of that firearm becomes illegal, according to the characteristics which the law attaches to it by regulatory measures. The possession condemned in each case rests upon diverse facts, and jeopardy on one is not jeopardy on the other. In this view of the case, it is unnecessary to consider the significance or effect of the dismissal of the prior indictment \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Apparently for the first time, on appeal, appellant raises the three year statute of limitations under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6531, which provides: \u201cNo person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any of the various offenses arising under the internal revenue laws unless the indictment is found or the information instituted within 3 years next after the commission of the offense * * While the Government has made no point of the timeliness of the plea, it is nevertheless important to consider whether the statute is an affirmative defense, which must be originally pleaded on peril of waiver, as in civil cases, or whether it constitutes a jurisdictional bar to prosecution and punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\"> This statute of limitations, as found in the revenue laws, is in consonance with a policy of repose \u201cthat is fundamental to our society and our criminal law.\u201d Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209, 73 S.Ct. 1055, 97 L.Ed. 1557. And see: The 32nd Section of the Act of April 30, 1790, 1 Statutes at Large 119. And, it is to be liberally interpreted in favor of the accused. See: United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S. 518, 52 S.Ct. 416, 76 L.Ed. 917; and United States v. McElvain, 272 U.S. 633, 47 S.Ct. 219, 71 L.Ed. 451. For, as Judge Fahy states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>in Askins v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 198, 251 F.2d 909, 912, \u201csociety is likely to be healthier on the whole if an individual suspected of a non-capital offense is either charged within a specified time * * * or else is relieved of the never-ending possibility of public accountability for an accusation arising out of the long ago.\u201d Unlike the statute of limitations in civil cases, it is not a mere limitation upon the remedy, but a limitation upon the power of the sovereign to act against the accused. See: Benes v. United States (6 CA), 276 F.2d 99; and Chaifetz v. United States, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 349, 288 F.2d 133, cert. den. 366 U.S. 209, 81 S.Ct. 1051, 6 L.Ed. 2d 233, reh. den. 366 U.S. 955, 81 S.Ct. 1901, 6 L.Ed.2d 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">We have indicated, however, following good authority, that the statute is an affirmative defense, not available in a collateral attack by habeas corpus. See: Roberts v. Hunter (10 CA), 140 F.2d 38, citing Biddinger v. Commissioner of Police, 245 U.S. 128, 38 S.Ct. 41, 62 L.Ed. 193, which relied upon United States v. Cook, 17 Wall. 168, 84 U.S. 168, 21 L.Ed. 538, involving a statute of limitations in a Revenue Act. And see: Capone v. Aderhold (5 CA), 65 F.2d 130. The Askins ease, supra, differentiates between a statute of limitations directed to the indictment itself, and a situation in which the accused is indicted for an offense without limitation and convicted of a lesser included offense, to which a statute is applicable. \u201cIn this \u2018special situation,\u201d said the Court, \u201c * * the sentence is subject to collateral attack,\u201d since no period of limitation was applicable to the indictment and the question of lawfulness of the sentence did not, therefore, arise until after the verdict. See also: Chaifetz v. United States, ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Notwithstanding Roberts v. Hunter, supra, and the cases there cited, and the differentiation made in Askins, supra, if recognition of a distinction between the statute of repose in civil cases and the substantive bar in criminal cases, is to have any meaning in the administration of criminal justice, the statute of limitations must be held to affect not only the remedy, but to operate as a jurisdictional limitation upon the power to prosecute and punish. And see: Bustamante v. District Court of the Third Judicial District, 138 Colo. 97, 329 P.2d 1013; Herman v. People, 124 Colo. 46, 233 P.2d 873; People v. Crosby, Cal., 25 Cal.Rptr. 847, 375 P.2d 839; and People v. McGee (Cal.), 36 P.2d 378. The language of the statute clearly provides that no person shall be prosecuted, tried or punished for the offense charged here, unless the information is instituted within three years after the commission of the offense. It is plainly a limitation upon the power to prosecute or to punish. It is, therefore, jurisdictional, and noticeable at this stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Indeed, the Government apparently does not contend otherwise, for it relies upon the exception to the general three year period in \u00a7 6531, which provides that the period of limitations shall be six years for eight separately and specifically enumerated offenses arising under the revenue laws, four of which specify the section or sections of the revenue laws to which they are referable. None of the exceptions make reference to \u00a7 5851, under which this information is laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\"> Since the six-year limitation is an exception to the general rule, it must be strictly construed to apply to those offenses specifically enumerated. See: United States v. Scharton, supra; and Braverman v. United States, 317 U.S. 49, 63 S.Ct. 99, 87 L.Ed. 23. The Government takes the position that the offense charged here falls within the second category of excepted offenses, as \u201cfor the offense of willfully attempting in any manner to evade or defeat any tax or the payment thereof.\u201d While this category does not make specific reference to a section or sections of the revenue laws, the critical language can be found in a number of sections which make it an offense to willfully attempt, in any manner, to evade or defeat a tax or the payment thereof. See: 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5646; 5671; 5684(b); 5761; 6653(e); and 6672. As we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>seen, \u00a7 5851, under which the appellant is charged, is not concerned with \u201cwillfully attempting * * * to evade or defeat any tax,\u201d but condemns the possession of a firearm on which the making tax has not been paid as provided by \u00a7 \u25a0'5821. It is plain that the six-year limitation exception is inapplicable to the offense charged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The case must, therefore, be reversed, with directions to vacate the judgment and dismiss the information.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-14\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5848(1) pertinently defines the tei'm \u201cfirearm\u201d as, \u201ca shotgun or rifle having a barrel of less than 18 inches in length * * * from which a shot is discharged by an explosive if such weapon is capable of being concealed on the person, * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-16\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5821 pertinently provides: \u201c(a) * * * There shall be levied, collected, and paid upon the making in the United States of any firearm * * * a tax at that rate provided in section 5811 (a) * * \u201c(c) * * * The tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be paid by the person making the firearm.
