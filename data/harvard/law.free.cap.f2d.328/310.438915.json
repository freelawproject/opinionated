The \u25a0decision of the arbitrator is \u201cfinal and binding\u201d upon the parties. The Union \u25a0requested certain contract modifications, .and because of the inability of the parties to agree, the issues were submitted to the mutually appointed arbitrator for \u2022decision. Hearings were held at which time evidence was submitted, the parties were present, and an award was rendered in behalf of the Union. The Hotel refused to comply with the terms and \u25a0conditions of the arbitrator\u2019s award. The Union thereupon instituted suit in the United States District Court, pursuant to the provisions of Section 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act \u25a0of 1947, as amended 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a) and Federal Declaratory Judgments Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2202.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">The Hotel filed its unverified answer, the material provisions of which admitted the execution of the collective bargaining agreement; admitted the dispute between the parties; admitted the arbitration hearings and the submission of evidence to the arbitrator; admitted the entry of the arbitrator\u2019s award; admitted the refusal of the appellant to abide by the award. In further answering the complaint, appellant stated, \u201c * * * that no evidence was presented to the arbitrator <em>upon </em>which an award could be granted * * * \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">On motion of the Union, the district court granted a summary judgment enforcing the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-16\">The record in this case discloses no genuine material issue of fact to be tried. The case was therefore a proper one for a summary judgment. We agree with the district court that there is no basis for the defendant\u2019s refusal to abide by the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-17\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
