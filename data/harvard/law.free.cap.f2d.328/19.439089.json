There was ample evidence to establish that a felony warrant was issued for his brother\u2019s arrest and that the defendant concealed and harbored his brother, knowing that he was a fugitive and that a felony warrant had been issued for his arrest. The attack upon the prosecutor\u2019s argument as substantial error is without basis, is indeed frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-27\">The judgment should be, and it is, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
