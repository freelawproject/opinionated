Olmstead, summary judgment against appellant, New Hampshire Insurance Company (\u201cNew Hampshire\u201d). For the reasons that follow, we reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee was injured in a car accident on September 11, 2001, while on his way to work at Checkmate Boats, Inc. (\u201cCheckmate\u201d). New Hampshire insured Checkmate with a Business Auto Insurance Policy (\u201cBAP\u201d) and a Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy (\u201cCGL\u201d). Appellee settled with the tortfeasor for $50,000, the limit of his liability policy, and sought underinsured-motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) coverage pursuant to Checkmate\u2019s policies with New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">{\u00b6 3} In May 2003, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On March 8, 2004, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On March 30, 2004, the trial court filed a nunc pro tunc judgment entry regarding its March 8, 2004 entry and held that the CGL policy did not provide UM coverage for appellee,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the BAP provided UM coverage to appellee, that defendants AIG and American International Group were dismissed, and that there was no just reason for delay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">{\u00b6 4} On appeal, New Hampshire raises the following sole assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting plaintiff-appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in denying defendant-appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">{\u00b6 6} In particular, New Hampshire argues that the trial court erred in finding that appellee\u2019s car was being used in the business or personal affairs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Checkmate at the time of the accident and that appellee\u2019s car was therefore a covered auto under the policy\u2019s liability coverage. New Hampshire argues that the trial court further erred by finding that since appellee\u2019s car was a covered auto for liability purposes, appellee was an \u201cinsured\u201d as defined in the policy\u2019s UM endorsement because he was \u201canyone \u2018occupying\u2019 a covered \u2018auto\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">{\u00b6 7} In <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at \u00b6 11, the Ohio Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cWhen confronted with an issue of contractual interpretation, the role of a court is to give effect to the intent of the parties to the agreement. <em>Hamilton Ins. Serv., Inc. v. Nationwide Ins. Cos. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 270, 273, 714 N.E.2d 898, citing <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp. v. Roehm </em>(1919), 99 Ohio St. 343, 124 N.E. 223, syllabus. See, also, Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution. We examine the insurance contract as a whole and presume that the intent of the parties is reflected in the language used in the policy. <em>Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 130, 31 OBR 289, 509 N.E.2d 411, paragraph one of the syllabus. We look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language used in the policy unless another meaning is clearly apparent from the contents of the policy. <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146, paragraph two of the syllabus. When the language of a written contract is clear, a court may look no further than the writing itself to find the intent of the parties. Id. As a matter of law, a contract is unambiguous if it can be given a definite legal meaning. <em>Gulf Ins. Co. v. Burns Motors, Inc. </em>(Tex.2000), 22 S.W.3d 417, 423.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">{\u00b6 9} In examining the policy as a whole, we find that Checkmate defined in its declarations page what vehicles were considered \u201ccovered autos\u201d under the various types of coverage. The BAP policy declarations page states:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">{\u00b610} \u201cITEM TWO \u2014 SCHEDULE OF COVERAGES AND COVERED AUTOS. This policy provides only those coverages where a charge is shown in the premium column below. Each of these coverages will apply only to those \u2018autos\u2019 shown as covered \u2018autos.\u2019 \u2018Autos\u2019 are shown as covered \u2018autos\u2019 for a particular coverage by the entry of one or more symbols from the COVERED AUTO Section of the Business Auto Coverage Form next to the name of the coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">{\u00b6 11} For purposes of liability coverage, the vehicles that are defined as \u201ccovered autos\u201d are \u201cSpecifically Described \u2018Autos,\u2019 \u201d \u201cHired \u2018Autos\u2019 Only,\u201d and \u201cNonowned \u2018Autos\u2019 Only.\u201d For purposes of UM coverage, only autos owned by the corporation are defined as \u201ccovered autos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">{\u00b6 12} Appellee argues that \u201cItem Two\u201d creates a difference between \u201ccovered \u2018autos\u2019 \u201d and \u201ccovered \u2018autos\u2019 for a particular coverage.\u201d We disagree. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>declarations page clearly and unambiguously states that there is coverage only for \u201cthose \u2018autos\u2019 shown as covered \u2018autos.\u2019 \u201d It then defines \u201ccovered \u2018autos\u2019 \u201d as only those \u201cautos\u201d designated for a particular type of coverage. Even though other types of vehicles are defined as \u201ccovered \u2018autos\u2019 \u201d for purposes of liability coverage, for purposes of UM coverage, Checkmate chose that only vehicles owned by the corporation would be considered \u201ccovered \u2018autos.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">{\u00b6 13} The UM coverage endorsement states that when a corporation is the named insured, UM coverage is afforded to \u201c[ajnyone \u2018occupying\u2019 a covered \u2018auto\u2019 or a temporary substitute for a covered \u2018auto\u2019.\u201d The trial court held that appellee was entitled to UM coverage because, insofar as he was acting within the course and scope of employment at the time of his accident, appellee was driving and occupying a \u201ccovered auto.\u201d We, however, find that this analysis of the policy is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">{\u00b6 14} Clearly, if appellee had been within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident, he would have been afforded liability coverage because his vehicle would have been considered a \u201ccovered auto\u201d under the category of \u201cNonowned \u2018Autos\u2019 Only.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As stated above, however, an insurance contract must be examined as a whole, and we must presume that the intent of the parties is reflected in the policy language. <em>Galatis, </em>supra, 100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">{\u00b6 15} In the declarations page of the policy, in defining what vehicle is a \u201ccovered auto\u201d for purposes of determining UM coverage, Checkmate selected that only those autos owned by the corporation would be considered \u201ccovered autos.\u201d Therefore, although appellee was occupying a \u201ccovered auto\u201d for purposes of liability coverage, the contracting parties clearly did not include \u201cnon-owned autos,\u201d appellee\u2019s category of coverage, in the definition of \u201ccovered auto\u201d for purposes of determining who was entitled to UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">{\u00b6 16} The UM endorsement states that the provisions of the coverage form apply unless modified by the endorsement. The endorsement does not define \u201ccovered auto.\u201d Hence, we find that the declarations page is controlling in determining what vehicles are defined as \u201ccovered autos\u201d for purposes of UM coverage. Checkmate unambiguously selected that only \u201cowned autos\u201d would be considered \u201ccovered autos\u201d for purposes of determining UM coverage. Further, had the UM endorsement intended to alter the definition of \u201ccovered auto\u201d to include all autos that were covered pursuant to any given category, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>just those autos that were designated as \u201ccovered autos\u201d for UM coverage, then the endorsement could have stated so. It did not. Moreover, if we were to afford UM coverage to any \u201ccovered auto,\u201d regardless of its category of coverage, we would fail to give effect to all terms and conditions of the policy negotiated and selected by the contracting parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">{\u00b6 17} Insofar as only corporation-owned vehicles were \u201ccovered autos\u201d for purposes of UM coverage, we find that the issue of whether appellee was within the scope of his employment is irrelevant in determining whether he was entitled to UM coverage. The inquiry ends after determining that appellee was not occupying a corporation-owned vehicle at the time of his accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">{\u00b6 18} Additionally, contrary to appellee\u2019s argument, we find that it is reasonable that a corporation would pay a premium for coverage on behalf of its employees under circumstances in which it could be exposed to liability, but not under circumstances in which the corporation would derive no direct benefit from the coverage, such as arguably would be the case when providing UM coverage on employee-owned vehicles. Regardless, we find that appellee\u2019s argument is not germane to the issue of what coverage is provided by the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 19} Furthermore, to the extent that the trial court alternatively held that UM coverage would be afforded to appellee by operation of law, that holding is also erroneous. The version of R.C. 3937.18 in effect at the time of this policy stated that no automobile liability policy shall be issued unless UM coverage is offered \u201cin an amount of coverage equivalent to the automobile liability or motor vehicle liability coverage.\u201d Former R.C. 3937.18(A)(2), 2000 Sub.S.B. No. 267, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, 11380-11381. The trial court held that no waiver of UM coverage was signed and, therefore, that appellee was entitled to UM coverage by operation of law. Checkmate had $1,000,000 in both liability and UM coverage. Insofar as Checkmate purchased UM coverage, we find that New Hampshire clearly complied with the requirements of R.C. 3937.18 and, therefore, no UM coverage was created by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">{\u00b6 20} Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying New Hampshire\u2019s motion for summary judgment. There being no genuine issue of material facts, we find that reasonable minds can only conclude that New Hampshire is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Civ.R. 56(C). Accordingly, we find New Hampshire\u2019s sole assignment of error well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">{\u00b6 21} On consideration whereof, the court finds that substantial justice has not been done the party complaining, and the March 30, 2004 judgment of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas is reversed. Pursuant to App.R. 12(B) this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>enters judgment on behalf of New Hampshire Insurance Company against Forest D. Olmstead. on his claim for UM coverage pursuant to New Hampshire\u2019s policy with Checkmate Boats, Inc. This matter is remanded to the trial court for further consideration of the remaining prayers for relief in appellee\u2019s complaint. Pursuant to App.R. 24, costs are assessed to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b502-6\">Handwork and Pietrykowski, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-15\">.
