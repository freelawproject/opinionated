The trial court imposed an 11-month prison term and ordered that it be served consecutively to the prison term in the case numbered B-0301478. (At the time of his conviction for trafficking in cocaine, Montgomery had been on community control in the case numbered B-0301478. Based on his new trafficking conviction, the trial court found that Montgomery had violated his community-control sanctions and imposed a prison sentence.) Montgomery now appeals the imposition of his trafficking sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">{\u00b6 2} In his single assignment of error, Montgomery argues that under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the trial court erred by imposing a nonminimum prison term when the additional findings necessary to impose that term were not found by a jury or admitted by Montgomery. Montgomery sets forth the same argument with respect to the imposition of consecutive sentences. For the following reasons, we modify Montgomery\u2019s sentence in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">{\u00b6 3} <em>Blakely </em>reaffirmed the holding in <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that under the Sixth Amendment, \u201c \u2018[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>Blakely </em>court defined \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d not as the longest term the defendant can receive under any circumstances but as \u201cthe maximum sentence a judge may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">{\u00b6 4} This court has previously held, in a series of cases,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that <em>Blakely </em>does not affect Ohio\u2019s sentencing scheme. But in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. </em>Booker;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which reaffirmed the holding in <em>Blakely, </em>we have reevaluated our previous decisions and have determined that the Sixth Amendment does have a bearing on some of Ohio\u2019s sentencing statutes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">{\u00b65} In <em>State v. Bruce</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we held that R.C. 2929.14(C), the sentencing statute governing the imposition of maximum sentences, was unconstitutional to the extent that it permitted a sentencing court to impose a sentence that exceeded the maximum term supported by the jury\u2019s verdict or admissions by the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There, Bruce was convicted of voluntary manslaughter after pleading guilty. He was sentenced to ten years, the maximum sentence allowed under state law after the trial court made the factual finding that Bruce had committed one of the \u201cworst forms\u201d of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">{\u00b6 6} In determining that Bruce\u2019s sentence violated the Sixth Amendment, we noted that our prior interpretation of Blakely\u2019s definition of the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d as the \u201cstatutory range\u201d was wrong.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead, we relied on <em>Booker\u2019s </em>affirmation of the rule in <em>Blakely </em>that a defendant has the \u201cright to have the jury find the existence of \u2018any particular fact\u2019 that the law makes essential to his punishment.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">{\u00b6 7} Thus, we concluded in <em>Bruce </em>that the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for <em>Blakely </em>purposes is the maximum term a trial court can impose without any additional findings; i.e., a prison term supported solely by the jury\u2019s verdict or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>defendant\u2019s admissions. Accordingly, we determined that the trial court\u2019s finding, after Bruce had pleaded guilty, that Bruce had committed the worst form of the offense was an additional finding, and, thus, the trial court\u2019s reliance on that independent fact to impose the maximum sentence was improper because it was not admitted by Bruce or found by a jury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We then reduced Bruce\u2019s sentence to nine years, the longest prison term that could be imposed under Ohio\u2019s sentencing scheme supported by Bruce\u2019s admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">{\u00b6 8} In light of our interpretation of the current state of the law, we now turn to Montgomery\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in imposing a nonminimum prison term. Under Ohio\u2019s sentencing scheme, prison terms are determined by the felony degree of the charged offense. For example, R.C. 2929.14(A)(5) states that a prison term for a fifth-degree felony shall be between six and 12 months. Although there is a range of sentences to choose from based on the felony degree, the Ohio legislature has chosen to further limit the sentencing court\u2019s discretion in selecting an appropriate prison term. One such limitation is found in R.C. 2929.14(B), which provides that \u201cthe court shall impose the shortest prison term authorized for the offense pursuant to division (A) of this section\u201d unless the offender has previously served a prison term or the trial court finds that the shortest prison term \u201cwill demean the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct or will not adequately protect the public from future crime by the offender.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A plain reading of this statute indicates that R.C. 2929.14(B) entitles an offender who has not previously served a prison term to a presumption that the imposition of the minimum term is sufficient.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, before imposing a term greater than the minimum, the sentencing court must make an additional finding under R.C. 2929.14(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">{\u00b6 9} As we have noted previously, Blakely\u2019s bright-line rule is that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime above the prescribed statutory maximum must be found by a jury or admitted by the defendant. In <em>Bruce, </em>we held that the statutory maximum is the maximum term a sentencing court can impose without any additional findings by the court. Under R.C. 2929.14(B), the only prison term a sentencing court can impose on an offender who has not previously served a prison term, without making additional findings, is the minimum prison term allowed by law for the offense. Thus, we hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>statutory maximum for an offender who has not previously served a prison term is the minimum prison term allowed by law for the offense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">{\u00b6 10} Our holding today overrules our decision in <em>State v. </em>Eckstein<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to the extent that it held that the minimum sentence for an offense was not the statutory maximum for offenders who had not previously served a prison term.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> With our decision today, we note again that, under R.C. 2929.14(B), the legislature has mandated that the sentencing court impose the shortest prison term on a first-time offender unless it makes one of the R.C. 2929.14(B)(2) findings. It is not simply a recommendation to sentencing courts. The sentencing court does not have the authority to impose a longer sentence unless it makes additional R.C. 2929.14(B)(2) findings. While we understand that these \u201cfindings\u201d have historically been considered sentencing factors, the <em>Blakely </em>line of jurisprudence now makes them \u201cfacts\u201d that must be found by a jury or admitted by the defendant, because they affect the level of punishment an offender will receive.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The minimum prison term for an offender who has not previously served a prison term is ordinarily the only sentence that is supported by the jury\u2019s verdict and the defendant\u2019s admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">{\u00b6 11} While our decision today to treat the minimum prison term as the statutory maximum for offenders who have not previously served a prison term is in conflict with the Third Appellate District\u2019s decision in <em>State v. </em>Trubee<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the Tenth Appellate District\u2019s decision in <em>State v. </em>Abdul-Mumin,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we believe that it comports with our holding in <em>Bruce, </em>where we explained that the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d sentence is the maximum sentence a court may impose without any additional findings, and with <em>Booker, </em>where the Supreme Court reaffirmed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>bright-line rule that any fact that affects the level of punishment above the statutory maximum must be found by a jury or admitted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">{\u00b6 12} We now evaluate Montgomery\u2019s sentence in light of our discussion of the law. Montgomery was convicted of trafficking in cocaine, a fifth-degree felony that carries a penalty of six to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The trial court sentenced Montgomery, who had not previously served a prison term with the Ohio Department of Corrections, to 11 months after making the factual finding that the shortest prison term would demean the seriousness of Montgomery\u2019s conduct and/or would not protect the public from future crime by him. Because the court made the additional R.C. 2929.14(B)(2) finding at the sentencing hearing, after Montgomery\u2019s plea had been accepted, the Sixth Amendment prohibited the imposition of a prison term longer than the minimum for Montgomery\u2019s first prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">{\u00b6 13} Although <em>Blakely </em>allows the fact of a prior conviction to support an enhanced sentence,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we hold that that exception does not apply here. At Montgomery\u2019s sentencing hearing, the trial court noted that Montgomery had previously been convicted of trafficking in cocaine, although he was not sentenced to a prison term. But the court based its R.C. 2929.14(B)(2) finding on Montgomery\u2019s previous juvenile-delinquency adjudications and confinement in juvenile detention facilities. It is well established in Ohio that an adjudication that a juvenile is delinquent is not the same as a criminal conviction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, the fact of Montgomery\u2019s previous juvenile-delinquency adjudications could not be used to justify a finding that the shortest prison term would not adequately protect the public from future crime by the offender or would demean the seriousness of the crime under Blakely\u2019s prior-conviction exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, we hold that Montgomery\u2019s sentence violated the Sixth Amendment. Therefore, we modify Montgomery\u2019s sentence to six months, the minimum prison term for a fifth-degree felony as set forth in R.C. 2929.14(A)(5).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Further, we hold that R.C. 2929.14(A)(5) and 2929.14(B) are unconstitutional to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>the extent that the statutes allow a trial court to increase the presumptive sentence in the absence of jury findings or admissions by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">{\u00b6 15} We now turn to Montgomery\u2019s argument that <em>Blakely </em>is applicable to R.C. 2929.14(E), the statute governing the imposition of consecutive sentences. Montgomery contends that because a sentencing court must make independent findings prior to ordering that prison terms be served consecutively, the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial is implicated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">{\u00b6 16} Again, the rule set forth in <em>Apprendi </em>and affirmed in <em>Blakely </em>is that \u201c \u2018[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court, to date, has not applied this rule to the imposition of aggregate sentences. <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker </em>concerned only the limits of punishment for one specific crime. They did not address whether the sentences for multiple, but separate, crimes should be served concurrently or consecutively. To apply <em>Blakely </em>to the imposition of consecutive sentences would be to unnecessarily expand the Sixth Amendment jurisprudence articulated by the Supreme Court. Further, federal courts have consistently held that the imposition of consecutive sentences does not violate the Sixth Amendment if the individual sentence for each count does not exceed the statutory maximum for the corresponding offense.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Ohio courts have held the same.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">{\u00b6 17} Because we hold that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to consecutive sentences, we evaluate the imposition of the consecutive sentences here as we have done in the past. In Ohio, to impose consecutive sentences under R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), the trial court must find that consecutive sentences are \u201cnecessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender and that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public.\u201d The court must also make one of the following findings: (1) when the offender committed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>offenses, he was awaiting trial or was under community control, (2) the harm caused by the multiple offenses was so great or unusual that no single prison term would adequately reflect the offender\u2019s conduct, or (3) the offender\u2019s criminal history demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> A trial court imposing consecutive sentences must make the required findings and specify on the record its reasons supporting those findings.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">{\u00b6 18} Here, the trial court made all the statutorily required findings, including the finding that Montgomery was on community control at the time of the trafficking offense, and it gave supporting reasons for its other findings on the record at the sentencing hearing. Under Ohio\u2019s sentencing scheme, consecutive sentences were properly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">{\u00b6 19} In sum, we modify Montgomery\u2019s sentence in part to a minimum prison term of six months for his trafficking conviction. We leave undisturbed that part of the trial court\u2019s order making the trafficking sentence consecutive to the sentence separately imposed for Montgomery\u2019s community-control violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Sentence modified in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b800-8\">Doan, P.J., and Sundermann, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-12\">. <em>Blakely v.
