The trial court severed the theft charge from the aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery charges for purposes of trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 3} At appellant\u2019s jury trial on the aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery charges, the state\u2019s evidence showed that on the night in question, appellant walked up to Juan Fuentes and his brother, Sergio Fuentes, while they were standing in Juan\u2019s backyard, pulled a gun on them, and demanded money. Juan gave appellant his wallet, which contained $325, and Sergio gave him the money he had in his pockets. Appellant then ordered Juan and Sergio into their house. While inside, Juan\u2019s friend, Jonathan Martinez, came out of the bathroom. Appellant ordered all three men to sit on a couch and then searched them one by one. When he had Martinez on the floor with his foot on his chest, Martinez grabbed appellant\u2019s hand, and Juan and Sergio overpowered him. During the fight, Jose Jimenez, who had been sleeping upstairs, came down and saw what was happening. He called the police, and they came and arrested appellant. When the police searched appellant, they found Juan\u2019s wallet, which contained Juan\u2019s birth certificate and $325.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant testified that on the night in question, he was selling crack cocaine in the area and was scheduled to meet a prostitute at a street corner near where Juan Fuentes lives to sell her some crack cocaine. According to appellant, someone at Juan\u2019s house motioned for him to come over. Appellant testified that he gave Juan and Sergio some drugs, and at one point, Juan showed him a gun and tried to sell it to him for $400. He testified that he went into the house at Juan\u2019s invitation and that once inside, Juan struck him on the back of the head with the pistol, causing him to fall to one knee. Then, according to appellant, several other Hispanic men in the house attacked him and robbed him of $35.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b6 5} During their deliberations, the jurors sent the trial court a note, asking, \u201cWe cannot get 12 votes on charges 2 and 3,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] what now? People are not changing views.\u201d The trial court ordered the jury back to the jury room and gave them an instruction substantially similar to the one set forth in <em>State v. Howard </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 18, 537 N.E.2d 188.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jurors returned to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>deliberations. Thereafter, they returned a verdict, acquitting appellant of the aggravated burglary charge but convicting him of the aggravated robbery charge and the firearm specification. In a separate proceeding, appellant pled guilty to the theft charge. The trial court sentenced appellant to five years in prison for his aggravated robbery conviction, to be served consecutively to a three-year prison term for his conviction on the firearm specification. The trial court also sentenced appellant to an 11-month prison term for theft, to be served concurrently with his sentence for aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant appeals his conviction and sentence for aggravated robbery and the firearm specification, raising the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe verdicts on count two and the specification to count two were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant argues that his conviction on the aggravated robbery charge and its accompanying firearm specification were against the manifest weight of the evidence because the state\u2019s witnesses gave conflicting testimony on certain issues, while his claim that he was the victim of the crime was \u201cplausible\u201d and corroborated by a police officer\u2019s testimony. We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cWeight of the evidence concerns \u2018the inclination of the <em>greater amount of credible evidence, </em>offered in a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1990) 1594. In determining whether a conviction is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court must review the entire record, weighing the evidence and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from it, and taking into account the witnesses\u2019 credibility, to determine whether the jury clearly lost its way in resolving evidentiary conflicts and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that its verdict must be reversed and a new trial ordered. <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717, cited in <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. \u201cOn the trial of a case, either civil or criminal, the weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. The decision of the trier of fact is owed deference, since the trier of fact is \u201c \u2018best able to view the witnesses and observe their demeanor, gestures and voice inflections, and use these observations in weighing the credibility of the proffered testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Miles </em>(Mar. 18, 2002), Butler App. No. CA2001-04-079, 2002 WL 445041, quoting <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant argues that the state\u2019s witnesses provided conflicting testimony on how the gun was dislodged from his hand and where the gun ended up after the struggle over it had ended. By contrast, appellant contends, his testimony that he had been the victim of the incident was \u201cplausible,\u201d since a police officer testified that appellant told him shortly after he had been arrested that the Hispanic men inside the house had robbed him of $35.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">{\u00b6 12} However, the inconsistencies in the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses were minor, and they did not render the testimony inherently unworthy of belief. Furthermore, appellant\u2019s version of events was far from plausible. In order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>believe it, the jury would have had to believe that Juan and Sergio invited appellant into their home, robbed him, and then called the police to have them come and arrest him. The police found Juan\u2019s wallet, money, and birth certificate in appellant\u2019s pocket. Appellant was unable to explain how Juan\u2019s wallet got in his pocket. The jurors were in the best position to determine whether the state\u2019s witnesses or appellant was lying about who committed the robbery, and they were entitled to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of any witness who testified, including appellant. <em>State v. Antill </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 61, 67, 26 O.O.2d 366, 197 N.E.2d 548. There was no evidence presented that showed that the jury lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that reversal is warranted and a new trial required. <em>Martin, </em>20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. Accordingly, we conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict convicting appellant of aggravated robbery along with the accompanying firearm specification was not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">{\u00b6 14} Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe trial court erred in its instruction to the jury following indication by the jury that it could not reach a unanimous verdict on certain charges, to the prejudice of defendant-appellant and in violation of his right to due process and a fair trial pursuant to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">{\u00b6 16} Appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s decision to give the jury a <em>Howard </em>charge after it indicated it was deadlocked on Count Two of the indictment and the firearm specification resulted in a \u201ccoerced verdict.\u201d Specifically, he argues that the trial court erred by not inquiring of the jury \u201cwhether further deliberations would result in a verdict\u201d before giving them the <em>Howard </em>charge. We disagree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">{\u00b6 17} Appellant has not cited, nor have we found, any authority to support his suggestion that the trial court was required to ask the jury \u201cwhether further deliberation would result in a verdict\u201d before giving it the supplemental charge set forth in <em>Howard, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 18, 537 N.E.2d 188, at paragraph two of the syllabus. Appellant further suggests that the fact that the jury deliberated for less than a half-hour after being given the <em>Howard </em>charge \u201cmilitates in favor a finding that the instruction was coercive\u201d and insists that the trial court should have declared a mistrial. However, the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt in this case was overwhelming, and his claim that he was the one who was actually robbed lacked credibility. Consequently, we reject appellant\u2019s argument that the jury was coerced into convicting appellant of aggravated robbery as a result of their being given the <em>Howard </em>charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Appellant also argues that the trial court erred in reciting the <em>Howard </em>charge to the jury. He points out that under <em>Howard, </em>a trial court is supposed to instruct the jury to, among other things, examine each question submitted to it \u201cwith proper regard <em>and </em>deference to the opinions of others,\u201d but in this case, the trial court told the jury that \u201c[e]ach question .should be examined with proper regard <em>in </em>deference to the opinions of others.\u201d Appellant argues that this portion of the instruction violated his right to a fair trial, since it advised the jurors \u201cto disregard their oath and decide a case, not based upon their individual conscience, but based upon the views of other jurors.\u201d We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">{\u00b6 19} The language seized upon by appellant to demonstrate error appears to be simply one of several mistakes that were made in transcribing the trial court\u2019s statements. See footnote 3. Furthermore, even if the transcript was accurate, the trial court\u2019s instruction, when considered as a whole, substantially comports with the instruction set forth in <em>Howard. </em>The slight difference in wording (i.e., the use of \u201cin\u201d rather than \u201cand\u201d) would not have caused the jurors \u201cto disregard their oaths\u201d and \u201cdecide the case based upon the views of the other jurors\u201d rather than their own,as appellant asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 20} Finally, appellant argues that instead of giving the jurors the <em>Howard </em>charge, it should have given them the following instruction, set forth in <em>State v. Martens </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 338, 343, 629 N.E.2d 462:</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c \u2018VERDICT IMPOSSIBLE. It is conceivable that after a reasonable length of time honest differences of opinion on the evidence may prevent an agreement upon a verdict. When that condition exists you may consider whether further deliberations will serve a useful purpose. If you decide that you cannot agree and that further deliberations will not serve a useful purpose you may ask to be returned to the courtroom and report that fact to the court. If there is a possibility of reaching a verdict you should continue your deliberations.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (1992) 118, Section 415.50(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant maintains that the <em>Martens </em>court found the foregoing instruction \u201cappropriate in lieu of the <em>Howard </em>charge.\u201d This is incorrect. In <em>Martens, </em>the trial court <em>gave </em>the jury a <em>Howard </em>instruction similar to the one the trial court gave to the jury, here. Id., 90 Ohio App.3d at 342, 629 N.E.2d 462. The appellant in <em>Martens </em>argued on appeal that the trial court was required to give the jury the instruction found in 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (1992) 118, Section 415.50(4), by virtue of the fact that the instruction was contained in Ohio Jury Instructions. The <em>Martens </em>court rejected that argument, finding that \u201c[t]he instructions found in Ohio Jury Instructions are not mandatory\u201d and further stating that \u201c[requiring a trial court to rigidly follow these instructions would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>remove judicial discretion and control from the trial proceedings and not allow the flexibility necessary to manage the various situations that arise during a jury trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">{\u00b6 23} Additionally, while appellant proffered a nonspecific objection to the <em>Howard </em>charge, he never asked the trial court to give the instruction quoted in <em>Martens, </em>90 Ohio App.3d at 343, 629 N.E.2d 462. The decision whether to give an instruction rests within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and the trial court\u2019s failure to give the one set forth in <em>Martens </em>above does not amount to an abuse of discretion in any event. Id. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s use of the <em>Howard </em>charge coerced the jury\u2019s guilty verdict under the circumstances present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">{\u00b6 24} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">{\u00b6 25} Supplemental Assignment of Error:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant-appellant when it imposed a sentence beyond the statutory minimum in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">{\u00b6 27} Appellant asserts that the trial court erred when it imposed a five-year sentence on him for his aggravated robbery conviction. He argues that under <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403, the trial court was obligated to sentence him to no more than the statutory minimum sentence of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">{\u00b6 28} Appellant failed to raise this issue in the trial court. Generally, an appellate court will not consider an error that was not called to the trial court\u2019s attention at a time when the trial court could have corrected the error or avoided it altogether. <em>State v. Hill </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 191, 196, 749 N.E.2d 274. If we are to recognize this assignment of error at all, then, the error must constitute \u201cplain error.\u201d Crim.R. 52(B) (\u201cPlain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court\u201d). Notice of plain error pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B) must be taken only with the utmost caution, only under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 94-95, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">{\u00b6 29} In Ohio, aggravated robbery is a felony of the first degree. R.C. 2911.01(C). R.C. 2929.14(A)(1) states, \u201cFor a felony of the first degree, the prison term shall be three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten years.\u201d R.C. 2929.14(B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c[I]f the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a felony elects or is required to impose a prison term on the offender, the court shall impose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>shortest prison term authorized for the offense pursuant to division (A) of this section, unless one or more of the following applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(2) The court finds on the record that the shortest prison term will demean the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct or will not adequately protect the public from future crime by the offender or others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">{\u00b6 33} The trial court found that imposing the shortest prison term on appellant for his aggravated robbery conviction would demean the seriousness of bis conduct and not adequately protect the public from future crime by him or others. As a result, the trial court sentenced appellant to a five-year prison term on his aggravated robbery conviction, rather than to the three-year minimum term. Appellant asserts that this sentence violates <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">{\u00b6 34} At issue in <em>Blakely </em>was the constitutionality of a sentence imposed under the state of Washington\u2019s sentencing scheme. In that case, Blakely had pled guilty to second-degree kidnapping, involving domestic violence and use of a firearm. In the state of Washington, second-degree kidnapping is a class B felony, carrying a maximum punishment of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Under Washington\u2019s sentencing statute, the \u201cstandard range\u201d of punishment for second-degree kidnapping with a firearm is 49 to 53 months. The sentencing statute permits a trial judge to impose a sentence above the standard range if he finds \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence.\u201d One of the aggravating factors justifying imposition of an exceptional sentence is whether the offender acted with \u201cdeliberate cruelty.\u201d The trial court found that Blakely had acted with \u201cdeliberate cruelty\u201d in carrying out the kidnapping and therefore imposed on him an exceptional sentence of 90 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">{\u00b6 35} Blakely subsequently appealed his sentence to the United States Supreme Court, which reversed the trial court\u2019s imposition of an exceptional sentence. The <em>Blakely </em>court held, \u201c \u2018Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakely, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. at 2536, 159 L.Ed.2d 403, quoting <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435. The court further held that the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for purposes of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>\u201cis the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. </em>In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.\u201d (Emphasis sic; citations omitted.) <em>Blakely, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. at 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>{\u00b6 36} Applying these principles to the case before it, the <em>Blakely </em>court found that the maximum sentence that the trial judge was permitted to impose for second-degree kidnapping with use of a firearm was 53 months, not ten years, as the state had argued. The court concluded that because Washington\u2019s sentencing procedure did not comply with the Sixth Amendment, Blakely\u2019s sentence was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 37} In this case, appellant urges us to find that <em>Blakely </em>applies to Ohio\u2019s sentencing scheme and that, as a result, Ohio\u2019s sentencing scheme, like Washington\u2019s, does not comply with the Sixth Amendment. Specifically, he argues that because R.C. 2929.14(B)(2) requires a trial court, rather than a jury, to make certain factual determinations in order to impose a sentence on an offender above the presumptive minimum, it violates the rule in <em>Blakely </em>that \u201cany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. at 2536, 159 L.Ed.2d 403. Stated differently, appellant asserts that the factual findings necessary under R.C. 2929.14(B)(2) to impose a sentence above the minimum are the type of \u201cadditional facts\u201d that have to be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Since that submission was not done in this case, appellant argues that his sentence violates <em>Blakely. </em>We disagree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">{\u00b6 38} First, the majority in <em>Blakely </em>made it clear that its decision did not apply to states with indeterminate sentencing schemes. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cJustice O\u2019Connor argues that, because determinate sentencing schemes involving judicial factfinding entail less judicial discretion than indeterminate schemes, the constitutionality of the latter implies the constitutionality of the former. This argument is flawed on a number of levels. First, the Sixth Amendment by its terms is not a limitation on judicial power, but a reservation of jury power. It limits judicial power only to the extent that the claimed judicial power infringes on the province of the jury. <em>Indeterminate sentencing does not do so. </em>It increases judicial discretion, to be sure, but not at the expense of the jury\u2019s traditional function of finding the facts essential to lawful imposition of the penalty. Of course indeterminate schemes involve judicial fact-finding, in that a judge (like a parole board) may implicitly rule on those facts he deems important to the exercise of his sentencing discretion. But the facts do not pertain to whether the defendant has a legal right to a lesser sentence \u2014 and that makes all the difference insofar as judicial impingement upon the traditional role of the jury is concerned.\u201d (Emphasis added; citations omitted.) <em>Blakely, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. at 2540, 159 L.Ed.2d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">{\u00b6 40} Judge Griffin and Professor Katz have suggested in their treatise, Ohio Felony Sentencing Law, that provisions such as R.C. 2929.14(B) \u201care intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>only to structure judicial discretion within an indeterminate sentencing scheme and not to set ceilings on sentences as occurred under the Washington statute [reviewed in <em>Blakely].\u201d </em>Griffin &amp; Katz, Ohio Felony Sentencing Law (2004) 482, Section 2:22. They further suggest that provisions like R.C. 2929.14(B) \u201cinvolve guidance for determining the impact of a sentence on public protection and proportionality \u2014 determinations that have always been made by a judge in deciding fairness and necessity of a sentence. Those are decisions that have never been consigned to juries and, thus, are not governed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">{\u00b6 41} In <em>State v. Eckstein, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-030139, 2004-Ohio-5059, 2004 WL 2244828, the court rejected an argument similar to the one made by appellant in this case, stating as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cAfter reviewing the decision in <em>Blakely, </em>we hold that the minimum sentence [for attempted rape] in this case was not the \u2018statutory maximum.\u2019 The [R.C. 2929.14(B)(2) ] findings that the minimum prison term would demean the seriousness of the offense or not adequately protect the public from future crime by the offender are discretionary factors that the trial court may give weight to based on the facts reflected in the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cEckstein argues that the R.C. 2929.14(B)(2) findings were additional facts used to enhance his sentence over the maximum sentence prescribed by state law and that those facts should therefore have been submitted to the jury to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cThese discretionary factors are used to guide the court in imposing a sentence within the standard statutory range. This court has held that a sentence within the standard statutory range is not unconstitutional under <em>Blakely </em>because a sentence within the range authorized by law is presumed to be based solely on the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>[State v. Bell, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-030726, 2004-Ohio-3621, 2004 WL 1531904, at \u00b6 42.] Here, the standard statutory range of prison terms for attempted rape was two to eight years. The record demonstrates that the trial court considered the R.C. 2929.12 factors when it found that [the victim] had suffered physical and emotional harm, that Eckstein had no remorse, and that Eckstein\u2019s relationship with [the victim] had facilitated the offense. Based on those discretionary findings, the trial court determined that the shortest prison term would demean the seriousness of Eckstein\u2019s conduct and would not protect the public from future crime by him, and the court accordingly imposed a five-year sentence. Since this sentence was within the range authorized by state law and, was, based on facts reflected in the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>verdict, Eckstein\u2019s sentence complied with <em>Blakely. </em>R.C. 2929.14(B) comports with <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>holding, which is designed to protect a defendant from a harsher sentence based on facts not found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cIn sum, we hold that the R.C. 2929.14(B)(2) findings that must be specified prior to a departure from the minimum prison term are discretionary factors to be used by the trial court in determining what sentence to impose within the authorized range. The fact that a trial court is not required to give its reasons for its R.C. 2929.14(B) findings supports our holding. The R.C. 2929.14(B) findings serve only to confirm that a court has considered the statutory preference of a minimum prison term when determining what sentence to impose within the authorized range. The R.C. 2929.14(B)(2) factors are not additional facts used to enhance an offender\u2019s sentence beyond the \u2018statutory maximum.\u2019 \u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Eckstein, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-030139, 2004-Ohio-5059, at \u00b6 22-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">{\u00b6 48} We conclude that the trial court did not commit plain error when it imposed a five-year sentence on appellant for aggravated robbery. <em>Blakely </em>applies to states that have determinate sentencing schemes like the state of Washington, and not to states that have indeterminate sentencing schemes like Ohio. See <em>Blakely, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. at 2540, 159 L.Ed.2d 403; Griffin &amp; Katz, Ohio Felony Sentencing Law (2004) 482, Section 2:22. Furthermore, to the extent that <em>Blakely </em>does apply, the trial court\u2019s imposition of a five-year sentence on appellant for aggravated robbery still does not violate that decision, \u201cbecause a sentence within the range authorized by law is presumed to be based solely on the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d <em>State v. Eckstein, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-030139, at \u00b6 25, following <em>State v. Bell, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-030726, at \u00b6 42, and the five-year sentence for aggravated robbery is within the range authorized by law. R.C. 2929.14(A)(1). In light of the foregoing, the trial court did not commit plain error in imposing a five-year sentence on appellant for his aggravated robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">{\u00b6 49} Appellant\u2019s supplemental assignment of error is overruled.
