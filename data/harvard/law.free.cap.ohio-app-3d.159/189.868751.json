The test for deciding a motion for reconsideration in the court of appeals is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the motion calls to the attention of the court an obvious error in its decision or raises an issue for consideration that was either not considered at all or was not fully considered by the court when it should have been. <em>Columbus v. Hodge </em>(1987), 37 Ohio App.3d 68, 523 N.E.2d 515. <em>Matthews v. Matthews </em>(1981), 5 Ohio App.3d 140, 5 OBR 320, 450 N.E.2d 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">{\u00b6 2} In our previous decision, we addressed facts involving Drayer\u2019s contact with two 14-year-old girls in the vestibule of an apartment building. Both girls alleged that defendant-appellant Drayer placed his hand inside their clothing, restrained them from leaving the scene, and made verbal threats to them and to others while in their presence. Appellant was charged with two counts of gross sexual imposition, having sexual contact with another whose submission is purposely compelled by force or threat of force. After hearing instruction on both gross sexual imposition and sexual imposition, the jury convicted appellant on both counts of gross sexual imposition, and the trial court sentenced appellant accordingly. On appeal, by a two-to-one majority, we reversed, finding that there was insufficient evidence of force to support his conviction for gross sexual imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">{\u00b6 3} The state now argues that this court incorrectly determined that evidence of appellant\u2019s conduct after the sexual contact could not be considered in determining the presence of the element of force, that other evidence of force was not adequately considered, that even without other evidence of force, the remaining assignments of error are not moot (as the majority decision held), and that this court should now either reconsider its holding that there was insufficient evidence of force or overrule the remaining assignments of error and modify the verdict to reflect a conviction on the lesser included offense of sexual imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">{\u00b6 4} In discussing the issue of force, the majority in our previous decision stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">In determining whether force was established, it must be noted, contrary to appellee\u2019s assertion, the circumstances which occurred after the sexual contact cannot be considered in determining whether appellant used force to compel sexual contact with [the victims]. Instead, the relevant time-frame includes the events leading up to, and during, the sexual contact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-9\"><em>State v. Drayer, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-1033, 2004-Ohio-5061, 2004 WL 2803426, at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">{\u00b6 5} Upon further reflection and additional review of the transcript and pertinent case law, we conclude that this statement was a misstatement of the law on force in this context. Instead, the dominant rule appears to be that all of the circumstances surrounding the sexual contact are relevant and may be considered by the jury in determining whether force or the threat of force was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>used against the victim. See, e.g., <em>State v. Schaim </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 55, 600 N.E.2d 661 (\u201cA threat of force can be inferred from the circumstances surrounding sexual conduct\u201d); <em>State v. Dye </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 323, 328, 695 N.E.2d 763 (court considered surrounding circumstances in deciding whether force was used, including the fact that defendant told the victim he would not be the victim\u2019s friend if the victim told someone about the abuse, and victim thought defendant might hit him if he told); <em>State v. Stokes </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 735, 596 N.E.2d 480 (jury could consider force issue where, inter alia, defendant threatened victim after rape that if she told what had happened, he would hurt victim\u2019s mother); <em>State v. Hudson </em>(Dec. 23, 2003), Delaware App. No. 02 CAA 12065, 2003 WL 23008978, at \u00b6 50-53 (defendant\u2019s threats after molestation could be considered part of surrounding circumstances supporting finding of force).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">{\u00b6 6} Therefore, in this case, the jury could consider testimony by both girls that, after placing his hand inside their clothing, appellant refused to allow them to leave, grabbed the arm of one of the girls when she attempted to leave, told his girlfriend\u2019s son to go back upstairs, and told another girl who happened upon the scene to go away, thereby isolating the victims from contact with others who might help them. This evidence, if believed by the jury, would support a finding that appellant used force or the threat of force to make sexual contact with his victims because it demonstrated that his interaction with the girls was characterized by threats and intimidation to the degree that they feared him and did not feel free to leave the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">{\u00b6 7} Based upon this analysis, we agree with the state that our prior opinion, based as it was upon a more limited interpretation of the evidentiary requirements for proving gross sexual imposition, resulted in a holding that was incorrect as a matter of law. Thus, we sustain appellee\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">{\u00b6 8} This result requires us to now rule upon the remaining issue in appellant\u2019s first assignment of error \u2014 whether the evidence supported the element of purpose \u2014 and appellant\u2019s second, third, and fourth assignments of error, which we had declared moot in our previous opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">{\u00b6 9} In his first assignment of error, appellant also argued that the evidence was insufficient to show purpose \u2014 that is, that appellant\u2019s contact with the girls was \u201cfor the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.\u201d R.C. 2907.01(B). In <em>State v. George, </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-1412, 2003-Ohio-6658, 2003 WL 22927381, at \u00b6 13, this court noted that a jury may look to circumstantial evidence to find proof of purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">Absent an admission, proof of a defendant\u2019s purpose or specific intent invariably requires circumstantial evidence. * * * Consequently, when deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>mining whether a touching was undertaken for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, a trier of fact may consider the type, nature and circumstances surrounding the contact. * * * From these facts, a trier of fact may infer a defendant\u2019s purpose in making the physical contact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">{\u00b6 10} As appellant argues, not all touching of a person\u2019s breast or buttocks is for the purpose of sexual gratification \u2014 for example, if the touching is inadvertent. Here, while appellant admitted that he may have brushed against the girls, he claims that there was no evidence that the alleged contact underneath the girls\u2019 clothing was inadvertent. On the contrary, the evidence concerning the \u201ctype, nature, and circumstances\u201d of these contacts was sufficient for the jury to find purpose: appellant placed his hand down one girl\u2019s shirt, touching her nipple area, and inside the other girl\u2019s pants, touching her buttocks, thus making contact with both girls for several seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">{\u00b6 11} Having found that the state presented sufficient evidence to prove the elements of force and purpose, we overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error claims that the two guilty verdicts were against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">{\u00b6 13} In determining whether a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the appellate court acts as a \u201c13th juror.\u201d Under this standard of review, the appellate court weighs the evidence in order to determine whether the trier of fact \u201cclearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. The appellate court, however, must bear in mind the trier of fact\u2019s superior, first-hand perspective in judging the demeanor and credibility of witnesses. See <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. The power to reverse on manifest weight of the evidence should be used only in exceptional circumstances when \u201c \u2018the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">{\u00b6 14} As partially addressed above, the evidence in this case does not weigh heavily against conviction but, rather, favors conviction. There was ample testimony at trial that, if believed, established that appellant confronted the victims in the vestibule of the apartment building, lectured them on their behavior, touched, grabbed, or otherwise restrained them in a way that prevented their movement, shouted at others who came upon the scene so that they would leave, and put his hands inside the victims\u2019 clothing. Appellant argues, primarily, that the 14-year-old girls lacked credibility, as evidenced by their subsequent break-in to appellant\u2019s apartment. As the state points out, however, under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>manifest-weight review, questions of weight and credibility are for the trier of fact. <em>DeHass, </em>10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, at paragraph one of the syllabus. A trier of fact is free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of each witness. <em>State v. Long </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 328, 335, 713 N.E.2d 1; <em>State v. Woodward, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-398, 2004-Ohio-4418, 2004 WL 1879037, at \u00b6 18. Here, the jury heard from defense witnesses, defense counsel, and even the two girls about the break-in. The jury could have found that the girls lacked credibility, could have believed that the girls contrived their story as a way to remove appellant from the apartment building and steal his belongings, or could have rejected the girls\u2019 testimony for that or any other reason. Obviously, the jury believed the girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">{\u00b6 15} At the same time, the jury heard evidence that tended to discount the testimony of appellant and other defense witnesses. While appellant and his girlfriend\u2019s sons testified that appellant did not touch the girls, except perhaps to brush past them, the boys admitted to having discussed the case with appellant and their mother; one of the boys admitted that appellant and the boys\u2019 mother told him to say that appellant did not touch the girls; some evidence suggested that neither of the boys was in a position to really see what took place; and another resident, William Howell, testified that he saw appellant with his arms around the girls. While defense counsel sought to impugn the credibility of the girls, the sister of one of the girls corroborated the girls\u2019 story; and the grandmother of one of the girls testified that the girl was \u201chysterical crying\u201d immediately after the alleged incident. And, while defense counsel focused on the fact that no glitter was found on appellant, evidence also showed that appellant would have had time to wash his hands after the incident. Given this abundance of evidence tending to show appellant\u2019s guilt, we cannot say that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">{\u00b6 16} Because we find that the trier of fact did not lose its way or create a miscarriage of justice in finding that the evidence supported convictions for gross sexual imposition, we overrule appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">{\u00b6 17} Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error argued that he was denied a fair trial because the trial court repeatedly permitted the prosecutor to lead his own witnesses and that the prosecutor engaged in improper conduct during his opening statement and his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">{\u00b6 18} The test for prosecutorial misconduct is, first, whether the conduct is improper and, second, whether the conduct prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused. <em>State v. White </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 16, 22, 693 N.E.2d 772. The prosecutor\u2019s conduct cannot be grounds for a new trial unless the conduct deprives the defendant of a fair trial. <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1993), 66 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Ohio St.3d 402, 405, 613 N.E.2d 203. Even if the prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing arguments are improper, reversal based upon those statements is warranted only if the statements permeate the entire atmosphere of the trial. <em>State v. Tumbleson </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 693, 699, 664 N.E.2d 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">{\u00b6 19} Here, we agree with appellant that the prosecutor asked some leading questions and that the trial court admonished him for his conduct. We do not agree, however, that these actions rose to the level of misconduct or that they denied appellant a fair trial. As appellant points out, the trial court repeatedly sustained defense objections to the prosecutor\u2019s questions and admonished the prosecutor to stop leading witnesses. More important, appellant has not shown that the prosecutor\u2019s actions deprived appellant of a fair trial. Instead, the record shows that the trial court maintained a level playing field by making these rulings and limiting the prosecutor to appropriate questions. See <em>State v. Joseph </em>(Dec. 23, 1993), Allen App. No. 1-91-11, 1993 WL 531858 (\u201cAppellant has failed to demonstrate how the leading questions asked by the prosecutor created an unfair trial when the court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objections to such questions and the prosecutor would then rephrase the question\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">{\u00b6 20} Nor can we agree that the prosecutor\u2019s reference in his opening statement to other allegations involving appellant amounted to misconduct. The transcript reflects lengthy discussions among the court, defense counsel, and the prosecutor concerning appellant\u2019s altercation, just prior to the alleged incident with the girls, with a boy on a bike outside the apartment building. The court sustained a defense motion in limine to exclude a tape of an interview in which appellant discusses the altercation with police, pending the court\u2019s review of the tape. Thereafter, during opening statements, the prosecutor, in general terms, twice mentioned the incident. The prosecutor did not, however, identify appellant as a participant in, or the cause of, the incident. In any event, the trial court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objections to the prosecutor\u2019s statement, and appellant has failed to present any evidence that, given the court\u2019s handling of this issue, the prosecutor\u2019s actions deprived appellant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">{\u00b6 21} Finally, we cannot agree that the prosecutor engaged in prejudicial misconduct during his closing argument. Appellant argues that the prosecutor mischaracterized and misstated the evidence, including his recollection of one witness, William Howell. As the state notes, prosecutors have wide latitude in closing arguments. <em>State v. Davis </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 107, 119, 666 N.E.2d 1099. <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 266, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768. As noted, the test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the remarks made by the prosecution were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. \u201cThe touchstone of analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u2018is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Loch, </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-1065, 2003-Ohio-4701, 2003 WL 22064070, at \u00b6 43, quoting <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78. While a prosecutor may not present his or her belief about a witness\u2019s credibility, a prosecutor may point out that other evidence corroborates that witness\u2019s testimony. <em>State v. Carpenter </em>(1996), 116 Ohio App.3d 615, 624, 688 N.E.2d 1090; <em>State v. Draughn </em>(1992), 76 Ohio App.3d 664, 670, 602 N.E.2d 790. Here, the prosecutor spoke at length about Howell\u2019s testimony and characterized him as a person \u201cwith nothing to gain and nothing to lose.\u201d Given defense counsel\u2019s contrary characterization of that same testimony, the jury was free to believe or disbelieve it, and appellant has shown no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">{\u00b6 22} The prosecutor\u2019s conduct, taken as a whole, did not rise to the level affecting appellant\u2019s substantial rights or depriving him of a fair trial. Therefore, we overrule appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 23} Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error charges that he was denied a fair trial by ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The two-prong test for determining ineffective assistance is found in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, in which the court held, at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">{\u00b6 24} With regard to this assignment of error, appellant argues, first, that defense counsel should have sought a mistrial based upon prosecutorial misconduct in the form of leading questions. As discussed above, we find that defense counsel consistently objected to leading questions, and the trial court consistently sustained the objections and directed the prosecutor to change course. A mistrial is an extreme remedy, \u201cdeclared only when the ends of justice so require and a fair trial is no longer possible.\u201d <em>State v. Franklin </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 127, 580 N.E.2d 1, citing <em>Illinois v. Somerville </em>(1973), 410 U.S. 458, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425. Based on this record, we cannot find that defense counsel\u2019s failure to move for a mistrial rendered him ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">{\u00b6 25} Second, appellant argues that counsel\u2019s representation was inadequate because he sought and obtained a motion in limine to exclude evidence of appellant\u2019s altercation with another child in the apartment complex just prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>the events leading to his arrest but then failed to object when evidence regarding this altercation was actually introduced by one witness\u2019s testimony. In response, the state points out that the prosecutor instructed the witness not to describe what she saw outside the window. Defense counsel could reasonably have chosen not to object to the witness\u2019s testimony because an objection would have highlighted appellant\u2019s involvement in another alleged altercation in the same time frame or because this testimony shed light on the incident without impugning appellant, explained why the girls had been looking out the window, explained appellant\u2019s demeanor when he entered the building, and provided a possible explanation for his desire to lecture the girls. Under these circumstances, it was reasonable for defense counsel not to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 26} Third, appellant takes issue with trial counsel\u2019s failure to assert that the state had not shown that appellant had the required purpose of sexual gratification. However, during his closing argument, defense counsel argued specifically that the state had not proven purpose. But, in any event, as noted above, we find that the jury could have inferred purpose from the evidence presented. Therefore, defense counsel\u2019s actions in that regard were not prejudicial to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 27} Finally, appellant argues that defense counsel failed to timely file a Crim.R. 29(C) motion after the jury returned its verdicts. Because we find that the state presented sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction, appellant suffered no prejudice <em>from </em>defense counsel\u2019s failure to file a timely Crim.R. 29(C) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b6 28} Taking the transcript as a whole, we cannot say that it reveals representation so deficient as to prejudice appellant\u2019s defense. Therefore, we overrule appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b6 29} Based upon these considerations, we grant the state\u2019s motion for reconsideration and vacate this court\u2019s prior opinion reversing and remanding appellant\u2019s conviction on two counts of gross sexual imposition. Upon reconsideration of the facts and law, we now overrule appellant\u2019s first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error and affirm the judgment of conviction of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Motion for reconsideration granted, and judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-10\">Petree and Klatt, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
