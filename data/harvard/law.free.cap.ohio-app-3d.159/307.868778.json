Cherry<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was indicted on one count of trafficking in cocaine, a violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1), and one count of possession of cocaine, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). On June 9, 2003, Cherry pleaded no contest to both counts, and the trial court found him guilty. Prior to accepting Cherry\u2019s pleas, the trial court asked defense counsel whether Cherry\u2019s pleas were based upon any underlying agreement with the state. Cherry\u2019s counsel stated that they were not. The state agreed that Cherry\u2019s pleas were not based on any agreement but added that it would \u201chave no objection to a term of community control.\u201d After the trial court had engaged in a lengthy plea colloquy with Cherry, Cherry\u2019s counsel requested that the case be continued to July 3, 2004, for a presentence investigation. The trial court stated that it would permit Cherry to remain free on bond but cautioned Cherry that his failure to appear would be taken into consideration should he choose not to appear for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">{\u00b6 2} On July 3, 2003, Cherry failed to appear for sentencing, and the trial court issued a warrant for his arrest. Cherry was arrested on December 29, 2004. On January 28, 2004, the trial court sentenced Cherry to 11 months in prison on each charge, to be served consecutively. Cherry now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>{\u00b6 3} In a sole assignment of error, Cherry challenges the trial court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences. Cherry contends that the only reason the trial court imposed consecutive sentences was to punish him for his failure to appear at his original sentencing hearing. He argues that absent this improper consideration, there is no evidence in the record that would support consecutive sentences. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">{\u00b6 4} In <em>State v. Anderson, </em>we held that \u201c[a] trial court may use a defendant\u2019s failure to appear for sentencing as a sentence-enhancing factor, but not as a factor to justify consecutive sentences.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We went on to explain, however, that a trial court\u2019s \u201cimproper consideration of a defendant\u2019s failure to appear at sentencing is harmless error where the trial court properly relies on other factors supporting the consecutive sentences.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ajz\">{\u00b6 5} While we agree that the trial court should not have considered Cherry\u2019s failure to appear at sentencing, the trial court\u2019s error was harmless because it made the statutorily required findings for consecutive sentences, and it relied on other factors, in addition to Cherry\u2019s failure to appear at sentencing, as its reasons for imposing consecutive sentences.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, the trial court complied with R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) when it orally stated that it was imposing consecutive sentences to protect the public and to punish Cherry and that the sentences were not disproportionate to the seriousness of Cherry\u2019s conduct or to the danger he posed to the public. The trial court then discussed Cherry\u2019s criminal history and the fact that he \u201chad been given a chance in 2002 for intensive supervision probation that was revoked and he [had been] sent to prison.\u201d The court also noted that Cherry had failed to appear for a TASC evaluation and that he had not appeared for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">{\u00b6 6} The trial court further complied with R.C. 2929.14(E)(4)(c) when it stated that Cherry\u2019s criminal record demonstrated a need to protect the public.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court reiterated that it was imposing consecutive sentences because Cherry had not been successful on a previous attempt at community control, he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>served a prison term, and he had failed to appear for sentencing. Because the trial court made the necessary findings to support the imposition of consecutive sentences, because it relied on additional factors besides Cherry\u2019s failure to appear at sentencing to support the sentences, and because those findings were supported by the record, we overrule Cherry\u2019s sole assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b350-6\">Doan, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b350-7\">Painter, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-13\">.

Cherry was originally going to get a community-control sanction. A leap from that to consecutive terms is a leap that makes a mockery of the sentencing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">{\u00b6 8} Consecutive sentences are reserved for the worst offenders \u2014 usually not those who are originally slated for a nonprison sanction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
