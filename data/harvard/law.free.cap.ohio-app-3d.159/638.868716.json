Finding merit to the appeal, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">{\u00b6 2} In 2002, Peat filed a medical malpractice action against Kranitz alleging negligence for his failure to order a CT scan and timely diagnose a brain abscess. During discovery, Peat deposed Kranitz\u2019s expert, Dr. Charles Eckerline.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Peat inquired about the publications listed on Eckerline\u2019s curriculum vitae, specifically the University of Kentucky, Department of Emergency Medicine, Evaluation and Treatment Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d). Eckerline claimed that the Guidelines were consistent with the current standard of care for evaluating and treating headaches. However, he stated that he did not rely on the Guidelines and did not find them authoritative.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">{\u00b6 3} Prior to trial, Kranitz filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude all testimony regarding the Guidelines. Although the ruling is not in the record, the trial court apparently granted Kranitz\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>{\u00b6 4} The matter proceeded to a jury trial, at which Peat attempted to introduce the Guidelines for the purpose of impeaching Eckerline. Again, the trial court denied this request. The jury subsequently found in Kranitz\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 5} Peat filed a motion for new trial, claiming that the trial court committed prejudicial error when it refused to allow him to impeach Eckerline with a learned treatise. The trial court granted Peat\u2019s motion and ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 6} Kranitz appeals the trial court\u2019s decision, raising two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">{\u00b6 7} In his first assignment of error, Kranitz argues that the court\u2019s decision to grant a new trial was erroneous as a matter of law. He claims that the Guidelines were inadmissible for impeachment under Evid.R. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">{\u00b6 8} Civ. R. 59(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-10\">A new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues upon any of the following grounds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-11\">(1) Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, magistrate, or prevailing party, or any order of the court or magistrate, or abuse of discretion, by which an aggrieved party was prevented from having a fair trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-13\">(9) Error of law occurring at the trial and brought to the attention of the trial court by the party making the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">{\u00b6 9} The parties have conflicting opinions as to which standard this court should apply in reviewing this matter. This court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-15\">Under Ohio law, the standard of appellate review depends on the basis for the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion for a new trial. Thus, \u201c[w]here a new trial is granted by a trial court, for reasons which involve no exercise of discretion but only a decision on a question of law, the order granting a new trial may be reversed upon the basis of a showing that the decision was erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Rohde v. Farmer </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St.2d 82 [52 O.O.2d 376], 262 N.E.2d 685 paragraph two of the syllabus. By contrast, \u201c[w]here a trial court is authorized to grant a new trial for a reason which requires the exercise of a sound discretion, the order granting a new trial may be reversed only upon a showing of abuse of discretion by the trial court.\u201d Id., paragraph one of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-16\"><em>Powell v. Schiffauer </em>(Feb. 2, 1989), Cuyahoga App. No. 54930, 1989 WL 7941.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-17\">{\u00b6 10} In its decision granting a new trial, the trial court concluded that its own evidentiary ruling excluding the Guidelines \u201cmay have prejudiced\u201d Peat in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>cross-examining Eckerline. In applying the <em>Rohde </em>standard, evidentiary rulings are reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_h\">where a trial court\u2019s order is based on an erroneous standard or a misconstruction of the law, it is not appropriate for a reviewing court to use an abuse of discretion standard. In determining a pure question of law, an appellate court may properly substitute its judgment for that of the trial court, since an important function of appellate courts is to resolve disputed propositions of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A82\"><em>Castlebrook Ltd. v. Dayton Properties Ltd. Partnership </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 340, 346, 604 N.E.2d 808. See, also, <em>Slowbe v. Slowbe, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 83079, 2004-Ohio-2411, 2004 WL 1068418.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">{\u00b6 11} A misconstruction of law exists in this matter.' The trial court erred when it determined that the Guidelines constituted a learned treatise under Evid.R. 706, finding that it was \u201cpublished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">{\u00b6 12} Evid.R. 706, entitled \u201cLearned treatises for impeachment,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">Statements contained in published treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on a subject of history, medicine, or other science or art are admissible for impeachment if the publication is either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">(A) Relied upon by an expert witness in reaching an opinion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">(B) Established as reliable authority (1) by the testimony or admission of the witness, (2) by other expert testimony, or (3) by judicial notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">If admitted for impeachment, the statements may be read into evidence but shall not be received as exhibits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">{\u00b6 13} Thus, in order for the writing to be considered admissible for impeachment, it must be a \u201cpublished\u201d writing. The rules of evidence do not define \u201cpublished\u201d in this context. Therefore, we look to its ordinary meaning. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1990) defines \u201cpublish\u201d as \u201c[t]o make public; to circulate; to make known to people in general. To issue; to put into circulation.\u201d Moreover, \u201cpublication\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he act of publishing anything; offering it to public notice, or rendering it accessible to public scrutiny. An advising of the public; a making known of something to them for a purpose.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">{\u00b6 14} Ohio courts have had the opportunity to define \u201cpublish\u201d and \u201cpublication\u201d in other contexts. See <em>Scully v. Cleveland Stevedore Co. </em>(Apr. 11, 1991), Cuyahoga App. No. 58397, 1991 WL 53885 (\u201cpublication\u201d pursuant to Webster\u2019s Dictionary was defined as \u201cthe act of publishing,\u201d and \u201cpublish\u201d meant \u201cto make generally known\u201d); <em>State v. Hustler Magazine </em>(Apr. 4, 1979), Hamilton App. No. C-77101, 1979 WL 208622 (\u201cpublish\u201d pursuant to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (Rev.4th Ed.1968) was defined as \u201cto place before the public as though in mass media\u201d); <em>Draudt v. Wooster City School Dist. </em>(2003), 246 F.Supp.2d 820, 831 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>(N.D.Ohio) (\u201cpublish\u201d pursuant to Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) is defined as \u201cto put out an edition or circulate it to the public\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 15} It is undisputed that the Guidelines were an internal document of the University of Kentucky\u2019s Department of Emergency Medicine. There was no evidence demonstrating that the Guidelines were \u201cpublished\u201d under the common and ordinary meaning of the word because they were not circulated to the public or put before public scrutiny. The Guidelines were an internal document used solely by the university\u2019s emergency department. Although Dr. Eckerline\u2019s characterization of the Guidelines as a \u201cpublication\u201d in his curriculum vita may be a misnomer, the Guidelines themselves are not considered published under Evid.R. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">{\u00b6 16} Peat argues that the manner and format of the publication is irrelevant for purposes of Evid.R. 706. In support of this contention, he cites two federal cases that held that videotapes may qualify as learned treatises for purposes of the learned-treatise exception to the hearsay rule: that videotapes were \u201cnothing more than a contemporary variant of a published treatise, periodical, or pamphlet.\u201d See <em>Costantino v. Herzog </em>(C.A.2, 2000), 203 F.3d 164, 171; <em>Loven v. State </em>(Tex.App.1992), 831 S.W.2d 387, 397.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, those videotapes are distinguishable because they were produced and released by medical organizations to the medical community and used for educational purposes. The videotapes were not created by a university solely for that university, as in the instant case. Instead, they were created by various organizations and circulated to the medical community.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">{\u00b6 17} Therefore, because we find that the Guidelines are not a learned treatise, the trial court erred when it granted Peat a new trial on the basis that the Guidelines could be used to impeach Dr. Eckerline. Accordingly, Kranitz\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">{\u00b6 18} The first assignment of error having been sustained, the second assignment is moot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judgment is reversed, and the jury verdict is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Diane Karpinski, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b683-4\">James J. Sweeney, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-15\">. While the record indicates that Eckerline was deposed by Peat, the deposition transcript was never filed with the trial court. Therefore, any reference to Eckerline's deposition is taken from the parties\u2019 appellate briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-10\">. These cases were decided under the federal rules, which provide that learned treatises are an exception to the hearsay rule. Fed.R.Evid. 803(18). Ohio has not adopted that exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b682-11\">. Kranitz contended in his second assignment of error that ordering a new trial was an abuse of discretion because the exclusion of the Guidelines was not prejudicial, but merely provided cumulative evidence and thus constituted harmless error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b683-5\">James J. Sweeney, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AVRl\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">{\u00b6 19} I respectfully dissent. I believe that the majority has too narrowly interpreted the definition of what should be considered published for purposes of Evid.R. 706. I think it misses the point to consider the Guidelines unpublished simply on the theory that they are not circulated or distributed to the general public. Defendant\u2019s expert identified the University of Kentucky, Department of Emergency Medicine, Evaluation and Treatment Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) as one of his \u201cpublications\u201d on his curriculum vitae (\u201cCV\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These Guidelines certainly were or are circulated for use and reference at least at the University of Kentucky\u2019s Department of Medicine, if not the medical community at large. Otherwise, what was the purpose of their creation?</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">{\u00b6 20} In addition to the foregoing, I believe that for purposes of this litigation the Guidelines were published even under the definition cited by the majority. The Guidelines came to plaintiffs attention because defendant produced their expert\u2019s CV. The defendant\u2019s expert published the Guidelines by circulating his CV, which lists them.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">{\u00b6 21} Independent of Evid.R. 706, I believe it is an abuse of discretion to prohibit a party from cross-examining an expert witness about information the expert identifies as a credential in his or her own resume regardless of whether it is considered a learned treatise under Evid.R. 706. The defendant\u2019s expert must intend those reviewing his CV to consider the Guidelines relevant to his credentials as an expert. Examination of the expert concerning his identified credentials is relevant to the expert\u2019s overall credibility. For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b683-9\">. Since plaintiff sought to cross-examine defendant\u2019s expert with Guidelines he himself considers published, that should be enough to end the inquiry of whether it is published for purposes of impeachment. In other words, this is not a case where a party is seeking to impeach an expert with some document unknown or unfamiliar to that expert.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
