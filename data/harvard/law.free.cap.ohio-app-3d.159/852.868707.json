Appellant raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>{\u00b6 2} \u201cI. The trial court failed to inform defendant-appellant as to the nature of the charges prior to defendant-appellant signing the waiver of indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cII. The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant by not informing appellant as to the effect of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cIII. The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant by not informing appellant at sentencing as to the mandatory requirement of post-release control.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cIV. The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant by not accurately informing appellant at sentencing as to the amount of additional imprisonment time for violations of post-release control.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cV. The sentence of the trial court is unsupported by the record and contrary to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">{\u00b6 7} The charges in this case stem from an incident on March 29, 2003, when appellant was caught pilfering aluminum cans at the Bell Mells Tavern in Port Clinton, Ottawa County, Ohio. Appellant was confronted by police, jumped into his vehicle, and accelerated at a high rate of speed toward a police officer. The officer had to take evasive actions in order to avoid being hit. Appellant then led police on a high-speed vehicle chase through three counties and lasting approximately three hours. The chase ended after appellant\u2019s vehicle crashed and he was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">{\u00b6 8} In appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred by not advising him of the nature of the charges against him prior to his executing a waiver of the indictment and pleading guilty to a bill of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">{\u00b6 9} Crim.R. 7(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cA felony that may be punished by death or life imprisonment shall be prosecuted by indictment. All other felonies shall be prosecuted by indictment, except that after a defendant has been advised by the court of the nature of the charge against the defendant and of the defendant\u2019s right to indictment, the defendant may waive that right in writing and in open court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">{\u00b6 11} Further, R.C. 2941.021 provides that a defendant may be prosecuted by information \u201cafter he has been advised by the court of the nature of the charge against him and of his rights under the constitution, is represented by counsel or has affirmatively waived counsel by waiver in writing and in open court, waives in writing and in open court prosecution by indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">{\u00b6 12} Disputing whether the above-quoted requirements were met, the parties cite <em>State v. Willis </em>(Dec. 30, 1999), 6th Dist. No. WD-99-015, 1999 WL 1262077. Upon review of <em>Willis, </em>we find it inapplicable to the instant case. In <em>Willis, </em>the defendant was convicted of burglary following a jury trial. Here, however, appellant pleaded guilty to the charges against him. Thus, \u201c[h]is plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>of guilty to the offenses waived any claimed right to an indictment.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Beaucamp v. Lazaroff </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 237, 238, 673 N.E.2d 1273, citing <em>Stacy v. Van Coren </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St.2d 188, 189, 47 O.O.2d 397, 248 N.E.2d 603. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error states that appellant was not informed of the effect of his plea. Specifically, appellant argues that he was not informed that a term of imprisonment imposed for attempted assault of a peace officer was statutorily required to be served consecutively with a prison term imposed for failure to comply with the signal of a police officer in violation of R.C. 2921.331(B). R.C. 2921.331(D).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant further contends that at the time of his plea, he was not informed that if a term of imprisonment were imposed, he would be subject to postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">{\u00b6 14} Before accepting a guilty plea, Crim.R. 11 demands that the trial court inform a defendant of the constitutional rights he waives by entering the plea. <em>State v. Nero </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 106, 107, 564 N.E.2d 474. Crim.R. 11(C)(2), which governs guilty pleas, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cIn felony cases the court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty or a plea of no contest, and shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest without first addressing the defendant personally and doing all of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(a) Determining that the defendant is making the plea voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charges and of the maximum penalty involved, and, if applicable, that the defendant is not eligible for probation or for the imposition of community control sanctions at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(b) Informing the defendant of and determining that the defendant understands the effect of the plea of guilty or no contest, and that the court, upon acceptance of the plea, may proceed with judgment and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(c) Informing the defendant and determining that the defendant understands that by the plea the defendant is waiving the rights to jury trial, to confront witnesses against him or her, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in the defendant\u2019s favor, and to require the state to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at a trial at which the defendant cannot be compelled to testify against himself or herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">{\u00b6 19} The Supreme Court of Ohio, however, has required only substantial compliance with Crim.R. 11(C) with regard to nonconstitutional rights. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number><em>v. Stewart </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 86, 93, 5 O.O.3d 52, 364 N.E.2d 1163. \u201cSubstantial compliance means that under the totality of the circumstances the defendant subjectively understands the implications of his plea and the rights he is waiving.\u201d <em>Nero, </em>56 Ohio St.3d at 108, 564 N.E.2d 474, citing <em>Stewart, </em>supra. The reviewing court should focus not on whether the trial court recited the words of Crim.R. 11(C), but rather on whether the record shows that \u201cthe trial court explained or referred to the right in a manner reasonably intelligible to that defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Ballard </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 473, 480, 20 O.O.3d 397, 423 N.E.2d 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">{\u00b6 20} Regarding consecutive sentences, in <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 130, 532 N.E.2d 1295, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that \u201c[flailure to inform a defendant who pleads guilty to more than one offense that the court may order him to serve any sentences imposed consecutively, rather than concurrently, is not a violation of Crim.R. 11(C)(2), and does not render the plea involuntary.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">{\u00b6 21} In reaching its holding, the <em>Johnson </em>court noted that the text of Crim.R. 11(C) refers to a \u201csingle and individual criminal charge.\u201d Id. at 133, 532 N.E.2d 1295. The court then concluded that Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a)\u2019s maximum-penalty language referred to a single crime, rather than the total of all sentences. Id. The court further stated that \u201cthe decision of whether the criminal defendant is to serve the sentences for all his crimes consecutively or concurrently is a matter of sentencing discretion, the exercise of which is committed to the trial court.\u201d Id. at 133-134, 532 N.E.2d 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">{\u00b6 22} In this case, unlike the trial court\u2019s discretion in <em>Johnson </em>as to whether to impose consecutive sentences, if appellant were to receive a prison sentence for each offense, R.C. 2921.331(D) mandates consecutive sentences. Thus, a consecutive sentence was part of the maximum penalty appellant faced, and the trial court erred by failing to so inform appellant at the plea hearing. However, we do note that the written guilty plea correctly states \u201cthat the court must impose said sentences consecutively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">{\u00b6 23} Next, appellant contends that the trial court failed to inform him that postrelease control would be mandatory if a term of imprisonment were imposed. During the plea hearing, the judge never informed appellant that he was subject to a mandatory three-year period of postrelease control under R.C. 2967.28(B)(3). The only reference to postrelease control is in the written plea form, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cAfter prison release, I may have up to 3 or 5 years of post-release control. After prison release, if post-release control is imposed, for violations of post-release control conditions, the adult parole authority or parole board may impose a more restrictive or longer control sanction, return Defendant to prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>for up to nine months for each violation, up to a maximum of 50% of the stated term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">{\u00b6 25} The facts of this case are similar to those in <em>State v. Lamb, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 128, 2004-Ohio-474, 804 N.E.2d 1027. In <em>Lamb, </em>the trial court ascertained that the defendant understood the effect of his pleas but never notified him that he would be subject to a mandatory five-year period of postrelease control. Id. at \u00b6 7-8. Further, as in this case, the only reference to postrelease control was in Lamb\u2019s written plea of guilty. The plea stated that Lamb \u201c \u2018may have up to 3 years of post-release control.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">{\u00b6 26} As in <em>Lamb, </em>we note that R.C. 2929.14(F) clearly states that postrelease control is part of an offender\u2019s sentence. Based on this fact and the Eighth Appellate District cases captioned <em>State v. Perry, </em>8th Dist. No. 82085, 2003-Ohio-6344,(2003 WL 22805880, and <em>State v. Jones </em>(May 24, 2001), 8th Dist. No. 77657, 2001 WL 605406, <em>Lamb </em>held that \u201cin order to substantially comply with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a), a trial court must advise a defendant of any mandatory post-release control period at the time of the defendant\u2019s plea.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 16. Accord <em>State v. Perdue, </em>2d Dist. No. 20234, 2004-Ohio-6788, 2004 WL 2903878.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">{\u00b6 27} Based on the foregoing, we find that substantial compliance with the mandates of Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) was not met in this case; thus, the trial court erroneously accepted appellant\u2019s guilty plea. Accordingly, we find that appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">{\u00b6 28} Because we have determined that appellant\u2019s guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary, the sentencing issues raised in appellant\u2019s third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error are not ripe for review and are therefore moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">{\u00b6 29} On consideration whereof, we find that appellant was prejudiced and prevented from having a fair proceeding. Accordingly, the judgment of the Ottawa County Court of Common Pleas is reversed. Appellant\u2019s plea and sentence are hereby vacated, and the matter is remanded to said court for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Pursuant to App.R. 24, court costs of this proceeding are assessed to appellee, the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b897-11\">Skow and Parish, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-12\">. R.C. 2921.331(D) provides: \"If an offender is sentenced pursuant to division (C)(4) or (5) of this section for a violation of division (B) of this section, and if the offender is sentenced to a prison term for that violation, the offender shall serve the prison term consecutively to any other prison term or mandatory prison term imposed upon the offender.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
