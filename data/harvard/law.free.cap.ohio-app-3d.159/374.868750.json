The workers were employed by the railroad for decades and both developed asbestosis, allegedly as a result of their exposure to asbestos in their work in the rail yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>The workers filed suit in Cuyahoga County, and the railroad filed a motion to dismiss in reliance on the doctrine of forum non conveniens, which the trial court denied. Following a one-week trial, the jury awarded Seaford $76,000 and Thomas $64,000. Initially, the court reduced Thomas\u2019s award by one-third because he had been exposed to asbestos also while working for another employer. After the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. Ayers </em>(2003), 538 U.S. 135, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261, however, the trial court reconsidered its apportionment award and reinstated Thomas\u2019s original award of $64,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">{\u00b6 3} Meanwhile, the railroad filed a motion for setoff to reflect settlements the workers had received from manufacturers and distributors of asbestos, which the trial court denied. The court also denied the railroad\u2019s motion for a new trial, in which the railroad claimed that the court had made several improper evidentiary rulings. The railroad then filed this appeal, presenting seven assignments of error, the first of which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">The trial court lacked judicial authority and subject matter jurisdiction to preside over the proceedings in this matter. Thus, any judgment entered in this matter is void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">A. Whether a Violation of the Ohio Constitution Occurred</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">{\u00b6 4} The railroad claims that because the visiting judges who heard the case had been appointed permanently to the asbestos docket in violation of the Ohio Constitution, they lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. Its basic argument is that \u201cthere is a constitutional unfairness about the process employed to manage the asbestos cases in Cuyahoga County.\u201d The railroad argues that because the same two judges have been appointed repeatedly to the asbestos docket, \u201ctheir assignment becomes de facto permanent in violation of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">{\u00b6 5} The Ohio Supreme Court is granted the power to appoint judges in the Ohio Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">The chief justice or acting chief justice, as necessity arises, shall assign any judge of a court of common pleas or a division thereof temporarily to sit or hold court on any other court of common pleas or division thereof or any court of appeals or shall assign any judge of a court of appeals temporarily to sit or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>hold court on any other court of appeals or any court of common pleas or division thereof and upon such assignment said judge shall serve in such assigned capacity until the termination of the assignment. Rules may be adopted to provide for the temporary assignment of judges to sit and hold court in any court established by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Section 5(A)(3), Article IV. The Constitution further provides for the use of retired judges as appointed judges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">No person shall be elected or appointed to any judicial office if on or before the day when he shall assume the office and enter upon the discharge of its duties he shall have attained the age of seventy years. Any voluntarily retired judge, or any judge who is retired under this section, may be assigned with his consent, by the chief justice or acting chief justice of the supreme court to active duty as a judge and while so serving shall receive the established compensation for such office, computed upon a per diem basis, in addition to any retirement benefits to which he may be entitled. Laws may be passed providing retirement benefits for judges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Section 6(C), Article IV. Finally, the Constitution addresses the election of judges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">The judges of the courts of common pleas and the divisions thereof shall be elected by the electors of the counties, districts, or, as may be provided by law, other subdivisions, in which their respective courts are located, for terms of not less than six years, and each judge of a court of common pleas or division thereof shall reside during his term of office in the county, district, or subdivision in which his court is located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Section 6(A)(3), Article IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">{\u00b6 6} The appointment of judges and the election of judges are mutually exclusive concepts. As the Ohio Supreme Court noted in another case concerning an objection to an appointed judge, \u201c[t]he record conclusively demonstrates that Judge McMonagle\u2019s assignment was made in accordance with Section 6(C), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution. Moreover, that portion of Section 6(A)(3), Article IV, pertains only to the election of judges and not to the temporary assignment of a judge having been duly elected and subsequently retired under Section 6(C), Article IV of the Constitution.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Berger v. McMonagle </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 28, 31, 6 OBR 50, 451 N.E.2d 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">{\u00b6 7} The railroad does not claim that the judges in this case were not duly appointed in accordance with the Constitution. In fact, it concedes that the judges were appointed by the Chief Justice and attaches copies of those appointments to its brief. Rather, it says that the repeated use of the Supreme Court\u2019s constitutional power of appointment violates the section of the Constitution concerning the election of judges. Thus, it argues that the court lacked subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>matter jurisdiction over the case and that therefore the court\u2019s decision is void. The railroad does not argue that the common pleas court itself lacked jurisdiction over the case; rather, it argues that because these two judges have been appointed repeatedly to the asbestos docket, \u201cthe appointment of Judges Hanna and Spellacy as Cuyahoga County trial judges has become permanent in nature in violation of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">{\u00b6 8} The only law the railroad cites to support this alleged constitutional violation does not address the constitutionality of the Chief Justice\u2019s actions at all. First, the railroad cites <em>State ex rel. Kline v. Carroll </em>(2002), 96 Ohio St.3d 404, 775 N.E.2d 517. Although the court in <em>Kline </em>held that the verdict of the Lakewood court was void because the case was not properly reassigned pursuant to R.C. 2937.20, and that \u201cchallenging improper assignment and transfer of a case is an attack on the subject-matter jurisdiction of the transferee court,\u201d the case in <em>Kline </em>had been transferred by an administrative judge from one municipal court to another. <em>Kline </em>at \u00b6 27. The <em>Kline </em>court also held that \u201c[bjecause former R.C. 2937.20 is inapplicable to a municipal court judge who disqualifies himself without an affidavit having been filed against the judge, the Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court possesses the exclusive authority to appoint another judge in these circumstances.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23. In the case at bar, the Chief Justice appointed the judge the railroad objects to. <em>Kline, </em>therefore, is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">{\u00b6 9} The railroad also relies on <em>State v. Keith, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81125, 2002-Ohio-7250, 2002 WL 31875968. In <em>Keith, </em>however, the court\u2019s ruling was held to be void because \u201c[wjhile the Ohio Constitution and the Rules of Superintendence allow for the temporary assignment of visiting judges, no such assignment is evident from the record in this case. [The allegedly assigned judge] was, therefore, without authority to enter the order granting the state\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Keith </em>at \u00b6 6. Again, the railroad does not claim that the Chief Justice did not assign the judges in this case or that the record fails to reflect that appointment. The focus of the railroad\u2019s argument is that the Chief Justice lacked the authority to make what the railroad deems to be permanent appointments instead of temporary ones. This issue was not the issue addressed in <em>Keith. Keith, </em>therefore, is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 10} Finally, the railroad argues that the Chief Justice improperly had made a permanent appointment of a visiting judge. In support, the railroad cites <em>Silverman v. Am. Income Life Ins. Co. </em>(Dec. 18, 2001), Franklin App. Nos. 01AP-338 and 01AP-339, 2001 WL 1607635, in which the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">The record does not substantiate plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the visiting judge was appointed as a permanent visiting judge. Certificates of assignment reflect that on at least fourteen occasions between October 1997 and March 2001, the Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court appointed that particular visiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>judge, a retired judge of a different county\u2019s common pleas court, to preside in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. However, each of the assignments was for specific cases or for specified, limited time periods, with any proceedings in which he participated to be concluded, if necessary, after the specified period ended. The assignments, although numerous, were for limited time periods and were therefore temporary in nature, not permanent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Id. at * 16. The railroad argues that the judge\u2019s appointment in the case at bar is not limited in the way the appointment was limited in <em>Silverman, </em>because the continuous nature of the asbestos judge\u2019s service makes him a permanent judge. The railroad is not able, however, to point to any statute or rule prohibiting the repeated appointment without interruption of a particular judge to a district.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">B. Guidelines for Assignment of Judges</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">{\u00b6 11} To support its position, the railroad points to the Guidelines for Assignment of Judges as stating that \u201c \u2018the Chief Justice will assign * * * a retired judge for <em>no longer than two months.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added by appellant.) First, the guideline the railroad cites states, <em>\u201cOrdinarily, </em>the Chief Justice will assign * * * a retired judge for no longer than two months.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Guideline 8, 95 Ohio St.3d LXXXI. The word \u201cordinarily\u201d implies that two-month terms are customary but are not necessarily the only length. There might be other than ordinary circumstances for longer terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">{\u00b6 12} Second, the Guidelines provide an exemption for the Chief Justice. The first Guideline states that \u201c[wjhile these Guidelines may impose specific duties upon other persons, the Chief Justice may waive compliance with any Guideline\u201d in the exercise of his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">{\u00b6 13} Finally, this set of Guidelines does not govern assignments during the time period of the case at bar. The version of the Guidelines the railroad cites did not take effect until 2002; the introduction to those Guidelines explicitly states: \u201cThe March 1, 2002 revisions apply to assignment requests made on or after March 1, 2002 * * 95 Ohio St.3d LXXIX. The case was first filed on August 28, 1999. Any argument as to the assignment of a judge to the case at bar, therefore, would have had to cite Guidelines effective on that date. The Guidelines in effect at that time are found at 37 Ohio St.3d xxxix.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">{\u00b6 14} Moreover, the introductions to both the old and the new versions of the Guidelines state, \u201cThe Guidelines have not been adopted as rules pursuant to Article IV, Section 5 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d The Guidelines, therefore, are just that: a guide for the assignment of judges. Nothing the railroad has cited provides any support for the assertion that the continuous appointment of the same retired judges to the asbestos docket violates the Constitution or even violates any rules of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>{\u00b6 15} It is well settled that the act of appointing a visiting judge to hear a case is not unconstitutional. <em>Pocket v. Brown </em>(C.A.6 1987), 819 F.2d 148, 149 (finding no federal constitutional violation); <em>State ex rel. Berger v. McMonagle </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 28, 30-31, 6 OBR 50, 451 N.E.2d 225 (finding no state constitutional violation); <em>Hewlett v. Cincinnati Univ. Hosp. </em>(Mar. 21, 1989), Franklin App. No. 88AP-687, 1989 WL 27158.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">C. Jurisdiction of Appellate Courts to Review Appointments</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 16} Moreover, even if, arguendo, the Chief Justice erred in appointing these judges, we are without jurisdiction to review the issue. As the Fourth Appellate District has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">To the extent that [appellant] seeks in this court to question the propriety of the Chief Justice\u2019s assignment of Judge Clark, our conclusion is that that is not a proper subject of our appellate review. With respect to the assignment of an out-of-county judge to a court of common pleas, Civ.R. 63 merely implements the grant of power found in Section 5(A)(3), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution. That provision authorizes the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and no one else, to assign a common pleas judge from out of county to a single-judge division. We find nothing in that constitutional grant of power to suggest that an inferior court, such as this court of appeals, is authorized to review the propriety of the Chief Justice\u2019s exercise of the power of assignment granted to him by Section 5(A)(3), Article IV, Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-8\"><em>Adkins v. Adkins </em>(1988), 43 Ohio App.3d 95, 96-97, 539 N.E.2d 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">D. Failure to Object in the Trial Court</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">{\u00b6 17} The record does not reflect any motion, oral or written, objecting to the authority of the judge hearing the case. Further, the appropriate means for objecting to the authority of an assigned judge is through a motion for mandamus and prohibition. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that a judge\u2019s right to hear a case cannot be questioned in a collateral proceeding to which the judge is not a party. The court specifically ruled that an appeal from an adverse ruling constituted a collateral proceeding if the appeal challenged the authority of the judge who heard the case. <em>State ex rel. Sowell v. Lovinger </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 21, 23, 6 OBR 18, 450 N.E.2d 1176, citing <em>Stiess v. State </em>(1921), 103 Ohio St. 33, 132 N.E. 85. The railroad may not, therefore, \u201cappeal from an adverse judgment rendered in the underlying action\u201d by questioning the authority of the appointed judge. <em>Lovinger, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 23, 6 OBR 18, 450 N.E.2d 1176. Instead, \u201cuntil a de facto officer is properly challenged in a quo warranto proceeding and thereby removed from office, his actions are as valid as those of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>de jure officer.\u201d <em>State v. Staten </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 107, 110, 54 O.O.2d 235, 267 N.E.2d 122, citing <em>Ex Parte Strang </em>(1871), 21 Ohio St. 610, 1871 WL 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 18} The railroad cannot now for the first time, therefore, attack the jurisdiction of the visiting retired judges on appeal. See, also, <em>Huffman v. Shaffer </em>(1984), 13 Ohio App.3d 291, 13 OBR 356, 469 N.E.2d 566. \u201cClearly, the decision by the [appellants] to proceed without challenge or objection concerning the appointment of [the visiting judge] renders any possible error waived.\u201d <em>Williams v. Banner Buick, Inc. </em>(1989), 60 Ohio App.3d 128, 134, 574 N.E.2d 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">{\u00b6 19} Even if the judges had been improperly assigned, furthermore, their exercise of apparent authority can make them de facto judges.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">[W]here a judge delegates judicial authority under a color of right but the delegation of authority is defective, either because the judge lacked the requisite legal authority to make the delegation or because of a defect or irregularity in the appointment procedure, the person to whom the judicial authority is transferred may become a \u201cde facto\u201d judge, rather than a \u201cde jure\u201d judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-8\"><em>Huffman v. Huffman, </em>Franklin App. Nos. 02AP-101 and 02AP-698, 2002-Ohio-6031, 2002 WL 31466435, citing <em>State ex rel. Witten v. Ferguson </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 702, 708-709, 36 O.O. 285, 76 N.E.2d 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">{\u00b6 20} As the <em>Witten </em>court explained, \u201c[a] de jure officer is one who occupies his office through a proper and legal election or appointment and during a constituted term.\u201d <em>Witten, </em>148 Ohio St. at 707, 36 O.O. 285, 76 N.E.2d 886. A de facto judge, on the other hand, \u201chas all the power and authority of a \u2018de jure\u2019 judge, and judicial actions taken by a \u2018de facto\u2019 judge are legally valid and binding and not subject to collateral attack or to challenges first raised on appeal.\u201d <em>Huffman, </em>2002-Ohio-6031, at \u00b6 34, citing <em>Williams v. Banner Buick, Inc., </em>60 Ohio App.3d at 134, 574 N.E.2d 579. \u201c[T]he acting judge, by having \u2018colorable\u2019 authority, is deemed a de facto judge with all the power and authority of a proper de jure judge. Consequently, actions taken by [the visiting judge] are legally valid and binding.\u201d <em>Banner Buick, </em>supra, 60 Ohio App.3d at 134, 574 N.E.2d 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">{\u00b6 21} Failure to even object or raise the issue of the visiting judge\u2019s jurisdiction is fatal to this claim on appeal. In a case in which a party appealed the issue of the authority of the assigned judge, the Ninth Appellate District held that by failing to object to the assignment before the judge took any action in the case, the party waived its right to raise the issue on appeal. <em>Boling v. Valecko </em>(Feb. 6, 2002), Summit App. No. 20464, at 6, 2002 WL 185182, citing <em>White v. Summit Cty. </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 116, 118, 740 N.E.2d 688, quoting <em>Berger v. Berger </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 125, 131, 3 OBR 141, 443 N.E.2d 1375. \u201c[A]ny procedural irregularities that may attend a transfer of a case [to a visiting judge] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>are waived unless asserted in a timely manner. \u2018A party cannot await the decision with knowledge of the procedural irregularity before choosing to object to the defect if the decision is unfavorable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wissel v. Ohio High School Athletic Assn. </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 529, 533, 605 N.E.2d 458, quoting <em>Berger v. Berger, </em>3 Ohio App.3d at 130, 3 OBR 141, 443 N.E.2d 1375. See, also, <em>Adkins, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">{\u00b6 22} In summary, by failing to raise this issue before the appeal, the railroad has waived it. It submitted to the authority of the visiting judges when it participated in the trial without objecting to the judges\u2019 authority. Further, the railroad has failed to demonstrate any error in the procedure that the common pleas court and the Chief Justice followed in the appointment of these judges. It has also failed to point to any law to support its assertion that the appointment of these judges was unconstitutional. Finally, it failed to demonstrate that this court has the authority to address the issue of the validity of an appointment by the Chief Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">{\u00b6 23} Accordingly, this assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 24} For its second assignment of error, the railroad states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">The trial court erred when it denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">{\u00b6 25} The railroad argues that the trial court should have dismissed this case because the forum was not convenient for any of the parties. It raises the same arguments that it raised in <em>Hess v. Norfolk S. Ry. </em>Co., 153 Ohio App.3d 565, 2003-Ohio-4172, 795 N.E.2d 91: that none of the workers lived in Ohio, that the rail yard where the workers were exposed to asbestos was in North Carolina, that it is a Virginia corporation, and that it had to depose numerous parties in North Carolina. The railroad raised these issues both in its written motion to dismiss as well as in its oral arguments prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">{\u00b626} The workers respond by citing the trial court\u2019s stated reasons for denying the motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens. In its reply brief, the railroad claims that because the transcript of the hearing on this issue is not part of the stipulated record which is before this court, we cannot consider the workers\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">{\u00b6 27} The railroad is partially correct; we cannot consider the court\u2019s comments that are not properly before us. The logic of an argument, however, does not depend upon its source. Moreover, we cannot review facts underlying the court\u2019s decision if we do not have the transcript of the hearing in which those facts were presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>{\u00b6 28} \u201cAbsent relevant evidence, an appellate court must presume the regularity of the trial court\u2019s proceedings and judgment.\u201d <em>Natl. City Bank v. Beyer </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 152, 160, 729 N.E.2d 711, citing <em>Wells v. Spirit Fabricating, Ltd. </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 282, 288-289, 680 N.E.2d 1046. Because we do not have the transcript in which the facts upon which the claim of non conveniens was presented, we must presume that the court\u2019s judgment was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 29} App.R. 9(B) is quite clear as to the responsibility of the appealing party: \u201cAt the time of filing the notice of appeal the appellant, in writing, shall order from the reporter a complete transcript or a transcript of the parts of the proceedings * * * as the appellant considers necessary for inclusion in the record * * App.R. 9(B). The parties in the case at bar stipulated to the record as it was filed on appeal. If the railroad intended to argue the issue of forum, it was required to provide this court with the portion of the record it needed to address the trial court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Absent the transcript of the hearing on the motion, we are constrained to affirm the decision of the trial court. <em>Natl. City Bank v. Beyer, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 160, 729 N.E.2d 711. Accordingly, this assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">{\u00b6 30} For its third assignment of error, the railroad states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant when it precluded appellant from introducing evidence that the manufacturers of asbestos products made representations to appellant that their products were safe and erroneously allowed appellees to introduce into evidence scientific studies that did not relate or in any way reference the railroad for the purpose of establishing that these studies provided notice to the railroad that exposure to asbestos could pose a harm to its workers, which unfairly prejudiced appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 31} The railroad challenges the trial court\u2019s exclusion of pamphlets it claims it received from the asbestos manufacturers and the exclusion of testimony of its expert, Dr. Weir, concerning the railroad\u2019s alleged lack of notice of the dangers of asbestos because of its reliance on those pamphlets.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe decision of whether or not to admit evidence rests in the sound discretion of the court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Wightman v. Consol. Rail Corp. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 431, 437, 715 N.E.2d 546, citing <em>Peters v. Ohio State Lottery Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 296, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>299, 587 N.E.2d 290. Evidence must be relevant to be admissible. \u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Evid.R. 401. Even if evidence is relevant, however, if its prejudicial effect outweighs its value, it might not be admissible. The rules provide the following distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">(A) Exclusion mandatory. Although relevant, evidence is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">(B) Exclusion discretionary. Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Evid.R. 403. The railroad argues that the pamphlets it tried to introduce were relevant and that the testimony of the worker\u2019s expert witness was unduly prejudicial and irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 33} Again, the railroad presented an identical assignment of error in <em>Hess. </em>In both this trial and the one in <em>Hess, </em>the railroad attempted to introduce into evidence pamphlets that the railroad allegedly had received from asbestos manufacturers claiming that the asbestos was not harmful. In both cases, the railroad tried to have the same expert witness, Dr. Weir, testify as to the contents of the pamphlets. And in both cases, the trial court refused to admit both the pamphlets and testimony about them because Dr. Weir was not employed by the railroad when it allegedly received the pamphlets and because no employee of the railroad was available to testify concerning when the railroad received them. The court therefore excluded the pamphlets as hearsay. As the <em>Hess </em>court noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\">The testimony of Dr. Weir goes directly to the knowledge and notice of the appellant regarding the safety of the asbestos products at issue. Clearly, any evidence that the asbestos manufacturers either did or did not provide adequate warnings to Norfolk regarding the health risks of asbestos goes directly to the issue of foreseeability. However, to introduce a pamphlet into evidence to prove the actual knowledge of the appellant requires that a proper foundation be laid. The trial court excluded introduction of this evidence, stating, \u201cIf he had a circular in the hands of a railroad person who said he got, and relied on it and bought the product, it\u2019s in. This is hearsay, it\u2019s out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">A proper foundation would include a witness from Norfolk who had actual knowledge of the following: who at the railroad received the pamphlet, when the pamphlet was received, and whether Norfolk relied on the information in the pamphlet. Clearly, because he lacked actual knowledge pertaining to the pamphlet, the appellant\u2019s expert is not the proper witness to introduce informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>tion contained in a pamphlet that was supposedly given to \u201csomeone\u201d at Norfolk, proclaiming that asbestos products were safe. * * * Furthermore, the trial court would have admitted this evidence if introduced through a proper witness and with a foundation to prove its reliability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\"><em>Hess, </em>153 Ohio App.3d 565, 2003-Ohio-4172, 795 N.E.2d 91, at \u00b6 46-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 34} In the case at bar, the railroad failed to provide a proper foundation for the introduction of these pamphlets and, therefore, for the expert\u2019s testimony regarding them. The reasoning of this court in <em>Hess </em>applies, therefore, to this case. Because the pamphlet and Dr. Weir\u2019s testimony are hearsay without a foundation, they are inadmissible. The trial court did not err in excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 35} Under this assignment of error, the railroad also disputes the trial court\u2019s admission of the testimony of the workers\u2019 expert, Dr. Ellenbecker. Again, \u201c[t]he admission or rejection of evidence concerning out-of-court experiments is a matter peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court, and reviewing courts will not interfere absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Columbus v. Taylor </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 162, 529 N.E.2d 1382, syllabus, approving <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio RR. Co. </em>(1935), 129 Ohio St. 401, 2 O.O. 396, 195 N.E. 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 36} The railroad objects to Ellenbecker\u2019s testimony concerning the level of knowledge available in the professional community concerning the dangers of asbestos as early as the 1900s. This issue was also addressed and overruled in <em>Hess. </em>Although the expert plaintiffs used in <em>Hess </em>was a different person, both experts testified as to the level of knowledge available in the professional community concerning the dangers of asbestos as early as the 1900s. The railroad argues that it is unfair to impute to the railroad the knowledge available to other industries, and it points out that the first study on asbestos in the railroad industry was not published until 1983. Seaford\u2019s exposure to asbestos occurred during his employment with the railroad between 1949 until 1987. Thomas\u2019s exposure while employed with the railroad occurred between 1963 and 1995. As this court stated in <em>Hess, </em>however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">That a study did not come from the railroad industry until 1983, which stated that exposure to asbestos is harmful to one\u2019s health, does not give the railroad the right to hide its head in the sand and pretend that asbestos exposure was not known to be harmful for the past 43 years. What other industries knew, published, and circulated about the dangers of asbestos, the railroad also should have known.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Id., 153 Ohio App.3d 565, 2003-Ohio-4172, 795 N.E.2d 91, at \u00b6 51. We find the reasoning in <em>Hess </em>to be sound. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in its ruling to admit the testimony of the worker\u2019s expert regarding the industry\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>knowledge of the danger of asbestos. Accordingly, this assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 37} For its fourth assignment of error, the railroad states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant when it excluded the testimony of appellant\u2019s industrial hygienist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 38} The railroad sought to introduce expert testimony from an industrial hygienist, Mr. Liukonen, concerning air quality tests he had run in rail yards, engines, and cabooses. He also intended to testify about studies by others. The trial court held a voir dire of his proposed testimony and ruled that he would not be permitted to testify about test results from studies by other persons. It also ruled that he could not testify about tests in which the circumstances of the testing were significantly different from the conditions that the workers experienced.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 39} Expert testimony is governed by Evid.R. 702, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">A witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">(A) The witness\u2019 testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">(B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-12\">(C) The witness\u2019 testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information. To the extent that the testimony reports the result of a procedure, test, or experiment, the testimony is reliable only if all of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-13\">(1) The theory upon which the procedure, test, or experiment is based is objectively verifiable or is validly derived from widely accepted knowledge, facts, or principles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-14\">(2) The design of the procedure, test, or experiment reliably implements the theory;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-15\">(3) The particular procedure, test, or experiment was conducted in a way that will yield an accurate result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-16\">Liukonen\u2019s qualifications were undisputed. He thus fulfills the requirements of Evid.R. 702(A) and (B). What is challenged is whether the methods and principles he used to reach his result are reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-17\">{\u00b6 40} The railroad relies on <em>Miller v. Bike Athletic Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 607, 611, 687 N.E.2d 735, to support the admissibility of Liukonen\u2019s experiments. The <em>Miller </em>court held, \u201cWhen an out-of-court experiment is not represented to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>a reenactment of the accident and deals with one aspect or principle directly related to the cause or result of the occurrence, the conditions of the accident need not be duplicated.\u201d Id., paragraph two of the syllabus. The <em>Miller </em>court, while it did not require that the exact conditions be recreated, did require that the out-of-court experiment deal \u201cwith one aspect or principle directly related to the cause or result of the occurrence.\u201d Id. at 615, 687 N.E.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 41} Here, the experiments Liukonen relies on were too different from the conditions the workers experienced to be reliable. In fact, the experiments did not deal with any aspect or principle of the conditions that the workers allege caused their asbestosis. One of the experiments that Liukonen intended to discuss was a test that someone else had run on asbestos brake shoes. As this court noted in <em>Kilbane v. Consol. Rail Corp., </em>2004-Ohio-134, 2004 WL 63922, the results of that particular test were not admissible, because the expert quantified the amount of asbestos released only when the brakes were applied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the trial court noted in the case at bar, the brake shoe test did not involve a comparable activity of the workers, whose duties, in addition to beating on the brake shoes to change them, included tearing off asbestos from heat shields and removing tape from asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 42} Another test that the court excluded concerned an asbestos heat shield in the caboose. Liukonen testified that he examined a heat shield that was encased in cement and found it was not friable, that is, able to be crumbled with his fingers. The workers had testified, on the other hand, that the heat shields they had dealt with were friable and were not encased in cement. Explaining that \u201c[t]he heat shield is not the same as the heat shield these men complain of,\u201d the court properly excluded Liukonen\u2019s testimony on the heat shield, as well as on the brake shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 43} Liukonen also intended to testify about the absence of airborne asbestos at rail yards he had examined. Excluding this testimony, the trial court described the time frame in which the tests Liukonen intended to testify about were conducted: the tests were performed as much as 40 years after the beginning of the workers\u2019 exposure. The court concluded that there was no evidence that the conditions of the rail yards at the time the experiments were performed replicated the conditions of the rail yards at the time the workers were exposed to them. The court held, therefore, that Liukonen would not be allowed to testify about the conditions of a different rail yard several decades later.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>{\u00b6 44} Finally, Liukonen intended to testify that the asbestos tape that was wrapped around pipes in the cabooses of the trains was not friable and did not give off asbestos fibers. Again, however, the test he performed on the tapes did not involve tearing the tape or repairing it. He also tested tape in a refrigerated car, not in a caboose. The workers testified that for up to 40 years, they had used the pipes as a footrest and had seen the tape on the pipes tattered and torn. The expert was not prepared to testify about tape in this condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 45} The trial court did not err in excluding Liukonen\u2019s testimony. His tests were not relevant, because they examined the air around undisturbed products made of asbestos, whereas the workers\u2019 exposure involved those products when they were torn, damaged, or being removed by strong hammer blows. Tearing a product from a heat shield, hammering it to remove it from a brake, or disturbing it through repeated pressure from booted feet provided conditions so unlike those of Liukonen\u2019s experiments that the court could properly conclude that his experiments did not deal with circumstances directly related to the cause of the workers\u2019 asbestosis. Accordingly, this assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 46} For its fifth assignment of error, the railroad states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant when it permitted appellees to introduce answers to interrogatories in an unrelated twenty year old Tennessee lawsuit as rebuttal testimony which was never disclosed to appellant prior to trial and was not listed in appellee\u2019s trial exhibit list.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 47} After the railroad had presented its case, the court permitted the workers, over the railroad\u2019s objection, to present rebuttal testimony in the form of the railroad\u2019s answers to interrogatories from a Tennessee case from 1983. These interrogatories were submitted by another worker with an asbestos claim in the 1983 case. The railroad objects to their admission because they were not on the workers\u2019 trial exhibit list and were not disclosed before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">{\u00b648} The railroad also argues that because the workers presented evidence in their case-in-chief to show that the railroad had knowledge of the dangers of asbestos, they could not introduce new evidence to prove that issue on rebuttal. The railroad points out that because the workers\u2019 case-in-chief required them to prove that the railroad had knowledge of the dangers of asbestos, the interrogatories introduced on rebuttal should be limited to their case-in-chief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">Admission of rebuttal testimony is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court and its judgment will not be reversed absent a clear showing of an abuse of that discretion with attendant material prejudice to the defendant. <em>State v. Hymore </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 122, 128, 38 O.O.2d 298, 224 N.E.2d 126, 130. Thus, a trial court\u2019s decision regarding the admission of rebuttal testimony will not be reversed unless the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>arbitrary or unconscionable. <em>State v. Finnerty </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 104, 108, 543 N.E.2d 1233, 1237.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\"><em>State v.

Waste Mgmt., Inc. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 408, 410, 644 N.E.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 50} The presentation of evidence is controlled by R.C. 2315.01, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">When the jury is sworn, unless for special reasons the court otherwise directs, the trial shall proceed in the following order except as provided in section 2315.02 of the Revised Code:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">(A) The plaintiff concisely must state the plaintiffs claim, and briefly may state the plaintiffs evidence to sustain it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">(B) The defendant must then briefly state the defendant\u2019s defense, and briefly may state the defendant\u2019s evidence in support of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-11\">(C) The party who would be defeated if no evidence were offered on either side, first, must produce that party\u2019s evidence, and the adverse party must then produce the adverse party\u2019s evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-12\">(D) The parties then shall be confined to rebutting evidence, unless the court for good reasons, in the furtherance of justice, permits them to offer evidence in their original cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">{\u00b6 51} As one court noted, \u201cThe purpose of a rebuttal witness is to \u2018explain, refute or disprove new facts introduced into evidence by the adverse party.\u2019 <em>State v. McNeill </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 438, 446 [700 N.E.2d 596]. The testimony of a rebuttal witness is only relevant to challenge the evidence introduced by the opponent, and the scope of this testimony is limited to such evidence. Id.\u201d <em>State v. Hunt, </em>Summit App. No. 21515, 2003-Ohio-6120, 2003 WL 22715616, at \u00b6 23. In <em>Hunt, </em>the court permitted rebuttal testimony to impeach claims by the defense witnesses concerning the defendant\u2019s claims that he never had threatened the victim. The court permitted rebuttal testimony, stating, \u201cAs this evidence is relevant to refute defense evidence, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it permitted the State to introduce evidence through its rebuttal witness.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">{\u00b6 52} Wflien counsel was discussing the admission of these interrogatory answers, the counsel for the workers stated that the interrogatory evidence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Z\">rebuts what Dr. Weir and Mr. Liukonen [the railroad\u2019s expert witnesses] came in and said [sic] they want to talk about TLV\u2019s [recommended threshold limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>value of asbestos in the air].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> * * * But when we asked the railroad during the period of time that these men worked, did you ever take any TLV\u2019s, did you ever take any dust counts, no. They didn\u2019t. It\u2019s rebuttable evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">Then as to the claim agents, what they are going to do is get up and argue we never knew there was any disease. Well, all right. Fine. That\u2019s their claims records retention policy. It only goes back ten years. If the jury is going to hear that they didn\u2019t have any claims, the jury should hear that when they kept their records that that doesn\u2019t change, no matter what case you are in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">(Footnote added.) The interrogatory answers specifically undermine the railroad\u2019s claim as part of its defense that it did not have knowledge of the danger and had not received notice of claims prior to the first published study of asbestos in rail yards. The workers state that they sought to introduce these interrogatory answers to prove that the railroad\u2019s assertions in its defense were without basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 53} The workers also sought to introduce the interrogatories to show that the railroad\u2019s assertion that it did not know of any asbestos injuries to its workers prior to 1983 was disingenuous. The interrogatory answer stated that its records prior to 1973 had been destroyed and, therefore, any prior claims could not be substantiated as true or false. In its opening statement, the railroad claimed that \u201cthe railroad was not seeing any incidents of asbestos-related disease\u201d prior to 1983. This assertion goes well beyond any evidence that was produced. Because the railroad did not preserve its records, it could not say what it saw prior to 1973.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The workers presented a colorable argument, therefore, that the interrogatories were proper rebuttal evidence against the specific claim that defendants lacked knowledge of prior claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 54} In a Sixth Appellate District case, the trial court permitted rebuttal evidence that could have been admitted in the case-in-chief. In <em>Obenour v. Bower </em>(Aug. 19, 1994), Lucas App. No. L-93-319, 1994 WL 455667, a landlord sued a tenant for nonpayment of rent. The tenant\u2019s defense consisted, in part, of a claim that the landlord was not the rightful owner of the property. Although the landlord presented witnesses who testified that he owned the property, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>defendant argued that without a copy of the deed, the ownership was not proven. The trial court permitted the landlord to present a copy of the deed on rebuttal, although he could have presented it in his original case. The court held that \u201cit is within the discretion of the trial court to permit or deny the presentation of evidence that is part of a party\u2019s case in chief after that party has rested. Accordingly, unless the trial court\u2019s attitude in allowing appellee to provide documentary evidence of his ownership after he rested his case is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable, this court cannot disturb the lower court\u2019s judgment.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. at * 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 55} Indeed, Evid.R. 611 provides the trial court with discretion in determining the order of presenting evidence. However, the rule specifies three criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUi\">(A) Control by court. The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 56} In a Ninth Appellate District case, the court allowed rebuttal testimony concerning the state\u2019s case-in-chief against a defendant on trial for driving under the influence. Although the state had the burden of proving defendant\u2019s intoxication, \u201c[r]ebuttal testimony is properly offered to refute evidence offered by the adversary. Furthermore, a trial court enjoys discretion over the control of the presentation of evidence. Evid.R. 611(A). Given the trial court\u2019s discretionary authority to control the presentation of evidence, we cannot say the trial court erred. [Defendant] did introduce evidence tending to establish his sobriety. The trial court properly allowed the prosecution to rebut this defense by admitting the hospital record into evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State v. Perry </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 709, 715, 671 N.E.2d 623. See, also, <em>Cleveland v. Wirtz </em>(July 29, 1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 62751, 1993 WL 290011. The trial court in the case at bar did not err in allowing the interrogatory answers to be introduced as evidence on rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 57} Even if that evidence had been admitted improperly, however, its introduction would be harmless error if the railroad does not meet the high standard enunciated in Civ.R. 61:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">No error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in anything done or omitted by the court or by any of the parties is ground for granting a new trial or for setting aside a verdict or for vacating, modifying or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice. The court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Civ.R. 61. The railroad has failed to show that the admission of the objected-to rebuttal testimony affected the railroad\u2019s substantial rights. The railroad has the right to rebut any evidence against it. It argued at trial that because its expert witnesses were no longer available for questioning on the interrogatory answers, its substantial rights were violated. As the workers\u2019 counsel pointed out, however, neither of the railroad\u2019s experts was affiliated with the railroad at the time these interrogatories were answered. They would not be able, therefore, to testify concerning the answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 58} Further, the workers had already introduced sufficient evidence in their case-in-chief with the records of the Association of American Railroads from 1932 to show that even if the railroad lacked actual notice of the dangers of asbestos, it had constructive notice: that is, it should have known that asbestos was a dangerous substance and that its workers were at risk. An appellate court may not reverse a judgment if it finds that the errors in the case were not prejudicial to the losing party. App.R. 12(B). The admission of the rebuttal testimony did not affect a substantial right of the railroad. Civ.R. 61. The admission of the interrogatory answers, if error at all, therefore, would be harmless error. Accordingly, this assignment is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 59} For its sixth assignment of error, the railroad states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">The trial court erred when it permitted Mr. Seaford to recover damages for his alleged fear of cancer claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">{\u00b6 60} The railroad claims that one of the workers, Ralph Seaford, should not have been permitted to recover on his fear-of-cancer claim. It argues that Seaford did not exhibit sufficient fear to justify an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">{\u00b6 61} The United States Supreme Court recently addressed this issue in asbestos cases in <em>Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. Ayers, </em>538 U.S. 135, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261. Once a worker has developed asbestosis, the court held, he may recover for a sincere fear of later developing cancer. \u201cWe affirm only the qualification of an asbestosis sufferer to seek compensation for fear of cancer as an element of his asbestosis-related pain and suffering damages. It is incumbent upon such a complainant, however, to prove that his alleged fear is genuine <em>and serious.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at 157, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261. The court declined, however, to define the terms \u201cgenuine and serious\u201d in this context. Id. at 158, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261. The <em>Ayers </em>court noted that the dissenting opinions varied in their interpretation of what constituted \u201cgenuine and serious.\u201d Because the definition of those terms had not been discussed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>case, the court stated that it therefore resisted ruling on it that day. Id. at fn. 17.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 62} We are guided by a review of cases cited by the court in <em>Ayers. </em>In <em>Devlin v. Johns-Manville </em>(1985), 202 N.J.Super. 556, 495 A.2d 495, the court held that plaintiffs will be required to provide the following at trial to recover for their alleged fear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">1. Plaintiff is currently suffering from serious fear or emotional distress or a clinically diagnosed phobia of cancer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">2. The fear was proximately caused by exposure to asbestos.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">3. Plaintiffs fear of getting cancer due to their [sic] exposure to asbestos is reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">4. Defendants are legally responsible for plaintiffs exposure to asbestos. [See <em>Arnett v. Dow Chemical Co. </em>No. 720586 (Cal.Super.Ct. March 21, 1983)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">Id. at 563, 495 A.2d 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">{\u00b6 63} In the case at bar, the only element in dispute here is, as the <em>Devlin </em>court put it, whether the worker is currently suffering from a \u201cserious fear\u201d or \u201cemotional distress.\u201d The court further noted that \u201ca plaintiff can testify to his fear, preoccupation and distress resulting from the enhanced risk of cancer about which he has been informed.\u201d Id. Here, the worker\u2019s testimony consisted of a single statement describing his reaction to his increased risk of developing cancer once he developed asbestosis: \u201cI worry about it and the family is concerned about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">{\u00b6 64} Because plaintiffs one-sentence statement does not express \u201cserious fear\u201d or \u201cemotional distress,\u201d the railroad argues that \u201cworry\u201d does not rise to the level of \u201cfear\u201d and does not express a \u201cserious\u201d enough emotion to justify an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>award for fear of cancer. We agree. Nothing in the worker\u2019s testimony indicates that his fear qualified as serious or that he suffered emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 65} This brief statement is the only time in the trial that plaintiff addresses the basis for any award to recover for his fear of cancer. The first question is how to understand his \u201cworry\u201d when he gives us no details, only the word \u201cworry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 66} The question is whether Seaford\u2019s \u201cworry\u201d and his observation of his family\u2019s \u201cconcern\u201d are the equivalent of \u201cserious fear,\u201d here, specifically of developing cancer. Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary, provides a discussion of the difference between these three words: \u201cConcern suggests mental uneasiness over someone or something in which one has an affectionate interest\u201d as in \u201cI feel concern for their welfare.\u201d \u201cWorry\u201d suggests mental distress or agitation over some problem as in \u201chis chief worry was that he might fail.\u201d \u201c[F]ear is the general term for the anxiety and agitation felt <em>at the presence of danger.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In its discussion of synonyms of \u201cfear,\u201d the dictionary lists \u201cdread,\u201d \u201calarm,\u201d \u201cfright,\u201d \u201cterror,\u201d and \u201cpanic.\u201d It is that sense of danger that distinguishes \u201cserious fear\u201d from \u201cworry,\u201d including a worry based on a family\u2019s \u201cconcern.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 67} Other cases the .United States Supreme Court cited in the <em>Ayers </em>case include <em>Eagle-Picher Industries., Inc. v. Cox </em>(Fla.App.1985), 481 So.2d 517, which notes that a worker who had witnessed a friend with asbestosis die from cancer resulting from the asbestos exposure had a valid claim for fear of cancer. See, also, <em>Coffman v. Keene Corp. </em>(1992), 257 N.J.Super. 279, 608 A.2d 416, in which the court found the worker\u2019s fear valid, noting that \u201chis fright is magnified by the experience of his brother-in-law, who had physically wasted and died from cancer brought on by asbestosis.\u201d Id. at 294, 608 A.2d 416. No such circumstances are reported in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 68} The railroad states that the trial court should have directed a verdict in its favor on this issue, or, in the alternative, that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. We agree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">Under Civ.R. 50(A)(4), a court may properly grant a motion for directed verdict when, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, it finds that reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion on a determinative issue, and the conclusion is adverse to the non-moving party. Review of the grant or denial of a motion for directed verdict is de novo. In evaluating the grant or denial of a JNOV, a reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>court applies the same test as that applied in reviewing a motion for a directed verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">(Footnotes omitted). <em>Kanjuka v. MetroHealth Med. Ctr., </em>151 Ohio App.3d 183, 72002-Ohio-6803, 83 N.E.2d 920, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 69} A directed verdict is appropriate when reasonable minds could determine that the evidence is insufficient to support a verdict against the party moving for directed verdict. Here, nothing in the record supports a finding that the worker\u2019s \u201cworry\u201d or his family\u2019s \u201cconcern\u201d reached the level of \u201cemotional distress\u201d or \u201cserious fear\u201d required by <em>Ayers </em>to support a claim of fear of cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 70} We conclude, therefore, that the evidence was insufficient to support the award to Seaford for a fear-of-cancer claim. Accordingly, this assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 71} For its seventh assignment of error, the railroad states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">The trial court erred when it denied appellant the right to a set-off of damages in this FELA action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">{\u00b6 72} The railroad argues in its appellate brief that because the workers reached a settlement with the asbestos manufacturers, the court should have set off the amount they received from the manufacturers from the total they were awarded. To rule otherwise, they say, would allow the workers to receive a larger recovery than the jury had determined was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">{\u00b6 73} The only setoff permitted in a FELA case is one reached between the plaintiff and another tortfeasor before the judgment against the FELA defendant is rendered. The <em>Ayers </em>court explained alternate solutions when it noted that federal and state reporters have related that \u201cFELA defendants may bring indemnification and contribution actions against third parties <em>under otherwise applicable state or federal law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 538 U.S. at 162, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">{\u00b6 74} The record in the case at bar indicates that the workers settled with various manufacturers prior to the judgment in the case at bar.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-13\">Our analysis of the merits begins by recognizing that third-party actions for contribution arising out of FELA claims are governed by state law. <em>Denicola v. G.C. Murphy Co., </em>562 F.2d 889, 895 (3d Cir.1977); <em>Kennedy v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>282 F.2d 705, 709 (3d Cir.1960); see also <em>Alabama Great Southern Railroad Co. v. Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Co., </em>493 F.2d 979, 983 (8th Cir.1974) (citing cases). Here, the question of which state\u2019s law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>applies is of crucial significance. If Indiana law applies, Conrail has no right to contribution. <em>Jackson v. Record, </em>211 Ind. 141, 5 N.E.2d 897, 898 (1937); <em>Elcona Homes Corp. v. McMillan Bloedell, Ltd., </em>475 N.E.2d 713, 715 (Ind.Ct.App.1985); Ind.Code Ann. \u00a7 34-4-33-7 (Burns Supp.1986). If Pennsylvania law applies, Conrail possesses a right of contribution among joint tortfeasors. <em>Elder v. Orluck, </em>511 Pa. 402, 515 A.2d 517, 519 (Pa.1986); <em>Rivera v. Philadelphia Theological Seminary </em>[510 Pa. 1], 507 A.2d 1, 12 (Pa.1986); 42 Pa.Cons.Stat. \u00a7 8324 (1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-5\"><em>Shields v. Consol. Rail Corp. </em>(C.A.3, 1987), 810 F.2d 397, 399. Whether the railroad is entitled to contribution, therefore, depends upon the law of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">{\u00b6 75} It is not the law of the state in which the trial is held that is controlling, however, but the state in which injury occurred. As the <em>Shields </em>court noted, \u201cSection 379a [redrafted as \u00a7 146] of the new Restatement provides: \u2018In an action for a personal injury, the local law of the state where the injury occurred determines the rights and liabilities of the parties, unless some other state has a more significant relationship with the occurrence and the parties as to the particular issue involved, in which event the local law of the latter state will govern.\u2019 \u201d (Bracketed insert by circuit court.) Id., 810 F.2d at 399-400, quoting <em>Griffith v. United Air Lines, Inc </em>(1964), 416 Pa. 1, 15, 203 A.2d 796. In the case at bar, therefore, the issue of contribution depends upon the law of North Carolina, or whatever state is determined to have the most significant relationship with the occurrence that caused the injury. This portion of the setoff issue, therefore, is remanded for the trial court to apply the appropriate state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b6 76} Although neither party raised it as an issue, we take judicial notice of an error by the trial court. The trial court included an interrogatory to the jury asking what percentage of injury to plaintiff Thomas was a result of his employment at Duke Power. Because the jury determined that Duke Power was responsible for one-third of Thomas\u2019s asbestos-related injuries, the court initially reduced Thomas\u2019s award by one-third. The court subsequently increased Thomas\u2019s award to the total amount the jury ascribed to his pain and suffering and medical expenses and eliminated the one-third reduction attributable to a different employer. In its nunc pro tunc entry of July 3, 2003, however, made effective November 22, 2002, the court again reduced the amount by one-third. This reduction was an error because no actual settlement with Duke Power existed at the time of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b6 77} The statutory language of FELA does not support future or anticipatory setoffs for amounts that might be received in the future by the workers from nonrailroad sources. The United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Ayers, </em>supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArH\">The statutory language, however, supports the trial court\u2019s understanding that the FELA does not authorize apportionment of damages between railroad and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>nonrailroad causes. Section 1 of the Act, to which we earlier referred, see supra, at 144-146 [123 S.Ct. 1210,155 L.Ed.2d 261], provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">\u201cEvery common carrier by railroad while engaging in [interstate commerce], shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce * * * for such injury * * * resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of * * * such carrier * * *.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Id., 538 U.S. at 159-160, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 78} Further, the <em>Ayers </em>court found: \u201cNothing in the statutory text instructs that the amount of damages payable by a liable employer bears reduction when the negligence of a third party also contributed in part to the injury-in-suit.\u201d Id. at 160, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261. See, also, <em>Hess, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 79} In very strong language, the United States Supreme Court stated that the railroad\u2019s argument that Section 1 requires apportionment \u201cwould put that provision in tension with the rest of the statute.\u201d 538 U.S. at 161, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261. The court acknowledged, however, that \u201cthe Act expressly directs apportionment of responsibility between employer and employee based on comparative fault.\u201d But the court immediately went on to caution: \u201cThe statute expressly provides no other apportionment.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">{\u00b6 80} \u201c[T]o narrow employer liability without a textual warrant,\u201d the court emphatically declared, was \u201cinconsistent with the Act\u2019s overall recovery facilitating thrust.\u201d Thus the court found the railroad\u2019s plea \u201can untenable reading of the congressional silence.\u201d Id. at 161, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261. The court also observed that in a century of FELA jurisprudence, \u201c[n]o FELA decision made by this Court so much as hints that the statute mandates apportionment of damages among potentially liable tortfeasors.\u201d Id. at 161, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">{\u00b6 81} In the case at bar, the trial court was asked to apportion damages between two employers. <em>Ayers </em>clearly held that FELA admits apportionment between an employer and employee based on comparative fault, but not, however, between employers. In fact, <em>Ayers </em>expressly held that \u201creading the FELA to require apportionment would handicap plaintiffs and could vastly complicate adjudications, all the more so if, as Norfolk sometimes suggests, * * * manufacturers and suppliers, as well as other employers, should come within the apportionment pool.\u201d Id., 538 U.S. at 165, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261. The court concluded, therefore, that \u201c[u]nder the FELA, an employee who suffers an \u2018injury\u2019 caused \u2018in whole or in part\u2019 by a railroad\u2019s negligence may recover his or her <em>full damages from the railroad, regardless of whether the injury was also caused \u2018in part\u2019 by the actions of a third party.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at 165-166, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261. The court clearly held that \u201c[n]othing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the statutory text instructs that the amount of damages payable by a liable employer bears reduction when the negligence of a third party also contributed in part to the injury-in-suit.\u201d Id. at 160,123 S.Ct. 1210,155 L.Ed.2d 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 82} The trial court erred, therefore, when it reduced one-third of the award to Thomas for the percentage of injury he incurred while working at Duke Power. The court is ordered, therefore, to reinstate Thomas\u2019s full $64,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 83} The trial court is further ordered to determine whether the appropriate state law permits any setoff and to apply that law to the prior settlement Seaford and Thomas reached with the asbestos manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 84} The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b441-9\">Timothy E.

Additionally, defendant's expert Dr. Weir testified that there was no evidence of any railroad worker having an asbestos-related claim in the United States until the late 1970s.

He could report only on what was in the American Association of Railroads' records, and those records were limited to what the railroad had reported to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b436-13\">. {\u00b6 a} The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-14\">{lib} Considering the dissents' readiness to \"develop a federal common law\u201d to contain jury verdicts under the FELA, <em>see post, </em>at 5, 11-12, 16 [538 U.S. 135, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261] (Kennedy, L); <em>post, </em>at 6 [538 U.S. 135, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261] (Breyer, L), it is curious that the principal dissent nevertheless questions the \"basis in our FELA jurisprudence\u201d for the requirement that claimants prove their alleged fear to be \"genuine and serious,\u201d see <em>post, </em>at 15 [538 U.S. 135, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261] (internal quotation marks omitted). In contrast to the principal dissent, Justice Breyer appears ultimately to advance only an elaboration of the requirement that the plaintiff prove fear that is \"genuine and serious.\u201d He would specify, additionally, that the fear \"significantly and detrimentally affec[t] the plaintiff's ability to carry on with everyday life and work.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 6 [538 U.S. 135, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261], That elaboration, Justice Breyer maintains, is \"consistent with the sense of the common law.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The definition Justice Breyer would give to the terms \"genuine and serious\u201d in this context was not aired in the trial court or in this Court.

I write separately to address some areas of particular concern to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">{\u00b6 86} First, I believe that the common pleas court abused its discretion by denying the motion to dismiss on grounds of forum non conveniens. The doctrine of forum non conveniens, \u201cwhich allows a court having proper jurisdiction to dismiss an action when to do so would further the ends of justice and promote the convenience of the parties, [is] an inherent power of the trial court, resting within its sound discretion.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Merrell-Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 123, 125, 519 N.E.2d 370. The criteria the court should consider are generally divided into the private interests of the litigants and the public interest of the courts and citizens of the forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">{\u00b6 87} \u201cImportant private interests include: \u2018the relative ease of access to sources of proof; availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling, and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing, witnesses; possibility of view of premises, if view would be appropriate to the action; and all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive. There may also be questions as to the enforceability of a judgment if one is obtained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chambers, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 126-127, 519 N.E.2d 370, quoting <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert </em>(1947), 330 U.S. 501, 508, 67 S.Ct. 839, 91 L.Ed. 1055. Although \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 choice of forum should rarely be disturbed,\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>330 U.S. at 508, 67 S.Ct. 839, 91 L.Ed. 1055, particularly when the plaintiff has chosen his home forum, \u201c[b]ecause the central purpose of any forum non conveniens inquiry is to ensure that the trial is convenient, a foreign plaintiffs choice deserves less deference.\u201d <em>Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno </em>(1981), 454 U.S. 235, 256, 102 S.Ct. 252, 70 L.Ed.2d 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">{\u00b6 88} In this case, although depositions of treating doctors had to be taken in North Carolina and medical records had to be sought from there, none of the corporate records were located in North Carolina, and all of appellant\u2019s own witnesses were from Ohio and Texas. It does not appear that the convenience of the parties and witnesses could be better served in one forum than another.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">{\u00b6 89} \u201cPublic interest factors to be considered include the administrative difficulties and delay to other litigants caused by congested court calendars, the imposition of jury duty upon the citizens of a community which has very little relation to the litigation, a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home, and the appropriateness of litigating a case in a forum familiar with the applicable law.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 127, 519 N.E.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 90} While the Ohio courts are undoubtedly extremely familiar with asbestos litigation under the FELA, the connection between this litigation and Ohio is otherwise extremely tenuous, based only on the fact that Norfolk Southern does business here. The efficiency of conducting all asbestos litigation in a few fora that have become experts in such matters should not override the general interest in deciding local controversies locally. Our federal system was not designed for efficiency, but for maximum local autonomy. Making Ohio bear the burden of conducting asbestos litigation from other states simply because it is familiar with this type of litigation is unfair. Therefore, I would find that the court abused its discretion by overruling the motion to dismiss on grounds of forum non conveniens.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">{\u00b6 91} However, dismissal is not an appropriate remedy at this juncture. If we vacated the judgment and dismissed the case at this point, we would erase the results of a lengthy proceeding. That result would not remedy the harm appellant has already suffered because of the increased cost and inconvenience of litigating here. Therefore, although I believe that the denial of appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss was an abuse of discretion, I would not reverse on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">{\u00b6 92} Second, I must disagree with the majority\u2019s determination that the common pleas court should not have allowed the jury to consider appellees\u2019 claim for fear of developing cancer. The majority concludes that his \u201cworry\u201d and his family\u2019s \u201cconcern\u201d that he would develop cancer is not the equivalent of \u201cserious fear.\u201d Such a position rewards plaintiffs who can express their fears dramatically, while penalizing the stoic. \u201cWorry,\u201d \u201cconcern,\u201d and \u201cfear\u201d are all synonyms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>See New American Roget\u2019s College Thesaurus (1985) 638 (\u201cWorry, <em>n. </em>care, anxiety, mental anguish, uneasiness, fear, apprehension; concern, misgiving\u201d). One would not \u201cworry\u201d or be \u201cconcerned\u201d if one were not afraid.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">{\u00b6 93} It is incumbent on the claimant to prove that his fear is \u201cgenuine and serious,\u201d <em>Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. Ayers </em>(2003), 538 U.S. 135, 157, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261, but this does not mean that the fear must be debilitating, as the majority apparently suggests. Rather, I would construe the phrase \u201cgenuine and serious\u201d to mean that fear of cancer is compensable if it is real and fact-based. Here, Seaford testified that his doctors told him that he had an increased risk of developing cancer, that he worried about it, and that his family was concerned. In my view, this testimony was sufficient to support the court\u2019s decision to allow this issue to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">{\u00b6 94} Finally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to remand this matter for further proceedings with respect to the question whether the settlements appellees actually received from the asbestos manufacturers should be set off against the judgment in this case. A railroad is liable for the whole injury suffered by an employee under the FELA, and that liability is not subject to apportionment. <em>Ayers, </em>538 U.S. at 159-60, 123 S.Ct. 1210, 155 L.Ed.2d 261. However, if the employee has actually recovered some of the damages from another source, the amount of the uncompensated damages actually suffered by the employee has been reduced. To compensate the employee for the entire loss would result in a windfall. See <em>Schadel v. Iowa Interstate RR., Ltd. </em>(C.A.7, 2004), 381 F.3d 671 (judgment against a railroad on a claim under the FELA was properly reduced by the amount of a settlement of a claim against another tortfeasor).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">{\u00b6 95} <em>Schadel </em>makes clear that federal, not state, common law governs the question whether a setoff should be permitted and that the federal rule requires a pro tanto reduction of the judgment by the amount of a settlement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would affirm the common pleas court\u2019s judgment, but would remand for the common pleas court to reduce the amount of damages awarded to appellees by the amount of the settlements received by the appellees from the asbestos manufacturers.</p>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b443-8\">. If the law of North Carolina does apply, that would be a further reason for hearing the matter in North Carolina.
