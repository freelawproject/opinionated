Vetter, appeal from a judgment sustaining a motion for a protective order and a motion to compel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>discovery by defendant-appellee, Richard P. Swenson, in this personal injury action arising out of an automobile accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 2} The trial court determined that Swenson was the tortfeasor in an auto accident that injured appellants. The parties conducted discovery on the issue of damages, but matters came to a standstill after appellee, pursuant to Civ.R. 35(A), moved to compel appellants to undergo an independent medical examination (\u201cIME\u201d) by the physician of appellee\u2019s choice. Appellants moved for a Civ.R. 26(C)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> protective order that would set the manner, conditions, and scope of the IME, proposing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">(1) The defense medical examination will go forward on a date and time convenient to the person to be examined and the doctor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">(2) Plaintiff will be accompanied by his/her attorney or other legal representative as permitted[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">(3) The examination may be audio taped by Plaintiffs representative;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">(4) No other persons other than plaintiff, his/her representative and a same sex staff person will be allowed to be present during the examination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">(5) The examination must be limited to Plaintiffs medical conditions which are claimed by the Plaintiff to be causally or historically related to the incident referenced in Plaintiffs complaint delineated by the moving party in written form, and within the expertise of the physician;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\">(6) That the Plaintiff not be forced to travel outside the forum to appear for the medical examination without a showing of good cause by the Defendant^]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-12\">(7) The Defendant is required to tender to the Plaintiff reimbursement for travel and expenses for traveling to and from the examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>{\u00b6 3} In response, appellee moved for a protective order requesting that the court prevent a third party from attending appellants\u2019 IME and prevent appellants from making an audiotape or videotape of the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 4} On June 25, 2004, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion to compel appellants to undergo the IME and overruled appellants\u2019 motion for a protective order. The court specifically mentioned appellants\u2019 requested conditions for the IME in its outline of the parties\u2019 arguments. In disposing of the motions, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">This action sounding in negligence and personal injury is certainly one whereby the physical condition of a party, namely Plaintiffs, is at issue. Defendant must be afforded the opportunity to subject Plaintiffs to an independent physical examination in order to establish damages. The Court finds no reasonable basis for precluding Defendants from having the opportunity to require Plaintiff to submit to an independent medical examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">If Plaintiffs feel that Dr. Hauser is not impartial, they are free to obtain the services of another doctor to perform an additional IME. Plaintiffs are also free to impeach Dr. Hauser\u2019s credibility [if] they so wish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 5} Thus, the court ordered appellants to attend an IME at a specific date and time and stated that, if appellants fail to comply, the court would issue sanctions pursuant to Civ.R. 37(B)(2) and/or 41(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">{\u00b6 6} On July 17, 2004, the court entered a second order, entitled \u201cDecision and Entry Sustaining Defendant\u2019s Motion for Protective Order, Filed June 7, 2004; and Decision and Entry Sustaining Defendant\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery, Filed June 7, 2004.\u201d In this entry, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">In his Motion for a Protective Order, Swenson argues that any third-party should be banned from Plaintiffs\u2019 IMEs and that the examinations should not be recorded, nor notes taken. Swenson objects to [Plaintiffs\u2019] counsel being present at the examination. Plaintiffs respond by listing seven requirements for an IME, including, <em>inter alia, </em>that Plaintiffs should be accompanied by counsel, and that the examinations be recorded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-11\">The Court hereby SUSTAINS Swenson\u2019s Motion for a Protective Order, and OVERRULES Plaintiffs\u2019 seven conditions in their entirety. Plaintiffs will cooperate with the requirements of the examining physician. If Plaintiffs fail to cooperate fully, they will suffer the sanction of the Court refusing to allow Plaintiffs \u201cto support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting [them] from introducing designated matters in evidence.\u201d Civil Rule 47(B)(2)(b). Said sanction is well within the authority of this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">{\u00b6 7} Appellants now appeal from the July 17, 2004 order, assigning the following as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>I. The trial court erred in denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for protective order and therein requiring plaintiffs to attend medical examinations absent compliance with Civil Rule 35.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">II. The trial court erred in granting defendant Swenson\u2019s motion for protective order prohibiting any third party from attending medical examinations of plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b6 8} As a preliminary matter, appellee has asserted that the order appealed from does not constitute a final appealable order, and therefore dismissal of this appeal is required. For the following reasons, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 9} This court has recently held that an order granting a motion for an IME is a final appealable order. In <em>Kinsey v. Erie Ins. Group, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-51, 2004-Ohio-579, 2004 WL 239894, we addressed a similar case in which a defendant moved to compel an IME of an injured plaintiff. Following the tripartite test set forth in <em>State v. Muncie </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 440, 446, 746 N.E.2d 1092, for determining whether an order is a final order, we stated, at \u00b6 11-14:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">The order at issue grants a provisional remedy. As used in R.C. 2505.02, a \u201cprovisional remedy\u201d is defined as \u201ca proceeding ancillary to an action, <em>including, but not limited to, </em>a proceeding for a preliminary injunction, attachment, discovery of privileged matter, or suppression of evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2505.02(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Ohio Supreme Court in <em>[State v. Muncie </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 440], at 448, 746 N.E.2d 1092, noted that the phrase \u201cincluding, but not limited to\u201d precedes a nonexhaustive list of examples. * * * In other words, the list is illustrative and not exhaustive in view of the not limited to language included in the definition. * * * We find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>discovery pursuant to a Civ.R. 35(A) medical examination is a provisional remedy ancillary to an underlying action, even though a proceeding regarding a compelled medical examination is not expressly enumerated in R.C. 2505.02(A)(3). * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">In this case, the order determines the action with respect to the provisional remedy and prevents a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs with respect to the provisional remedy. The trial court\u2019s ruling on [defendant]^ Civ.R. 35(A) motion to compel an independent medical examination of [plaintiff] determines the action with respect to the motion and prevents judgment for plaintiffs with respect to the motion. The second part of the three-part test is met because the order for a medical examination meets the requirement of R.C. 2505.02(B)(4)(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">The requirement of R.C. 2505.02(B)(4)(b) is also met in this case. \u201c[A]n order arising from a provisional remedy is not a final order unless \u2018the appealing party would not be afforded a meaningful or effective remedy by an appeal following final judgment as to all proceedings, issues, claims, and parties in the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Muncie, </em>at 451, 746 N.E.2d 1092, quoting R.C. 2505.02(B)(4)(b). * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">* * * In the case at bar, the Civ.R. 35(A) order did not specify the scope of the examination. Such an order presents the danger of an unjust invasion of privacy that an appellate court would be unable to remedy in an appeal taken after final judgment. Accordingly, we conclude that because the trial court\u2019s Civ.R. 35(A) order did not specify the scope of the medical examination, R.C. 2505.02(B)(4)(b) is satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 10} Following this analysis, it is clear that the trial court\u2019s first order, dated June 25, 2004, by which the court granted appellee\u2019s motion to compel an IME, was a final appealable order. However, that is not the order from which appellants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">{\u00b6 11} Appellants have appealed from the court\u2019s second order, dated July 19, 2004, in which the court ordered that appellants\u2019 attorney should not be permitted to attend the IME, nor should the IME be recorded or notes be taken. Appellants do not dispute that appellee is entitled to an IME in preparing for trial pursuant to Civ.R. 35.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, appellants argue that the court should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ordered the scope and conditions of the IME to include an opportunity for appellants to have their attorney present and/or record the examination. Appellants assert that the order from which this appeal is taken specifically served to prohibit them from having a third party present for the examination and, therefore, that it was this order that resulted in the necessity of seeking a remedy on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 12} Following the same analysis utilized in <em>Kinsey, </em>this second order is not a final appealable order. We agree that the order arguably provides a provisional remedy because, as appellants allege, the lack of a third party at the exam could lead to discovery of privileged matter; therefore, the first prong of the <em>Muncie </em>test is satisfied. In addition, the order determines the action with regard to the provisional remedy in that it rules on a motion to compel and a motion for a protective order and threatens appellants with sanctions if appellants do not comply. Therefore, the order meets the second requirement of the <em>Muncie </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 13} But the order does not meet the third requirement of the <em>Muncie </em>test, in that appellants have not shown that the order precludes a meaningful, effective remedy by appeal following final judgment. As the trial court indicated in its earlier order, appellants could always obtain an IME from their own choice of physician and present that physician\u2019s report or testimony as contradictory evidence. In addition, appellants could present impeaching evidence supporting their contention that appellee\u2019s physician is regularly engaged by insurers and other defendants in auto accident cases and that his opinion is biased. As the court suggested, the trier of fact must weigh the credibility of this evidence, and appellants\u2019 objections to this particular physician go to his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 14} Moreover, appellants have failed to articulate a compelling argument that information arising from an unsupervised IME could prejudice their case. But even if, during the exam, appellants revealed to the physician information that is not pertinent, invades appellants\u2019 privacy, or prejudices their case, appellants could file a motion in limine to exclude the evidence, object to its introduction at trial, and, upon an adverse ruling, appeal after final judgment. See, e.g., <em>Krotine v. Neer, </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-121, 2002-Ohio-7019, 2002 WL 31838301, at \u00b6 10-17; <em>Henderson v. Henderson, </em>150 Ohio App.3d 339, 2002-Ohio-6496, 780 N.E.2d 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 15} Appellants maintain that the court\u2019s order failed to set out the scope and conditions of the IME, thus exposing them to the danger that privileged information will be revealed. However, reading the two orders in conjunction with one another, we find the court did set conditions and indicate the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>the IME; they just were not the conditions that appellants wanted. Thus, even though in <em>Kinsey </em>we stated that an order without appropriate limitations \u201cpresents the danger of an unjust invasion of privacy that an appellate court would be unable to remedy in an appeal taken after final judgment,\u201d in this case, the court used its discretion to set what it considered to be appropriate limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>State ex rel. Lambdin v. Brenton </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St.2d 21, 50 O.O.2d 44, 254 N.E.2d 681, the Ohio Supreme Court addressed whether a court may compel a plaintiff to submit to a physical examination by defendant\u2019s doctors in the absence of plaintiffs attorney. Although raised in the context of an action seeking a writ of prohibition, the court\u2019s pronouncement is nevertheless apt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akk\">[T]his is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. * * * If the court determined that the presence of relator\u2019s counsel would unduly impede defendant\u2019s physicians in making their examination, it had the power to order the exclusion of the attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Id. at 22, 50 O.O.2d 44, 254 N.E.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 17} Indeed, in addressing discovery orders, this court\u2019s standard of review is whether the trial court abused its discretion in rendering a decision that was arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. See <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. In this case, the trial court used its discretion in concluding that appellants would not suffer irreparable harm by undergoing the IME without their counsel being present and set the conditions and scope of the IME accordingly. Appellants have failed to show that the court\u2019s order met the third prong of the <em>Muncie </em>test, in that appellants have not shown that the court\u2019s order precluded them from obtaining a meaningful or effective remedy by appeal following final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 18} This court has jurisdiction to hear appeals only from final orders and judgments. Because the trial court\u2019s order sustaining appellee\u2019s motions for protective order and to compel discovery is an interlocutory, preliminary ruling that does not meet the requirements of R.C. 2505.02, it is not a final order, and this court has no jurisdiction to review that decision. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed for lack of a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-10\">Petree and McCormac, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b572-11\">McCormac, J., retired of the Tenth Appellate District, assigned to active duty under authority of Section 6(C), Article IV, Ohio Constitution.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-13\">.
