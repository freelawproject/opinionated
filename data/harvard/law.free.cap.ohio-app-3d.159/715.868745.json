Because we conclude that the sole assignment of error is not well taken, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In 2000, Phillip Beer filed a lawsuit in Ohio against Cincinnati Machines, Inc., Mohawk Machinery, Inc., and In Motion, Inc., seeking damages for injuries he suffered while performing work for In Motion at premises owned and/or operated by Cincinnati Machines and Mohawk Machinery. WGSIF, which provided In Motion\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation coverage, sought to intervene in the action as a matter of right, asserting that it had an interest in the action because it had paid approximately $280,000 in compensation benefits to Beer. The trial court denied WGSIF\u2019s motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">{\u00b6 3} In its sole assignment of error, WGSIF asserts that the trial court erred in denying its motion to intervene because WGSIF had a right to intervene pursuant to Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. 342.700.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">{\u00b6 4} Civ.R. 24(A)(2) provides: \u201cUpon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action * * * when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant\u2019s ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant\u2019s interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\u201d The applicant\u2019s interest in the action must be a \u201clegally protectable\u201d interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">{\u00b6 5} In order to determine whether WGSIF had a legally protectable interest in Beer\u2019s lawsuit, we must first determine which state\u2019s law \u2014 Ohio\u2019s or Kentucky\u2019s \u2014 should apply. The Fourth Appellate District has stated that the issue of subrogation should be determined by the law of the state where the workers\u2019 compensation coverage exists.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But we agree with the Tenth Appellate District that the existence of one state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation coverage should not automatically determine the choice of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We look to the analysis set out by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Morgan v. Biro Mfg. Co., Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court stated that \u201ca presumption is created that the law of the place of the injury controls unless another jurisdiction has a more significant relationship to the lawsuit.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To determine which state has the more significant relationship, a court should consider factors including \u201c(1) the place of the injury; (2) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred; (3) the domicile, residence, nationality, place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>of incorporation, and place of business of the parties; [and] (4) the place where the relationship between the parties, if any, is located.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">{\u00b6 6} Applying <em>Morgan </em>to the case before us, we conclude that Ohio has the more significant relationship to this lawsuit. Beer alleged that his injury occurred in Ohio. Beer is a resident of Ohio, and Cincinnati Machines and Mohawk Machinery are based in Ohio. The only Kentucky contacts are Beer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation coverage through WGSIF and Beer\u2019s former employer, In Motion, Inc. Accordingly, we look to Ohio law to determine whether Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. 342.700 gives WGSIF a legally protectable interest in the Ohio action.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">{\u00b6 7} In <em>Holeton v. Crouse Cartage Co., </em>the Ohio Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation subrogation statute, R.C. 4123.931.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court concluded that although a workers\u2019 compensation subrogation statute was not per se unconstitutional, R.C. 4123.931 violated Sections 2, 16, and 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. The court\u2019s analysis focused on two sections of the statute. R.C. 4123.931(A), which gave a statutory subrogee a right of subrogation with respect to \u201cestimated future values of compensation and medical benefits\u201d could, in the court\u2019s view, result in an unconstitutional taking where \u201cthe amount of reimbursement for \u2018estimated future values of compensation and medical benefits\u2019 proves to be substantially greater than the subrogee\u2019s eventual compensation outlay.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">{\u00b6 8} The court also concluded that R.C. 4123.931(D) violated the Equal Protection, Due Process, and Takings Clauses of the state constitution, because while it provided that a claimant who was successful in a jury trial could request interrogatories to quantify which part of the jury award was attributable to compensation and medical benefits, a claimant who settled was not afforded the same opportunity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">{\u00b6 9} After R.C. 4123.931 was ruled unconstitutional, the predecessor statute, R.C. 4123.93, became effective again. In <em>Modzelewski v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., </em>the Ohio Supreme Court reviewed R.C. 4123.93\u2019s constitutionality.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> R.C. 4123.93(D) provided, \u201cThe right of subrogation which inures to the benefit of the [subrogee] * * * is automatic and applies <em>only if the employee is a party to an </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number><em>action involving the third-party tortfeasor.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Like R.C. 4123.931, R.C. 4123.93 created a distinction between claimants. In this case, the distinction was between those claimants who instituted actions and those who did not. But the Supreme Court did not base its conclusion solely on that distinction. Rather, the court held that the statute was \u201cunconstitutional because it precludes claimants who are parties to actions against third-party tortfeasors from showing that their tort recovery or portions thereof do not duplicate their workers\u2019 compensation recovery and, therefore, do not represent a double recovery.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">{\u00b6 10} With guidance from <em>Holeton </em>and <em>Modzelewski, </em>we consider the Kentucky workers\u2019 compensation subrogation statute. Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. 342.700 provides, \u201cIf the injured employee elects to proceed at law by civil action against the other person to recover damages, he shall give due and timely notice to the employer and the special fund of the filing of the action.\u201d The requirement of notice to the employer and the special fund applies only to those claimants instigating a civil action. As with both versions of the Ohio statute reviewed by the Ohio Supreme Court, the Kentucky statute creates a distinction between claimants. The statute requires those claimants instituting civil actions to give notice to the employer and the fund, while a similar notice is not required of a claimant who settles prior to the instigation of a civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">{\u00b6 11} More troubling is that the Kentucky statute does not provide a means for a claimant who proceeds to trial against a tortfeasor to show that any damages recovered are not duplicative of any workers\u2019 compensation benefits received. In <em>Modzelewski, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court concluded that this failure violated the Ohio Constitution. Similarly, application of the Kentucky statute would violate Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">{\u00b6 12} Because application of the Kentucky statute would violate the Ohio Constitution, we conclude that WGSIF\u2019s interest was not a legally protectable one in Ohio. Accordingly, WGSIF did not meet the requirements for intervening as a matter of right. The trial court properly denied the motion to intervene. The assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b759-9\">Hildebrandt and Gorman, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-8\">. <em>State ex rel.
