Painter, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">{\u00b6 1} In both life and law, sometimes the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. And sometimes it is less. In the present case, it is exactly the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">{\u00b6 2} Third-party defendant-appellant Monfort Supply Company appeals the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">{\u00b6 3} This dispute centers on whether Monfort has the duty to defend and indemnify the third-party plaintiffs-appellees, Giovanni, Susanne, Leonardo, Eliza, Nicola, and Tracy Ranieri, in a dispute about a real-estate conveyance and a long-existing easement. The procedural complexity leading up to the current dispute belies the simplicity of the answer: when one party warrants that it will indemnify another \u201cagainst all claims of all persons\u201d and does not make any exceptions to that guarantee \u2014 well, we think the answer should be obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">\n<em>I. A Parcel, a Pipeline, and a Promise</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b181-15\">{\u00b6 4} Nearly 50 years ago \u2014 all the way back in 1955 \u2014 Monfort purchased a parcel of land from Norbert and Edna Frey, and the deed was properly recorded in Hamilton County. The Frey deed stated that the parcel was subject to an \u201ceasement for construction and maintenance of an oil pipeline to defendant Mid-Valley Pipeline Co., as recorded in Deed Book 2832, Page 38 of the Hamilton County Ohio Deed Records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-16\">{\u00b6 5} The pipeline was indeed under the land (it ran from Texas to Lima, Ohio), but the easement was not recorded in Deed Book 2832. It was actually in Deed Book 2382. The easement called for a 50-foot area surrounding the pipeline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>remain free from any obstruction so that Mid-Valley could obtain access to and repair the pipeline if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">{\u00b6 6} Monfort subdivided the land into smaller parcels suitable for single-family homes. In 1986, Monfort sold the lot involved in this case to the Ranieris. That deed warranted that the \u201ctitle so conveyed is Clear, Free and Unincumbered [sic]; And further, That [Monfort] does Warrant and will Defend the same against all claims of all persons whomsoever.\u201d The deed also described an easement for septic purposes, but did not contain any description of the pipeline easement. It also referred to a plat book, which, in turn, referred to an easement for a pipeline \u201cas recorded in D.B. 2832, PG 38.\u201d Again, the easement was actually in Deed Book 2382, not 2832.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">{\u00b6 7} In 2001, plaintiffs Gerald and Deborah Kohlbrand purchased the same plot from the Ranieris. Their deed made no mention of the pipeline easement. Soon after their purchase, the Kohlbrands discovered the pipeline easement. They sued the Ranieris and eventually sued Mid-Valley, alleging that fraudulent nondisclosure of the pipeline easement had resulted in damages. In response, the Ranieris filed a third-party complaint against Monfort, claiming that Monfort was obligated to indemnify and defend the Ranieris because of the general warranty contained in the deed to them. The Ranieris moved for, and were granted, summary judgment on this limited issue. The trial court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\n<em>II. Legalism at Its Lowest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">{\u00b6 8} Monfort now appeals, claiming in its sole assignment of error that summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">{\u00b6 9} We review summary-judgment determinations de novo, without deference to the trial court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriately granted when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can only come to a conclusion adverse to the nonmoving party when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">{\u00b6 10} The facts of this case are basically undisputed. While the issues of damages and attorneys\u2019 fees remain undecided, neither is before us in this appeal. All that concerns us is whether Monfort has a duty to defend and to indemnify the Ranieris in the underlying case. Monfort now argues that the deed referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>to the plat, which referred to the easement, which meant that the easement was incorporated by reference into the deed. Not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">{\u00b6 11} We decline to impose a rule that would require grantees to skip around the county recorder\u2019s office looking for any encumbrances that might exist on a prospective purchase where there is no mention of any encumbrance\u2014 and especially when there is a warranty <em>against </em>any encumbrance. Deeds subject to an easement should disclose the easement on the face of the deed. If Monfort had wanted to create an exception for the pipeline easement, it simply could have added \u201csubject to\u201d and referred to the easement in the general warranty section of the deed. But it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">{\u00b6 12} And even if the plat reference had been incorporated by reference, the reference to the easement in the plat was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\n<em>III. The Normans Strike Again</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">{\u00b6 13} Monfort contends, \u201cAlthough a \u2018clear title\u2019 is one that is not subject to any restrictions, the case at bar involved a \u2018free and clear\u2019 title, which is the same as a marketable title.\u201d So, according to Monfort, a free and clear title is worse than a clear title. Say what?</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">{\u00b6 14} Would that Harold had not lost the Battle of Hastings.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">{\u00b6 15} <em>Free </em>and <em>dear </em>mean the same thing. Using both is an unnecessary lawyerism. <em>Free </em>is English; <em>dear </em>is from the Old French <em>der. </em>After the Norman Conquest, English courts were held in French. The Normans were originally Vikings, but after they conquered the region of Normandy, they became French; then they took over England.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But most people in England, surprisingly enough, still spoke English. So lawyers started using two words for one and forgot to stop for the last 900 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">{\u00b6 16} So <em>free </em>and <em>dear </em>do not mean separate things; they mean, and were always meant to mean, <em>exadly the same thing. </em>Just as <em>null </em>and <em>void </em>and <em>due </em>and <em>payable </em>mean the same thing. All of these couplets are redundant and irritating lawyerisms. And they invite just what has happened here \u2014 an assertion that they somehow have different meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">{\u00b6 17} The Norman Conquest was in 1066. We can safely eliminate the couplets now.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">{\u00b6 18} And this case involved a \u201cclear, free and unincumbered\u201d title. Would Monfort argue that this, too, provides less protection than a clear title? Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cclear\u201d as \u201cfree from encumbrances and claims.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u201cincumbrance\u201d means the same thing as \u201cencumbrance,\u201d so we can deduce that \u201cunincumbered\u201d means the same thing as \u201cunencumbered.\u201d So it is only logical that \u201cclear, free and unencumbered\u201d is a mere redundancy for clear or for \u201cfree from encumbrance.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">{\u00b6 19} An easement for an oil pipeline is certainly an encumbrance. And any title that is subject to an easement is not a clear title. Despite its warranty to the contrary, Monfort did not actually convey the land \u201cfree, clear and unencumbered,\u201d and it therefore had a duty to indemnify and defend the Ranieris. Not only was summary judgment appropriate, but any other result would have stretched the bounds of legalese to ridiculous proportions.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">{\u00b6 20} If the answer\u2019s glaring simplicity were not enough, the Eighth Appellate District addressed a nearly identical case some 20 years ago in <em>Katana v. </em>Harbin,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There, an older deed had listed a sewer easement, but the newer deed did not. But the newer deed contained a general warranty that the land was free of encumbrances with exceptions for building, zoning, or other easements \u2014 but not for the sewer easement. The court held that the exception to the covenant in the newer deed \u201c \u2018should not be extended beyond the plain and ordinary meaning of its terms.\u2019 * * * Therefore, what is written on the face of the deed must control.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">{\u00b6 21} We could not agree more. What is written on the face of the Monfort deed is that the conveyance was unencumbered and that Monfort would defend the Ranieris against any claims to the contrary. The conveyance wasn\u2019t, and Monfort didn\u2019t. There are no genuine issues of material fact; there are no issues of fact whatsoever. This was a simple case of legal interpretation that any first-year law student should be able to answer: a \u201cfree, clear and unencumbered title\u201d is the same as a \u201cclear title.\u201d Monfort warranted, in the plainest of language, that the land was unencumbered and that it would defend the Ranieris against any claims to the contrary. Summary judgment was therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\n<em>IV. The Normans Conquer Lorain County</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">{\u00b6 22} Monfort cites <em>Zilka v. Cent. S. Ltd.,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a Ninth Appellate District case that distinguished a clear title from a free and clear title in much the same way that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Monfort now argues. \u201cIn short, while \u2018clear title\u2019 cannot have any encumbrance or restriction whatsoever, \u2018free and clear\u2019 title is a marketable title * * *.\u201d We are, thankfully, unable to find any case that has cited this aberration \u2014 the Norman invasion has not progressed any farther south in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">{\u00b6 23} We may consider <em>Zilka </em>and give it the weight that we consider appropriate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And we consider it inappropriate to give <em>Zilka </em>any weight at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">{\u00b6 24} The Normans and <em>Zilka </em>have also corrupted an Ohio real-estate treatise \u2014 namely, Baldwin\u2019s Ohio Real Estate Law. In the section defining \u201cmarketable title,\u201d the treatise states, \u201cTitle that is \u2018free and clear\u2019 is not the same as \u2018clear title.\u2019 Rather, \u2018free and clear title\u2019 means title that is unencumbered by any hens and is marketable.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It then cites <em>Zilka.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">{\u00b6 25} Before <em>Zilka, </em>we are sure that Baldwin\u2019s made no such claim. Another venerable Ohio treatise (published before <em>Zilka) </em>states it properly: \u201c[\u2018Clear title\u2019] usually refers not to the title itself but to the absence of liens or encumbrances against the real estate. The term typically appears in the following context: The seller agrees to convey to the purchaser marketable title, \u2018free and clear\u2019 of liens and encumbrances.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> So the sample used to define \u201cclear title\u201d used the term \u201cfree and clear\u201d title. But Monfort argues that they are two different things. Is it any wonder that lawyers get a bad rap?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">{\u00b6 26} Nine hundred years later, courts in Ohio are still dealing with the consequences of the Norman invasion. We can only hope that some day logic will prevail over silly tradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">{\u00b6 27} Since the trial court got it right, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-11\">Doan, P.J., and Sundermann, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-11\">.
