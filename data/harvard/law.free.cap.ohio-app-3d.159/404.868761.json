Christley, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">{\u00b6 1} Ronald Armentrout, Ronald\u2019s wife Elizabeth Armentrout, and Ronald\u2019s son Robert Armentrout appeal from the judgment of the Portage County Common Pleas Court that granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, the Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company, Ltd. (\u201cTokio\u201d), on appellants\u2019 declaratory judgment action. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">{\u00b6 2} The underlying facts of this case are not in dispute. Ronald was severely injured when the car he was driving was hit head-on by a car driven by Marvin Bolden. Bolden was drunk at the time of the accident. Donna Fresch owned the car Bolden was driving. Elizabeth leased the car Ronald was driving at the time of the collision from Don Joseph, Inc., with an assignment of the lease to Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (\u201cTMCC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">{\u00b6 3} The leased car driven by Ronald was owned by TMCC. TMCC carried a business automobile liability policy and a follow-form excess liability policy, each with liability limits of $1,000,000, issued by Tokio. Thus, appellants contended that they were insureds under these policies and made claims for uninsured/underinsured-motorists coverage against the Tokio policies. Tokio denied the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">{\u00b6 4} Appellants also filed suit against Bolden and Fresch in the Portage County Common Pleas Court. Appellants\u2019 claims against Bolden and Fresch were eventually settled with Tokio\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Appellants filed the instant case seeking a declaration that they were entitled to coverage under the Tokio policies. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted Tokio\u2019s motion. Appellants timely appealed, raising one assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting Appellee The Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Company, Ltd.\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Appellants\u2019 claims for underinsured motorist coverage under an automobile liability policy and follow-form excess liability policy issued by The Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Company, Ltd., and denying Appellants\u2019 cross motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">{\u00b6 7} For the following reasons we affirm. We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241, i.e., independently and without deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Lexford Prop. Mgmt., L.L.C. v. Lexford Prop. Mgmt., Inc. </em>(2001), 147 Ohio App.3d 312, 2001-Ohio-4363, 770 N.E.2d 603, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 8} Summary judgment is proper when (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co., Inc. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c[A] party seeking summary judgment, on the ground that the nonmoving party cannot prove its case, bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on the essential element(s) of the nonmoving party\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">{\u00b6 10} If the moving party has satisfied this initial burden, the nonmoving party has a reciprocal burden under Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Id. at 293, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">{\u00b6 11} Appellants\u2019 arguments are based on their belief that underinsuredmotorist coverage arose in the policies by operation of law, pursuant to <em>Linko v. Indemn. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 445, 2000-Ohio-92, 739 N.E.2d 338. This case turns on whether the pre-H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18 applies or the post-H.B. 261 version. 1997 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 261, 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2372.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>Ross v. Farmers Ins. Group. of Cos. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 281, 695 N.E.2d 732, the Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201cthe statutory law in effect at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>time of entering into a contract for automobile liability insurance controls the rights and duties of the contracting parties.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Wolfe v. Wolfe </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 246, 725 N.E.2d 261, the Ohio Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c1. Pursuant to R.C. 3937.31(A), every automobile liability insurance policy issued in this state must have, at a minimum, a guaranteed two-year policy period during which the policy cannot be altered except by agreement of the parties and in accordance with R.C. 3937.30 to 3937.39.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c2. The commencement of each policy period mandated by R.C. 3937.31(A) brings into existence a new contract of automobile insurance, whether the policy is categorized as a new policy of insurance or a renewal of an existing policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c3. The guarantee period mandated by R.C. 3937.31(A) is not limited solely to the first two years following the initial institution of coverage.\u201d Id. at paragraphs one, two, and three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">{\u00b6 17} The Tokio policies at issue were reissued December 5, 1997, with the policy renewal effective retroactive to October 1, 1997. The renewal was for a period of one year. Thus, the latest the policies could have been issued or last renewed for a two-year period was October 1,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">{\u00b6 18} H.B. 261 became effective on September 3,1997. If the policies at issue are \u201cautomobile liability insurance policies]\u201d as defined in R.C. 3937.30, the two-year guarantee period mandated by R.C. 3937.31(A) applies and the pre-H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18 is operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 3937.30 defines \u201cautomobile insurance policy\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cAs used in sections 3937.30 to 3937.39 of the Revised Code, \u2018automobile insurance policy\u2019 means an insurance policy delivered or issued in this state or covering a motor vehicle required to be registered in this state which:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(A) Provides automobile bodily injury or property damage liability, or related coverage, or any combination thereof;</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(B) Insures as named insured, any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(1) Any one person;</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(2) A husband and wife resident in the same household;</p>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(3) Either a husband or a wife who reside in the same household if an endorsement on the policy excludes the other spouse from coverage under the policy and the spouse excluded signs the endorsement. Nothing in this division (B)(3) shall prevent the issuance of separate policies to each spouse or affect the compliance of the policy with Chapter 4509. of the Revised Code as to the named insured or any additional insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>{\u00b6 26} \u201c(C) Insures only private passenger motor vehicles or other four-wheeled motor vehicles which are classified or rated as private passenger vehicles and are not used as public or private livery, or rental conveyances;</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(D) Does not insure more than four motor vehicles;</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(E) Does not cover garage, automobile sales agency, repair shop, service station, or public parking operation hazards;</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(F) Is not issued under an assigned risk plan pursuant to section 4509.70 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 30} The policies named Toyota Motor Credit Corporation and Toyota Motor Credit Receivables Corporation as insureds. These were the named insureds as listed on the policy before changes effected by the December 5, 1997 renewal. Appellants argue that any changes made to the policy by the December 5, 1997 renewal do not apply, i.e., the changes do not apply retroactively to October 1, 1997, because the accident giving rise to the claims occurred before the changes were contracted for on December 5, 1997. While we agree with appellants\u2019 position on this point, it does not change our analysis. When the policy was renewed December 5, 1997, an endorsement changed the named insureds to Toyota Motor Credit Corporation, Toyota Motor Credit Receivables Corporation, Toyota Lease Trust, and Toyota Leasing, Inc. Thus, the policy always listed more than one person as a named insured and it is irrelevant whether the December 5 endorsement applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">{\u00b6 31} While a corporation is a \u201cperson\u201d under Ohio law, R.C. 1.59(C), the policies at issue named more than one person as an insured, and these insureds were not husband and wife; therefore, the policies could not be \u201cautomobile insurance policies\u201d as defined in R.C. 3937.30 and the two-year guarantee period mandated by R.C. 3937.31(A) would not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">{\u00b6 32} The policies at issue were renewed effective October 1, 1997. H.B. 261 became effective September 3, 1997; thus, the post-H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18 applies. Even if December 5, 1997, were considered the effective date, the post-H.B. 261 version would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">{\u00b6 33} We now address appellants\u2019 argument that underinsured-motorist coverage applies by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">{\u00b6 34} The post-H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18(A) mandated the offer of underinsured-motorist coverage for any \u201cautomobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance.\u201d R.C. 3937.18(L) defined \u201cautomobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance\u201d as either of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(1) Any policy of insurance that serves as proof of financial responsibility, as proof of financial responsibility is defined by division (K) of section 4509.01 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>of the Revised Code, for owners or operators of the motor vehicles specifically identified in the policy of insurance;</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(2) Any umbrella liability policy of insurance written as excess over one or more policies described in division (L)(l) of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">{\u00b6 37} R.C. 4509.01(E) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c \u2018Proof of financial responsibility\u2019 means proof of ability to respond in damages for liability, on account of accidents occurring subsequent to the effective date of such proof, arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle in the amount of twelve thousand five hundred dollars because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident, in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident, and in the amount of seven thousand five hundred dollars because of injury to property of others in any one accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">{\u00b6 39} Ohio\u2019s financial responsibility laws, R.C. 4509 et seq., require the owner of a vehicle to maintain proof of financial responsibility. The applicable version of R.C. 4509.01(D) defined \u201cowner\u201d as the \u201cperson who holds the legal title of a motor vehicle. If a motor vehicle is the subject of an agreement for conditional sale or lease with the right of purchase upon performance of the conditions stated in the agreement and with an immediate right of possession vested in the conditional vendee or lessee, the vendee or lessee is the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 40} Here, Elizabeth was the lessee of the car Ronald was driving at the time of the accident. The lease provided Elizabeth with the right to buy the car at the end of the lease term; therefore, pursuant to R.C. 4509.01(D) she was the \u201cowner\u201d of the car. As a result, for purposes of financial responsibility compliance, neither Tokio nor TMCC had a duty to have or offer under/uninsured-motorist coverage on this leased vehicle. Per the definition of R.C. 4509.01(D), neither of these entities qualified as an \u201cowner.\u201d As a result, the policies issued by Tokio did not have to be construed as providing \u201cautomobile liability or motor vehicle liability policies] of insurance\u201d under the post-H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18; therefore, <em>Linko </em>did not apply, as Tokio was not required to offer TMCC underinsured-motorist coverage, and underinsured-motorist coverage did not arise by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">{\u00b6 41} Appellants\u2019 sole assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">{\u00b6 42} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Portage County Common Pleas Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-12\">Donald R. Ford, P.J., and Robert A. Nader, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b449-13\">Robert A. Nader, J., of the Ninth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
