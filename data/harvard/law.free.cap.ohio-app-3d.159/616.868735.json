Appellees provided the anesthesia during the operation. Satterfield was seriously injured as a result of a fire that occurred during the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">{\u00b6 3} Mrs. Satterfield and her husband, Clarence Satterfield, filed a medical-malpractice suit against appellant, appellees, and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and its employee, Dr. Charles Modlin (collectively referred to as \u201cCCF\u201d). Appellant later filed a cross-claim for contribution and indemnification against CCF and appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">{\u00b6 4} In July 2003, the Satterfields entered into a high-low settlement agreement with appellant. Under the terms of the agreement, appellant paid the Satterfields $500,000 and the Satterfields agreed that regardless of the outcome at trial, they would not execute a judgment against appellant exceeding an additional $500,000. On August 20, 2003, CCF settled all of the Satterfields\u2019 claims against CCF. The Satterfields dismissed their remaining claims on September 18, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">{\u00b6 5} After learning of the settlement, CCF and appellees filed motions for summary judgment on appellant\u2019s cross-claim. Next, appellant filed a motion for leave to amend its cross-claim, which the trial court initially granted. A few days later, CCF filed a motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s decision allowing appellant to file an amended cross-claim. On January 6, 2004, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>issued a judgment granting CCF\u2019s and Bel-Park\u2019s motions for summary judgment, granting CCF\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and denying appellant\u2019s motion for leave to amend its cross-claim. Appellant thereafter filed its timely notice of appeal. Appellant has since dismissed its appeal against CCF.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant raises two assignments of error, the first of which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in granting summary judgment in favor of the CCF and Bel-Park defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant argues that summary judgment was improper because genuine issues of material fact exist regarding its right to indemnification from appellees. Appellant contends that the Satterfields\u2019 claims against it were based on agency by estoppel. In other words, the Satterfields sought to hold appellant hable for the acts of those practicing in its hospital. The Satterfields, appellant claims, never established that it committed any independent acts of negligence. Therefore, appellant argues that because its alleged negligence was secondary to that of appellees, indemnification from appellees is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">{\u00b6 9} Furthermore, appellant contends that it asserted its right of indemnification in its cross-claim by asserting that if it \u201cshould be found liable by virtue of principles of vicarious liability or primary and secondary negligence,\u201d then it was entitled to indemnification by those who were primarily liable to the Satterfields. The trial court found that because appellant was never found vicariously liable for appellees\u2019 conduct, summary judgment was proper. However, appellant urges us to consider that it was found liable to the Satterfields. Appellant argues that the fact that the Satterfields settled with it demonstrates that the Satterfields considered appellant to be liable to them. It contends that a judicial determination of liability was not necessary for it to seek indemnification from appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">{\u00b6 10} In reviewing an award of summary judgment, appellate courts must apply a de novo standard of review. <em>Cole v. Am. Indus. &amp; Resources Corp. </em>(1998), 128 Ohio App.3d 546, 552, 715 N.E.2d 1179. Thus, we will apply the same test as the trial court in determining whether summary judgment was proper. Civ.R. 56(C) provides that the trial court shall render summary judgment if no genuine issue of material fact exists and when construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can only conclude that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>State ex rel. Parsons v. Fleming </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 509, 511, 628 N.E.2d 1377. Whether a fact is material depends on the substantive law of the claim being litigated. <em>Hoyt, Inc. v. Gordon &amp; Assoc., Inc. </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 598, 603, 662 N.E.2d 1088, citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 242, 247-248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The rule of indemnity provides that \u201cwhere a person is chargeable with another\u2019s wrongful act and pays damages to the injured party as a result thereof, he has a right of indemnity from the person committing the wrongful act, the party paying the damages being only secondarily liable; whereas, the person committing the wrongful act is primarily liable.\u201d <em>Travelers Indem. Co. v. Trowbridge </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 11, 14, 70 O.O.2d 6, 321 N.E.2d 787. When the indemnity at issue is implied, as it is here, one of the codefendants must be at fault in causing the plaintiffs injuries. <em>O\u2019Neill v. Showa Denko K.K. </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 345, 349, 655 N.E.2d 767. Without fault, there is no basis for indemnification. Id. This is so because \u201c \u2018one party must be \u201cchargeable\u201d for the wrongful act of another as a prerequisite for indemnity.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Convention Ctr. Inn, Ltd. v. Dow Chem. Co. </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 243, 247, 590 N.E.2d 898, 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant\u2019s cross-claim unambiguously states:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cDefendant says that <em>if it should be found liable </em>by virtue of principles of vicarious liability or primary and secondary negligence, that it is entitled to indemnity from such defendants who may be primarily liable to the plaintiffs.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">{\u00b6 14} Here, appellant was never found liable. Since there was a settlement, liability was never established. And the Satterfields dismissed all claims against all parties. Thus, appellant could not meet the term for indemnification that it included in its cross-claim. Similarly, in <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>101 Ohio App.3d 345, 655 N.E.2d 767, the Eighth District noted that because the appellant\u2019s cross-claim for indemnification was contingent upon a finding of liability and the case was settled before litigation, the appellant was barred from recovery by virtue of the cross-claim\u2019s language. The cross-claim included the language \u201c <em>\u2018If [the distributor] is found to be liable </em>to the Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018[the distributor] is entitled to complete indemnification * * * <em>to the extent of any judgment rendered in favor of Plaintiffs </em>against [the manufacturer] including its costs and attorney fees.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added by court of appeals.) Id. at 350, 655 N.E.2d 767. Appellant attempts to distinguish <em>O\u2019Neill </em>on the basis that it was a products-liability case in which the distributor, who did not pay a settlement, sought indemnification from the manufacturer for attorney fees and costs. However, the case is still similar to the present case because the court relied upon the language in the distributor\u2019s cross-claim against the manufacturer in determining that the distributor was not entitled to indemnification. This reasoning is applicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">{\u00b6 15} Additionally, the settlement agreement between the Satterfields and appellant provides that it \u201cis not a release of any claim, or portion thereof.\u201d Thus, by entering into the agreement with the Satterfields, appellant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>extinguish liability on appellees\u2019 part. When appellant entered into the agreement, appellees were still subject to full liability on the Satterfields\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">{\u00b6 16} The failure to extinguish liability with the high-low agreement distinguishes this ease from those cited by appellant, in which the defendants who settled were entitled to indemnification. See <em>Mills v. River Terminal Ry. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 2002), 276 F.3d 222; <em>Hope v. Continental W. Ins. Co. </em>(Sept. 29, 2000), 2d Dist. No. 18116, 2000 WL 1433876; <em>Globe Indemn. Co. v. Schmitt </em>(1944), 142 Ohio St. 595, 27 O.O. 525, 53 N.E.2d 790; <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(C.A.6 1974), 502 F.2d 138. In those cases, the defendants\u2019 settlement agreements extinguished the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. In this case, appellant\u2019s high-low agreement did not extinguish any claims against any defendants. Rather, appellant\u2019s high-low agreement merely limited its potential exposure to a monetary judgment. Therefore, since appellant did not settle any of the Satterfields\u2019 claims, it would be inequitable to allow indemnification since appellees still could have been held liable for their own conduct in this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">{\u00b6 17} Furthermore, appellant presented no evidence that appellees were primarily liable while it was only secondarily liable. \u201cIndemnification occurs when one who is primarily liable is required to reimburse another who has discharged a liability for which that other is only secondarily liable.\u201d <em>Krasny-Kaplan Corp. v. Flo-Tork, Inc. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 75, 78, 609 N.E.2d 152. In their complaint, the Satterfields alleged both that appellant was secondarily liable because of a principal/agent relationship with appellees and that it was primarily hable. They specifically alleged that the \u201ctreatment rendered by the Defendants [which includes appellant] fell below the acceptable standards practiced by other physicians and hospitals and medical personnel under like and similar circumstances.\u201d In the high-low settlement agreement, appellant does state that it continues to deny its direct liability. However, since appellant entered into the high-low agreement and the other parties settled too, there was never a determination that appellant was only secondarily liable and that appellees were primarily liable. Without such a determination, appellant is not entitled to indemnification from appellees. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">{\u00b6 18} For these reasons, the trial court appropriately granted summary judgment. Therefore, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe trial court erred in denying St. Elizabeth\u2019s motion for leave to amend its cross-claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">{\u00b6 21} Appellant sought to amend its cross-claim to assert contractual indemnity against CCF and remove its claim for contribution. It also sought to eliminate the language \u201cif it should be found liable by virtue of principles of vicarious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>liability or primary and secondary negligence, that it is entitled to indemnity from such defendants who may be primarily hable to the plaintiffs.\u201d In its motion to amend, appellant contended that it paid an amount to the Satterfields based upon its potential vicarious liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant contends that the court should have permitted it to amend its cross-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">{\u00b6 23} Because this assignment of error relates to adding a contractual indemnification claim, it is moot. Regardless of whether the amended cross-claim was admitted, the only indemnification claim against appellees was one of implied indemnification, which was contained in the original cross-claim. The contractual indemnification claim in the amended cross-claim was premised upon an agreement between appellant and CCF, to which appellees were not parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">{\u00b6 24} The grant or denial of a motion to amend a pleading is within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Turner v. Cent. Local School Dist. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 95, 99, 706 N.E.2d 1261. Thus, we may reverse such a decision only if the trial court abuses that discretion. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the trial court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. \u201c[W]here it is possible that the plaintiff, by an amended complaint, may set forth a claim upon which relief can be granted, and it is tendered timely and in good faith and no reason is apparent or disclosed for denying leave, the denial of leave to file such amended complaint is an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Peterson v. Teodosio </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 161, 175, 63 O.O.2d 262, 297 N.E.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">{\u00b6 25} Civ.R. 15(A) governs the amendment of pleadings and provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA party may amend his pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted and the action has not been placed upon the trial calendar, he may so amend it at any time within twenty-eight days after it is served. Otherwise a party may amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party. Leave of court shall be freely given when justice so requires. A party shall plead in response to an amended pleading within the time remaining for response to the original pleading or within fourteen days after service of the amended pleading, whichever period may be the longer, unless the court otherwise orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">{\u00b6 27} The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to amend. Appellant\u2019s motion was untimely. Appellant entered into its high-low agreement on July 7, 2003. It did not file its motion to amend until October 2, 2003. Had appellant believed that entering into the agreement required it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>change the wording in its cross-claim, it should not have taken three months to do so. Instead, appellant waited to amend its cross-claim until after both appellees and CCF had filed their motions for summary judgment. Appellees and CCF pointed out in their motions the shortcomings of appellant\u2019s cross-claim. It seems that appellant sought to amend its cross-claim in an attempt to avoid summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">{\u00b6 28} Furthermore, the trial was set for August 25, 2003. The trial was set to go forward based on appellant\u2019s original cross-claim. Had CCF and appellees not filed motions for leave to file summary judgment motions on the eve of trial, the case would have proceeded on appellant\u2019s original cross-claim. Up to the day before trial, appellant had not filed a motion to amend. Again, this fact points to the untimeliness of appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">{\u00b6 29} For these reasons, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to amend its cross-claim. Thus, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 30} Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s judgment is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b663-8\">Vukovich and Waite, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
