On appeal, defendant advances multiple challenges to his sentence, none of which was preserved below. We reject each of defendant\u2019s challenges to his sentence and write only to address defendant\u2019s challenges under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Defendant first argues that, under <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi, </em>the trial court erred in imposing an upward departure sentence based on facts that were neither admitted by defendant nor found by a jury. Although defendant did not advance such a challenge below, he argues that the departure sentence should be reviewed as plain error. The Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of that argument under similar circumstances in <em>State v. Gornick, </em>340 Or 160, 130 P3d 780 (2006), is controlling. Second, defendant argues that the trial court violated the principles articulated in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>by denying him consideration for leave, release, and program options under ORS 137.750. He concedes that he did not advance that challenge below either, but argues that the trial court\u2019s denial should be reviewed as plain error. Our decision in <em>State v. Vigil, </em>197 Or App 407, 106 P3d 656, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>199 Or App 525, 112 P3d 441, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 156 (2005), is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
