The circuit court denied the MNCPPC petition for an injunction and, thereby, permitted the Washington National Arena (WNA), a limited partnership, to pursue a tax assessment appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">MNCPPC and the County seek a reversal of the order. The State of Maryland, invokes a two-pronged attack. First, the State asserts that it was error for the trial court to deny the State the right to intervene in the proceeding and, second, that the trial court was incorrect in its decision on the merits. The State suggested on oral argument that we decide both issues in their favor. Such an arrangement would place the State in the position of having the merits of the appeal adjudicated without the necessity of ever having had their case heard on the merits in the trial court. Were we to follow the State\u2019s suggestion, we would, in effect, have to close our eyes to Md. Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>That the State has a right to appeal from a <em>denial </em>of a motion to intervene is no longer open to doubt. <em>Citizens Coordinating Comm, on Friendship Heights, Inc. v. TKU Associates, </em>276 Md. 705, A. 2d (1976); <em>See also Nat\u2019l 4-H Club Found, of America v. Thorpe, </em>22 Md. App. 1, 9, 321 A. 2d 321, 326 (1974);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Md. Rule 208. If the State was a necessary party to the declaratory judgment action between MNCPPC and WNA, but was wrongfully denied intervention in the case, the decision on the merits of the matter before us is rendered nugatory, and we shall be required to reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The threshold question then is, was the State erroneously denied the right to intervene In the declaratory judgment action?</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In the case <em>subjudice, </em>the \u201cPetition for Declaratory Judgment and Injunction\u201d was brought by MNCPPC to secure a ruling on a contractual obligation of WNA arising from a lease. The answer of WNA manifests that, in the view of the respondent, a clause of the lease, which is the actual \u201cbone of contention,\u201d is violative of WNA\u2019s \u201c. . . constitutional rights of equal protection and due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The lease clause sought to be enforced by MNCPPC, and vigorously opposed by WNA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">\u201cLessee [WNA by assignment] further agrees that it will not contest or challenge any determination by the State Assessor that the real estate improvements are subject to real estate taxes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">When the State Assessor made his determination, WNA appealed to the Property Tax Assessment Appeal Board for Prince George\u2019s County. MNCPPC alleged in its petition for declaratory judgment that WNA\u2019s appeal to the Appeal Board constituted a breaeh of the above quoted clause of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Because the government of Prince George\u2019s County believed, among other reasons, that it had \u201c... a pecuniary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>interest in the . . . matter and an adverse decision . . . would cause substantial loss of tax revenue to . . . [the] County,\u201d it petitioned to intervene. The State of Maryland also petitioned to intervene alleging \u201cThat the State of Maryland has a substantial interest in the subject matter of this suit by virtue of the effect the Court\u2019s decision may have on the State\u2019s right to certain real estate taxes.\u201d Both petitions were heard immediately prior to the argument of the case on its merits. The County\u2019s petition to intervene was granted. The State\u2019s petition was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Md. Ann. Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 3-405 (a) (1) mandates that, \u201cIf declaratory relief is sought, a person who has or claims any interest which would be affected by the declaration, shall be made a party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Williams v. Moore, </em>215 Md. 181, 137 A. 2d 193 (1957), said the above quoted portion of what is now Courts Art. \u00a7 3-405 (a) (1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had been interpreted many times, and that, \u201cIt may be stated as a general rule that ordinarily, in an action for a declaratory judgment, all persons interested in the declaration are necessary parties.\u201d 215 Md. at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Inasmuch as real estate taxes, payable not only to a political subdivision, but also to the State were involved in the instant litigation, it goes without saying that the State had a financial interest in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Md. Rule 208, governs intervention. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">\u201ca. <em>Of Right.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">Upon timely application a person shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (a) when the representation of the applicant\u2019s interest by existing parties is or may be inadequate and the applicant is or may be bound by a judgment in the action . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Judge Levine, writing for the Court of Appeals in <em>Citizens Coordinating Comm, on Friendship Heights, Inc. v. TKU Associates, supra, </em>discussed Rule 208 and the applicable law with respect to the right to intervene in an action pending in a trial court. The <em>Citizens </em>opinion was grounded on federal appellate decisions, largely because there is a dearth of Maryland case law on the subject.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>4Citizens </em>quotes from C. Wright and A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>Civil \u00a7 1909 (1972), that the \u201c \u2018. .. most important factor in determining adequacy of representation is how the interest of the absentee compares with the interests of the present parties.\u2019 \u201d 276 Md. at 713. Judge Levine, in <em>Citizens, </em>went on to state, \u201cWhere the applicant\u2019s interest is similar to, but not identical with, that of an existing party, he ordinarily should be allowed to intervene \u2018unless it is clear that the [existing] party will provide adequate representation for the absentee.\u2019 [Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 1909].\u201d 276 Md. at 713. The Court said that, \u201c[t]he burden of showing that existing representation may be inadequate is a minimal one.\u201d 276 Md. at 714. The question then arises as to whether the State met the burden of showing that the representation by the MNCPPC and the County was inadequate as to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">On the face of the Attorney General\u2019s petition, brought on behalf of the State, it is plain that the State\u2019s interest in the real estate taxes would be affected by any decision of the trial court. Hence, unless the representation of the State\u2019s interest by the County or MNCPPC was adequate, the State should have been allowed to intervene. Why the judge declined to allow the State to intervene is not revealed by the record. We are presented with the bare result, but not the reason for the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Based upon the County\u2019s interest in real estate taxes, <em>inter alia,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it might be argued that the County\u2019s presence in the case adequately protected the State\u2019s interest so that there was no necessity for the State\u2019s intervention, but no such argument has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>It is not necessary that there be a positive showing of inadequacy of representation in order to intervene. It is sufficient that the representation \u201cmay be inadequate.\u201d <em>Citizens Coordinating Comm, on Friendship Heights, Inc. v. TKU Associates, supra; Kozak v. Wells, </em>278 F. 2d 104, 110 (8th Cir. 1960); <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Bisanz Bros., </em>249 F. 2d 22, 27-28 (8th Cir. 1957). Moreover, a \u201cserious possibility\u201d that the applicant\u2019s interest may not be protected adequately satifies the rule. <em>Citizens Coordinating Comm, on Friendship Heights, Inc. v. TKU Associates, supra; Nuesse v. Camp, </em>385 F. 2d 694, 704 (D.C. Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Paraphrasing Judge Levine in <em>Citizens, </em>the interest of the existing parties is similar but- not identical. The County government represents the people who reside within the territorial confines of Prince George\u2019s County. It is primarily interested in their welfare. The Attorney General, on the other hand, represents the people of the entire State, not just one political subdivision. The interest of two governments, State and County, may be the same but not necessarily so. The State is interested in the welfare of all its citizens not just those of Prince George\u2019s County. Inasmuch as the interest of the County may not be the same as that of the rest of the State, we cannot say that the interests are identical and that the County adequately represented the State\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">MNCPPC\u2019s interest is likewise not identical with that of the State. MNCPPC is a hybrid administrative agency whose jurisdiction encompasses parts of two counties. Md. Ann. Code art. 66D. It is not a State agency although it may act as the representative of the State for the limited purposes set out in Md. Ann. Code art. 66D, \u00a7 4-101, not here applicable. The Commission is a bi-county agency charged with the duty of carrying out general plans for the physical development of the metropolitan district. While its interests are not necessarily in conflict with the State\u2019s, the interests are confined to the authority granted by the statute under which the Commission was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Moreover, it is possible that the State may believe and argue to the trial court that the agreement entered into by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>MNCPPC and approved by the County was <em>ultra vires </em>so that the State\u2019s position would be contrary to both the County\u2019s and MNCPPC\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">\u25a0As we have indicated, whatever reasons led the trial judge to deny the State\u2019s right to intervene are not disclosed in the record. We have before us only the judge\u2019s conclusion, spoken at the hearing, with respect to the Attorney General\u2019s motion: \u201cIt is denied .... We will make it more formal. The motion of the Attorney General to intervene is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">We think the State should have been allowed to intervene as a matter of right. Because it was not, we are compelled, by <em>Citizens </em>and <em>Williams, </em>to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">\n<em>Order denying the motion of the State of Maryland to intervene is reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">\n<em>Order reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">\n<em>Case remanded for a new hearing.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-10\">. <em>Nat\u2019l 4-H Club </em>suggests that the granting of a motion to intervene is not immediately appealable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b737-10\">.

Code art. 31A, \u00a7 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\">. <em>But see </em>Nat\u2019l 4-H Club Pound, of America v.
