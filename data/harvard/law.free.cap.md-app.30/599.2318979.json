A two count information charged Venner with unlawfully possessing marihuana extract in sufficient quantity to indicate an intent to manufacture or distribute it, and with simple possession of the same substance. He moved to suppress the evidence and dismiss the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Both the issue raised by the motion, as well as the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence, were submitted to Judge Solomon Liss, without a jury, in a series of appearances from 12 December 1973 to 20 November 1974. Evidence which it was stipulated that the court should consider on both issues consisted of an agreed statement of facts, supplemented by testimony and exhibits. Judge Liss denied the motion and found Venner guilty on the first count. After sentence was imposed, Venner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">The Facts Before The Court</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">The agreed statement was submitted on 27 September 1974. The transcript reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right, Mr. Bass [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney], will you please give us the facts that are agreed on in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Now as I understand it, Mr. Gede, these facts are stipulated and agreed and are to be accepted by the Court as if they had been introduced into evidence by the witnesses. Any facts that are not agreed on you will, of course, promptly let the Court know?</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">MR. GEDE [Defense counsel]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">THE COURT: Very well.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">MR. BASS: Your Honor, on July 21, 1973, at 3:45 P.M., Charles Venner, a twenty year old male, was taken to Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland by several friends. The defendant was admitted to the emergency room in what appeared to be a semi-conscious state. The friends gave certain information to the attending physician, Dr. Robert Egbert of the Sinai Hospital Staff, and based on this information Dr. Egbert had reason to believe that perhaps the defendant had taken in his stomach, contained in balloons a substance known as hashish oil; and he also, on the basis of looking at the patient, believed that either one of the many balloons had burst inside the defendant, thus an overdose.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">The doctor ordered x-rays taken by the hospital radiologist, and these photographs revealed 12 to 15 balloons still inside the defendant\u2019s stomach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">\u201cMR. BASS: As I said, the x-rays revealed what looked like 12 to 15 balloons still inside the defendant\u2019s stomach. Dr. Egbert then notified the Baltimore City Police Department, and Officer Russell Smeak of Northwest District. Officer Smeak, after hearing the situation, made arrangements with the Supervisor of Nurses, Intensive Care, if any stools contained balloons the hospital was told to contact Northern District, and they would respond and take custody of the contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">On July 22, 1973, at 8:10 P.M., Officer Michael <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Leonard of the Northwestern District responded to a call of the hospital and took custody of 8 balloons. On July 23, 1973, Officer Wendell France responded to a call to the hospital and received 4 balloons. At approximately 6:30 Officer Allen Taylor went to the hospital to retrieve one more balloon passed by the defendant. On July 24, 1973, about 11:00 A.M., Officer Joseph Lombardi responded to the hospital call to receive eight more balloons found in the defendant\u2019s stool. A total of 21 balloons were recovered, plus a fragment of a broken balloon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is it further stipulated between counsel that the balloons that were turned over to Officer Leonard, Officer France, Officer Taylor, and Officer Lombardi were, in fact, retrieved from the stools that were passed by the defendant in the hospital?</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">MR. GEDE: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">THE COURT: Very well. Now that still leaves, obviously, the open question as to whether or not the nurse was entitled \u2014 the nurses were entitled to take these stools and to examine them, and whether the police officers were entitled to receive them without a search and seizure warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">MR. BASS: Chemist William Butler of the Baltimore City Police Department analyzed the contents of the rubber balloons and obtained a positive test for hashish oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">Your Honor, that is as far as we can go with the statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">MR. GEDE: Your Honor, just for the record, I will stipulate that that is what he would say without seeing the chemist\u2019s report and analysis of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: I think what you ought to do is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>bring your expert in. This is an essential part of the case. There\u2019s a question of whether he should be held for possession or distribution, and I think that we ought to have testimony on this. I suggest to you, when we meet again two weeks from today, that the expert be here so we can qualify him and have him bring his report in and have him give us the benefit of any expertise as to what this means from the standpoint of dosage as well as from the standpoint of quantity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">There followed a discussion among the judge and counsel as to additional evidence. Judge Liss set a time for taking further evidence. At a later hearing the State called a qualified chemist, who testified that he had received the balloons and examined their contents. They contained what the chemist referred to as hashish oil, or marihuana extract, the principal agent extracted being tetrahydrocannabinol. The quantity of the extract was 200 grams, which the witness said could easily involve a hundred pounds of marihuana. He said that that much extract could be used to produce a hallucinogenic effect in thousands of cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The record of Venner\u2019s admission and treatment at Sinai Hospital, in Baltimore, which was before Judge Liss and is a part of the record before us, provides more detail than was included in the agreed statement. The hospital summary shows, as the history of the present illness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\u201cPatient has been in apparent good health without any significant medical history. Three months ago, he went to Morocco for a vacation and on returning home he was caught with illegal possesion of narcotics (name ? unknown). He was jailed for three months, and was released a few days prior to admission. Before boarding the plane, he allegedly swallowed 24 to 25 bags of hashish oil and on that night he became dizzy, weak, nauseated, with dry mouth. He arrived at New York Kennedy Airport and passed 5 balloons the next day. The night prior to admission he developed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>nausea, hallucinations, increased appetite, drowsiness, and disorientation. His condition remained the same and he was brought to the Sinai Hospital Emergency Room the next day, euphoric, disoriented and lethargic, but responding to verbal orders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The summary contains this description of \u201cHospital Course\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201cPatient was admitted to Mt. Pleasant ICU, and on the 2nd hospital day, he was coherent, and oriented x3. He was noticed to be persistently bradycardeic, which did not respond to Atropine. At 5:40 p.m., on that day, he passed through the rectum 8 balloons of different colors. Another five balloons were passed on the next day, then four balloons on the 4th day and two balloons on the 5th day. Vital signs remained stable in spite of the bradycardia, ranging between 34 to 60/min. Serial abdominal films revealed the presence of numerous foreign bodies, and the last film taken the day before discharge disclosed no evidence of such foreign body. Police report on the contents of one of the balloons was positive for marihjuana [sic].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Progress notes in the hospital record contain these entries:</p>\n<p id=\"Ad4\">, _40 \u201c7/22 6 pm Passed at 5 pm 8 bags (balloons) of diff colors \u2014 yellow, green, blue. They were given to the nursing supervisor at once. 11 more bags to go (if count is correct).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">\u201c7-23 He passed 5 balloons more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">\u201c7/24 passed 4 balloons (intact) plus a small fragm\u00e9nt. Total = 8 + 5 + 4 = 17. (2 more if count is correct &amp; if all are intact, however, apparently at least one got burst).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">30 \u201c7/25 12N passed 2 more balloons at 3 ]M yesterday. Everything accounted for, however, on further questioning, he says that he could not remember if they were really 24 or 25.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>On the Doctors Order Sheet an entry at 1:00 A.M. on 22 July 1973 says, \u201cForeign bodies in stools to be handed over to security.\u201d Relevant entries in Nurses Notes are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201c7-22 5 40/pm Had large stool including 8 colored articles which were removed and given to Dr. Uy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">6 P.M. Miss Keithly given the foreign bodies taken from stool. Dr. Uy gave them to Miss Keithly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">\u201c7-23 10 45/AM Passed large brown formed stool c [with] 5 balloons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">\u201c7-24 9 10/AM Had large formed bowel movement &amp; passed four balloons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">3 30/PM Passed 2 more balloons &lt;* loose bowel movement. Balloons kept \u2014 locked security. To be analyzed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Contentions on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">The questions in this appeal, as appellant presents them in his brief, are:</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">1. Did the trial court err in admitting evidence obtained as a result of Appellant\u2019s medical treatment for drug abuse?</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">2. Was there sufficient probable cause to justify a warrantless search and seizure?</p>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">3. Did the State show sufficient exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless search and seizure?</p>\n<p id=\"b627-16\">Numbers 2 and 3 could well be combined and restated: Was the contraband lawfully obtained by the police?</p>\n<p id=\"b627-17\">Statutory Protection Against Disclosure</p>\n<p id=\"b627-18\">Appellant\u2019s first contention invokes the protection of Code, Art. 43B, \u00a7 10 (b), which says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-19\">\u201cWhenever a person shall seek counselling, treatment or therapy for any form of drug abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>from a physician, psychologist, hospital, an educator pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 85A of Article 77, or a person, program or facility authorized by the Authority to counsel or treat any form of drug abuse, no statement, whether oral or written, made by such person and no observation or conclusion derived from such counselling, treatment or therapy made by such physician, psychologist, hospital, person, program or facility shall be admissible against such person in any proceeding. The facts or results of any examination to determine the existence of illegal or prohibited drugs in a person\u2019s body shall not be admissible in any proceeding against such person, provided that the facts or results of any such examination ordered pursuant to a civil commitment proceeding under this article or as a condition of parole or probation shall be admissible in the proceeding for which the examination was ordered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Pointing out that the statute, Art. 43B, \u00a7 2 (d) defines drug abuse as including \u201cany misuse by any person of * * * any drug whose use is either prohibited or regulated\u201d, appellant argues that \u00a7 10 (b) makes inadmissible against him any evidence from the hospital or its personnel or records. The same argument was made below. In an excellent opinion filed with his ruling on the motion to suppress, Judge Liss held that Venner was not entitled to the protection of the statute. We adopt that portion of Judge Liss\u2019s opinion. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">\u201cDefendant urges that he is entitled to the protection of this section of the Drug Abuse Control and Rehabilitation Act (Article 43B); and that therefore the evidence obtained by reason of his examinations and treatment at Sinai Hospital is inadmissible. The State concedes that if this evidence is suppressed the case against the Defendant must fall. It therefore becomes necessary for the Court to determine whether it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>was the intent of the Maryland Legislature to afford the Defendant, under the circumstances of this case, the protection mandated by Article 43B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201cArticle 43B begins with a Declaration of Purpose which states the legislative intent for the passage of the Act. Section (c) of that Declaration of Purpose is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u2018Experience has demonstrated that drug addicts can be rehabilitated and returned to useful lives only through extended periods of treatment in a controlled environment followed by supervision in an after-care program. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive program of human renewal of drug addicts in rehabilitation centers and after-care programs. <em>The comprehensive program provided by this article is designed to assist the rehabilitation of drug addicts. </em>It applies to addicts who are not accused of crimes, as well as addicts convicted of crimes. <em>The program is further designed to protect society against the social contagion of drug addiction and to meet the need of drug addicts for medical, psychological and vocational rehabilitation, while safeguarding the liberty of individuals against undue interference. </em>\u2019 (1969, Ch. 404) [Italics supplied]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">\u201cDelegate Steven V. Sklar,' of the Maryland Legislature, the sponsor of Article 43B, was called as joint witness by the State and by the Defense. Delegate Sklar indicated that it was his view that the legislative intent was to prevent the use of evidence in a court proceeding against a drug abuser or drug user where this evidence was obtained by reason of the drug user\u2019s or abuser\u2019s seeking counseling, treatment or therapy from a physician, psychologist, hospital, or educator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>\u201cArticle 43B, Section <em>2, </em>included the following definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">\u2018(D) \u201cDrug abuse\u201d means any misuse by any person of or dependence by any person on any drug whose use is either prohibited or regulated by 276 through 302 of Article 27, including, but not limited to, narcotic and non-narcotic drug addiction and narcotic and non-narcotic drug habituation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">\u2018(E) \u201cDrug Addiction\u201d means a physical and psychological dependence on any drug enumerated in 276 through 302 of Article 27.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">\u201cDrug Addict\u201d means a person exhibiting the symptoms of drug addiction or who, by reason of the repeated use of any drug enumerated above is in imminent danger of becoming addicted to that drug; provided, however, that no person shall be deemed a drug addict solely by virtue of his taking of any such drug pursuant to a lawful prescription issued by a physician in the course of professional treatment for legitimate medical purposes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">\u201cIt would seem clear that the purpose of this Act was to aid in the treatment, counseling and rehabilitation of drug abusers and drug addicts. A reading of the declaration of purpose, the definitions, and Section 10 leads to the inescapable conclusion that the Legislature was seeking to encourage those unfortunates to seek treatment and not to be deterred from requesting such treatment and assistance because of the fact that the information obtained by the physician or hospital might be used in a criminal prosecution against the patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">\u201cThe Defendant, however, has not shown that he is entitled to the benefits accruing from Section 10 of Article 43B. There is not a scintilla of evidence that he was either a drug abuser or drug addict. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>While it is obvious that the Defendant introduced a large quantity of hashish oil in his body, it is clear that this was not done for the purpose of achieving the psychotrophic response sought by a drug abuser. Instead, the Defendant very carefully devised an ingenious scheme to prevent the drug from entering his blood stream. The sole purpose was to assist the Defendant in secreting the contraband drug so that he might avoid discovery. The magnitude of the amount involved indicated an intention to manufacture or distribute the drug. His scheme might have succeeded except for the fortuitous circumstance that one of the balloons burst and he suffered the effects of a hashish overdose. The Court draws the conclusion from all the facts that the swallowing of the balloons was for the purpose of evading discovery of the contraband which was to be distributed illegally by the Defendant for a profit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">\u201cArticle 43B, Section 10, was never intended to assist the drug trafficker to engage in his nefarious trade and to use its provisions as a shield against apprehension and punishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">\u201cFor the reasons given, the Court holds that the Defendant is not entitled to the protection afforded by Article 43B, Section 10.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Fourth Amendment Protection Against Unreasonable Search and Seizure</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">The other issue, as Judge Liss stated it in his Memorandum Opinion below, was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">\u201cThe second issue to be decided by this Court is whether the evidence seized by the police without a warrant from Sinai Hospital should be excluded from the case because its seizure was a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Appellant\u2019s questions 2 and 3 as he states them here, are directed to specific findings by Judge Liss under that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">That part of the Fourth Amendment which is invoked provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Judge Liss cited and discussed numerous decisions of the United States Supreme Court, including <em>Rochin v. California, </em>342 U. S. 165, 96 L. Ed. 183, 72 S. Ct. 205 (1952); <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U. S. 757, 16 L.Ed.2d 908, 86 S. Ct. 1826 (1966); <em>Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 U. S. 42, 26 L.Ed.2d 419, 90 S. Ct. 1975 (1970); <em>Cupp v. Murphy, </em>412 U. S. 291, 36 L.Ed.2d 900, 93 S. Ct. 2000 (1973). He proceeded to examine the factual situation in this case and held that there was probable cause, that the circumstances were exigent, and that the warrantless seizure was reasonable and did not violate Venner\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment. For these reasons he denied the motion to suppress the contraband as evidence and to dismiss the information against Venner.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">We reach the same result, but we do not find it necessary to consider the questions of probable cause, exigency, or reasonableness. Those are considerations which must be weighed when a court undertakes to determine whether questioned evidence, seized by police from a defendant on trial, was seized in compliance with or in violation of conceded Fourth Amendment rights of that defendant. Before it is necessary to entertain the question of compliance on the one hand and violation on the other, there may be, as there is in this case, a threshold question to be answered. That question is whether the Fourth Amendment <em>applies at all </em>to the circumstances under which the police came into possession of the questioned evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Fourth Amendment does not apply \u2014 if Venner was not the \u201cvictim\u201d of a police seizure \u2014 then questions of probable cause, exigency, and reasonableness are totally irrelevant. The well known comment of Mr. Justice Holmes in <em>Hester v. United States, </em>265 U. S. 57, 68 L. Ed. 898, 44 S. Ct. 445 (1924) that \u201cthe special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to the people in their \u2018persons, houses, papers, and effects,\u2019 is not extended to the open fields\u201d, serves to illustrate that agents of the government may, irrespective of probable cause or the lack of it, search an unprotected place and seize anything they find there, with no requirement whatever that they obtain a warrant or that there be exigent circumstances which required the immediate seizure without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">What must be kept in mind is that what the Fourth Amendment protects is the right of people to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures. When a search and seizure are made in the proper execution of a properly issued warrant, they are not unreasonable and therefore they violate no constitutionally protected rights. To put it another way, there is no constitutional protection against a reasonable search and seizure. And not everything is protected against unreasonable searches and seizures. What is protected is the right to be secure in one\u2019s person, house, papers, and effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">What may be suppressed, upon a proper showing, are not persons or houses themselves, but papers and effects, broadened in meaning to include any so-called real evidence or physical evidence, including intercepted conversations, but distinguished from testimonial evidence, which has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>unlawfully seized by the police from a person or from his house or other place where the individual has a constitutionally protected expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In the familiar constitutional sense of the word \u201csearch\u201d and the word \u201cseizure\u201d, it is neither a search nor a seizure when the police come into possession of contraband, instrumentalities of crime, fruits of crime, or mere evidence, without violating the security of the defendant\u2019s person or his house or other constitutionally protected area.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">A review of the evolution of Fourth Amendment protection available to defendants in State criminal cases may be helpful to an understanding of that protection as it is applied today. The rule followed for many years in Maryland, and in many other states, is found in <em>Marshall v. State, </em>182 Md. 379, 35 A. 2d 115 (1943). The Court said, at 383:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201cAt common law matter pertinent to the issue was always admissible and the court would not raise an issue as to how it was obtained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The Court quoted with approval from <em>Lawrence v. State, </em>103 Md. 17, 63 A. 96 (1906), which cited 4 <em>Wigmore on Evidence, </em>Sec. 2264, and 1 <em>Greenleaf on Evidence, </em>Sec. 254 (a), and quoted from <em>Greenleaf </em>that \u201cthough papers and other subjects of evidence may have been illegally taken from the possession of the party against whom they are offered, or otherwise unlawfully obtained, this is no valid objection to their admissibility, if they are pertinent to the issue. The court will not take notice of how they were obtained, whether lawfully or unlawfully, nor will it form an issue to determine that question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">This view was reaffirmed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Davis v. State, </em>189 Md. 640, 57 A. 2d 289 (1948), in which the Court said, at 645:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">\u201cThis State has aligned itself with those jurisdictions holding that the question of how evidence is obtained is collateral to the issue of the guilt or innocence of the accused, and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>pertinent evidence, no matter how obtained, will be admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">It should be noted that the rule applied as the law of Maryland in the cases just cited was the common law rule. A statutory modification enacted in 1929 made inadmissible in most misdemeanor trials evidence obtained through an illegal search or seizure. The common law rule continued to apply in felony cases. That statute, known as the Bouse Act, appeared as Code, Art. 35, \u00a7 5, until 1 January 1974, when it was repealed by Acts of 1973,1st Sp. Sess., ch. 2, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">When <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 81 S. Ct. 1684 (1961), extended the federal exclusionary rule of <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>232 U. S. 383, 58 L. Ed. 652, 34 S. Ct. 341 (1914), to state prosecutions, defendants in all criminal prosecutions, felony or misdemeanor, became entitled, as a matter of federal law, to the exclusion from the trial of all evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">But one must have been a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d \u2014 he must have been the victim of an unlawful seizure \u2014 to be entitled to the protection of <em>Mapp\u2019s </em>exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">In <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U. S. 347, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, 88 S. Ct. 507 (1967), the accused sought to suppress a telephone conversation seized by agents by the placing of an electronic device on the outside of a telephone booth in which Katz originated a call. The issues as argued were whether a public telephone booth was a constitutionally protected area, and whether a physical penetration into a constitutionally protected area is necessary to make the search unlawful. The Supreme Court declined to adopt that formulation of the issues. It said, at 350:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">\u201cIn the first place, the correct solution of Fourth Amendment problems is not necessarily promoted by incantation of the phrase \u2018constitutionally protected area.\u2019 Secondly, the Fourth Amendment cannot be translated into a general constitutional \u2018right to privacy.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">The Court went on to say, at 351:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\">\u201cFor the Fourth Amendment protects people, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. See Lewis v. United States, 385 U. S. 206, 210[, 87 S. Ct. 424, 427, 17 L.Ed.2d 312]; United States v. Lee, 274 U. S. 559, 563[, 47 S. Ct. 746, 748, 71 L. Ed. 1202], But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Answering the contention that Katz was not in a private place because he could be seen in the booth through the glass the Court said, at 352:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">\u201cBut what he sought to exclude when he entered the booth was not the intruding eye \u2014 it was the uninvited ear. He did not shed his right to do so simply because he made his calls from a place where he might be seen. No less than an individual in a business office, in a friend\u2019s apartment, or in a taxicab, a person in a telephone booth may rely upon the protection of the Fourth Amendment. One who occupies it, shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Not all of the cases in this area undertake to draw a clear distinction between two approaches which we see as different, and which may or may not, in a particular case, be significant to the result. It is one thing to hold that evidence may be used because the manner in which the police came by it was unrelated to any right of the accused under the Fourth Amendment. It is quite different to hold that evidence may be used because the police respected the accused\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights and the seizure was reasonable, having been made under a valid warrant, or upon probable cause and exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\"><em>Cardwell v. Lewis, </em>417 U. S. 583, 41 L.Ed.2d 325, 94 S. Ct. 2464 (1974), seems to illustrate this lack of distinction. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Ohio murder victim had been found near his car, which had been pushed over an embankment. Police took scrapings of foreign paint from the car, and made casts of tire tracks found at the scene. Almost three months later the police, having developed probable cause to charge Lewis, asked him to come to the police office for interrogation. They obtained an arrest warrant before he arrived. After Lewis had been there some seven hours, the police served the arrest warrant. They took possession of his car from a public parking lot, and the next day examined the tire treads and took paint samples. Both were later connected to the murder scene. The police had no warrant to search the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">After his conviction in a state court, Lewis obtained habeas corpus relief in the U. S. District Court, which held that the warrantless seizure of evidence from the car violated Lewis\u2019s Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The U. S. Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The Supreme Court reversed, by a judgment announced in an opinion by Mr. Justice Blaekmun, in which three other justices joined. Mr. Justice Powell concurred in the result. Justices Stewart, Douglas, Brennan, and Marshall dissented. The opinion by Mr. Justice Blaekmun said, at 591:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">\u201c * * * the exercise of a desire to be mobile does not, of course, waive one\u2019s right to be free of unreasonable government intrusion. But insofar as Fourth Amendment protection extends to a motor vehicle, it is the right to privacy that is the touchstone of our inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">\u201cIn the present case, nothing from the interior of the car and no personal effects, which the Fourth Amendment traditionally has been deemed to protect, were searched or seized and introduced in evidence. With the \u2018search\u2019 limited to the examination of the tire on the wheel and the taking of paint scrapings from the exterior of the vehicle left in the public parking lot, we fail to comprehend what expectation of privacy was infringed. Stated simply, the invasion of privacy, \u2018if it can be said to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>exist, is abstract and theoretical.\u2019 Air Pollution Variance Board v. Western Alfalfa Corp., 416 U. S. 861, 865, [94 S. Ct. 2114, 2116, 40 L.Ed.2d 607] (1974). Under circumstances such as these, where probable cause exists, a warrantless examination of the exterior of a car is not unreasonable under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The comment appears to mix two ingredients which clarity suggests should be kept separate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If indeed no expectation of privacy was infringed, then probable cause and the reasonableness of the warrantless search are irrelevancies. We point this out to emphasize that if the Fourth Amendment is not applicable, we need not look for compliance. If the Fourth Amendment is applicable, compliance is, of course, mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In the case now before us, the State raised no question, here or below, of Venner\u2019s standing to contest the seizure of the contraband. Perhaps he was thought to have the \u201cautomatic standing\u201d recognized in <em>Jones v. United States, </em>362 U. S. 257, 4 L.Ed.2d 697, 80 S. Ct. 725 (1960). In <em>Jones </em>the Court recognized two grounds for according standing: (a) when the crime charged is possession of the goods at the time of the seizure, and, (b) when the accused had a possessory or proprietary interest in, or was legitimately upon the premises at the time of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">In <em>Duncan v. State, </em>276 Md. 715, 351 A. 2d 144 (1976), the Court of Appeals clearly held the automatic standing rule of <em>Jones </em>to be in force in Maryland, notwithstanding the development of other alternatives to the dilemma of both asserting and denying possession of the same goods at the same time. In any event, \u201cstanding\u201d is not involved in the case now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The Fourth Amendment Does Not Protect Against Police Seizure Of Abandoned Property</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Numerous cases have been concerned with the use of evidence once owned, possessed, or controlled by an accused, but which comes into the possession of the police after it has been abandoned or otherwise relinquished by him. An example is found in <em>Abel v. United States, </em>362 U. S. 217, 4 L.Ed.2d 668, 80 S. Ct. 683 (1960). An alien suspected of espionage was arrested in his hotel room by immigration officers on an administrative warrant. Agents of the F.B.I. hovered in the background. When Abel packed his belongings and checked out of his hotel room to accompany the immigration officers, the F.B.I. agents, without a warrant, but with the permission of the hotel management, searched the vacated room. In a waste basket they found and seized two items later used, over objection, as evidence. One was a hollowed out pencil containing microfilm. The other was a block of wood containing a cipher pad. The Court said, at 241:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">\u201cNo pretense is made that this search by the F.B.I. was for any purpose other than to gather evidence of crime, that is, evidence of petitioner\u2019s espionage. As such, however, it was entirely lawful, although undertaken without a warrant. This is so for the reason that at the time of the search petitioner had vacated the room. The hotel then had the exclusive right to its possession, and the hotel management freely gave its consent that the search be made. Nor was it unlawful to seize the entire contents of the wastepaper basket, even though some of its contents had no connection with crime. So far as the record shows, petitioner had abandoned these articles. He had thrown them away. So far as he was concerned, they were <em>bona vacantia. </em>There can be nothing unlawful in the Government\u2019s appropriation of such abandoned property. See Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57, 58[, 44 S. Ct. 445, 446, 68 L. Ed. 898].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Another hotel room case is <em>United States v. Cowan, </em>396 F. 2d 83 (2nd Cir. 1968). When a luggage thief had left his hotel room without paying his bill, and without removing the luggage from the room, the hotel manager took possession of the room, and removed the luggage. With the manager\u2019s consent, F.B.I. agents searched the room and the luggage. The luggage had been stolen from airline terminals at Kennedy Airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The U. S. Court of Appeals affirmed Cowan\u2019s conviction. The court said, at 86:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">\u201cCowan contends that the search and seizure of the luggage were unlawful. We hold that appellant does not have standing to raise this issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">After a discussion of <em>Jones v. United States, supra, </em>the court went on to say, at 86-87:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">\u201cIn order to have standing to challenge the legality of a search, one must establish that he was the victim of an invasion of privacy. [Citations omitted]. While redress for persons aggrieved by searches and seizures originally depended upon proof of a superior property interest, recent decisions rest upon the constitutional right to the protection of privacy rather than any interest in the property which was subject to the search or seizure. * * * Here there was no invasion of Cowan\u2019s right to privacy. He had lost his right to use the room and with this the law gave the hotel the right to seize the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">\u201cUnder these circumstances, Cowan\u2019s privacy was not invaded when the hotel manager permitted the federal agents to examine the contents of the baggage at the hotel or when the agents seized the baggage after Cowan\u2019s arrest. And since the hotel, not Cowan, was entitled to retain possession at the time when the baggage was seized there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>interference with Cowan\u2019s property rights, such as they were, in the luggage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">\u201cMoreover, we agree with Judge Weinfeld that the luggage had been abandoned at the time of the search. * * * Appellant argues that the abandonment doctrine does not apply because there was no unambiguous act of intentional discard * * *. Abandonment does not require performing a ritual; rather it is a question of intent.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">In <em>United States v. </em>Maryland,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 479 F. 2d 566 (5th Cir. 1973), the appellant and other occupants of a described automobile were arrested by a deputy sheriff on the request of a neighboring sheriff, who wanted them for passing counterfeit bills. The persons arrested were taken to the courthouse in a patrol car. A later search of the patrol car yielded five counterfeit bills between the seat and the cushion where appellant had sat. The bills were used as evidence against him at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">After discussing <em>Jones v. United States, supra, </em>the court said, at 568:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">\u201cThe Government\u2019s first argument is that appellant voluntarily abandoned the counterfeit bills in the police car when he exited from it without the bills and therefore had no standing to object to the subsequent search by which they were discovered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">\u201cWe agree that the deputy\u2019s search of the police vehicle after appellant had exited from it was not directed against appellant within the meaning of <em>Jones </em>and did not invade any area in which appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy. Further, we agree that if appellant\u2019s arrest was lawful, the abandonment was clearly voluntary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>The court went on to hold that the arrest was lawful, therefore the abandonment was not brought about by unlawful police conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The appellant in <em>United States v. Minker, </em>312 F. 2d 632 (3rd Cir. 1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U. S. 953, 83 S. Ct. 952, 9 L.Ed.2d 978 (1963), was convicted of evading a tax based upon a lottery operation. A lawful search of Minker\u2019s apartment had yielded no incriminating evidence. Thereafter</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">\u201c * * * government agents had arranged with Anthony Damore, a trash collector, to permit them to examine the contents of a trash receptacle located on the premises of the Hampden Boulevard apartment building, but outside the structure. The management of the apartment house had hired Damore to remove the trash three times a week. The receptacle was used by four tenants, as well as the building superintendent. The contents were examined off the premises, and the agents retained certain adding machine tapes and other slips of paper. Handwriting identified as Minker\u2019s appeared on many of these items. It is the taking of these articles from the trash can that is challenged here as being an unreasonable search and seizure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">\u201cPrior to trial appellant presented a motion to suppress this evidence. The district court, after hearing, denied the motion, holding that Minker had abandoned the articles prior to the seizure by the government. At the trial objection was made to the introduction of this evidence. We think it abundantly clear that not only had Minker abandoned the property but, in addition, that the trash can was located outside an area that would entitle him to constitutional protection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Still another abandonment case gave rise to <em>United States v. Mustone, </em>469 F. 2d 970 (1st Cir. 1972). Secret Service agents had under surveillance a commercial premises at 3A Union Street, Boston, where they suspected a counterfeiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>operation was being conducted. One of the appellants, Brennan, was observed leaving the premises, carrying two large trash bags. The court detailed what followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">\u201cBrennan placed these bags on the sidewalk near some garbage cans \u2018several doors away\u2019 from 3A Union Street and then left the area. Both bags were tied closed. Kozak picked up these bags and deposited them in the Boston Secret Service office. When Agent Miller opened them the next morning he found a sheet of paper containing the impressions of three and one half counterfeit ten dollar notes and three aluminum offset plates stained with green ink.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">\u201cBased primarily on this evidence government agents obtained a search warrant for 3A Union Street and on March 18 searched the premises. They found approximately $242,000 in printed but uncut counterfeit ten dollar notes, an offset press, a vertical camera, a platemaker, a black attache case containing plates used to print counterfeit notes, and a large quantity of other printing and photographic supplies. Isabarrone\u2019s and Brennan\u2019s fingerprints were found on objects inside the back room. All three appellants were arrested shortly thereafter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The court then stated the contention on appeal, and its holding. It said, at 972:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">\u201cOn appeal appellants\u2019 primary contention is that the trial court erred in denying their Rule 41(e) motions to suppress the evidence found in the trash bags and during the search of 3A Union Street. With regard to the trash bags, appellants assert that the government\u2019s warrantless search and seizure of these bags violated Brennan\u2019s fourth amendment rights. They rely on People v. Krivda, 5 Cal. 3d 357, 96 Cal. Rptr. 62, 486 P.2d 1262 (1971), vacated 409 U.S. 33, 93 S. Ct. 32, 34 L.Ed.2d 45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>(1972), and argue that Brennan had a \u2018reasonable expectation of privacy\u2019 as to the contents of these bags. In <em>Krivda </em>the California Supreme Court, citing Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), upheld a citizen\u2019s expectation of privacy as to the contents of a trash can placed on a public sidewalk awaiting pickup by municipal rubbish collectors. There the court upheld the suppression of evidence obtained during the warrantless search of the can. We are not persuaded by this authority, however, and hold that when Brennan deposited the bags on the sidewalk he abandoned them. Implicit in the concept of abandonment is a renunciation of any \u2018reasonable\u2019 expectation of privacy in the property abandoned. The contrary suggestion strikes us as anomalous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In <em>Robinson v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 439, 283 A. 2d 637 (1971), Chief Judge Orth, writing for this Court, made it clear that the seizure of discarded evidence, in an area where the accused had no justifiable right of privacy, is simply not within the protection of the Fourth Amendment. Two victims were robbed on the street by three men. Police arrived, and the victims pointed out the three men standing on a corner nearby. The police pursued them. Two of the men went into a building, and through a shoeshine parlor into a bathroom. An officer opened the door and ordered the men out. The officer found a pistol in a trash can in the bathroom. The gun was admitted in evidence over objection. We said, at 442-43:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\u201cWe hold that the search of the room and seizure of the evidence was not constitutionally proscribed. The Fourth Amendment protects \u2018* * * the security a man relies upon when he places himself or his property within a constitutionally protected area * * * . There he is protected from unwarranted governmental intrusion.\u2019 <em>Hoffa v. United States, </em>385 U. S. 293, 301. But it is what a person <em>justifi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>ably </em>seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, which may be constitutionally protected from unwarranted governmental intrusion, for \u2018the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.\u2019 <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U. S. 347. The capacity to claim its protection \u2018depends not upon a property right in the invalid place, but upon whether the area was one in which there was a <em>reasonable </em>expectation of freedom from governmental intrusion.\u2019 <em>Mancusi v. DeForte, </em>392 U. S. 364, 368. Thus \u2018 * * * the expectation of privacy is necessarily limited to that which is justifiable and reasonable; and what that encompasses depends upon and is controlled by the circumstances of each case.\u2019 <em>Kirsch v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 565, 569.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">\u201cRobinson in oral argument before us conceded the legality of his warrantless arrest and clearly it was legal. <em>Wescott v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 305. But the validity of the search and seizure here is not predicated upon it being incident to a legal arrest in any event. See <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U. S. 752. It is simply that as to Robinson and Jones the \u2018bathroom\u2019 was not a constitutionally protected area. They hid in it at the approach of the police and the men they had robbed. Assuming that it was accessible to the public as a public restroom, they had no justifiable and reasonable expectation of privacy therein under the circumstances here. They cannot complain because the police entered the room and seized an article which, by a rational inference, they had discarded. <em>Davis v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 630. This was no unwarranted governmental intrusion, nor lawless police conduct. <em>Brown v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 90, is clearly factually inapposite. We hold that the lower court did not err in overruling the objection to the admission of the pistol, clip and cartridge. The search of the room and seizure of the evidence was not within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>protection of the Fourth Amendment and thus could not violate its guarantees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">See also <em>Davis v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 630, 632, 236 A. 2d 307 (1967), <em>cert. den., </em>249 Md. 731 (1968), where we said that \u201cone who abandons or discards property cannot complain with effect of the later seizure of such property by the police, or of its use against him in court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">There Was No Intrusion Into Venner\u2019s Body To Obtain Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">We should not permit ourselves to fall into imprecise thinking because the evidence sought to be suppressed was in Yenner\u2019s body when the police first learned of its probable existence. The contraband was not taken from his body, by the police or by anyone acting for the police. There was no intrusion into the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">It was made clear by the Supreme Court in <em>Schmerber v. California, supra, </em>that such procedures as the compulsory drawing of blood from the body for testing purposes plainly constitute searches of persons, and depend antecedently upon seizures of persons within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The Court held in that case that the warrantless seizure of blood to test for alcohol was reasonable, given a lawful arrest, probable cause, an emergency in which delay threatened the loss of the evidence, and the taking of the blood by a physician in a hospital environment according to accepted medical practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">The other extreme is illustrated in the case of <em>Rochin v. California, supra, </em>decided in 1952, before <em>Mapp v. Ohio, supra, </em>applied the exclusionary rule of <em>Weeks v. United States, supra. </em>Fourth Amendment reasonableness was not involved, but the Court held in <em>Rochin </em>that the methods used to obtain evidence violated due process of law. The Court said, at 172-73:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">\u201cIt is conduct that shocks the conscience. -Illegally breaking into the privacy of the petitioner, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>struggle to open his mouth and remove what was there, the forcible extraction of his stomach\u2019s contents \u2014 this course of proceeding by agents of government to obtain evidence is bound to offend even hardened sensibilities. They are methods too close to the rack and the screw to permit of constitutional differentiation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">A warrantless seizure of evidence, involving a borderline intrusion into the body, was held by the Supreme Court in <em>Cupp v. Murphy, supra, </em>to have been constitutionally permissible, and not in violation of the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendments. Murphy\u2019s wife was found strangled to death. There were abrasions and lacerations on her throat. Murphy, who was not then living with his wife, voluntarily came to the police station for questioning. The police suspected that a dark spot on Murphy\u2019s finger might be dried blood, and asked to take scrapings from his fingernails. Murphy refused. The police took them by force. The scrapings contained traces of skin and blood cells, and fabric from the victim\u2019s nightgown. They were used as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Drawing a limited analogy to <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U. S. 752, 23 L.Ed.2d 685, 89 S. Ct. 2034 (1969), which defined the scope of a search incident to a valid arrest, and noting that the police had probable cause to arrest Murphy (although they had not done so), and noting \u201cthe very limited intrusion undertaken incident to the station house detention, and the ready destructibility of the evidence\u201d, the Court approved the warrantless seizure in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">We refer to one other case involving an intrusion into the body, because of the similarity of certain facts to the present case. In <em>People v. Bracamonte, </em>Sup., 124 Cal. Rptr. 528 (1975), the Supreme Court of California reversed a conviction based upon evidence obtained by what the court held was an unreasonable search and seizure. California narcotics agents obtained a warrant to search the residence of Rita Bracamonte and her husband, their vehicles, and their persons. After the agents arrived, Mrs. Bracamonte <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>fled in one of the described vehicles. She was stopped nearby, and was seen to swallow some balloons. Agents took her, handcuffed, to a hospital, and on the strength of the warrant, asked a physician to pump her stomach. Because of Mrs. Bracamonte\u2019s strenuous resistance, she was strapped to a table by two nurses, and when she still refused to swallow an emetic solution, they passed a tube through her nose into her throat. After further resistance she gave up, and drank the solution. She regurgitated seven multi-colored balloons. They contained heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The California court held that the warrant did not justify an intrusion into the appellant\u2019s body. It said that the warrantless intrusion was more than minor, and \u201cthat the high statistical probability that the balloons would \u2018pass through\u2019 constituted a condition other than the emergency situation in <em>Schmerber.\u201d </em><footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The Balloons And Their Contents Were Abandoned By Venner</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">It could not be said that a person has no property right in wastes or other materials which were once a part of or contained within his body, but which normally are discarded after their separation from the body. It is not unknown for a person to assert a continuing right of ownership, dominion, or control, for good reason or for no reason, over such things as excrement,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> fluid waste, secretions, hair, fingernails, toenails, blood, and organs or other parts of the body, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>whether their separation from the body is intentional, accidental, or merely the result of normal body functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">But it is all but universal human custom and human experience that such things are discarded \u2014 in a legal sense, abandoned \u2014 by the person from whom they emanate, either \u201con the spot\u201d, or, if social delicacy requires it, at a place or in a manner designed to cause the least offense to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">By the force of social custom, we hold that when a person does nothing and says nothing to indicate an intent to assert his right of ownership, possession, or control over such material, the only rational inference is that he intends to abandon the material. When one places, or permits others to place waste material from his body into the stream of ultimate disposition as waste, he has abandoned whatever legal right he theretofore had to protect it from prying eyes or acquisitive hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In this case the police did not confront or even see Venner at the hospital. He did not see them. There is nothing in the record to suggest that when the nurses, in the normal routine, took the bedpans from Venner\u2019s bed to the place for disposition of their contents, that it was a place where Venner had a constitutionally protected right of privacy. Nor is there anything to suggest that Venner exercised or attempted to exercise any right of possession or control over the balloons. They were abandoned by Venner.
