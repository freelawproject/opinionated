In this appeal they contend the evidence presented to the trial judge was not sufficient to support the guilty verdicts. We agree and shall vacate the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The scope of our review in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence in a non-jury case is governed by Maryland Rule 1086 which plainly commands that we cannot reverse the judgments of the trial court on the evidence unless we find the judgments to be clearly erroneous. <em>Szewczyk v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 597 (1969). The test as to whether the trial judge was clearly erroneous in reaching a guilty verdict is whether admissible evidence showed either directly, or circumstantially, or supplied a rational inference of, the facts to be proved from which the trier of fact could fairly be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused\u2019s guilt of the offense charged, with due regard being given to the opportunity of the lower court to judge the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Robinson v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 451 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\n<em>The Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Lillian Tenney, an employee of the Budget Bakery shop located on East Joppa Road in Baltimore County, testified that on Thursday, June 27, 1974, at approximately 5:00 P.M., \u201ctwo young boys\u201d entered the shop. One boy had a package of buns in his hands, \u201cand he laid them on the counter\u201d. The other boy \u201ccame around the counter behind me\u201d, produced \u201ca small gun\u201d and said, \u201cThis is a holdup\u201d. The boy with the gun then \u201cwent right to the desk, and right to the middle drawer \u2014 and he didn\u2019t go through all the drawers \u2014 if he knew just what he was doing, and he opened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the middle drawer, and we had a white envelope there where we keep our money from the register that we go down and get out money orders at the end of the day, and he just reached in and took the envelope and ran around the partition, and both of them took off.\u201d $190.00 was in the envelope in \u201ctens, twenties, fives and ones\u201d. The extent of Mrs. Tenney\u2019s description of the boys was that they \u201cwore dungarees, tennis shoes\u201d, and \u201cboth had hair down to their collars\u201d, and the one without the gun \u201chad large mirrored sunglasses on\u201d. When shown a pair of sunglasses, she said they were \u201cthe same type\u201d. The sunglasses were marked State\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 \u201cfor identification only\u201d. She testified to no other identifying details such as weight, height, color of hair or approximate ages of the \u201cyoung boys\u201d. She did not identify the appellants at the trial as the robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The next witness for the State was Mary Elizabeth Joyces, between 10 and 12 years old, who testified that at approximately 5:00 P. M. on June 27, 1974, she was walking in Yakona Alley. Later testimony indicated the alley to be between one and two blocks from the Budget Bakery. She saw \u201ctwo boys\u201d run down the alley and heard one of them say, \u201cHit the gas\u201d. One of them had a \u201clight brownish\u201d envelope in his hand. The two boys then got into the back seat of a green Volkswagen automobile. Two other \u201cmen\u201d were already in the front seat of the Volkswagen and it drove off \u201crather fast\u201d. One of \u201cthe two men\u201d that ran down the alley was wearing mirror sunglasses. State\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 for identification was the \u201csame type\u201d. The driver and the front seat passenger had \u201cbigger sunglasses on\u201d. Miss Joynes described the driver of the car as having \u201cfrizzy hair, like, like it was about came to right about here, and it was, like, frizzy. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">She testified to no other description of the four individuals she saw in the alley. She was asked by the prosecutor \u201cto look around the courtroom, and tell the Court if you see any of the four men that you saw on June 27, 1974\u201d. She responded, \u201cYes, I can, one of them\u201d and pointed out the appellant Deaver. When asked, \u201c . . . [w]hich one of the four boys would he be?\u201d, she replied, \u201cI think he was the one who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>came running down the alley\u201d. On cross-examination she was asked:</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u201cQ. This offense occurred back on June 27th, 1974, almost a year ago. Since that time, have you seen any of these parties?</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">A. I thought I did, but I am not sure, really, sure\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">She further testified that she had been unable to identify any of the boys from \u201csome pictures\u201d shown her by the police, although she had \u201cthought\u201d she could identify one of them but she \u201cwasn\u2019t sure\u201d. She was not asked which one she \u201cthought\u201d she could identify from the pictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Detective James Neuner of the Baltimore County Police Department testified that shortly before 8:30 P. M. on June 27, 1974, he arrested Deaver for the robbery. He was led to Deaver by the license number of the Volkswagen supplied to him by Miss Joynes. The car was registered in Deaver\u2019s name. After being advised of his Miranda rights, Deaver told Detective Neuner and Sergeant Gary Witt of the Baltimore County Police Department \u201cthat he and another named subject, the other defendant, Digioia, were in the alley [where Miss Joynes saw the Volkswagen] waiting for two other boys, and that the two boys came running down to the automobile hurriedly, and said that \u2018Let\u2019s step on it, let\u2019s go\u2019 \u201d. Deaver and Digioia were \u201calready in the car\u201d when the two boys ran up to it. The police report indicated that at the time of his arrest Deaver had $17.41 in his possession, including one ten dollar bill and seven one dollar bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Sergeant Witt testified that Deaver told him that he and Digioia were in the alley in the parked car at approximately 5:00 P. M. on June 27, 1974, \u201cand two subjects came down the alley, got into the car. Digioia told him to pick them up, and they proceeded on around the alley and out\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Digioia was arrested shortly before 10:05 P. M. on June 27, 1974, at which time he had $27.00 in his possession \u2014 \u201ctwo tens and seven ones\u201d. At that time he denied being with Deaver in the alley, saying that although he had been with Deaver from 1:30 P. M. to 3:30 P. M. he \u201chadn\u2019t seen Deaver anymore that day\u201d. The next day, however, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>consultation with counsel he gave a written statement to Detective Corporal Dennis Neugent of the Baltimore County Police Department. The statement was read into evidence without objection. The statement was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u201cI woke up, approximately, 12:00 or 12:30, and called Norman McDermitt around 12:45. I walked to Norman\u2019s house, and stayed till around 1:15. Went home and ate lunch. About 1:30, Johnny Deaver and Norm and Chris and Mike drove up. We then went to Loch Raven Dam and drank beer till 3:45 to 4:15. We all left, and John Deaver dropped me off at my house. About 4:50 that evening, Chris and John and Mike came back to my house, drove up to Oakleigh Road and finished the beer. Chris said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get some money, be back in a minute,\u201d while we were parked behind A &amp; P on Joppa Road. Five minutes later, Chris and Mike came running back to the car saying, \u201cLet\u2019s get lost.\u201d I then realized something was wrong, and I told Johnny to drop me off at my house. I arrived home about 5:15, and ordered one quarter barrel of beer from Rau\u2019s; waited at my house until about seven until beer arrived; then went down to Norman\u2019s house and drank until I was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Question: Did you have any idea that a holdup was planned?</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Answer: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Question: Did you, yourself, participate in the holdup?</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Answer: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Question: Do you know who Mike and Chris are?</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">Answer: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">Question: Have you ever participated in a holdup or robbery before?</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">Answer: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">Question: Have you told us everything you have been involved in?</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">Answer: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Question: Did you see or receive any money from the holdup?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Answer: No, I didn\u2019t receive any money, but I saw an envelope with money in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Question: Describe Mike, Chris.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Answer: Yes. Both about five foot ten inches, dark brown hair. Mike has short brown hair. Chris has shorter length hair. Both about one hundred fifty pounds. Both wearing blue jeans. Mike had sunglasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Question: Did Deaver go right to the alley or did Mike and Chris tell him where to go?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Answer: Mike and Chris told him where to go.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Question: Did Mike or Chris ever mention the bakery?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Answer: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Question: Would you assume that Deaver had previous knowledge of where Mike and Chris were going to get the money?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">Answer: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">Question: Why?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">' Answer: I don\u2019t think it was ever mentioned in the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-16\">Question: Is there anything else you can add to this statement?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-17\">Answer: No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-18\">Maude Kieth testified on behalf of Digioia that she was working in the Budget Bakery at about noontime on June 27, 1974. She noticed four boys \u201cin and out\u201d of the shop at that time. They were all not in the shop at the same time. None of them were in the shop when she went behind the counter to the desk where she opened the desk drawer to change a twenty dollar bill for a woman customer. She said, \u201c . . . I opened the drawer, and that\u2019s where we keep a brown envelope, well, it\u2019s really a brown manila envelope, and we kept the money in a white envelope in the brown manila envelope, and that\u2019s where I got change.\u201d She was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>present at the time of the robbery that took place five hours later in the day. She gave no description of any of the boys she saw other than they were dressed in dungarees and tennis shoes. When asked by Deaver\u2019s counsel, \u201cMiss Kieth, was Mr. Deaver one of the boys there, to the best of your recollection?\u201d, she replied, \u201cUh-huh\u201d. When asked by the prosecutor, \u201cBut you saw these boys coming in and out during that day, or the Deaver boy?\u201d she responded, \u201cYes, he looks very familiar\u201d. She was not asked to identify \u201cMr. Deaver\u201d or \u201cthe Deaver boy\u201d at the trial, nor is there any evidence of any extra-judicial identification by her of any of the boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Digioia took the stand to testify in his own behalf. At the time of trial he was twenty years old. His testimony confirmed generally his written statement to the police. He said the reason they parked in the alley was to drink beer, and that he had gone there on other occasions for the same purpose. Prior to June 27, 1974, he had known Deaver for three or four months. He did not know the last names of Chris or Mike and had not seen them before or after June 27th. When Chris said (while they were parked in the alley), \u201cI\u2019m going to get some money, be back in a minute\u201d, he \u201cfigured he was going home to get some money\u201d, but when Chris and Mike returned to the car and said \u201cLet\u2019s get lost\u201d, he \u201cthought it was a little suspicious\u201d. Digioia denied any knowledge of or participation in the robbery of the bakery shop. He said the $27.00 he had at the time of his arrest was money he earned from his employment as \u201ca spreader and a machine operator\u201d. He had no prior criminal record. At the time of his arrest on June 27th, he was \u201crather drunk\u201d. On the other hand, the arresting officer testified that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t say\u201d Digioia was \u201cpretty drunk\u201d when arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Deaver also testified in his own behalf. He was twenty years old at time of trial. His testimony also essentially conformed to his oral statement to the police. It differed from Digioia\u2019s statement in that he denied that \u201cMike\u201d or \u201cChris\u201d was in the car when he and Digioia drove to the alley to finish off the beer they had purchased earlier. He agreed with Digioia that Chris was with them and Norman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>McDermitt earlier in the day while drinking beer. But he disclaimed any recollection of a \u201cMike\u201d being with them at any time that day. He thought Chris was a friend of Norman McDermitt. While Deaver and Digioia were drinking beer in the Volkswagen parked in the alley, \u201ctwo guys did come up to the car\u201d. He did not know who they were. He testified: \u201c . . . I\u2019m not sure how they got in the car. I thought they had asked Frank for a ride .... But I\u2019m not quite sure how, what Frank said to them, but we did give them a ride\u201d. He denied any knowledge of or participation in the robbery of the bakery shop. He also denied being in the bakery shop at any time that day, saying, \u201cI went in that bakery one time about two or three years ago, and that\u2019s the only time I can recall ever going in that bakery\u201d. At the time of his arrest he had been \u201claid off\u201d his regular job with a drywell contractor and was working for himself repairing walls for an apartment complex on a part time basis. He further testified that at the time of his arrest he was on probation for his part in an armed robbery of a gasoline station. He had no other criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\n<em>The State\u2019s Theory of Guilt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In finding appellants guilty the trial judge stated no findings as to any underlying facts or otherwise gave any reasons for the verdicts. The State argues, however, that the appellants\u2019 presence seated in Deaver\u2019s automobile within two blocks of the robbery, and their \u201cflight from the scene of the crime\u201d, together with the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d, supports a finding of their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Apparently, the theory is that appellants were principals in the second degree, in that although they did not actually rob the bakery shop they were constructively present at the scene of the robbery because they operated what the State contends was the \u201cget-away\u201d car.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The fatal flaw in the theory is total lack of proof that the \u201ctwo young boys\u201d who robbed the Budget Bakery shop at 5:00 P. M. are the same \u201ctwo boys\u201d or \u201ctwo men\u201d whom young Miss Joynes saw enter Deaver\u2019s car in the alley. It will be recalled that Miss Joynes testified to no description <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>whatsoever concerning the two individuals \u2014 other than that one of them wore sunglasses and one had a \u201cbrownish envelope\u201d in his hand. It will also be recalled that the victim, Mrs. Tenney, said the \u201ctwo young boys\u201d who robbed her wore dungarees and tennis shoes, one of them wore sunglasses, and \u201cboth had hair down to their collars\u201d. Digioia said one of the individuals they picked up in the alley had \u201cshort brown hair\u201d and the other \u201cshorter length hair\u201d, both wore \u201cblue jeans\u201d, and one \u201chad sunglasses\u201d. Thus, the only common descriptive elements were the dungarees (blue jeans) and sunglasses. The evidence that one of the robbers took a <em>white </em>envelope of undetermined size and that one of the individuals seen in the alley (between one and two blocks from the bakery shop) had a <em>\u201clight bro'umish\u201d </em>envelope of undetermined size, if anything, negates identification. With regard to clothing, it is common knowledge that blue jeans (or dungarees) are currently worn by the younger members of our society as the accepted \u201cuniform of the day\u201d on all but the most formal occasions. Such clothing, alone, can hardly be used to distinguish one young person from another, especially in the absence of any evidence of distinguishing features of the particular blue jeans involved, such as holes, patches, floral designs, fading, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">As to the sunglasses, here again we do not think they can serve to identify the \u201cyoung boys\u201d who robbed the bakery shop as the same individuals in the alley. Wearing sunglasses at 5:00 P. M. on June 27th (one of the \u201clongest\u201d days of the year) is certainly not unusual. In the absence of other identification the fact that one of the robbers wore the \u201csame type\u201d sunglasses as those worn by one of the persons in the alley is not helpful to the prosecution\u2019s case. State\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 for identification (the sunglasses shown both Mrs. Tenney and Miss Joynes at trial) were never actually offered as an exhibit. Technically, therefore, the trial judge should not have considered them. He undoubtedly saw them, however, when they were shown to the witnesses, and they are included in the record before us. There is no evidence of anything unique or unusual about them, or that they were not readily available to any member of the buying public.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>On the record before us, we hold that the evidence is legally insufficient to warrant a finding that any of the individuals seen in the alley by Miss Joynes were the actual perpetrators of the armed robbery of the bakery shop. That being so, the appellants could not be guilty, as either principals or accessories, of aiding or abetting them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is no crime to aid or assist someone unless it is shown by substantial evidence that, with the knowledge of the one rendering the assistance, the person assisted has perpetrated or is perpetrating a criminal act. The fact that appellants told somewhat conflicting stories of the identity or non-identity of the individuals they drove from the alley, or that one- of the appellants became \u201csuspicious\u201d of the circumstances, does not, alone, supply that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">It follows from what we have said that the <em>only </em>evidence against the appellants is their presence in the general vicinity of the scene of the crime and their hurried departure therefrom. Such evidence, standing alone, is not enough to support the guilty verdicts. <em>Tasco v. State, </em>223 Md. 503 (1960); <em>Spencer v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 264 (1967); <em>Derricks and Hilgeman v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 261 (1970); <em>Williams v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 58 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Viewing the evidence as a whole, we think the remarks of Judge Gilbert, speaking for this Court in <em>Craig v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 515, at 520, are particularly appropriate to the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201cWe think that the finger of suspicion may well point toward the appellants], but suspicion is not the basis upon which conviction may be predicated\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">We hold that the judgments of conviction were clearly erroneous on the evidence. Md. Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Since we \u201ccannot determine from the record whether or not additional probative evidence can be produced on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>retrial\u201d, we shall, \u201cas the interests of justice appear to require it\u201d, vacate the judgments and remand the case with directions to the trial court to enter judgments of acquittal, unless the State within ten (10) days of the date of our mandate satisfies the trial court that it can produce additional probative evidence of guilt that will warrant a retrial. If the State does preliminarily so satisfy the Court, a new trial may be held according to <em>Gray v. State, </em>254 Md. 385 (1969), as to either or both of the appellants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">\n<em>Judgments vacated and case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-10\">. Appellants were charged as principals and not as accessories. Any proof that they were merely accessories before or after the fact to armed robbery would not have sustained their convictions as principals. Agresti v. State, 2 Md. App. 278 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\"><em>. </em>We recognize that such a retrial could pose a serious question of double jeopardy. See Benton v. Md., 395 U. S. 784 (1969); Sapir v. U. S., 348 U. S. 373 (1955). We note that although Benton v. Md., supra, was decided one week before Gray v. State, supra, it was not mentioned therein. Benton held that Federal double jeopardy standards are applicable to state criminal prosecutions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
