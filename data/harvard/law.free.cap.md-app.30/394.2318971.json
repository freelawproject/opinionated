On October 30, 1974 he was awarded workmen\u2019s compensation benefits by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission (Commission) at the rate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>$65.00 per week, not to exceed the sum of $26,000.00, for permanent disability under \u201cother cases\u201d calculated on the basis of 60% industrial loss of use of the body under Maryland Code Article 101, \u00a7 36 (4) (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Employer and insurer contended that by virtue of the provisions of Maryland Code Article 101, \u00a7 33,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it was discharged in full from any liability or obligation to pay any benefit under Article 101 because of the life pension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>provided by the State of Maryland under Article 73B. The Commission found that the pension benefits provided by Article 73B were equal to or better than any weekly benefit the claimant could receive under any type of permanent disability awarded under Article 101. It is manifest, however, that the Commission adopted claimant\u2019s position that the State Accident Fund was not entitled to an offset under Section 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Employer and insurer and claimant appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County with the cause thereafter being removed to the Circuit Court for Harford County for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">After motion filed in the Circuit Court for Harford County, Judge Close granted summary judgment in favor of the employer and insurer, \u201cBecause the Employer has provided benefits [under Article 73B, \u00a7 11 (6) and (7)] greater than those possible <footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> under Article 101, it is relieved and discharged of any liability or obligation to provide benefits under it [by reason of \u00a7 33].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Claimant on appeal asks us to decide that \u00a7 33 of Article 101 has no application to pensioned employees, but is limited in application solely to workmen\u2019s compensation cases where there have been awards of \u201cbenefits resulting from the death of an employee.\u201d Claimant recognizes that in <em>Nooe v. Mayor </em>&amp; <em>City Council of Baltimore, </em>28 Md. App. 348, 345 A. 2d 134 (1975),<footnotemark>5a</footnotemark> we considered the precise question here in issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>He asks us to reconsider our holding in <em>Nooe, \u201c* </em>* * that the payment * * * of the pension [providing a benefit equal to or better than any benefit provided for in Article 101] satisfied and discharged in full the liability or obligation of the [employer] for any benefit under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation law.\u201d 28 Md. App. at 356 [139].</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">We have reviewed and now reaffirm our decision in <em>Nooe. </em>For the reasons stated in <em>Nooe </em>we reiterate that \u00a7 33 must be interpreted to apply to cases involving permanent disability and hold that under the circumstances of this case the section must be interpreted as applying to this claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Alternatively, appellant contends that \u00a7 33 is unconstitutional under both the State and the United States Constitutions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The desirability for coordination of the overall system of wage-loss protection and the constitutional issues arising in statutory efforts to achieve it, are discussed in Larson\u2019s <em>Workmen's Compensation Law </em>in the following sections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">\u201c\u00a797.00 Once it is recognized that workmen\u2019s compensation is one unit in an overall system of wage-loss protection, rather than something resembling a recovery in tort or on a private accident policy, the conclusion follows that duplication of benefits from different parts of the system should not ordinarily be allowed. Since most social legislation in the United States has appeared in unrelated fragments, lack of coordination resulting in cumulation of benefits is quite common; but newer legislation is more carefully drawn to prevent this result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">\u201c\u00a797.10 Impropriety of duplicate benefits</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-11\">Wage-loss legislation is designed to restore to the worker a portion, such as one-half to two-thirds, of wages lost due to the three major causes of wage-loss: physical disability, economic unem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ployment, and old age. The crucial operative fact is that of wage loss; the cause of the wage loss merely dictates the category of legislation applicable. Now if a workman undergoes a period of wage loss due to all three conditions, it does not follow that he should receive three sets of benefits simultaneously and thereby recover mere than his actual wage. He is experiencing only one wage loss and, in any logical system, should receive only one wage-loss benefit. This conclusion is inevitable, once it is recognized that workmen\u2019s compensation, unemployment compensation, non-occupational sickness and disability insurance, and old age and survivors\u2019 insurance are all parts of a system based upon a common principle. If this is denied, then all coordination becomes impossible and social legislation becomes a grab-bag of assorted unrelated benefits. For example, if workmen\u2019s compensation is thought of as a quasi-tort recovery, there will be a temptation to say that the injured workman should be entitled to keep the entire recovery without reference to any other legislative benefits he may receive for the same wage loss. Again, if non-occupational disability insurance is viewed, as it was for a time in Rhode Island, as essentially equivalent to private health and accident insurance, the argument will be heard that a worker has just as much right to keep both occupational and non-occupational disability benefits as he would have to collect both workmen\u2019s compensation and the proceeds of a private accident policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">\u201c\u00a797.32 Constitutionality of the offset provision</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">The constitutionality issue is at this writing before the United States Supreme Court, <footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> and consequently the discussion of the point will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>confined to a brief account of the state of case law in the lower courts and the principal lines of argument. All but one <footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> of the decisions on the constitutional issue in federal district and circuit courts have held the offset constitutional. The case for constitutionality is well expounded in the Sixth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Lofty v. Richardson </em>[440 F. 2d 1144] * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">The main line of attack in this case was that Congress did not also create an offset for such benefits as private insurance proceeds and recoveries in damage suits. The court reviewed the development of Supreme Court cases establishing a very broad congressional discretion in adopting classifications for legislative purposes. It then examined the legislative history of the offset, stressing that the main purpose was to eliminate the kind of duplication of benefits that in many instances resulted in total benefits exceeding actual previous wage while working. The court set out in full a table \u2018purporting to show that continued duplication of benefits under terms of the then pending bill would mean at least some payments in excess of prior average \u201ctake home pay\u201d in every state, and up to a maximum of 247% in the instance of Arizona.\u2019 The adverse effect of this situation on incentives to become rehabilitated and to return to work was noted. As to the invidious classification argument, the court adduced three answers. The first was that there had been widespread complaints about double coverage as to compensation and social security, but no such complaints as to the proceeds of private insurance or negligence actions. The second was that administratively it would be relatively simple to enforce the compensation offset, while to calculate and apply a reduction for private insurance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>civil damages might offer severe difficulties. The third reason was the most important:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">\u2018Finally, it is entirely conceivable to us that Congress may have considered Social Security benefits and Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits to be more arguably duplicative of one another than could appropriately be claims concerning Social Security benefits and the other two types of payments. Both Social Security and Workmen\u2019s Compensation are social welfare legislation. Private accident or disability insurance is a private - contract, frequently paid for entirely by the recipient. And, of course, court awards for injuries are private rights derived from the common law involving the principle of compensation for negligence or fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">Most of the argument for the Workmen\u2019s Compensation offset came from employers who generally pay all of the costs for Workmen\u2019s Compensation and half of the costs of the Social Security benefits. Their argument before Congress was that they were paying twice for the same injury. This argument would have, of course, no merit at all in relation to a damage action award or to the proceeds of privately purchased accident or disability insurance.\u2019 \u201d [Quotation from <em>Lofty v. Richardson </em>cited in text.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-8\"><em>Lofty v. Richardson, </em>440 F. 2d 1144 (6th Cir. 1971) dealt with a congressional offset amendment requiring reduction of social security disability benefits when their recipients also are receiving State workmen\u2019s compensation benefits and the combined total of both exceed 80% of the worker\u2019s average wage. The Court rejected the contention that the offset statute\u2019s failure to include benefits derived from private insurance or from civil damage suits produced \u201can arbitrary and capricious classification which cannot stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>when tested against the due process clause\u201d (at 1146). In doing so the Court pointed out that \u201c* * * there is a good deal of case law which serves to illustrate the breadth of legislative power accorded the Congress (or the states) by the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the constitutional limitations contained in the due process and equal protection clauses\u201d (at 1146). <em>See: e.g. Admr., Motor Veh. Adm. v. Vogt, </em>267 Md. 660, 676, 299 A. 2d 1, 9 (1973), declaring: \u201c* * * a cardinal rule to be observed in determining whether a statute is violative of the Equal Protection Clause is that the legislature exercises a broad scope of discretion in establishing classifications, subject only to the requirement of reasonableness in doing so.\u201d; <em>A &amp; H Transp. Inc. v. Baltimore, </em>249 Md. 518, 529, 240 A. 2d 601, 606 (1968), declaring, \u201cThese [constitutional] limits are not exceeded under the due process clauses of the Maryland and Federal Constitutions unless the party challenging the ordinance can show that it is arbitrary, oppressive or unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Appellant contends, without justification, we think, that the <em>pension </em>provided by Article 73B constitutes a contract that may not be impaired. We find it plain that the <em>pension </em>is a benefit or gratuity provided by the State entirely at its expense. Article 73B, \u00a7 1 (17) (1975 Cum. Supp.) defines the word <em>pension </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">\u201c Tension\u2019 shall mean payments for life derived from money provided by the State. All pensions shall be payable in equal monthly installments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The statute makes a clear distinction with respect to an <em>annuity </em>resulting from employee contributions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The last mentioned contention, among others, fades away with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Richardson v. Belcher, </em>404 U. S. 78, 92 S. Ct. 254, 30 L.Ed.2d 231 (1971). In <em>Richardson,, </em>as in <em>Lofty, </em>supra, the Court was dealing with the Federal statute requiring reductions in social security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>disability benefits when the recipients received workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. In <em>Richardson </em>it was said at 80 [256-57] [234]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">\u201cIn our last consideration of a challenge to the constitutionality of a classification created under the Social Security Act, we held that \u2018a person covered by the Act has not such a right in benefit payments as would make every defeasance of \u201caccrued\u201d interests violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u2019 Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 611, 80 S. Ct. 1367, 1373, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435. The fact that social security benefits are financed in part by taxes on an employee\u2019s wages does not in itself limit the power of Congress to fix the levels of benefits under the Act or the conditions upon which they may be paid. Nor does an expectation of public benefits confer a contractual right to receive the expected amounts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The Court added at 81 [257] [235]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">\u201cThe appellee argues that the classification embodied in \u00a7 224 is arbitrary because it discriminates between those disabled employees who receive workmen\u2019s compensation and those who receive compensation from private insurance or from tort claim awards. We cannot say that this difference in treatment is constitutionally invalid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">\u201cA statutory classification in the area of social welfare is consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if it is \u2018rationally based and free from invidious discrimination.\u2019 Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 487, 90 S. Ct. 1153, 1162, 25 L.Ed.2d 491. While the present case, involving as it does \u2022 a federal statute, does not directly implicate the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause, a classification that meets the test articulated in <em>Dandridge </em>is perforce consistent with the due \u2022 process requirement of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The Court concluded by saying at 84 [258] [236]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">\u201cIf the goals sought are legitimate, and the classification adopted is rationally related to the achievement of those goals, then the action of Congress is not so arbitrary as to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Constitutionality of offset statutes similarly has been upheld in State Court decisions. <em>See: e.g. Myers v. State, </em>428 P. 2d 83 (Colorado 1967); <em>Lyons v. City of Los Angeles, </em>119 Cal. Rep. 159 (Court of Appeal 2d Dist. Div. 3 1975). See also other cases in accord as listed in footnote 2 of <em>Richardson v. Belcher, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Because we accept the rules of law declared in the cited cases as proper to be applied to the facts and circumstances of the subject case, we deem it unnecessary to engage in a particular discussion of the many cases cited by appellant. It will suffice to say that we have concluded that they are distinguishable on their facts or express legal views to which we will not adhere, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The decisions heretofore cited and adopted by us herein, have answered all constitutional issues posed here save two. They are: (1) the suggestion that the offset statute involves an unconstitutional classification in that it applies to State employees to the exclusion of others, and (2) that it permits an unconstitutional taking in violation of Maryland Constitution Article III, \u00a7 40.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">We see merit in neither contention. As to the suggested invidious discrimination, see <em>Strohmeyer v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>396 S.W.2d 1 (Mo. App. 1965). As to the last remaining contention, if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Article 73B, \u00a7 16 conferred a contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>vested right upon the claimant, it remains crystal clear that Article 101, \u00a7 33 took nothing thereby conferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ABZ\">\n<em>Appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\">.
