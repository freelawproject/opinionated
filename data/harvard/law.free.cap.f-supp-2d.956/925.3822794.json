HOLDERMAN, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Plaintiff and patent-owner Innovatio IP Ventures, LLC (\u201cInnovatio\u201d) has sued numerous hotels, coffee shops, restaurants, supermarkets, and other commercial users of wireless internet technology located throughout the United States (collectively, the \u201cWireless Network Users\u201d). Innovatio alleges that the Wireless Network Users provide wireless internet access to their customers or use it to manage internal processes, and by doing so infringe various claims of twenty-three patents owned by Innovatio. (Dkt. No. 198; Dkt. No. 451.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Cisco Systems, Inc., Motorola Solutions, Inc., SonicWALL, Inc., Netgear, Inc., and Hewlett-Packard Co. (collectively, the \u201cManufacturers\u201d) each manufacture devices used by the Wireless Network Users to implement their wireless internet networks. (Dkt. No. 819, Ex. A \u00b6 10.) The Manufacturers have filed declaratory judgment actions against Innovatio seeking a declaration that the Manufacturers\u2019 products, and the networks or systems of which those products are a part, do not infringe Innovatio\u2019s patents, and that Innovatio\u2019s patents are invalid. <em>(See </em>Dkt. Nos. 431, 442; <em>see also </em>12 CV 426, Dkt. No. 1; 12 CV 2773, Dkt. No. 1.) Innovatio, in turn, has alleged that the Manufacturers all infringe the same twenty-three patents Innovatio has asserted against the Wireless Network Users. (Dkt. Nos. 311-314.) All claims, cases, and parties were transferred-for pretrial coordination before this court by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in this MDL case, No. 2303. (Dkt. No. 1.) For ease of reference (and ignoring that some of them are also declaratory judgment plaintiffs), the court will refer to the Wireless Network Users and the Manufacturers collectively as the \u201cDefendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Following discovery, but before claim construction, the parties and the court agreed that the best course toward resolving the parties\u2019 dispute would be to pause and evaluate the potential damages available to Innovatio if the Defendants are found to infringe Innovatio\u2019s patents. <em>(See </em>Dkt. No. 614 (\u201c2/21/13 Trans.\u201d) at 24:6-26:18.) The Defendants contend that Innovatio\u2019s patents are all essential to the operation of the 802.11 wireless standard established by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (\u201cIEEE,\u201d pronounced \u201ceye-triple-ee\u201d), and that Innovatio is therefore subject to the promises of the prior owners of the patents-in-suit to license the patents on reasonable and nondiscriminatory (\u201cRAND\u201d) terms. The Defendants assert that, at most, Innovatio can recover no more than a reasonable and non-diseriminatory royalty if the Defendants are found to infringe the asserted claims of Innovatio\u2019s patents-in-suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">The impact of the RAND obligation on the recovery potentially available to Innovatio is an issue the parties and the court are addressing at this stage of the litigation to assist the parties. After establishing the potential recovery, the court hopes the parties will be able to evaluate the potential benefit of expending additional resources contesting infringement. Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>dressing damages first may thus aid settlement of this dispute. Because the impact of the RAND obligation is a damages question, the parties are entitled to a jury determination on that issue. Both parties have waived that right, however, and agree that the court should decide all RAND-related issues in summary proceedings and, if necessary, a bench trial. <em>(See </em>Dkt. No. 600, at 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">As a first step to determining the damages to which Innovatio would be entitled, if it proves infringement, the court requested the parties to identify the patent claims that are subject to the RAND obligation. (Dkt. No. 662.) The Defendants contend that all of Innovatio\u2019s asserted patent claims are subject to the RAND obligation. Innovatio, by contrast, contends that approximately 168 of its asserted claims are not essential to implement the 802.11 standard, and are therefore not subject to the RAND obligation. The following chart lists the asserted claims of each patent-in-suit with respect to which the parties dispute essentiality, and those on which they agree:</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Patent Number Claims the Parties Agree Are Standard-Essential Disputed Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">5,740,366 5-7, 9-12, 15-16,19-21, 24, 26-29, 32 8,13,14, 22, 23, 25</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">5,940,771 1-7</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">6,374,311 35, 37, 39,'41, 43-44, 48, 49, 51,'55, 60, 64 20-24, 26-30, 32-34, 36, 40, 45-47, 50, 53, 54, 56</p>\n<p id=\"b968-17\">18, 22, 27, 28, 30, 33, 82, 86, 88, 90, 94, 98,100 7,457,646 14-17, 19-21, 26, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 39, 43-45, 47, 49-51, 53-56, 59-64, 66-69, 71-73, 79, 83-85, 87, 89, 91-93, 99, 101-104, 107, 108, 111, 112, 114-123, 125-128, _130,135-137,143-144_</p>\n<p id=\"b968-20\">7,536,167 73-77, 80-83,' 89-97, 100, 102-107, 110-113, 119-127, 79, 85,109,115 _130,132-134, 203_</p>\n<p id=\"b968-22\">7,873,343 1-6, 8-11, 15-20, 22, 23, 25, 28-36, 38-41, 45-50, 52, 12, 42 _53, 55, 58-60_</p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">6,714,559 6-8</p>\n<p id=\"b968-25\">7,386,002 1-2, 4, 6, 7,14,16,18,19</p>\n<p id=\"b968-27\">7,535,921 1-5, 7-8</p>\n<p id=\"b968-29\">7,548,553 10-12,17,19, 20</p>\n<p id=\"b968-31\">7,916,747 1-3, 5-8,11,13,16,17; 20-25</p>\n<p id=\"b968-33\">5,546,397 1-5</p>\n<p id=\"b968-35\">5,844,893 7-11</p>\n<p id=\"b968-37\">6,665,536 1, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13-17, 19-21, 23, 24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 37, 39-42, 49, 50</p>\n<p id=\"b968-39\">6,697,415 11, 12, 15</p>\n<p id=\"b968-41\">7,013,138 1, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13-15, 17, 18, 21, 24, 26, 28, 36-39</p>\n<p id=\"b968-43\">7,710,907 1, 7, 10, 12,13, 15-17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 30, 33, 35, 36, 38-40, 43, 44, 46-50_</p>\n<p id=\"b968-45\">7,107,052 1, 5, 6, 8-12, 15, 16</p>\n<p id=\"b969-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>7,710,935 .1, 5, 6, 8-12,15, 16, 25-28, 32-35, _37-42, 44-47</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">5,295,154</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">5,428,636</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">5,504,746</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">6,826,165</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">The court must determine which of those 168 disputed claims are subject to a RAND obligation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The question is fully briefed.. (Dkt. Nos. 684, 707, 747.) To aid the court in its analysis, the parties have categorized the 168 claims into different technical categories, and they agree that all of the patent claims in each of the categories are either standard-essential or non-standard-essential. (Dkt. No. 774.) Following their initial submission of the categories, the parties further refined the categories and the claims in dispute. The court will use the parties\u2019 most recent categorization of the disputed claims. <em>(See </em>Dkt. Nos. 795, 797.)</p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">To assist the court in understanding the technology underlying the dispute, the court held an informal discussion regarding the technology with the parties\u2019 designated experts and counsel on the record on July 17, 2013. <em>(See </em>Dkt. No. 833.) Thereafter, on July 18 and 19, 2013, the court held a bench trial on the essentiality question. (Dkt. Nos. 836-839.) Prior to that bench trial, during the May 30, 2013, status hearing, the court addressed the question of which party bears the burden of proving that a claim is standard-essential, and also ruled on the question of whether all claims in a patent together must be either standard-essential or non-standard-essential. This opinion provides a further explanation of the court\u2019s ruling on those two questions, in addition to resolving the other issues in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-14\">At the July 2013 bench trial, the court heard argument from the parties and also testimony from several witnesses. Innovatio presented the testimony of Dr. Raymond W. Nettleton, an Associate Professor at the University of Colorado. The Defendants presented the testimony of Dr. Stephen B. Wicker, a member of the faculty of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. The court also accepted the Defendants\u2019 presentation of stipulated testimony from the informal discussion by Dr. Matthew B. Shoemake, a former officer of the IEEE and the CEO of Biscotti Inc. (Dkt. No. 820.) The parties by agreement presented additional testimony on paper by designating portions of the depositions of certain witnesses, including Dr. Nettleton. <em>(See </em>Dkt. Nos. 800, 801, 815.) Finally, the parties also agreed to accept the declarations of their, respective experts in lieu of direct examination (Dkt. No. 798 (\u201c7/10/13 Trans.\u201d), at 34:5-36:8), so the court has treated the declarations of Dr. Nettleton (Dkt. No. 747, Ex. 4), Dr. Shoemake (Dkt. No. 708, Ex. B), and Dr. Wicker (Dkt. No 708, Ex. C; Dkt. No. 790, Ex. A) as if they had given that testimony in court. Final<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>ly, the parties have submitted a statement of stipulated facts to which both sides agree. (Dkt. No. 819, Ex. A.)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">I. The IEEE and the 802.11 Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">The IEEE is a professional association and developer of technical standards. (Dkt. No. 819, Ex. A \u00b6 50.) Beginning in 1990, the IEEE formed a working group to establish the 802.11 standard for the operation of wireless local area networks (\u201cWLANs\u201d \u2014 also known as \u201cwireless Ethernet,\u201d \u201cWireless' Fidelity,\u201d or \u201cWi-Fi\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 51.) The IEEE continues to publish amendments to. that standard periodically. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 52.) Devices such as wireless routers, laptops, and cell phones that are compliant with the standard will be able to communicate effectively with one another in any WLAN. By establishing the 802.11 standard, the IEEE has ensured that the wireless devices of various manufacturers are interoperable, and that consumers are therefore able to purchase wireless devices from a variety of manufacturers without worrying about whether the device's will be compatible with each other. As a result, consumers experience no switching costs if they choose to buy wireless devices from different manufacturers, leading to greater price competition. <em>See Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola, Inc., </em>No. C10-1823, 2013 WL 2111217, at *5 (W.D.Wash. Apr. 25, 2013) (Robart, J.) (describing the role of standard-setting organizations).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Although the standard-setting process has many potential benefits for consumers, there are dangers. After a standard is established, for example, every manufacturer of compliant products must use the technology stated in the standard. If one particular company owns a patent covering that technology, however, the standard will effectively force all others to buy that company\u2019s technology if they want to practice the standard. This requirement allows the company to charge inflated prices that reflect not only the intrinsic value of its technology, but also the inflated value attributable to its technology\u2019s designation as the industry standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">II. Innovatio\u2019s RAND Obligations</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">' To avoid this phenomenon (often called \u201cpatent hold-up,\u201d <em>see Microsoft, </em>2013 WL 2111217, at *10), standard-setting organizations like the IEEE often require owners of standard-essential patents to promise ,to license their patents on RAND terms before the establishment of the standard. Prior to being acquired by Innovatio, Innovatio\u2019s patents were owned by Intermec Technologies Corporation (a subsidiary of UNOYA) and\u2018Intermec IP Corporation (collectively \u201cInternee\u201d), Norand Corporation (\u201cNorand\u201d), or Broadcom Corp. (\u201cBroadcom\u201d). (Dkt. No. 819, Ex. A \u00b6 53.) Each of those previous owners of Innovatio\u2019s patents agreed to license any standard-essential technology covered by their patents on RAND terms. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 54.) For example, on October 26, 1995, Intermec, wrote to the IEEE that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-12\">[i]n the event that patents issue to, or are acquired by, Intermec in the future which Intermec believes will read on devices operating under the proposed IEEE 802.11 Standard, Intermec will (upon written request from any third party) grant a nonexclusive, nontransferable sole and personal license under any such issued patent on a nondiscriminatory basis, on terms and conditions which Intermec deems reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">(Dkt. No. 709, Ex. 6.) Similarly, on October 17, 2006, Broadcom<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> wrote to the IEEE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>that, \u201cwith respect to any patent(s) and/or patent application(s) that it may hold or control, the use of which would be essential to create a compliant implementation of either mandatory or optional portions of the [Proposed] IEEE Standard,\u201d it promised to \u201cgrant a license under reasonable rates to an unrestricted number of applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis with reasonable terms and conditions.\u201d (Dkt. No. 709, Ex. 7.), Broadcom and Norand wrote similar letters to IEEE on September 6, 2002, and June 20, 1997. <em>(See </em>Dkt. No. 709, Exs. 8-10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">The parties do not dispute that the letters of Innovatio\u2019s predecessors in interest to the IEEE constitute binding contractual commitments to the IEEE and its members. <em>See Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola, Inc., </em>854 F.Supp.2d 993, 999 (W.D.Wash.2012) (\u201cThe court agrees with Microsoft that through Motorola\u2019s letters to both the IEEE and ITU, Motorola has entered into binding contractual commitments to license its essential patents on RAND terms.\u201d); <em>see also Apple, Inc. v. Motorola Mobility, Inc., </em>886 F.Supp.2d 1061, 1083 (W.D.Wis.2012) (\u201cIn this case, the combination of the policies and bylaws of the standard-setting organizations, Motorola\u2019s membership in those organizations and Motorola\u2019s assurances that it would license its essential patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms constitute contractual agreements.\u201d). Moreover, this court has already held that those commitments are now binding on Innovatio, and that they can be enforced by the Defendants as potential users of the 802.11 standard and thus third-party beneficiaries of the agreements between Innovatio\u2019s predecessors and the IEEE. <em>See In re Innovatio IP Ventures, LLC Patent Litig., </em>921 F.Supp.2d 903, 923 (N.D.Ill.2013) (\u201cThe longstanding rule in Illinois, and elsewhere, is that \u2018the promisee of a third-party-beneficiary contract may bring suit for a breach of that contract and recover damages therefor.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Carmack v. Great Am. Indem. Co., </em>400 Ill. 93, 78 N.E.2d 507, 511 (1948))).</p>\n<p id=\"AhV\">In addition, the parties agree that the terms of the RAND commitment by which Innovatio is bound are established by the current IEEE Standards Board Bylaws promulgated in 2007. (Dkt. No. 684, Ex. B (\u201cIEEE Bylaws\u201d); <em>see also </em>Dkt. No. 819, Ex. A \u00b6 56.) Moreover, the parties agree that the current IEEE Bylaws provide the applicable terms even though the current IEEE- Bylaws were not in effect at the times that Innovatio\u2019s predecessors entered into the RAND commitments. <em>(See </em>Dkt. No. 759 (\u201c5/30/13 Trans.\u201d) at 13:23-16:11.) The court will therefore use the current IEEE Bylaws to define the scope of Innovatio\u2019s RAND obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">Those bylaws provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-9\">IEEE standards may be drafted in terms that include the use of Essential Patent Claims. If the IEEE receives notice that a [Proposed] IEEE Standard may require the use of a potential Essential Patent Claim, the IEEE shall request licensing assurance, on the IEEE Standards Board approved Letter of Assurance form, from the patent holder or patent applicant....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-10\">A Letter of Assurance shall be either: a) A general disclaimer to the effect that the Submitter without conditions will not enforce any' present or future Essential Patent Claims against any person or entity making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing, distributing, or implementing a compliant implementation of the standard; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>b) A statement that a license for a compliant implementation of the standard will be made available to an unrestricted number of applicants on a worldwide basis without compensation or under reasonable rates, with reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">(IEEE Bylaws \u00a7 6.2.) Innovatio\u2019s RAND obligations are all of the type described in subparagraph \u201cb.\u201d The I\u00c9EE Bylaws define an \u201cEssential Patent Claim\u201d to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah3\">any Patent Claim the use of which was necessary to create a compliant implementation of either mandatory or optional portions of the normative clauses of the [Proposed] IEEE Standard when, at the time of the [Proposed] IEEE Standard\u2019s approval, there was no commercially and technically feasible non-infringing alternative. \u2022 An Essential Patent Claim does not include any Patent Claim that was essential only for Enabling Technology or any claim other than that set forth above even if contained in the same patent as the Essential Patent Claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-5\"><em>(Id. </em>\u00a7 6.1.) \u201cEnabling Technology\u201d is further defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-6\">any technology that may be necessary to make or use any product or portion thereof that complies with the [Proposed] IEEE Standard but is neither explicitly required by nor expressly set forth in the [Proposed] IEEE Standard (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing technology, compiler .technology, object-oriented technology, basic operating' system technology, and the like).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">\n<em>(Id.)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">III. Technical Background</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">The 802.11 standard establishes protocols for establishing wireless communications among devices in a local area. The IEEE has promulgated various amendments to the standard over the years, which are designated by letters, such as 802.11a or 802.11g. Because the parties do not distinguish among the various standards in their briefing (citing various amendments but focusing primarily on the 802.11g amendment to the standard released in 2003 and the 802.11n amendment released in 2009), the court accepts as undisputed that a patent claim is standard-essential if it is essential to implement any version of the standard. Periodically, the amendments are \u201crolled up\u201d and released as a new comprehensive version of the standard. Various versions of the standard are available online at http:// standards.ieee.org/about/get/ (last visited July 26, 2013). For simplicity, and following the industry practice, the court cites the amendments and the roll-ups of the standard by the year in which they were released. For example, \u00a7 1.1 of the 2012 version of the standard will be cited as IEEE Std. 802.11-2012 \u00a7 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">A group of devices, or \u201cstations,\u201d communicating on an 802.11 WLAN is known as a \u201cservice set.\u201d IEEE Std. 802.11-2012 \u00a7 4.3.1. In an independent basic service set, two or more stations communicate directly with one another. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4.3.2. More often, however, stations communicate through an access point, a device through which the communications of many stations in the service set can be routed, to form a \u201cbasic service set.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4.3.4.1. There may be multiple access points in a service set. In addition, an access point may be connected to a \u201cdistribution system\u201d (for example, an Ethernet connection to the internet), which allows it to communicate with other access points and stations in other service sets. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4.3.6. The 802.11 standard does not define any of the functionality of the distribution system itself. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5.5 (\u201cThe implementation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>the [distribution system] is unspecified and is beyond the scope of this standard.\u201d). A network of service sets is known as an extended service set. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4.3.4.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">The 802.11 standard is a set of traffic rules that the access points use to direct the wireless traffic among stations in a service set. Protocols for traffic direction are necessary because wireless devices communicate via radio waves. If two stations attempt to transmit a message at the same time on the same radio frequency, the waves will interfere with one another (often called a \u201ccollision\u201d), causing the resulting message to be incomprehensible. To avoid collisions, the 802.11 standard prescribes a medium access control (\u201cMAC\u201d) protocol to ensure that only one station is speaking at a time, and that other stations are listening to'it when appropriate. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5-6. Because many stations are portable and battery-powered, minimizing power usage is important. Consequently, the 802.11 MAC protocol includes provisions that allow stations to \u201csleep\u201d when they are not communicating with the access point, and to \u201cwake up\u201d at various intervals to retrieve any messages that may be waiting for them. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">In addition to the need to avoid collisions, wireless networks also face the competing challenge of including as much, information as possible in the radio waves to enable a quicker transfer of information. The 802.11 standard prescribes several different physical layer (\u201cPHY\u201d) protocols that prescribe how information should be encoded in each radio wave by varying its frequency, amplitude, or phase. Different PHY protocols have different advantages. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 7. For example, the frequency-hopping spread spectrum PHY instructs stations periodically to change or \u201chop\u201d frequencies based on a predetermined pattern, thus making collisions less likely. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 14. The direct sequence spread spectrum (\u201cDSSS\u201d) PHY multiplies each data bit to ensure that if some bits are lost, the receiving station can still interpret the message. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 16. Thus, instead of sending \u201c10,\u201d the device might send \u201c1111100000.\u201d Even if the receiving device hears the corrupted message 1101100100, it can still interpret the message as \u201c10.\u201d The DSSS PHY is reliable, but sends information at a lower rate than other PHY protocols. In another example, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (\u201cOFDM\u201d) PHY defines various \u201csymbols\u201d (comprising radio waves of a certain frequency and amplitude) to signify multiple data bits. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 18. As a result, stations using OFDM can transmit a greater volume of information. The 2009 Amendments to the 802.11 standard introduced the high throughput (\u201cHT\u201d) PHY specification, which uses multiple antennas transmitting on different frequencies at one time to increase still further the efficiency of data transfer. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">The 802.11 standard, the formal title of which is \u201cWireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications\u201d deals explicitly only with PHY and MAC functions. <em>Id. </em>at i. Higher level functions that build on the PHY and MAC functions are not explicitly addressed in the 802.11 standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Other sections and functions of the 802.11 standard are addressed as necessary in the discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">At this stage of the proceedings, the court is faced with only the limited question of which of the asserted claims in Innovatio\u2019s patents are standard-essential and thus potentially subject to Innovatio\u2019s RAND commitment. As a preliminary matter, the court must first determine which party bears the burden of establish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>ing whether the patent claims are standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The Defendants contend that \u201cas the party bound by RAND, Innovatio bears the burden of establishing entitlement to carve out particular patents (or claims) from its RAND obligations.\u201d (Dkt. No. 707, at 9 n. 10.) That argument is question-begging, however, as the issue in dispute is precisely to what extent Innovatio is bound by RAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Innovatio has a more plausible argument when it contends that the assertion of RAND is like an affirmative defense on which the Defendants bear the burden of proof. <em>Stockton E. Water Dist. v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1344, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2009), <em>modified on reh\u2019g in part, </em>638 F.3d 781 (Fed.Cir.2011) (\u201cThe proponent of the affirmative defense must prove all elements of the defense.\u201d). The existence of a RAND obligation is comparable to the existence of a license, which is also a contractual commitment limiting' the liability of a patent infringer. In a typical patent case, the accused infringer bears the burden of demonstrating the existence of a license, and that it is thus not liable for its infringement. Similarly here, the Defendants as the accused infringers should bear the burden of demonstrating the existence of a RAND obligation that limits their damages if they are found to infringe. The alternative would be to assume in patent litigation that every potentially standard-essential claim is subject to RAND until the patent owner demonstrates otherwise, a rule that would be overly burdensome for patent owners. The court thus assigns to the Defendants the burden of establishing the RAND commitment with respect to each patent claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">As another preliminary matter, the Defendants contend that Innovatio is obligated to license entire <em>patents </em>on RAND terms, rather than merely individual <em>patent claims. </em>(Dkt. No. 707, at 18.) Accordingly, the Defendants assert that the RAND commitment applies to an entire patent if any claim in the patent is standard-essential. That argument gains some support from the Letters of Assurance from Innovatio\u2019s predecessors, some of which promise .to license \u201cpatents.\u201d <em>(See, e.g., </em>Dkt. No. 709, Ex. 6 (\u201cIntermec will ... grant a nonexclusive, nontransferable sole and personal license under <em>any such issued patent </em>.... (emphasis added)).) The problem, however, is that the IEEE Bylaws, which the parties have agreed define the terms of Innovatio\u2019s RAND commitment, explicitly provide that \u201c[a]n Essential Patent Claim does not include ... any claim other than that set forth above even if contained in the same patent as the Essential Patent Claim.\u201d (Dkt. No. 684, Ex. B. \u00a7 6.2.) The IEEE Bylaws therefore plainly contemplate that some claims, but not others, in a particular patent may be standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">\u2018 More generally, patent law looks to individual claims to define the scope of a patent right. As the Federal Circuit has explained, \u201c[a] patent is infringed if any claim is infringed ... for each claim is a separate statement of the patented invention.\u201d <em>Pall Corp. v. Micron Separations, Inc., </em>66 F.3d 1211, 1220 (Fed.Cir.1995); <em>accord Honeywell Int\u2019l Inc. v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., </em>370 F.3d 1131, 1148 (Fed.Cir.2004) (\u201cEach claim defines a separate invention, whether or not written in independent form; and its validity stands or falls separately .... \u201d); <em>Bio-Tech. Gen. Corp. v. Genentech, Inc., </em>80 F.3d 1553, 1561 n. 8 (Fed.Cir.1996) (\u201cInfringement of one valid and enforceable patent claim is all that is required for liability to arise.\u201d). Given that basic attribute of patent law, the promise to license any standard-essential patent must be interpreted as a promise to license only the standard-essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>claims, the basic unit for evaluation of any-patented invention. The court will therefore evaluate each patent claim separately for standard-essentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">I. The Meaning of \u201cEssential Patent Claim\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">The parties agree that the phrase \u201cEssential Patent Claim\u201d is defined by the IEEE Bylaws. The definition in the IEEE Bylaws states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQm\">\u201cEssential Patent Claim\u201d shall mean any Patent Claim the use of which was necessary to create a compliant implementation of either mandatory or optional portions of the normative clauses of the [Proposed] IEEE Standard when, at the time of the [Proposed] IEEE Standard\u2019s approval, there was no commercially and technically feasible non-infringing alternative. An Essential Patent Claim does not include any Patent Claim that was essential only for Enabling Technology or any claim other than that set forth above even if contained in the same patent as the Essential Patent Claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAF\">(IEEE Bylaws \u00a7 6.1.) The definition includes two sentences. The first sentence describes the scope of an Essential Patent Claim as any claim \u201cthe use of which was necessary to create a compliant implementation\u201d of the 802.11 standard\u2019s \u201cmandatory or optional\u201d provisions so long as \u201cat the time of the [standard\u2019s] approval, there was no commercially and technically non-infringing alternative.\u201d The second sentence carves out an exception to the first sentence by stating that an Essential Patent Claim does not include any claims that are \u201cessential only for Enabling Technology\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">A bedrock principle of the interpretation of legal texts is that a statute or contract \u201cshould be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.\u201d <em>Corley v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 303, 314, 129 S.Ct. 1558, 173 L.Ed.2d 443 (2009) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The exception in the second sentence would be superfluous unless it carves out of the definition territory included by the first sentence. The claims that are \u201cnecessary to create a compliant implementation\u201d of the 802.11 standard under the first sentence must therefore include the claims described in the second sentence, those that are \u201cessential only for Enabling Technology.\u201d The IEEE Bylaws, moreover, define \u201cEnabling Technology\u201d to be \u201cany technology that may be necessary to make or use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>any product or portion thereof that complies with the [Proposed] IEEE Standard but <em>is neither explicitly required by nor expressly set forth in the [Proposed] IEEE Standard.\u201d </em>(IEEE Bylaws \u00a7 6.1 (emphasis added).) The first sentence therefore must include claims for technology that are necessary to implement the 802.11 standard, but that are not explicitly required by the standard. Otherwise, the second sentence would be unnecessary surplusage. Accordingly, a claim may be \u201cnecessary for a compliant implementation\u201d without being explicitly required by the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">As the first sentence of the definition clarifies, moreover, the term \u201cnecessary\u201d does not mean \u201cabsolutely necessary.\u201d Instead, a claim is \u201cnecessary\u201d when there is \u201cno commercially or technically feasible non-infringing alternative\u201d by which to implement the standard. In other words, to determine if a claim is necessary, one must ask if there were commercially and technically feasible non-infringing alternative ways to implement the standard at the time of the standard\u2019s approval. Even if some prohibitively expensive alternative technically existed when the standard was approved, a claim may still be necessary, because no alternative was \u201ccommercially\u201d feasible. Similarly, even if one could hypothesize an alternative way to implement the standard, a claim is still standard-essential if that hypothetical implementation was not technically feasible when the standard was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The first sentence also describes <em>when </em>to evaluate whether a claim is necessary for implementation of the standards: \u201cat the time of the [Proposed] IEEE Standard\u2019s approval.\u201d If later technological development creates another, non-infringing means to comply with the standard, a patent claim is still standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Finally, the second sentence establishes that a claim directed exclusively to Enabling Technology is not essential. Thus, if a patent claim recites only technology that is necessary to implement the standard, but that is hot explicitly required by or expressly set forth in the standard, then the claim is not standard-essential, even though it is \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of the first sentence. By negative implication, however, a claim directed to both Enabling Technology and to explicit steps of the standard is essential. <em>Cf. Ventas, Inc. v. United States, </em>381 F.3d 1156, 1161 (Fed.Cir.2004) (\u201cWhere Congress includes certain exceptions in a statute, the maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>presumes that those are the only exceptions Congress intended.\u201d). In other words, a claim that recites Enabling Technology may be standard-essential, so long as it also recites technology explicitly required by or expressly set forth in the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">The Defendants contend that there is an additional element to the definition of an Essential Patent Claim that they derive by focusing on the phrase \u201cnecessary to create a compliant implementation.\u201d According to the Defendants, \u201ca compliant implementation\u201d refers to an 802.11 compliant device, such as a laptop, an access point, or a bar code reader, rather than to an implementation of a portion of the standard, such as a MAC or PHY protocol. Put another way, the Defendants contend that \u201ca compliant implementation\u201d refers to an embodiment with standardized features, rather than to the standardized features themselves. The Defendants then point out that a standard-essential claim must be necessary only for \u201ca compliant implementation.\u201d They thus argue that a claim is standard-essential if the Defendants can point to <em>any single </em>802.11 compliant device that infringes the patent claim, regardless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>of whether other 802.11 compliant devices must infringe to practice the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\">In support of that argument, the Defendants highlight \u00a7 6.2(a) of the IEEE Bylaws, which refers to \u201cmaking, using, selling, offering to sell, importing, distributing, or implementing <em>a compliant implementation </em>of the standard.\u201d (IEEE Bylaws \u00a7 6.2(a) (emphasis added).) The Defendants assert that one cannot \u201cmake\u201d or \u201csell\u201d an 802.11 feature, whereas one can make or sell an 802.11 compliant device. The problem, though, is that one does not usually speak of \u201cimplementing\u201d a device such as a laptop. Instead one \u201cimplements\u201d a standardized feature. The language in \u00a7 6.2a of the IEEE Bylaws is therefore unhelpful to interpret the definition of an Essential Patent Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Moreover, the IEEE Bylaws\u2019 definition of an Essential Patent Claim states plainly the referent of the term \u201ccompliant implementation.\u201d The definition speaks of \u201ca compliant implementation of either mandatory or optional <em>portions </em>of the normative clauses\u201d of the standard. A compliant implementation is thus an implementation of any feature specified in a portion of the standard. Stated another way, to \u201ccreate a compliant implementation\u201d means simply to implement a p\u00f3rtion of the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">In summary, the IEEE Bylaws\u2019 definition presents a two-part test. To prove that a patent claim is standard-essential, an accused infringer must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) at the time of the standard\u2019s adoption, the only commercially and technically feasible way to implement a particular mandatory or optional portion of the normative clauses of the standard was to infringe the patent claim;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) the patent claim includes, at least in part, technology that is explicitly required by or expressly set forth in the standard (i.e., that the patent claim does not recite only Enabling Technology).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">II. The Parties\u2019 Disagreement</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">The parties\u2019 dispute is complex, but their basic disagreement can be demonstrated through a simple hypothetical. Assume that the 802.11 standard requires compliant products to perform steps A, B, and C to communicate with other devices on a IVLAN. The parties agree that a patent claim reciting a method with steps A, B, and C is standard-essential. The dispute is whether a patent claim reciting a method with steps A, B, C, and D is also essential (as the Defendants contend), or if the addition of step D makes that claim non-standard-essential (as Innovatio .argues). Of course, the answer may depend on the nature of step D. If step D is an express requirement of a mandatory or optional portion of the standard, then the patent claim is essential. In addition, if step D recites Enabling Technology, then the patent claim is standard-essential. If step D is not an express requirement of a mandatory or optional portion of the Standard, and does not describe Enabling Technology, then the hypothetical patent claim reciting steps A, B, C, and D is nonstandard-essential. .</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">Accordingly, the different categories into which 'the parties have divided the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>disputed claims are sorted and titled based on the nature of the additional element D that Innovatio contends makes the claims non-standard-essential. The parties have agreed that for purposes of analyzing each category, the other elements of the claims in each of the categories should be considered standard-essential.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court\u2019s discussion will therefore focus on the specific element or elements differentiating each category.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Before evaluating the parties\u2019 designated categories of claims for standard-essentiality, however, the court must address several arguments that are common to many of the disputed claims and claim categories. Innovatio\u2019s infringement contentions include many references to various versions of the 802.11 standard to show the existence of terms of its asserted claims in the Defendants\u2019 WLAN systems. <em>(See </em>Dkt. No. 708, Ex. 29.) Indeed, in many cases, including for claims that Innovatio now contends are not essential to the 802.11 standard, Innovatio lists no information in support of its infringement contentions other than references to portions of the 802.11 standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">The Defendants contend that Innovatio has thus conceded that these claims are standard-essential, or at least that Innovatio\u2019s references to the standard are strong evidence that the claims are standard-essential. In support of this reasoning, the Defendants have submitted deposition designations from a numb\u00e9r of Innovatio representatives explaining their attempts to license the patents by accusing 802.11 compliant devices of infringement. (Dkt. No. 800, Exs. B, C, D, and E.) The Defendants urge the court to find that all of the claims with respect to which Innovatio\u2019s infringement contentions mention the 802.11 standard are standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">The court is not willing to draw that inference,' because Innovatio\u2019s mere reliance on portions of the 802.11 standard in its infringement contentions for a claim does not necessarily require that the claim be standard-essential. For example, in the previously discussed hypothetical claim comprising elements A, B, C, and D, where elements A, B, and C are explicitly required by the standard but element D is not, a reference to the standard might validly show the existence of A, B, and C. The patent owner will also have to show the existence of step D in the accused instrumentality using some other evidence, of course, but the mere citation to the standard does not mean the entire claim is standard-essential. Taking the analysis one step further, even a citation to the standard to establish element D does not necessarily mean the standard requires element D. Compliance with the standard may only establish one aspect of element D, and additional evidence could establish other aspects of element D that move element D outside of the standard\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">Moreover, a party need not identify every piece of evidence on which it will ultimately rely to show infringement in its infringement contentions. Instead, it need only identify \u201cwhere each element of each asserted claim is found within each Accused Instrumentality.\u201d L.P.R. 2.2(c). Innovatio\u2019s infringement contentions might successfully perform this task with respect to non-standard-essential claims without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>citing any sources other than the 802.11 standard.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, Innovatio\u2019s failure to cite to anything beyond portions of the 802.11 standard in its infringement contentions with respect to a particular patent claim does not limit Innovatio to using only those portions of the standard to prove its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The court also notes that parties have the opportunity to amend their final infringement contentions in the course of the litigation for \u201cgood cause\u201d and \u201cabsent undue' prejudice\u201d to the other party. L.P.R. 3.4. One example of good cause that the rule provides is a claim construction by the court different from what the party seeking the amendment expected. <em>Id. </em>Claim construction has not yet occurred in this case, and Innovatio may thus under the court\u2019s Local Patent Rules have opportunities to amend its infringement contentions. In light of those opportunities, it is inappropriate at this point in the litigation process to use Innovatio\u2019s infringement contentions to pin it down to a certain position for purposes of deciding an issue related to damages, in which infringement is not at issue. Rather than deciding standard-essentiality on the basis of Innovatio\u2019s litigation position with respect to infringement, the court will examine the merits of the question by evaluating the technical content of each category of claims in relation to the 802.11 standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Similarly, the argument that Innovatio\u2019s asserted claims are standard-essential because Innovatio accuses only 802.11 compliant devices of infringing those claim is unavailing. Most, if not all, wireless devices on the market are 802.11 compliant, so Innovatio\u2019s decision to accuse only 802.11 compliant devices is unremarkable. A device\u2019s compliance with the 802.11 standard says nothing about whether it also contains other elements that may be covered by a patent but not required by the standard. In that case, the asserted claim could be non-standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">Another argument common to many of the claim categories relates to the nature of an \u201coptional\u201d portion of a normative clause of the standard. The IEEE Standards Board Operations Manual explains that the IEEE standards include clauses designated by \u201cshall,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d or \u201ccan\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-12\">The word <em>shall </em>indicates mandatory requirements strictly to be followed in order to conform to the standard and from which no deviation is permitted <em>(shall </em>equals <em>is required </em>to).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-13\">The word <em>should </em>indicates that among several possibilities one is recommended as particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others; or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required <em>(should </em>equals <em>is recommended </em>that).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-14\">The word <em>may </em>is used to indicate a course of action permissible within the limits of the standard <em>(may </em>equals <em>is permitted </em>to).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-15\">The word <em>can </em>is used for statements of possibility and capability, whether material,. physical, or causal <em>(can </em>equals <em>is able, </em>to).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-16\">(Dkt. No. 709, Ex. C., Ex. 4 (\u201cIEEE Operations Manual\u201d) \u00a7 6.4.7.) The Defendants contend that mandatory portions of the Standard are those using the term \u201cshall,\u201d while optional portions use \u201cmay\u201d or \u201cshould.\u201d Innovatio\u2019s counsel, by contrast, distinguished at the July 2013 bench trial between what he called \u201cbig-O\u201d optionality and \u201clittle-o\u201d optionality. (Dkt. No. 836 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>(\u201c7/18/13 AM Trans.\u201d) at 51:1-52:18.) Big-0 optionality is the optionality to which the IEEE Bylaws\u2019 definition of an Essential Patent Claim refers, and applies only when the standard explicitly states that a portion of a standard is optional. <em>See, e.g., </em>IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 \u00a7 9.1 (\u201c[Point coordination function] is optional in all [stations].\u201d). According to Innovatio, little-o optionality consists of references in the standard using \u201cmay\u201d or \u201cshould,\u201d which do not play a role in defining standard-essentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">There are at least two problems with Innovatio\u2019s argument on that point. First, the IEEE Bylaws\u2019 definition does not distinguish between types of optionality, nor does it provide any technical definition of the term \u201coptional.\u201d Instead, the Bylaws merely speak of \u201cmandatory or optional\u201d portions of the standard. The court does not believe it should define the term \u201coptional\u201d as anything other than its ordinary meaning. Second, the IEEE Operations Manual specifies that <em>\u201cshall </em>indicates mandatory requirements.\u201d That definition is then immediately followed by the descriptions of <em>\u201cshould\u201d </em>and <em>\u201cmay.\u201d </em>\u201cShould\u201d means a possibility is recommended, but not required, and \u201cmay\u201d means a possibility is permissible. Both of those definitions are consistent with the plain meaning of the term \u201coptional,\u201d strongly suggesting the use of \u201cmay\u201d or \u201cshould\u201d define optional portions of the standard. The court will therefore interpret the use of \u201cmay\u201d or \u201cshould\u201d to designate optionality for the purpose of determining standard-essentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-13\">III. Category by Category Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b980-14\">The court will now evaluate each of the parties\u2019 agreed categories to determine whether the Defendants have established by a preponderance of the evidence that the patent claims in each category are standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-15\">A. Category 1: Access Point Having Two or More Transceivers or Radios</p>\n<p id=\"b980-16\">Category 1 includes claims that require \u201c[access points] having two or more transceivers or radios.\u201d (Dkt. No. 774, at 2.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A \u201ctransceiver\u201d is a combined transmitter and receiver, and is a synonym for \u201cradio.\u201d (Dkt. No. 815, Ex. A (\u201cNettleton Dep.\u201d), at 60:8-12, 61:8-12.) For example, claim 7 of the '893 patent recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-17\">A data communication system comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-18\">a first wireless transceiver that participates on a first wireless channel to support communication within a cell;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-19\">a first plurality of wireless devices that participate oh the first wireless channel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-20\">a second wireless transceiver that participates on a second wireless channel to support communication within the cell;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-21\">a second plurality of wireless devices that participate on the second wireless channel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>the first and second wireless channels being communicatively incompatible with one another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-4\">and a control circuit, communicatively coupled to both the first and second wireless transceivers, that supports communication among the first and second pluralities of wireless devices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">'893 Patent col.12 l.l56-67 &amp; col.13 ll.1-6. The '536 Patent, which was applied for on July 20, 1999, after the '893 Patent issued on December 1, 1998, and contains numerous claims in Category 1, provides a further explanation of the possible benefits of having a single access point that can communicate through two different transceivers on two separate channels, or frequencies. According to the '536 Patent; that setup \u201cwill greatly increase the reliability of a particular access point, as well as increase the reliability of the entire network.\u201d '536 Patent col.5 ll.23-25. The benefits arise from a variety of different mechanisms. Each transceiver of the access point could receive a signal of a different quality on each channel, for example, allowing the control circuit to choose to listen to the stronger signal. <em>Id. </em>col.5 ll.64-67 &amp; col.6 ll.1-7. Alternatively, the access point could transmit through one transceiver and listen to the message on the other transceiver to determine if the correct message was sent. <em>Id. </em>col.6 ll.47\u2014 49. In yet another embodiment, each transceiver can transmit different information on a separate frequency to minimize the possibility of interference between the transmissions of two devices both attempting to communicate with the access point at the same time. <em>Id. </em>col.8 ll.36-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Each of the patent claims in Category 1 similarly describes a system including an access point with multiple transceivers. Innovatio contends that the use of multiple transceivers on an access point is the element \u201cD\u201d that makes each of these claims non-standard-essential. In support, Dr. Nettleton opines that \u201c[t]here is nothing in the 802.11 standard that requires an [access point] to have more than one transceiver, receiver, transmitter or radio for a compliant implementation.\u201d (Dkt. No. 747, Ex. 4 \u00b6 25.) Dr. Nettleton states that the use of multiple transceivers is not a <em>mandatory </em>requirement of the standard, but Dr. Nettleton says nothing about whether it is part of the <em>optional </em>portions of the 802.11 standard, which also define standard-essentiality.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">On that question, the 2009 Amendments to the 802.11 standard, which defined the 802.11n standard, make plain that the use of dual transceivers is required at least in an optional portion of the standard. The 2009 Amendments introduced a new functionality known as \u201cHigh Throughput PHY.\u201d IEEE Std. 802.11-2009, at 1 (\u201cAmendment 5: Enhancements for Higher Throughput\u201d). High Throughput defines features that allow transfer of data at higher rates than previous versions of the standard. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5.2.9 (\u201cThe IEEE 802.11 [high-throughput station] provides physical layer (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) features that can support a throughput of 100 Mb/s and greater, as measured at the MAC data service access point (SAP).\u201d). The High Throughput PHY does so, among other innovations, through the use of \u201cmultiple input, multiple output (MIMO) operation\u201d and \u201cspatial multiplexing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The 2009 Amendments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>define MIMO as \u201c[a] physical layer (PHY) configuration in which both transmitter and receiver use multiple antennas,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3.237, and spatial multiplexing as \u201c[a] transmission technique in which data streams are transmitted -on multiple spatial channels that are provided through the use of multiple antennas at the transmitter and the receiver,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3.248. The stream of data transmitted over each of the multiple antennas is called a \u201cspatial stream.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3.249.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">If one chooses to implement the High Throughput optional portion of the standard, moreover, the 2009 Amendments make clear that a high-throughput access point <em>\u201cshall </em>support all EQM rates for <em>one and two spatial streams ... </em>using 20 MHz channel width.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 20.1.1 (emphasis added); <em>accord id. </em>\u00a7 20.2.3 (\u201cSupport of 20 MHz non-[high-throughput] format and 20 MHz [high-throughput] format with one and two spatial streams is mandatory at [access points].\u201d). Each spatial stream requires the use of a discrete transceiver. Implementation of this optional portion of the standard therefore requires the use \u2019of an access point with multiple transceivers. <em>{See </em>Nettleton Dep. at 87:19-23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Innovatio contends that at least one Defendant offers for sale 802.11 compliant wireless access points with only a single transceiver, indicating that such products are fully capable of complying with the standard. <em>(See </em>Dkt. No. 747, Ex. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, Ex. H at 50:24-25, &amp; Ex. I.) That fact is irrelevant, however, as the use of two or more transceivers is nonetheless necessary to implement an optional portion of the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Innovatio also argued at the bench trial that Category 1 claims require that the two transceivers operate on \u201cincompatible channels,\u201d <em>see </em>'893 Patent cl. 7 (requiring that \u201cthe first and second wireless channels be[ ] communicatively incompatible with one another\u201d), whereas MIMO and spatial multiplexing involve a single, compatible channel divided into sub-channels. (7/18/13\u2019 AM Trans, at 64:16-65:15.) As Dr. Wicker credibly testified, however, the problem with that argument is that the benefits of MIMO and spatial multiplexing in creating increased data transfer rates are only realized if the two channels are in fact, incompatible and therefore capable of transmitting information at the same time on separate spatial streams. (7/18/13 AM Trans, at 88:20-89:14.) Because supporting two spatial streams is mandatory for access points under the 2009 Amendments, <em>see </em>IEEE Std. 802.11-2009 \u00a7 20.2.3 (\u201cSupport of 20 MHz non-[high-throughput] format and 20 MHz [high-throughput] format with one and two spatial streams is mandatory at [access points].\u201d), using two separate incompatible channels must also be mandatory. The court therefore finds that the Defendants have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the patent claims in Category 1 are standard essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">B. Category 2: Access Point that Allows Communications Between Two Wireless Transceivers Exclusive of a Wired Link</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">Category 2 includes only patent claims that have multiple transceivers (and thus were in Category 1 as well). This category includes patent claims that have \u201ca control circuit that accommodates or allows communications between two wireless transceivers \u2018exclusive of the wired link\u2019 or \u2018exclusive of the wired LAN.\u2019 \u201d (Dkt. No. 774, at 2.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For example, claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>1 of the '536 Patent recites an access point in which \u201cthe control circuit accommodates communications between the first wireless transceiver and the second wireless transceiver exclusive of the wired link.\u201d 536 Patent col.10 11.12-14. In other words, the patent describes a device in which a data packet can be sent from one antenna on an access point to the other antenna of the access point through the control circuit in the access point itself, rather than being sent first on .a wired connection to a wireless controller outside of the access point.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">To show the essentiality, of Category 2 claims, Dr. Wicker identifies portions of Innovatio\u2019s infringement contentions that refer to portions of the 802.11-2007 standard. (Dkt. No. 708, Ex. C, at 66.) In particular, he cites to \u00a7 5.4.1.1 of the 2007 Amendments to the standard, which describes how an access point chooses whether to send a message wirelessly to another station in the same basic service set, or to send the message on a wired link to the distribution system. The section explains first how an access point can invoke the distribution system to send a message to a station connected to a different access point. That example, it says, is \u201ca case in which the [access point] that invoked the distribution service was different from [the access point] that received the distributed message.\u201d IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 \u00a7 5.41.1. In another case, when \u201cthe. message had been intended for a [station] that was a member of the same [basic service set] as the sending [station], then the \u2018input\u2019 and \u2018output\u2019 [access points] for the message would have been the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to Dr. Wicker, that sentence means that an 802.11 access point may process a message and send it out through its other antenna without needing to use the wired link to obtain instructions from a wireless controller.. To implement that option requires communication exclusive of the wired link.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Dr. Nettleton opines that an alternative would be to use a wireless controller outside of the access point-to route the message back out through the access point to another station, and that the messages could travel on a wired link to that wire^ less controller (Dkt. No. 747, Ex. 4 \u00b6 26.) As Dr. Wicker stated, however, the use of a wireless controller is not commercially feasible because consumers are not willing to purchase multiple devices for their wireless network. (Dkt. No. 790, Ex. A, at 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Even if the alternative were commercially feasible, Dr. Wicker also testified at the bench trial that Dr. Nettleton\u2019s alternative is not \u201cnon-infringing\u201d because the wireless controller is conceptually a part of the access point. (Dkt. No. 837 (\u201c7/18/13 PM Trans.\u201d) at 146:19-21.) As the standard explains, an access point is \u201ca logical entity, and the. functions described may be shared by one or more physical entities.\u201d IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 \u00a7 5.3.2. According to Dr. Wicker, even if one separates the routing function into a separate \u201cbox\u201d by using the wireless controller, conceptually one still has an \u201caccess point\u201d (the transceiver plus the wireless controller, connected by a wire) that sends messages between the stations without sending any messages beyond the access point to the distribution system. (7/18/13 PM Trans, at 147:22-148:10.) Dr. Nettleton\u2019s testimony on this point was not credible because his alternative would still infringe the patent claims because it involves communication <em>within </em>an access point, and therefore \u201cexclusive of the wired link\u201d to the distribution system. The court therefore finds that the Defendants have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the claims in Category 2 are standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">C. Category 3: Access Point with Three Independent Protocols</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">Category 3 also includes only patent claims that were included in Category <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>I. This category includes claims specifying that an access point receives and transmits data according' to distinct protocol on each of its wireless and wired channels.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As the Defendants\u2019 expert Dr. Wicker points out, claims dependent from each of the independent claims in this category each specify that two of the protocols are the same. (Dkt. No. 708, Ex. C, at 100 (citing, for example, claim 35 of the '536 Patent, which claims \u201c[t]he access point of claim 21, wherein the second and third protocols are the same .... \u201d).) Because independent claims \u201cmust be at least as broad as the claims that depend from them,\u201d <em>AK Steel Corp. v. Sollac &amp; Ugine, </em>344 F.3d 1234, 1242 (Fed.Cir.2003), the \u201cindependent protocols\u201d identified in category 3 claims may all be the same protocol, so long as they operate independently of one another on each communication channel. In other words, the three protocols may be identical, but they all must operate separately. The key limitation in Category 3 claims thus amounts to nothing more than that the access points communicate on each transceiver (or wired connection) with distinct protocols. Moreover, all telecommunications systems use protocols in some way, so it is not possible to communicate without a protocol. (Dkt. No. 708, Ex. C, at 100.) Accordingly, any access point that communicates on distinct channels through multiple antennas must use distinct protocols to achieve each of those communications.</p>\n<p id=\"AAg\">Dr. Nettleton posits that an alternative would be to communicate \u201cusing a single bus and a single protocol to send and receive data ... instead of using three independent protocols.\u201d (Dkt. No. 747, Ex. 4 \u00b6 42.) A \u201cbus\u201d is simply a path for transmission of data. (7/18/13 PM Trans, at 182:25-183:3.) Dr. Nettleton\u2019s alternative therefore proposes having a single wire and protocol to transmit information among all antennas and the wired connection. As Dr. Nettleton admitted in his deposition, however, no devices actually use that configuration because that configuration would cause congestion and performance would be' poorer. (Nettleton Dep. at 126:3-16.) Dr. Wicker confirmed that Dr. Nettleton\u2019s proposed configuration would not be feasible without some sort of contention resolution mechanism to resolve any collisions among packets sent using the single protocol. (7/18/13 PM Trans, at 185:16-187:5.) Using such a mechanism would be inefficient. Dr. Nettleton\u2019s proposed alternative is therefore not technically and commercially feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Just as the use of multiple antennas on an access point is necessary to implement a high-throughput spatial multiplexing system as specified in-the 2009 Amendments to the 802.11 standard, the use of a distinct protocol to communicate with each of those antennas is also necessary. Accordingly, the;court finds that the Defendants have proven by a preponderance of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>that the claims in Category 3 are: standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">D. Category 4: Access Point Having an Interface System that Modularly Receives Transceivers</p>\n<p id=\"AQs\">[8] Category 4 includes claims that \u201crequire an [access point] to have at least one \u2018acceptor\u2019 or an \u2018interface system\u2019 for \u2018modularly receiving\u2019 the \u2018plurality of transceivers\u2019.\u201d that are part of an access point. (Dkt. No. 774, at 3.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Innovatio\u2019s expert Dr. Nettleton opines that the transceivers or radios are \u201cmodularly\u201d received if they are \u201cphysically separate modules\u201d that can be interchangeably connected to the access point. (Dkt. No. 747, Ex. 4 \u00b6 48.) An alternative, he contends, is to build the radio or transceiver directly on to the motherboard of the access point. <em>(Id.) </em>Indeed, Motorola\u2019s 30(b)(6) witness stated that some Motorola devices use this alternative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-5\">When we talk about a radio module internally in any case, we\u2019re describing a \u2014 something which is physically separable from the motherboard of the access point; you know, basically a daughterboard that you plug into the access point. And there are other situations where the radio hardware is built onto the motherboard itself and is not a physically separate module. So we don\u2019t refer to it as a radio module in that case. So some of our products have a single radio which is not a radio module. It\u2019s a \u2014 -just a radio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">(Dkt. No. 816, Ex. F at 57:6-15.) Because one could implement the 802.11 standard by using transceivers built directly into the access point motherboard, Innovatio contends that Category 4 claims are nonstandard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">The Defendants do not point to any section of the standard requiring that the access point have a system-to modularly receive multiple transceivers, and the standard appears to be \"silent on the question. Instead, the Defendants contend that it is not commercially feasible to sell stations without modular radios. At the informal discussion on July 17, Dr. Shoemake opined that radio modules must be calibrated to ensure that their transmitting power does not exceed FCC limits. (Dkt. No. 820, Ex. A, at 2.) According to Dr. Shoemake, it is much cheaper to accomplish this calibration by manufacturing all of the modular radios at a single location, rather than requiring calibration wherever the motherboards in various devices are manufactured. <em>(Id.) </em>In addition, Dr. Shoe-make opined that it iseasier to make modifications to the radios by removing the module and replacing it with another, rather than manufacturing an entire new motherboard. <em>(Id.) </em>Accordingly, the industry has coalesced around using modular radios, and Dr. Nettleton was not able to identify any devices without a modular radio on the market. Thus, the court finds that the Defendants have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the claims 'in Category 4 are standard-essential, because there is no commercially feasible alternative to using the Category 4 claims to implement the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">E. Category 5: Access Point that Contemporaneously Operates on Two Channels</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">Category 5 includes all claims that \u201crequire an [access point] to have a wireless- transceiver system that \u2018contemporaneously\u2019 operates \u2018on first and second com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>munieation channels.\u2019 \u201d (Dkt. No. 774, at 3.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As described above, the high throughput PHY of the 2009 Amendments to the 802.11 standard requires that access points be able to transmit multiple spatial streams at once to implement spatial multiplexing and MIMO. Doing so requires the contemporaneous operation of two communication channels. <em>See </em>IEEE Std. 802.11-2009 \u00a7 20.3.15 (\u201cThe [station] may operate in the 5 GHz band and/or 2.4 GHz band. When using 20 MHz channels, it uses channels defined in 17.3.8.3 (5 GHz band) or 18.4.6 (2.4 GHz band). When using 40 MHz channels, it can operate in the channels defined in 20.3.15.1 and 20.3.15.2.\u201d); <em>see also </em>(Nettleton Dep. at 99:5-12.) The court therefore finds that the Defendants have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the claims in Category 5 are standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">F. Category 6: A Processor for Implementing Claimed Method Steps; Category 7: Handheld Terminal or Handheld Computer; Category 8: A Roaming Terminal Keyboard Used to Collect Information Communicated</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Categories 6, 7, and 8 raise similar conceptual issues, so the court will address them together. All three of the categories include dependent claims that depend from independent claims the parties agree are standard-essential. Each of the three categories also add a single element to the independent claim to create the dependent claim. Category 6<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> includes claims requiring steps relating to a sleep operation to be performed \u201cat least in part, utilizing a processor executing software instructions stored in a memory.\u201d (Dkt. No. 774, at 3.) Category 7<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> includes claims requiring one of the stations communicating with an access device to be a \u201chand-held terminal\u201d or \u201chand-held computer.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Category 8<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> includes claims requiring \u201cutilizing a keyboard of the roaming wireless terminal node to collect information to be communicated to the bridging node.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">Innovatio contends that having elements requiring the use of a processor, a hand-held terminal, and a keyboard, respectively, makes each of these claims non-standard-essential because the 802.11 standard does not require those elements. The Defendants do not contest that the standard does not explicitly require the use of a processor or a keyboard. They point to \u00a7 1.2 of the standard as establishing a requirement for the use of hand-held devices:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-11\">1.2 Purpose</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-12\">The purpose of this standard is to provide wireless connectivity to automatic machinery, equipment, or [stations] that require rapid deployment, which may be portable or hand-held, or which may be mounted on moving vehicles within a local area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-13\">IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 \u00a7 1.2. This statement does not require the use of a hand-held device, however, but instead only states the purpose of the standard at a general level.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The use of a hand-held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>device as one of the stations in a WLAN network is thus not a requirement of a mandatory or optional portion of the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">Nonetheless, the Defendants contend that the RAND requirement would be reduced to nothing if a patentee who has agreed to a RAND obligation could get around it merely by adding an additional element like \u201cutilizing a processor\u201d to an otherwise standard-essential claim. That concern is particularly great where the additional element is technology as basic as \u201ca processor\u201d or \u201ca keyboard.\u201d Even if the use of \u201ca keyboard\u201d or a \u201cprocessor\u201d is not necessary to implement the standard, the vast majority of computing devices include those two elements. A large chunk of devices using the 802.11 standard are also hand-held. A patentee should not be able to sue the large number of users of these basic elements who are otherwise implementing standard-essential independent claims without being subject to the RAND obligation applicable to the standard-essential independent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Moreover, the obligation to license a standard-essential ' independent patent claim at a RAND rate would be meaningless if the patent holder could charge an exorbitant fee for a claim dependent on the standard-essential independent claim and reciting only a technically basic additional element. The only additional licensing value that the dependent claim provides above the RAND-obligated independent claim is whatever value is added by the additional element. When that additional element is merely basic technology that adds nothing novel to the claim, that added value is likely to be zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">The definition of an \u201cEssential Patent Claim\u201d handles this problem by including within its scope claims that recite in part Enabling Technology, or technology that is \u201cnecessary to make or use any product or portion thereof that complies with the [Proposed] IEEE Standard,\u201d but that is .not explicitly required in the standard. (IEEE Bylaws \u00a7 6.1.) Dr. Nettleton opines that a processor, a hand-held device, and a keyboard are not necessary to make or use an 802.11 compliant product because one could use a touch screen instead of a keyboard, a laptop instead of a hand-held device, and an application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d) instead of a processor<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to perform the functions specified in the claims. (Dkt. No. 747, Ex. 4 \u00b6\u00b674, 79, 92, 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">Those alternatives, however, merely take advantage of creative claiming to try to do an end-run around the concept of Enabling Technology. To see why, consider the keyboard example. No one would dispute that some type of data entry device, whether a keyboard or a touchscreen, is necessary to allow the user to input information to be communicated on an 802.11 WLAN. At the broadest level, the necessary Enabling Technology is <em>a device of some kind </em>capable of data entry. Innovation patents try to avoid the inclusion of Enabling Technology in the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>essentiality merely by including an element claiming one version of the Enabling Technology (a keyboard), rather than the other version (a touch screen), when both versions were well-known at the time of the invention. Innovatio then attempts to argue that the use,of one version of the Enabling Technology is not necessary because one could always use the other version.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">If the court were to accept this argument, the concept of Enabling Technology would be meaningless, as one could always claim around it by including claims describing only a subcategory of a type of Enabling Technology. For example, in the case of the hand-held device, a patent could have one claim requiring the use of. a roaming terminal that is a \u201chand-held device,\u201d and another claim requiring the use of a roaming terminal that is not hand-held. The fact remains that the use of some <em>type </em>of roaming terminal is necessary to implement the standard, however, so a claim element directed at <em>any type </em>of conventional roaming terminal must be standard-essential Enabling Technology as well. Similarly, the use of some device to perform the necessary computing functions, whether an ASIC or a processor, is necessary Enabling Technology. A claim element directed at any type of conventional device to perform the necessary computing functions is therefore still standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">The court therefore finds that the Defendants have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the claims in categories 6, 7, and 8 are all standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">G. Category 9: Selectively Sleeping Between Consecutive Beacons or Between Non-consecutive Beacons</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Category 9 includes claims that \u201crequire a second node\u201d such as a terminal or other station to \u201c \u2018selectively\u2019 either enter or remain \u2018in a low power state\u2019 between consecutive or non-consecutive beacons.\u201d (Dkt. No. 774, at 4.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A \u201cbeacon\u201d is a communication between stations or access points that shares information about the parameters of the network and the devices on it. <em>See </em>IEEE Std. 802.11-2012 \u00a7 4.3.8.2. In particular, access points often share information with stations about the access point\u2019s presence and parameters. IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 \u00a7 7.2.3.1 (describing beacon frames): Category 9 claims provide that a station be able selectively either to sleep in between consecutive-beacons, or to remain asleep through several beacons at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">As mentioned above, the 802.11 MAC layer includes a protocol for a power save (\u201cPS\u201d) function that allows battery-powered stations to save power by staying \u201casleep\u201d and periodically \u201cwaking up\u201d to receive messages from an access point. The 802.11 standard specifies that a station wakes up only to receive selected beacons from an access point. The station remains awake if the beacon indicates that the access point has a data message for the station to receive, but otherwise goes back asleep and wakes up only to receive the next scheduled beacon. Table 11-1 of the 2007 Amendments to the 802.11 standard describes a station operating in PS mode:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-12\">[The station] listens to selected Beacon frames (based upon the Listenlnterval parameter ...) and sends PS-Poll frames to the [access point] if ... the most recent Beacon frame indicates [data waiting to be sent to the station]. The [access point] shall transmit [data] to a PS [station] only in response to a PS-Poll from that [station] ....

Consequently, the court finds that the Defendants have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the claims in Category 9 are standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">H. Category 10: Terminal Builds an Access Point List Based Upon Signal Strength</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Category 10 includes claims that \u201crequire a terminal that \u2018builds and stores a list of access points that are in communication range based at least in part on the strength of a signal received from the access point.\u2019 \u201d (Dkt. No. 774, at 4.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> According to Innovatio, the significant portion of these claims that makes them nonstandard-essential is their requirement that the list be built \u201cbased at least in part on the strength of a signal received from the access point.\u201d (Dkt. No. 747, at 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">Dr. Wicker, citing Innovatio\u2019s infringement contentions, points to sections of the 2007 Amendments to the 802.11 standard requiring a station to scan for available access points and to record information about those access points in a \u201cBSSDeseriptionSet\u201d or \u201cBasic Service Set Description Set.\u201d (Dkt. No. 708, Ex. C, at 54-55.) In particular, \u00a7 11.1.3 of the 2007 version of the standard provides that \u201ca [station] shall operate in either a Passive-Scanning Mode or an Active Scanning Mode\u201d and that upon receipt of an appropriate request, \u201ca [station] shall perform scanning.\u201d IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 \u00a7 11.1.3. Section 10.3.2.2 then defines the information that a station must store about the access points in a BSSDescriptionSet. Id. \u00a7 10.3.2.2. That section lists a variety of pieces of information, including the service set ID, a \u201ctimestamp\u201d field to synchronize the clock of the station to the clock of the access point, the data rates supported by the access point, the \u201cload\u201d of the service set, which indicates the number of stations using the channel and the percentage of time that the channel is in use, the length of time in between each beacon sent by the access point, and a variety of other pieces of information. Id. The list does not, however, include a field for the strength of the signal that the station received from the access point.-</p>\n<p id=\"b990-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>The 2012 version of the 802.11 standard, however, added several fields to the BSSDeseriptionSet, including a field for \u201cRCPIMeasurement.\u201d IEEE Std. 802.11-2012 \u00a7 6.3.3.3.2. \u201cRCPI\u201d stands for \u201creceived channel power indicator\u201d which is \u201c[a]n indication of the total channel power (signal, noise, and interference) of a received frame measured on the channel and at the antenna connector used to receive the frame.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3.1. An additional section of the 2012 Amendments to the standard describes the process that stations are to follow to perform the measurement of channel power. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10.11 (\u201cRadio measurement procedures\u201d). Moreover, the standard requires stations to have the capability of measuring and reporting RCPI. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 10.1.4.3.3- (\u201cIf dot 11 RadioMeasurementActivated is true and if the Request element of the Probe Request includes the RCPI element ID, the [station] <em>shall include </em>in the Probe Response an RCPI element containing the measured RCPI value of the received Probe Request frame.\u201d (emphasis added)). The Defendants contend that the recording of the RCPI value in the BSSDeseriptionSet, as specified in the 2012 standard, constitutes building a list of access points based in part on signal strength, and so infringes Category 10 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Innovatio responds that a requirement that a station measure and report the RCPI does not necessarily mean that the station must \u201cbuild and store\u201d a list \u201cbased at least in part on the strength of a signal received from the access point,\u201d as Category 10 claims require. According to Innovatio, the station may build a list based upon any criteria it chooses. Even though it must collect RCPI information, in other words, it need not rely on that RCPI information to build a list. Moreover, as Dr. Nettleton testified, an alternative would be to build a list based on whether the station received a valid beacon from the access point. (Dkt. No. 747, Ex. 4 \u00b6 117.) Even accepting that a station may build a list based upon receiving a valid beacon, however, Dr. Wicker testified that a station could not receive a valid beacon unless the signal strength is high enough. (Dkt. No. 838 (\u201c7/19/13 AM Trans.\u201d) at 273:5-15.) Dr. Nettleton agreed at his deposition. (Nettleton Dep. at 193:5-13.) Even Dr. Nettleton\u2019s proposed alternative would thus build a list based at least in part on signal strength. Dr. Nettleton\u2019s opinion on this point is not credible because his proposed alternative is not a non-infringing alternative. The court finds that the Defendants have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the claims in Category 10 are therefore standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">I. Category 11: Access Point Routes Messages Between Other Nodes</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">Category 11 involves claims which \u201crequire[] that a \u2018bridging node routes messages between other nodes.\u2019 \u201d (Dkt. No. 774, at 4.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 expert, Dr. Wicker, opines that \u00a7 5.4.1.1 of the 2007 Amendments to the standard indicates that Category 11 claims are standard-essential. (Dkt. No. 708, Ex. C, at 46-47.) That section describes the role of an \u201caccess point\u201d in distributing messages either to the \u201cdistribution system\u201d or wirelessly to other stations in the same basic service set. <em>See also </em>IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 \u00a7 3.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">First, the standard\u2019s use of the term \u201caccess point\u201d instead of \u201cbridging node\u201d is not a relevant difference. An access point, according to the standard, is \u201c[a]ny entity that has station (STA) functionality and provides access to the distribution ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>vices, via the wireless medium (WM) for associated [stations].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3.3. In other words, an access point is what allows for the transmission and reception of data from one WLAN to another WLAN or to the wired world. Access points, however, can also relay messages from one node to another node inside a basic service set. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5.4.1.1 (describing the access point\u2019s role in sending a message \u201cintended for a' [station] that was a member of the same [basic service set] as' the sending [station]\u201d). A bridging node, according to the '646 patent, is an \u201cinternal node in the spanning tree which is used to \u2018bridge\u2019 terminal nodes together into an interconnected network.... A bridge node consists of a network interface function and a routing function.\u201d '646 Patent col.9 11.27\u201429, 32-34. A bridging node is thus a station with the ability to receive data from one node and transmit it to another node inside a network. For purposes of analyzing Category 11, therefore, an access point does the same thing as a bridging node.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">Section 5.4.1.1 of the 2007 Amendments explains how an access point must act as a router under the 802.11 standard. For example, an access point \u201croutes\u201d messages when it chooses whether to rebroadcast them on the wireless medium to another station, or to send them on the distribution system to another access point for distribution to a station in a different basic service set. Section 5.4.1.1 explains this process as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-5\">[Consider a data message being sent from [a station in one basic service (\u201cstation 1\u201d), set to a -station in another basic service set (\u201cstation 4\u201d) ]. The message is sent from [station] 1 and received by [an \u201cinput\u201d access point]. <em>The [access point] gives the message to the distribution service of the [distribution system]. </em>It is the job of the distribution service to deliver the message within the [distribution system] in such a way that it arrives at the appropriate [distribution system] destination for the intended recipient. In this example, the message is distributed to [an \u201coutput\u201d access point, which] accesses the [wireless medium] to send the message to [station] 4 (the intended destination).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 \u00a7 5.4.1.1 (emphasis added). The emphasized sentence describes the point at which,the access point must decide .whether to send the message to the distribution system or to route it to another station in the same basic service set. .As \u00a7 5.4.1.1 further explains, this routing function, which allows an access point to distribute messages through the distribution system, \u201cis the primary service used by IEEE 802.11 [stations].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">The standard therefore calls for an access point to be able to act as a bridging node to route data messages from a sending node to a receiving node.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Performing this function is optional, of course, as the most basic implementation of the IEEE 802.11 standards is an independent basic service set, which involves only two stations communicating directly. <em>See </em>IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 \u00a7 5.2.1. Nonetheless, the 802.11 standard supports the use of access points as bridging nodes to route messages between other nodes as an optional feature. The court therefore finds that the Defendants have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>claims in Category 11 are standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">J. Category 12A: Operating Receiver Circuitry, . Transceiver Circuitry, Communication Circuitry, Receiver or Portion of Receiver in Powered Down State.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Category 12A involves a variety of other claims that are all directed to power management features of wireless devices.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Category 12A claims, all of which require that parts of a wireless terminal be \u201cpowered down\u201d at certain times, are thus similar to the claims in Category 9. Terminals operating in a powered down state and then waking long enough to receive a- message during a communication session or for a fixed period are plainly part of the 802.11 PS function, which provides that \u201c[i]n PS mode, a [station] shall be in the Doze state and shall enter the Awake state to receive selected Beacon frames.\u201d IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 \u00a7 11.2.1.1; <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 11.2.1.7 (\u201cThe [station] shall remain in the Awake state until it receives the data or management frame in response to its poll or it receives another Beacon frame [indicating] that the [access point] does not have any [data] for this [station].\u201d); <em>id. </em>(\u201cA [station] that stays awake to receive [multicast data] shall remain awake until the More Data field of [the multicast data] indicates there are no further [multicast data] or until [it receives information] indicating there are no more [multicast data to be transmitted].\u201d). The court therefore finds that the Defendants have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the claims in Category 12A are standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">K. Category 12B: Bridging Node Stor- - ing Pending Messages</p>\n<p id=\"Ak2\">Category 12B includes claims that \u201crequire a bridging node to store pending messages awaiting delivery until delivery is successful; to store such messages until a predetermined number of beacons occur and/or first messages have been transmitted and delivery is unsuccessful; or to remove such messages from the queue where delivery is unsuccessful.\u201d (Dkt. No. 797, at 4.)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> These'claims provide for the deletion of messages that are not successfully delivered to their destinations within a predetermined period of time through the use of an \u201caging function.\u201d The 802.11 standard describes the use of such an aging function to delete messages that are \u201cbuffered,\u201d or stored, for an excessive period of time without a successful delivery: \u201cAn [access point] can delete buffered frames for implementation-dependent reasons, including the use of an aging function and availability of buffers. The [access point] may base the aging function on the listen interval specified by the non-[access point station] in the (Re)Association Request frame.\u201d IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 \u00a7 11.2.1.5 (describing PS function operation during the \u201ccontention period\u201d). That section of the standard describes an optional implementation of an aging function. Similarly, \u00a7 11.2.1.6 describes a mandatory implementation: \u201cAn [access point] shall have an aging function to delete pending traffic buffered for an excessive time period. The exact specification of the aging function is beyond the scope of this standard.\u201d M \u00a7 11.2.1.6 (describing PS function operation during the \u201ccontention free period\u201d). ' ' \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b993-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>Innovatio contends that its patent claims relate to the \u201cexact specification\u201d of-an aging function that is beyond the scope of the standard. That argument fails, however, because the \u201caging function\u201d claims in Category 12B describe the aging function at a broad level of generality, providing only for the deletion of messages that are not successfully delivered. <em>See, e.g., </em>'366 Patent cl.22 (providing that a terminal \u201cremove from the queue those of the messages awaiting delivery where delivery is unsuccessful\u201d). Accordingly, one could not implement any aging function, regardless of its exact specification, without infringing Innovatio\u2019s \u201caging function\u201d patent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">To be sure, Category 12B claims speak of exercising an aging function based on \u201ca predetermined number of beacons,\u201d <em>see, e.g., </em>'366 Patent col.21 ll.31-34., whereas the standard requires an aging function based on \u201can excessive time period,\u201d IEEE Std. 802.ll-2007 \u00a7 ll.2.1.6. A beacon is transmitted at a regular interval, however, so a \u201cpredetermined number of beacons\u201d describes a time interval. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 7.3.1.3 (\u201cThe Beacon Interval field represents the number of time units (TUs) between target beacon transmission times (TBTTs).\u201d). Accordingly, the patent describes an aging function with no more detail than the aging function that the 802.11 standard requires. Because the 802.11 standard provides that access points \u201cshall\u201d have an aging function, the court finds that the Defendants have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the claims in Category 12B are standard-essential.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">L. Category 12C: Spanning Tree -</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Category 12C includes claims requiring that \u201ca plurality of bridging devices participate in spanning tree routing or a bridging node is a node of a spanning tree.\u201d'<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The claims in this category specify the use of a \u201cspanning tree\u201d to network multiple stations together. Both the '366 Patent and the '646 Patent describe a spanning tree as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-10\">To set up the network, an optimal configuration for conducting network communication spanning tree is created .to control the flow of data communication. To aid understanding ,by providing a more visual description, this configuration is referred to hereafter as a \u201cspanning tree\u201d or \u201coptimal spanning tree\u201d. Specifically, [the] root[s] of the spanning tree are the gateways; the branches are the bridges; and non-bridging stations, such as RF terminals, are the leaves of the tree. Data are sent along the branches of the newly created .optimal spanning tree. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">'366 Patent col.2 ll.32-43; '646 Patent col.2 ll.64-67 &amp; col.3 ll.1-6. As Dr. Wicker further explained at the bench trial, a spanning tree is a network of nodes that interconnects all nodes, but in which there is exactly one path between any two pair of nodes. (7/19/13 AM Trans, at 330:12-23.) The advantage of having only one path between each pair of nodes is that a message will not \u201cloop\u201d in a circle without ever being transmitted to its proper destination. Dr. Wicker testified that a.spanning tree is a concept- relevant-at the distribution sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>tem layer, because it describes the manner in which access points are connected together in a distribution system. <em>(Id. </em>at 332:8-20); <em>see also </em>'646 Patent col.2 ll.45-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Innovatio contends that because the 802.11 standard does not specify, distribution system implementations, <em>see </em>IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 \u00a7 5.5 (\u201cThe implementation of the [distribution system] is unspecified and is beyond the scope of this standard.\u201d), the use of a spanning tree cannot be standard essential. Dr. Wicker testified, however, that the use of a spanning tree is necessary to operate any distribution system in a technically feasible manner. (7/19/13 AM at 332:21-333:6.) Not using a spanning tree would cause multiple addressing loops that would slow communication and may cause data to be lost. As Dr. Nettleton stated in his deposition testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-5\">Disadvantages of not using a spanning tree would be basically that you would be building links that are not required, and you would also be running the risk of addressing loops. If everything works correctly, you can have loops all over the place. If something goes wrong and you have \u2014 have an addressing loop, then the signal just keeps going round and round and never gets anywhere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">(Dkt. No. 815, Ex. B. at 334:3-10.) In other words, a spanning tree is necessary to implement any distribution system on which an 802.11 compliant device might send messages. Moreover, an optional feature of the 802.11 standard is the ability to send messages to a distribution system. <em>See, e.g., </em>IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 \u00a7 5.2.3 (describing the communication of messages from an access point to a distribution system). The use of a spanning tree is thus Enabling Technology necessary for the implementation of the option of using a distribution system. The court therefore finds that the Defendants have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the claims in Category 12C are standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">M. Category 13: Access Point Programmed with Network Configuration</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">Category 13 includes claims that \u201crequire the [access point] to have circuitry programmed with a network configuration ... to selectively route data.\u201d (Dkt. No. 795, Ex. A.)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Category 13 claims are similar to Category 11 claims in that they require the access points to route messages to other terminals. The 802.11 standard requires access points to route messages for the reasons explained above with respect to Category 11. Category 13 additionally requires, however, that the access point have \u201ccircuitry programmed with a network configuration\u201d to do the routing. Dr. Nettleton explains that a wireless controller or wireless switch connected to the access point through a wired connection could provide the processing circuitry that allows the access point to route the data, rather than having that circuitry in the access point itself. (Dkt. No. 747, Ex. 4 \u00b6 54.) Thus, Dr. Nettleton asserts that Category 13 is non-standard-essential for the same reasons as Category 2, which requires that the access point process messages \u201cexclusive of a wired link\u201d to a wireless controller or switch.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">As explained above in the discussion of Category 2, however, under the 802.11 standard, a wireless controller is conceptually part of the access point. Dr. Nettle-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>ton\u2019s opinion on this point is not credible because his proposed alternative nonetheless involves the use of an access point to route information. The court therefore finds that the Defendants have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the claims in Category 13 are standard-essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">For the reasons explained above, the court determines that the claims of Categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12A, 12B, 12C, and 13 are all standard-essential.

The Defendants conceive of this requirement as two separate requirements, contending both that (1) an essential patent claim must be necessary for a compliant implementation of the standard, and (2) that there be no commercially and technically feasible non-infringing alternatives.

It is also possible that if an ASIC does-not act as a processor, it could not offer the control and programmability necessary to implement the standard. <em>(Id.) </em>The court\u2019s reasoning here nevertheless assumes that an ASIC is a commercially and technically feasible non-infringing alternative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b988-8\">.

Dr. Nettleton contends that an alternative is to use a wireless controller outside of the access point to perform the routing function. As explained above in the discussion of Category 2, however, under the 802.11 standard, a wireless controller is conceptually part of- the access point, and so Dr. Nettleton\u2019s alternative nonetheless involves the use of an, access point to route information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b992-6\">.

No. 747, Ex. 4 \u00b6 131.) Rebooting instead of deleting messages, however, would still constitute an \"aging function,\u201d and is not non-infringing.
