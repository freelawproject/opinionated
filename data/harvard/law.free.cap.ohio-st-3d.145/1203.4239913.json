Judge Sutula has responded in writing to the affidavit, stating that he does not have any bias against any party in the underlying case. For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Sutula.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">{\u00b6 3} First, Groedel\u2019s primary complaint is that Judge Sutula is biased against her because he has denied almost all of her motions but granted all of defendant\u2019s motions. Specifically, Groedel avers that the judge has repeatedly abused his discretion by allowing defendant to submit filings out of time and in violation of the Civil Rules and discovery orders. It is well settled, however, that a litigant\u2019s dissatisfaction with a court\u2019s legal rulings, even if those rulings are erroneous, is not grounds for disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 4. Procedures exist by which appellate courts may review \u2014 and, if necessary, correct \u2014 rulings made by trial courts, but reviewing alleged legal errors is not the role of the chief justice in deciding an affidavit of disqualification. Further, a party is not entitled to a certain number of favorable rulings, and a judge must be free to make rulings without the apprehension that a disproportionate number of rulings in favor of one party will create the impression of bias toward that party or against its adversary. <em>In re Disqualification of Lawson, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1243, 2012-Ohio-6337, 986 N.E.2d 6, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Second, Groedel claims that Judge Sutula disrespected her at a recent pretrial conference when he showed her co-counsel a newspaper article about a local attorney who had been disciplined for professional misconduct and indicated that he might have to \u201creport\u201d Groedel for similar misconduct. According to Groedel, Judge Sutula\u2019s suggestion that she may have engaged in inappropriate conduct was based on \u201cunsubstantiated allegations\u201d from defendant. In response to Groedel\u2019s allegations, Judge Sutula summarized the circumstances and statements in the record that led him to caution Groedel\u2019s co-counsel that he might have a duty to report Groedel to disciplinary authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">{\u00b6 5} In general, a judge\u2019s disqualification is not warranted merely because the judge files a grievance against a lawyer in a pending case. <em>See In re Disqualification of Lynch, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1277, 2013-Ohio-910, 986 N.E.2d 1000, \u00b6 5. Indeed, judges have the duty to inform the appropriate authorities when they have knowledge that an attorney has violated a disciplinary rule raising a question regarding the attorney\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer. <em>See </em>Jud.Cond.R. 2.15(B). Thus, the fact that Judge Sutula cautioned Groedel\u2019s co-counsel that if certain allegations were true he may have a duty to report Groedel does not show that he is biased against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">{\u00b6 7} Accordingly, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Sutula.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
