The BTA determined that the purchase of the racetrack for $43,000,000 at a bankruptcy sale six months after the tax-lien date did not establish the true value of the property, because \u201csales conducted under supervision of a court order are forced sales which are not indicative of true value.\u201d BTA Nos. 2012-1715, 2012-1748, and 2012-1749, 2014 WL 1155691, at *2 (Mar. 6, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">{\u00b6 2} The school board maintains that Thistledown Racetrack sold in a recent arm\u2019s length transaction and that the $43,000,000 sale price establishes the true value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">{\u00b6 3} In this case, the BTA reasonably and lawfully applied R.C. 5713.04, which states that the price received for real property at auction or forced sale does not establish its value, and the evidence presented to the BTA supports its finding that the true value of Thistledown Racetrack was $13,800,000 as of the tax-lien date.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">{\u00b6 4} For these reasons, we affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">\n<em>The property and its 2010 sale in bankruptcy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b371-17\">{\u00b6 5} The subject property, parcel Nos. 771-03-001 and 761-18-001, is Thistledown Racetrack, a thoroughbred-racing facility located in Cuyahoga County that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>is home to the Ohio Derby. Thistledown includes 128 acres of land improved by a one-mile racetrack, an eight-story grandstand, and numerous barns and support structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">{\u00b6 6} In 2009, the year preceding the tax-lien date, New Thistledown, L.L.C., owned Thistledown Racetrack, and its parent company, Magna Entertainment Corporation, petitioned for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief and received authority to sell the racetrack at auction.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">{\u00b6 7} Magna Entertainment received three qualifying bids; Harrah\u2019s Ohio Acquisition Company, L.L.C., submitted the best and highest offer, and in September 2009, it agreed to purchase Thistledown for $89,500,000. The sales agreement, however, provided for a closing purchase price of $42,000,000, a contingent payment of $42,500,000 due if Harrah\u2019s earned at least $1.00 from the operation of video lottery terminals (\u201cVLTs\u201d) at the racetrack, and a contingent payment of $5,000,000 payable if the voters of Ohio rejected Issue 3 (which would allow four casinos in Ohio) at the November 2009 election. The sale was also contingent on Harrah\u2019s acquiring Thistledown\u2019s racing license and approval to operate VLTs at the racetrack. The sale never closed because the conditions were not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">{\u00b6 8} On May 25, 2010, Magna Entertainment held a second auction, and Harrah\u2019s again submitted the winning bid to purchase Thistledown. The contract stated that in exchange for $43,000,000, Harrah\u2019s would assume ownership of the real property as well as equipment, inventory, deposits, advertising and marketing materials, transferable permits, intellectual-property rights, goodwill, and insurance proceeds, among other things. Magna Entertainment also agreed to \u201csubmit to the [racing commission] a preliminary request to transfer all Licenses and Racing Approvals.\u201d The sale was contingent on Harrah\u2019s ability to obtain Thistledown\u2019s racing license from the racing commission but had no conditions related to VLTs. The bankruptcy court approved the sale on June 17, 2010, and Harrah\u2019s filed the deed on July 28, 2010, after it received the racing license.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">\n<em>Valuation and board of revision proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">{\u00b6 9} For tax year 2010, the Cuyahoga County fiscal officer assigned a total value of $14,264,000 to the parcels comprising Thistledown. The school board filed a complaint with the board of revision (\u201cBOR\u201d), seeking an increase in valuation to $89,500,000, the initial sale price Harrah\u2019s had bid for Thistledown. Harrah\u2019s filed countercomplaints seeking a decrease to $12,000,000, and it subsequently amended the countercomplaints to request a reduction to $5,500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">(\u00b6 10} At a hearing, the school board introduced evidence of the purchase agreement between Harrah\u2019s and Magna Entertainment as well as the bankruptcy court\u2019s order authorizing the sale, which stated that $43,000,000 \u201cconstitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration for the Purchased Assets.\u201d Harrah\u2019s responded with the testimony of Kathleen Floyd, its property-and-sales-tax director, who explained that the 2010 sale included real property as well as other assets, and she emphasized that Harrah\u2019s bought Thistledown to obtain its racing license in the hopes of operating VLTs, which were permitted only at racetracks. In addition, Carla Bishop, a property-tax consultant, testified that she could not value the property using the income, sales-comparison, and cost approaches; she therefore compared Thistledown to five other Ohio racetracks that had been assessed, concluded that the real estate had little contributory value to the overall purchase, and valued the real property at $5,500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">{\u00b6 11} The BOR retained the fiscal officer\u2019s initial valuation of $14,264,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\n<em>BTA proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">{\u00b6 12} The school board appealed to the BTA, requesting an increase to $43,000,000, the price Harrah\u2019s ultimately paid for Thistledown, and Harrah\u2019s requested a decrease to $13,800,000. The school board relied on the 2010 sale and argued that the $43,000,000 sale price reflected the value of the real property. In response, Floyd, the property-and-sales-tax director for Harrah\u2019s, reiterated her prior testimony that the sale price reflected the purchase of other assets in addition to real property and that Harrah\u2019s bought Thistledown hoping to obtain a license to operate VLTs at the racetrack. Harrah\u2019s also submitted a new appraisal and testimony from David Sangree, an appraiser, who testified that the income-capitalization approach was not effective for valuing properties like Thistledown that had been losing money, and he therefore conducted sales-comparison and cost approaches to valuation. He testified that 65 percent of the $43,000,000 purchase price \u2014 or $27,950,000 \u2014 could be attributed to obtaining Thistledown\u2019s racing license in the hope of operating VLTs at the racetrack, and he opined that the furniture, fixtures, and equipment were worth approximately $1,200,000, and after rounding, he valued the real property at $13,800,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">{\u00b6 13} The BTA rejected the 2010 sale price as evidence of value, explaining that \u201c[although it is clear that the subject property sold recent to [the] tax lien date, we do not find the sale to have been arm\u2019s-length because it was subject to the approval of a bankruptcy court.\u201d 2014 WL 1155691 at <em>*2. </em>It therefore considered the appraisal evidence, found Sangree\u2019s opinion to be \u201creasonable and well supported,\u201d and valued the real property at $13,800,000. <em>Id. </em>at *2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">{\u00b6 14} On appeal to this court, the school board presents three propositions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">Proposition of law No. 1: A recent arm\u2019s length sale of property is the best evidence of value and must be accepted for ad valorem taxation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Proposition of law No. 2: It has not been established that an allocation of the purchase price was made to property other than real estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">Proposition of law No. 3: The appraisal report should not be considered due to the recent arm\u2019s length sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">{\u00b6 15} Ultimately, the school board asks us to \u201cdetermine the value of the subject property to be $43,000,000 for the 2010 tax year or in the alternative remand the case back to the BTA with instructions to consider the $43,000,000 sale in its determination of value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">{\u00b6 16} Pursuant to R.C. 5717.04, this court reviews a decision of the BTA to determine whether it is reasonable and lawful. In our review, we defer to the BTA\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by reliable and probative evidence in the record. <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 14. And as we indicated in <em>HIN, L.L.C. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 481, 2010-Ohio-687, 923 N.E.2d 1144, \u00b6 13, a decision of the BTA will be affirmed if it correctly applies the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">{\u00b6 17} During the tax year at issue, former R.C. 5713.03 set forth how real estate is to be valued for tax purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">In determining the true value of any tract, lot, or parcel of real estate under this section, if such tract, lot, or parcel has been the subject of an arm\u2019s length sale between a willing seller and a willing buyer within a reasonable length of time, either before or after the tax lien date, the auditor shall consider the sale price of such tract, lot, or parcel to be the true value for taxation purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Am.Sub.H.B. No. 260, 140 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2665, 2722. We construed this statute in <em>Berea City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 269, 2005-Ohio-4979, 834 N.E.2d 782, and explained that \u201cwhen the property has been the subject of a recent arm\u2019s-length sale between a willing seller and a willing buyer, the sale price of the property shall be \u2018the true value for taxation purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13, quoting R.C. 5713.03. As the court noted in <em>Cummins Property Servs., L.L.C. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 516, 2008-Ohio-1473, 885 N.E.2d 222, \u00b6 13, \u201cat the very heart of <em>Berea </em>lies the rejection of appraisal evidence of the value of the property whenever a recent, arm\u2019s-length sale price has been offered as evidence of value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">{\u00b6 18} R.C. 5713.04, however, provides that \u201c[t]he price for which such real property would sell at auction or forced sale shall not be taken as the criterion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>its value.\u201d We have explained that \u201cthis statutory pronouncement codifies the basic proposition that a sale must be voluntary from the standpoint of both seller and buyer in order to qualify as an arm\u2019s-length transaction.\u201d <em>Cincinnati School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 63, 2010-Ohio-4907, 936 N.E.2d 489, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">{\u00b6 19} For this reason, in <em>Olentangy Local Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>141 Ohio St.3d 243, 2014-Ohio-4723, 23 N.E.3d 1086, we held that if the underlying transaction is an auction or forced sale, \u201cthe proponent of the sale price bears the burden to prove that the sale was nevertheless an arm\u2019s-length transaction between typically motivated parties and should therefore be regarded as the best evidence of the property\u2019s value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">{\u00b6 20} The BTA reasonably and lawfully determined that the sale price did not establish the property\u2019s true value for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">{\u00b6 21} First, Thistledown Racetrack sold at auction. For purposes of R.C. 5713.04, the term \u201cauction\u201d means \u201c \u2018[a] public sale of property to the highest bidder,\u2019 \u201d <em>Olentangy Local Schools </em>at \u00b6 30, quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>142 (1993) and <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>149 (9th Ed.2009), and it includes \u201cboth voluntary and involuntary auctions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 27. Here, Magna Entertainment elicited and received qualified bids, Harrah\u2019s submitted the highest bid, and the bankruptcy court found that \u201cthe bidding process afforded a full and fair opportunity for any entity to make a higher or otherwise better offer\u201d and therefore established the purchase price. Pursuant to R.C. 5713.04, the sale price for Thistledown obtained at the auction does not establish the true value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">{\u00b6 22} Second, reliable and probative evidence in the record supports the finding that Thistledown sold at a forced sale within the meaning of R.C. 5713.04. A \u201cforced sale\u201d is a \u201churried sale by a debtor because of financial hardship or a creditor\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1538 (10th Ed.2014). We have indicated that a sale does not establish a property\u2019s value when it \u201coccurs under the compulsion that the property be liquidated for the benefit of creditors,\u201d <em>Cincinnati School Dist., </em>127 Ohio St.3d 63, 2010-Ohio-4907, 936 N.E.2d 489, \u00b6 3, and \u201c[a] sale conducted under duress is characterized by \u2018compelling business circumstances * * * clearly sufficient to establish that a recent sale of property was neither arm\u2019s-length in nature nor representative of true value,\u2019 \u201d <em>Strongsville Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 309, 2007-Ohio-6, 859 N.E.2d 540, \u00b6 16, quoting <em>Lakeside Ave., Ltd. Partnership v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 540, 548, 664 N.E.2d 913 (1996). The school board acknowledges that \u201c[t]he economic problems faced by a debtor in both a chapter 7 and chapter 11 bankruptcy may cause the debtor to accept less than the full value of its property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>{\u00b6 23} Harrah\u2019s bought the racetrack at a bankruptcy sale conducted pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 363(b), which authorizes sale of property of the bankruptcy estate \u201cother than in the ordinary course of business.\u201d The bankruptcy court supervising the sale found \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d to consummate the sale because \u201cthere is substantial risk of depreciation of the value of Purchased Assets if the sale is not consummated quickly.\u201d Further, the transaction was not between typically motivated parties \u2014 the bankruptcy court approved the sale after finding that time was of the essence in order to maximize the value of the bankruptcy estate\u2019s assets and that it was in the best interests of Magna Entertainment <em>and its creditors and other parties in interest. </em>Thus, sufficient evidence shows that the bankruptcy sale occurred at least in part to liquidate assets for the benefit of Magna Entertainment\u2019s creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, the BTA acted reasonably and lawfully in determining that the 2010 sale price does not establish the true value of Thistledown Racetrack, and it therefore properly considered appraisal evidence in valuing the property. Because the school board challenged the BOR\u2019s valuation, it had the burden of going forward with evidence showing its right to any increase in valuation. <em>Dublin City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 193, 2013-Ohio-4543, 11 N.E.3d 206, \u00b6 16. However, the school board presented nothing apart from the 2010 sale and the sale order as establishing the value of the real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">{\u00b6 25} In contrast, Harrah\u2019s submitted Sangree\u2019s appraisal to prove that the real estate had a fair market value of $13,800,000. Based on comparisons he made with sales of other racetracks, Sangree indicated that $27,950,000 of the $43,000,000 purchase price could be attributed to obtaining Thistledown\u2019s racing license in the hope of operating VLTs at the racetrack; opined that the furniture, fixtures, and equipment were worth approximately $1,200,000; and, after rounding, valued the property at $13,800,000. This testimony corroborated other evidence showing that Harrah\u2019s bought Thistledown in order to acquire its racing license and operate VLTs, as well as the recitals in the purchase agreement transferring both real property and other assets and requiring transfer of the racing license as a condition of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 26} Accordingly, the BTA reasonably and lawfully determined that the 2010 sale did not establish the true value of Thistledown Racetrack, and the evidence presented supports its finding that Thistledown Racetrack was worth $13,800,000 as of the tax-lien date. We therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Aq-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Kolick &amp; Kondzer, Thomas A.
