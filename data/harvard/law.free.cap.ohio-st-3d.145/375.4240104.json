In that sexennial reappraisal year, the Washington County Auditor, an appellee here, determined a value of $9,091,000 for the store. Appellant, Lowe\u2019s Home Centers, Inc., filed a complaint before the Washington County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d), also an appellee here, and presented an opinion seeking a reduction to $3,600,000, but the BOR retained the auditor\u2019s valuation. On appeal at the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d), Lowe\u2019s and the county presented competing appraisals. The BTA adopted the county\u2019s appraisal, and Lowe\u2019s has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">{\u00b6 2} Lowe\u2019s argues that the BTA misapplied our decision in <em>Meijer Stores Ltd. Partnership v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 447, 2009-Ohio-3479, 912 N.E.2d 560, by adopting the very type of appraisal in this case that the BTA correctly rejected in <em>Rite Aid of Ohio, Inc. v. Washington Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA No. 2011-1760, 2014 WL 2708165 (Apr. 22, 2014), which the BTA decided the same day as this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">{\u00b6 3} Our decision in the <em>Rite Aid </em>appeal, issued today, \u2014 Ohio St.3d-, 2016-Ohio-371,-N.E.3d-, explains the significance of <em>Meijer Stores, </em>and reading the BTA decision here in light of that explanation pinpoints a significant omission in the BTA\u2019s analysis. Namely, the BTA adopted the county\u2019s appraisal in this case without addressing whether the evidence justified applying the special-purpose doctrine that was the basis for our holding in <em>Meijer Stores. </em>We therefore vacate the BTA\u2019s decision and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"AS1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Factual background</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\">{\u00b6 4} The property at issue consists of six parcels (five actual tracts of land plus a tax-increment-financing (\u201cTIF\u201d) parcel). The property amounts to 16.22 acres in Marietta improved with a 142,446-square-foot building constructed in 2002. According to the complaint, the auditor valued the property at $9,091,000, and Lowe\u2019s sought a reduction to $3,600,000. Lowe\u2019s made a presentation at the BOR hearing in support of its requested valuation; the report consisted mainly of a comparable-sale study that was well short of an appraisal. The BOR\u2019s consultant recommended no change, and the BOR adopted that recommendation on June 15, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">\n<em>The competing appraisals and theories at the BTA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">{\u00b6 5} Lowe\u2019s appealed to the BTA, which held a hearing on April 2, 2013. Both Lowe\u2019s and the county presented appraisals. Lowe\u2019s presented the appraisal and testimony of Patricia Costello of the Robert Weiler Company, who arrived at a value of $5,700,000 by reconciling an income approach that yielded a value of $5,295,000 with a sales-comparison approach that yielded a value of $5,700,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">{\u00b6 6} The county presented the appraisal report and testimony of Karen Blosser, MAI, of U.S. Realty Consultants, Inc. (the same appraiser who testified for the county at the BTA hearing in <em>Rite Aid, </em>BTA No. 2011-1760, 2014 WL 2708165). Blosser arrived at a value of $7,200,000 based on reconciling an income approach that yielded a value of $7,200,000 with a sales-comparison approach that yielded a value of $7,100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 7} The differences in the two appraisals stem in significant part from competing assumptions. More than once, Costello, the property owner\u2019s appraiser, testified that she was valuing the property as if Lowe\u2019s were to leave the property in connection with a sale. She stated that \u201cin general, if a property like this, fee simple, basically it would be vacant if it were transferring. This property is not under lease.\u201d The county\u2019s appraiser, Blosser, testified that her assumptions were exactly the opposite. When asked, \u201cSo let\u2019s say this wasn\u2019t owner occupied January 1, 2010, who\u2019s the most likely occupant of the property,\u201d Blosser responded, \u201cLowe\u2019s would be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 8} The selection and treatment of comparables reflected these differing approaches. Blosser placed primary reliance on \u201cbig box\u201d store rent comparables from remote parts of the state, making adjustments for market conditions and the location, size, and age of the budding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For sale comparables, Blosser selected six comps from throughout the state involving retail stores from 62,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>square feet up to approximately 129,000 square feet. Three are \u201cleased fee\u201d sales and three are \u201cfee simple\u201d sales, by which the appraiser means that three of the properties were subject to a lease at the time of the sale and three were not. Although certain adjustments were made, no adjustments were made to the leased-fee sales to account for the fact that the subject was owner-occupied as of the lien date.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">{\u00b6 9} The Costello appraisal also assembled lease comparables throughout the state, although Costello focused on \u201csecond-generation\u201d properties where the initial user was no longer occupying the premises. Thus, Costello\u2019s lease comparables were built in 1962 (a 20,000-square-foot portion of a former Value City converted to multitenant use, this portion now leased to a furniture store), 1992 (a 35,650-square-foot craft center in a multitenant shopping center), 1997 (a 36,000-square-foot current Value City), 1988 (a 51,282-square-foot J.C. Penney anchoring a mall), and 1990 (an 81,548-square-foot leased portion of a strip mall). By contrast, Blosser\u2019s lease comparables were constructed in 2006 (a WalMart), 1988 (a Sam\u2019s Club), 1994 (another Lowe\u2019s), and 2008 (a Giant Eagle).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">{\u00b6 10} The sale comparables in the Costello appraisal are two former WalMarts built in 1994 and 1995, another Lowe\u2019s built in 1993, and a Garden Ridge built in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">\n<em>The BTA\u2019s decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">{\u00b6 11} As in <em>Rite Aid, </em>the BTA\u2019s analysis of the appraisals is terse. The leading point of contention is the propriety of using \u201cfirst-generation user-occupied comparable properties\u201d and \u201clong-term leased built-to-suit properties.\u201d BTA No. 2011-1664, 2014 WL 2708164, *2 (Apr. 22, 2014). Citing our decision in the <em>Meijer Stores </em>case and its own decision in <em>Target Corp. v. Lake Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA No. 2008-M-1088, 2011 WL 6917517 (Dec. 20, 2011), the BTA opined that \u201cby intentionally excluding first-generation users and long-term leased build-to-suit properties within her two approaches, Costello has not properly analyzed the market.\u201d BTA No. 2011-1664, 2014 WL 2708164, *2. By contrast, the BTA found that Blosser\u2019s comparables \u201cwere more appropriate given that Lowe\u2019s occupied the property as of the tax-lien date, as well as Blosser\u2019s testimony that the subject is located in a high-trafficked [sic] area which draws from a regional market.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">{\u00b6 12} Lowe\u2019s has appealed and claims that it is entitled to be treated similarly to the taxpayer i\u00f1 <em>Rite Aid, </em>\u2014 Ohio St.3d-, 2016-Ohio-371, \u2014 N.E.3d-.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Differential treatment of taxpayers may be justified by a finding that THEY ARE DIFFERENTLY SITUATED \u2014 A FINDING THAT IS MISSING HERE</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\"><em>The BTA\u2019s reliance on its 2011 </em>Target <em>decision is legal error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">{\u00b6 13} In challenging the BTA\u2019s decision in this case, Lowe\u2019s emphasizes the board\u2019s \u201cinconsistent and discriminatory\u201d application of R.C. 5713.03, the proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ty-valuation statute, along with the board\u2019s \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d in accepting the very type of appraisal it rejected in <em>Rite Aid, </em>BTA No. 2011-1760, 2014 WL 2708165. In our decision of the county\u2019s appeal in the <em>Rite Aid </em>case, we discussed the significance of <em>Meijer Stores </em>and the special-purpose doctrine, and we affirmed the BTA\u2019s decision in that case on the grounds that the special-purpose doctrine had not been shown to be applicable to the subject property, with the result that the BTA\u2019s adoption of the property owner\u2019s appraisal was neither unreasonable nor unlawful. In the present case, the BTA went in the opposite direction from its determination in <em>Rite Aid </em>by adopting the appraisal prepared by Karen Blosser for the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 14} It is well settled that \u201c[t]he weighing of evidence and the assessment of credibility as regards both of the appraisals are the statutory job of the BTA.\u201d <em>EOP-BP Tower, L.L.C. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-3096, 829 N.E.2d 686, \u00b6 9. Moreover, \u201c[ajbsent a showing of an abuse of discretion, the BTA\u2019s determination as to the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony will not be reversed by this court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 15} On the other hand, \u201cwe will not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789 (2001). Here, we find legal error primarily because of the BTA\u2019s reliance on <em>Meijer Stores </em>in conjunction with its own decision in <em>Target Corp., </em>BTA No. 2008-M-1088, 2011 WL 6917517.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 16} The BTA\u2019s <em>Target </em>decision is contrary to part of our holding in <em>Rite Aid. </em>In <em>Rite Aid, </em>we discussed the general rule that leased comparables will typically need to be adjusted in determining the value of a subject property that is itself unencumbered by such a lease. \u2014 Ohio St.3d-, 2016-Ohio-371, - \u2014 \u2022 N.E.3d -; <em>see also Steak \u2018n Shake, Inc. v. Warren Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>145 Ohio St.3d 244, 2015-Ohio-4836, 48 N.E.3d 535, \u00b6 36. In this case, the BTA stated that the Blosser appraisal, which did \u201cnot exclude first generation user-occupied comparable properties\u201d and \u201clong-term leased built-to-suit properties,\u201d was \u201cmore appropriate,\u201d relying in principal part on its <em>Target </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">{\u00b6 17} In its 2011 <em>Target </em>decision, the BTA rejected the property owner\u2019s appraisal and adopted an appraisal offered by the board of education that had been prepared by Karen Blosser. The BTA specifically faulted the owner\u2019s appraisal for \u201cma[king] significant adjustments to bring that [comparable] sale to what he believed the property would have sold for if it were garnering a market rent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *3. The BTA then stated its view that \u201cthe Ohio Supreme Court has rejected the need for adjustments made by the appraiser when considering the value of properties encumbered with such above-market rental rates.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>{\u00b6 18} In <em>Rite Aid, </em>we explained why this statement is incorrect as a general rule, with the exception that adjustments may not be necessary when the special-purpose doctrine applies. <em>Rite Aid </em>at \u00b6 21-22. The BTA\u2019s application of it here, in the absence of any finding concerning the special-purpose doctrine, is erroneous under <em>Rite Aid. </em>To correct the error, we find it necessary to vacate the decision below and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">\n<em>If the BTA determines that the special-purpose doctrine applies, Lowe\u2019s may appropriately be treated differently than Rite Aid</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AUXG\">{\u00b6 19} Lowe\u2019s invokes the guarantees of due process and equal protection, but its argument lacks merit unless it can establish that it is situated similarly to the taxpayer in <em>Rite Aid. See GTE N., Inc. v. Zaino, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 9, 2002-Ohio-2984, 770 N.E.2d 65, \u00b6 22 (while legislative tax classifications must not have the effect of treating differently persons who are in all relevant respects alike, the Equal Protection Clause \u201c \u2018does not require things which are different in fact * * * to be treated in law as though they were the same\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>Tigner v. Texas, </em>310 U.S. 141, 147, 60 S.Ct. 879, 84 L.Ed. 1124 (1940). The relevant question relating to the potential difference here is whether the special-purpose doctrine can properly be applied when appraising the Lowe\u2019s store, a determination that has not yet been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 20} The case law furnishes guidance for the BTA to make the special-purpose determination on remand. In <em>Meijer Stores, </em>we had no trouble affirming the BTA\u2019s reliance on the board of education\u2019s appraisal based on the special-purpose doctrine. Several factors were significant:</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">\u2022 The property was brand new on the lien date, having been recently constructed at the cost of millions.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">\u2022 The property was being put to apparently successful business use for the purpose for which it had been built.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">\u2022 The facility was massive at 193,000 square feet, thereby raising the inference that it might not be easy to market for general retail use \u2014 an inference supported by the property owner\u2019s appraiser, who testified as to the immediate external obsolescence given the property\u2019s adaptation to Meijer\u2019s particular business use.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\"><em>See Meijer Stores, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 447, 2009-Ohio-3479, 912 N.E.2d 560, at \u00b6 4, 7, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">{\u00b6 21} Similarly, in an earlier case involving a Meijer store, the BTA had declined to adopt the larger amount of obsolescence found by the owner\u2019s appraiser. The BTA found that there was \u201cnothing about the * * * property [that was] obsolete or useless to the owner due to changing business conditions.\u201d <em>Meijer, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA Nos. 93-M-731, 93-M-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>732, and 93-M-733, 1995 WL 59106, *11 (Feb. 8, 1995). Indeed, \u201c[t]he owner, by purchasing the land and constructing the building, evidences a market need for such a property. Therefore the costs of purchase and construction evidence that a prospective purchaser was willing to pay at least the costs of the property as newly constructed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *12.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Dinner Bell Meats, Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>12 Ohio St.3d 270, 466 N.E.2d 909 (1984), two competing appraisals employed differing cost approaches based on their respective findings that the property was \u201cspecial purpose\u201d in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 271. The court concluded that \u201cin utilizing the \u2018cost approach\u2019 for a \u2018special purpose\u2019 building,\u201d the appraiser \u201csimply considered the utility of the properties in conjunction with the highest and best use of the meatpacking facility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272. In so holding, we acknowledged the general principle that \u201c \u2018the special purpose exception is applied to a building in good condition being used currently and for the foreseeable future for the unique purpose for which it was built,\u2019 \u201d a doctrine necessary to prevent \u201cthe owner of a distinctive, but yet highly useful, building\u201d from \u201cescaping] full property tax liability.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting Fed <em>Res. Bank of Minneapolis v. State, </em>313 N.W.2d 619, 623 (Minn.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b623} Where the present case fits in with this case law has not yet been determined. It will be the responsibility of the BTA as the finder of fact to make that determination on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Under former R.C. 5713.03, the fee simple of the subject property SHOULD BE VALUED AS IT IS, ENCUMBERED OR UNENCUMBERED</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">{\u00b6 24} In this appeal, Lowe\u2019s asserts that the fee simple of the subject property must be valued as if unencumbered. It is true that current R.C. 5713.03, as later amended, does call for the county auditors to value property \u201cas if unencumbered.\u201d 2012 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 487, further amended by 2012 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 510. But the revisions introducing the words \u201cas if unencumbered\u201d were enacted during 2012, and accordingly were not in effect as of the tax-lien date for the tax year at issue, 2010. Moreover, nothing in the 2012 legislation made the new language retroactive to tax year 2010. The \u201cas if unencumbered\u201d language is therefore not applicable here. <em>Sapina v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>136 Ohio St.3d 188, 2013-Ohio-3028, 992 N.E.2d 1117, \u00b6 20, fn. 1. It is clear under the version of R.C. 5713.03 that was applicable in 2010 that the effects of any encumbrances on a sale price were not to be removed when determining property value. Am.Sub.H.B. No. 260, 140 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2722; <em>see also Cummins Property Servs., L.L.C. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 516, 2008-Ohio-1473, 885 N.E.2d 222, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">{\u00b6 25} It is, however, true that the present property should be valued as if unencumbered by a lease, but that is because it was in fact unencumbered by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>lease, not because of a general principle applicable in 2010 mandating that adjustments be made to eliminate the effect of encumbrances on the sale price of the subject property. If the special-purpose doctrine does not apply, the value of any comparables that were subject to leases should be adjusted to achieve a true comparable for this subject property. <em>Steak \u2018n Shake, </em>145 Ohio St.3d 244, 2015-Ohio-4836, 48 N.E.3d 535, at \u00b6 36. On the other hand, if the special-purpose doctrine does apply, it may be appropriate to use such comparables without adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">On remand, the BTA should determine whether departures from uniform STANDARDS IMPAIR THE CREDIBILITY OF THE BLOSSER APPRAISAL</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">{\u00b6 26} Lowe\u2019s separately contends that the Blosser appraisal failed to abide by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (\u201cUSPAP\u201d). Specifically, Lowe\u2019s maintains that the Blosser appraisal violates USPAP Standards Rule 1-1 (c), which prohibits an appraiser from \u201crendering] appraisal services in a careless or negligent manner\u201d such as \u201cmaking a series of errors that, although individually might not significantly affect the results of an appraisal, in the aggregate affects the credibility of those results.\u201d Lowe\u2019s focuses on the interviews designed to obtain information on the local real-estate market that were performed by Blosser\u2019s assistant rather than Blosser; Lowe\u2019s also points out that the interviewees were not currently in possession of broker or real-estate-sales licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">{\u00b6 27} The bare fact of such violations does not by itself make it unlawful to adopt a particular appraisal. <em>See Dublin City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 212, 2014-Ohio-1940, 11 N.E.3d 222, \u00b6 28 (\u201cIndustry standards do not establish the legal parameters of real-property assessment for taxation purposes\u201d). That said, the matters raised by Lowe\u2019s could be found to affect the credibility of the appraisal under all the circumstances of the case, and it is the duty of the BTA as the finder of fact to make those determinations. The BTA should give consideration to these matters on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">{\u00b6 28} For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the decision of the BTA and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">Decision vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b637-12\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A2G\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The Gibbs Firm, L.P.A., Ryan J.
