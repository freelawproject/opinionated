Ray Jones, counsel for plaintiff, has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge David A. Basinski, a retired judge sitting by assignment, from presiding over any further proceedings in the above-captioned divorce case, now pending for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">{\u00b6 2} Jones claims that on the day of the scheduled trial, and before hearing any evidence, Judge Basinski expressed a fixed anticipatory judgment regarding how he intended to divide the parties\u2019 marital property. Specifically, Jones claims that Judge Basinski stated that if the parties could not settle their outstanding property issues on their own, he would appoint a receiver to liquidate the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Basinski has responded in writing to the affidavit, explaining that upon learning that the parties had not settled their property issues, he wanted to \u201cget their attention,\u201d so he \u201cdescribed the most radical method of dividing the various marital assets, <em>i.e., </em>the appointment of a receiver and the sale of all of the marital property.\u201d Explaining to the parties the \u201cworst possible outcome if the matter goes to trial,\u201d the judge asserts, is part of his settlement approach in domestic-relations cases. Judge Basinski affirms, however, that because he has not heard any evidence in the matter, he has not prejudged the issues nor decided how he will ultimately rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Basinski.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">{\u00b6 5} As an initial matter, the timeliness of the affidavit warrants discussion. R.C. 2701.03(B) requires that an affidavit of disqualification be filed \u201cnot less than seven calendar days before the day on which the next hearing in the proceeding is scheduled.\u201d This statutory deadline may be set aside, however, when \u201ccompliance with the provision is impossible,\u201d such as when the alleged bias or prejudice occurs fewer than seven days before the hearing date. <em>In re Disqualification of Leskovyansky, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 1210, 723 N.E.2d 1099 (1999); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Squire, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 110, 2007-Ohio-5588, 876 N.E.2d 933, \u00b6 27. Here, Jones filed his affidavit of disqualification on November 16, 2015, the same day as the scheduled trial. Jones avers, however, that Judge Basinski made the alleged biased comments earlier that same day and that the judge had adjourned the trial so that Jones could file the affidavit. In light of Jones\u2019s averments, the clerk properly accepted the affidavit for filing. <em>See In re Disqualification of Squire, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1202, 2005-Ohio-7157, 850 N.E.2d 709, \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">{\u00b6 6} Turning to the merits, a judge, in facilitating settlement prior to trial, may \u201cwarn of potential adverse consequences should an agreement not be reached.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Spon, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1254, 2012-Ohio-6345, 984 N.E.2d 1069, \u00b6 22. Here, the transcript reveals that after learning that the parties could not resolve the property issues, Judge Basinski outlined several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>factors that they should consider before proceeding to trial, including the potential for an appointment of a receiver to liquidate their marital property. To some, the judge\u2019s approach may seem somewhat heavy-handed, but upon review of the entire transcript \u2014 as well as the judge\u2019s statements in his response to the affidavit of disqualification \u2014 his pretrial comments encouraging settlement are not sufficient to overcome the presumption that he will be able to render a fair decision based on the evidence later presented at trial. <em>See, e.cj., In re Disqualification of Brown, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1250, 1251, 657 N.E.2d 1353 (1993) (judge\u2019s expression of a conditional opinion of the facts or the law \u201cis not sufficient to counter the presumption of the judge\u2019s ability to render a fair decision based upon the evidence later presented at trial\u201d); <em>In re Disqualification of Forchione, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1235, 2012-Ohio-6303, 983 N.E.2d 356, \u00b622 (fact that judge discussed the possibility of an unfavorable verdict did not establish bias or prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">{\u00b6 7} Additionally, the transcript indicates that Judge Basinski addressed his pretrial comments to both parties, and Jones has not sufficiently explained how the judge\u2019s comments reflect a bias against his client or in favor of defendant. In disqualification requests, \u201c[t]he term \u2018bias or prejudice\u2019 \u2018implies a hostile feeling or spirit of ill-will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Neill, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1232, 2002-Ohio-7479, 798 N.E.2d 17, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956). Here, the judge\u2019s cautionary words do not appear to indicate ill will against one specific party or favoritism toward the other party. Accordingly, the judge\u2019s words do not indicate a bias or prejudice against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">{\u00b6 8} The statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. \u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">{\u00b6 9} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Basinski.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
