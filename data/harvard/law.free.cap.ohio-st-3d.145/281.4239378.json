We hold that it may.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">I. Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">{\u00b6 2} A Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted appellant, Antonia Earley, on two counts of aggravated vehicular assault, one count of endangering children, two counts of OVI, and one count of using weapons while intoxicated, all with forfeiture specifications. Earley pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated vehicular assault, a felony of the third degree, in violation of R.C. 2903.08(A)(1)(a); one count of endangering children, a felony of the third degree, in violation of R.C. 2919.22(A); one count of OVI, a misdemeanor of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a); and the accompanying forfeiture specifications. The state requested a nolle prosequi on the remaining counts, and those were dismissed. The trial court sentenced Earley to a term of three years for aggravated vehicular assault, 36 months for endangering children, and six months for OVI, all to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">{\u00b6 3} Earley appealed her sentences, claiming that aggravated vehicular assault is an allied offense of OVI and that they should have merged. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that even assuming that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>aggravated vehicular assault and OVI are allied offenses, R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) creates an exception that permits a trial court to impose a sentence for both.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">{\u00b6 4} The appellate court certified that its decision conflicted with <em>State v. West, </em>2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23547, 2010-Ohio-1786, 2010 WL 1632316; <em>State v. Mendoza, </em>6th Dist. Wood No. WD-10-008, 2012-Ohio-5988, 2012 WL 6617859; and <em>State v. Phelps, </em>12th Dist. Butler No. CA2009-09-243, 2010-Ohio-3257, 2010 WL 2723103. In those cases, without addressing the possible impact of R.C. 2929.41(B)(3), the appellate courts either held that an aggravated-vehicular-assault offense and an OVI offense merged or remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings to determine whether the offenses should merge pursuant to R.C. 2941.25. <em>West </em>at \u00b6 45; <em>Mendoza </em>at \u00b6 10-11; <em>Phelps </em>at \u00b6 30-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">{\u00b6 5} We accepted the conflict certified to us by the Eighth District Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">When the offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) is the predicate conduct for aggravated vehicular assault in violation [of] R.C. 2903.08(A)(1), are the two offenses allied, and if so, does R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) create an exception that allows a trial court to impose a sentence for both offenses?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">140 Ohio St.3d 1450, 2014-Ohio-4414, 17 N.E.3d 597. We also accepted the proposition of law raised in Earley\u2019s discretionary appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">When the offense of operating a vehicle while under the influence, R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a), is the predicate conduct for aggravated vehicular assault, R.C. 2903.08(A)(1)(a), Ohio\u2019s allied-offense statute, R.C. 2941.25, must be considered before a court may determine whether concurrent or consecutive sentences will be imposed under [R.C.] 2929.41(B)(3). Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, United States Constitution; Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution; R.C. 2941.25.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">140 Ohio St.3d 1451, 2014-Ohio-4414, 17 N.E.3d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">{\u00b6 6} The specific language found in R.C. 2941.25 and 2929.41 guides us in deciding whether R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) creates an exception that allows a trial court to impose a sentence for both aggravated vehicular assault in violation of R.C. 2903.08(A)(1)(a) and OVI in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) when the OVI offense is the predicate conduct for aggravated vehicular assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\n<em>A. Statutory Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 2941.25 sets forth when a defendant may be convicted of multiple offenses. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">(B) Where the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">{\u00b6 8} While R.C. 2941.25 focuses on multiple convictions, R.C. 2929.41 addresses sentencing, providing instruction to the trial court on whether prison terms shall be served consecutively or concurrently. R.C. 2929.41(A) provides, \u201cExcept as provided in division (B)(3) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for felony.\u201d And R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor violation of section 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19 of the Revised Code shall be served consecutively to a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of section 2903.06, 2903.07, 2903.08, or 4511.19 of the Revised Code or a felony violation of section 2903.04 of the Revised Code involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">\n<em>B. The Parties\u2019Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">{\u00b6 9} Earley argues that her aggravated-vehicular-assault and OVI offenses are allied offenses of similar import pursuant to <em>State v. Johnson, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061, and that the trial court committed plain error when it sentenced her for both.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">{\u00b6 10} The state responds that the trial court properly sentenced Earley for both aggravated vehicular assault and OVI. It argues that the plain language of R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) demonstrates the General Assembly\u2019s intent to allow cumula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>tive punishments for those offenses, and it suggests that our analysis for determining whether offenses merge pursuant to R.C. 2941.25 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\n<em>C. The Offenses Are Not Allied Offenses of Similar Import</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AhR\">{\u00b6 11} We conclude that the trial court did not err in sentencing Earley for both OVI in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) and aggravated vehicular assault in violation of R.C. 2903.08(A)(1)(a), because we hold that the two offenses are not allied offenses of similar import. In so concluding, we note that Earley\u2019s reliance upon <em>Johnson </em>is misplaced. The lead opinion in <em>Johnson </em>did not receive the support of a majority of this court, and more recent decisions of this court have rendered the analysis of the <em>Johnson </em>lead opinion largely obsolete. <em>See State v. Ruff, </em>143 Ohio St.3d 114, 2015-Ohio-995, 34 N.E.3d 892, \u00b6 16 (recognizing that although <em>Johnson </em>included a syllabus paragraph, our decision in that case \u201cwas incomplete\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 12} We have applied a three-part test under R.C. 2941.25 to determine whether a defendant can be convicted of multiple offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">As a practical matter, when determining whether offenses are allied offenses of similar import -within the meaning of R.C. 2941.25, courts must ask three questions when defendant\u2019s conduct supports multiple offenses: (1) Were the offenses dissimilar in import or significance? (2) Were they committed separately? and (3) Were they committed with separate animus or motivation? An affirmative answer to any of the above will permit separate convictions. The conduct, the animus, and the import must all be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\"><em>Ruff at </em>\u00b6 31; <em>see also id. </em>at paragraphs one, two, and three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">{\u00b6 13} The two particular offenses at issue here \u2014 felony aggravated vehicular assault under R.C. 2903.08(A)(1)(a) and misdemeanor OYI under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) \u2014 are offenses of dissimilar import and significance. R.C. 2903.08 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">(A) No person, while operating or participating in the operation of a motor vehicle, * * * shall cause serious physical harm to another person or another\u2019s unborn in any of the following ways:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">(l)(a) As the proximate result of committing a violation of division (A) of section 4511.19 of the Revised Code or of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Aggravated vehicular assault as defined in R.C. 2903.08(A)(1)(a) is a felony of the third degree unless one of the enumerated exceptions applies to make it a felony of the second degree, R.C. 2903.08(B)(1), and always carries a mandatory prison term, R.C. 2903.08(D)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 4511.19 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">(A)(1) No person shall operate any vehicle * * * within this state, if, at the time of the operation, any of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">(a) The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">OVI in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) is a misdemeanor of the first degree unless an exception applies. R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">{\u00b6 15} By criminalizing aggravated vehicular assault under R.C. 2903.08(A)(1)(a) and classifying it as a third-degree felony with a mandatory prison term, the General Assembly emphasized the necessity of a strong punishment for and deterrent against individuals causing serious physical harm while driving under the influence. This felony offense has a different import and significance than merely driving under the influence, for aggravated vehicular assault necessarily involves causing serious physical harm to another person. A first-degree-misdemeanor violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a), on the other hand, occurs any time an individual drives under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and one who does so commits this offense regardless of any subsequent consequences that occur due to the impaired driver\u2019s actions. There is a legitimate justification for criminalizing each of these offenses separately, and R.C. 2941.25 permits separate convictions for both pursuant to the test set forth in <em>Ruff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">{\u00b6 16} Thus, because the affirmative answer to the first <em>Ruff </em>question allows Earley to be separately convicted of each offense, the trial court did not commit plain error \u2014 and did not err at all \u2014 in not merging the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">\n<em>D. R.C. 2941.25 and 2929.41(B)(3) Have Independent Effect</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">{\u00b6 17} We further hold that R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) does not create an exception to R.C. 2941.25. Instead, the two statutes are independent and work together.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">{\u00b6 18} The allied-offense statute, R.C. 2941.25, concerns the merger of <em>convictions. </em>By applying R.C. 2941.25, courts determine whether a defendant can be convicted of multiple offenses. If a court concludes that particular multiple offenses are <em>not </em>allied offenses of similar import pursuant to R.C. 2941.25, the defendant may be convicted of all of them. And if that occurs, the court then proceeds to sentence the defendant on all the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>{\u00b6 19} R.C. 2929.41 addresses sentencing, providing instruction to the trial court on whether prison terms shall be served consecutively or concurrently. We accordingly conclude that because R.C. 2929.41 does.not become relevant until valid convictions have <em>already </em>been obtained, it cannot be said that R.C. 2929.41 creates an exception to R.C. 2941.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">{\u00b6 20} By explicitly providing that a sentence for a violation of R.C. 4511.19 can be served either consecutively or concurrently to a sentence for a violation of R.C. 2903.08, the language of R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) bolsters the view that a first-degree-misdemeanor OVI and a third-degree-felony aggravated vehicular assault are offenses of dissimilar import and significance that are to be punished cumulatively. R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) authorized the trial court to impose multiple sentences on Earley for those offenses by providing that the requirement for concurrent sentences stated in R.C. 2929.41(A) does not necessarily apply in this specific situation. Although this language is fully consistent with our conclusion that the two offenses at issue in this case are not allied offenses of similar import, it is not dispositive of that concern because either sentencing option available to the trial court under R.C. 2929.41 here was based on the presence of two valid separate convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 21} We accordingly hold that a trial court may impose cumulative sentences for aggravated vehicular assault in violation of R.C. 2903.08(A)(1)(a) and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) when the offense of operating a vehicle while under the influence is the predicate conduct for aggravated vehicular assault. Furthermore, R.C. 2941.25 and 2929.41(B)(3) have independent effect, and it cannot be said that R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) provides an exception to the allied-offense statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b543-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b543-9\">O\u2019Donnell, Kennedy, and French, JJ., concur in judgment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b543-10\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Alg\">separately concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) carves out an exception to the allied offense statute and permits a court to impose consecutive sentences for felony aggravated vehicular assault in violation of R.C. 2903.08(A)(1)(a) and its predicate misdemeanor offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs (\u201cOVI\u201d) in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a), regardless of whether they are allied offenses of similar import.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>{\u00b6 23} We have considered the allied offense statute, R.C. 2941.25, on many occasions and have recognized it as a legislative prohibition against multiple punishments for two or more offenses resulting from the same conduct. <em>See State v. Washington, </em>137 Ohio St.3d 427, 2013-Ohio-4982, 999 N.E.2d 661, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 24} It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">(B) Where the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">{\u00b6 25} R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) specifically authorizes a trial court to exercise its discretion to impose consecutive sentences for misdemeanor OVI violations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for <em>a misdemeanor violation of section </em>* * * <em>4511.19 of the Revised Code shall be served consecutively to a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of section </em>* * * <em>2903.08 * </em>* * <em>when the trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">{\u00b6 26} By using this language, the General Assembly expressed its intent to vest a sentencing court with discretion to impose consecutive sentences for the felony of aggravated vehicular assault and a misdemeanor OVI offense whenever the court exercises its discretion to impose sentence in that fashion. In <em>State v. Kreischer, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 391, 2006-Ohio-2706, 848 N.E.2d 496, this court stated: \u201c[W]hen the General Assembly has plainly and unambiguously conveyed its legislative intent, there is nothing for a court to interpret or construe, and therefore, the court applies the law as written.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">{\u00b6 27} The majority concludes that R.C. 2941.25 is independent from R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) because R.C. 2941.25 focuses on multiple convictions while R.C. 2929.41 addresses sentencing. According to the majority, \u201cR.C. 2929.41 does not become relevant until valid convictions have <em>already </em>been obtained.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Majority opinion at \u00b6 19. However, we recently concluded that \u201c \u2018for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>purposes of R.C. 2941.25(A), a conviction is a determination of guilt <em>and the ensuing sentence[;]\u2019 \u201d </em>thus, a defendant \u201c \u2018is not \u201cconvicted\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2941.25(A) <em>until the sentence is imposed.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Rogers, </em>143 Ohio St.3d 385, 2015-Ohio-2459, 38 N.E.3d 860, \u00b6 18, quoting <em>State v. Whitfield, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 319, 2010-Ohio-2, 922 N.E.2d 182, \u00b6 13, 24. Therefore, \u201cmerger of allied offenses occurs at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Whitfield </em>at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AWc\">Timothy J.

Walton, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, urging affirmance for amicus curiae Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney Ron O\u2019Brien.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 28} The allied offense statute provides general rules on whether multiple sentences may be imposed, whereas R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) expressly refers to the two offenses at issue in this case and permits a trial court to exercise its discretion to impose consecutive sentences if it chooses to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 29} Accordingly, regardless of whether the felony offense of aggravated vehicular assault and the misdemeanor offense of OVI qualify as allied offenses of similar import for purposes of R.C. 2941.25, the specific directory language of R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) permits a trial court to impose cumulative sentences for those offenses independent of and without regard to the allied offense statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 30} For this reason, I concur in the judgment entered in this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b545-9\">Kennedy and French, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
