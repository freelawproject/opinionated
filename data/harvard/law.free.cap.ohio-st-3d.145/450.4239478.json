We expressly extend that precedent to public-works contracts, vacate the judgment of the court of appeals, and remand this cause to that court for reconsideration in light of our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">{\u00b6 2} In 2007, appellant, the village of Piketon, solicited bids for the \u201cPike Hill Roadway and Related Improvements\u201d project. The project included the installation of a traffic light at the intersection of U.S. Route 23 and Market Street in Piketon and improvements to the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Appellee, Boone Coleman Construction, Inc., submitted the lowest bid and was hired for the project. The parties entered into a contract in which Piketon agreed to pay Boone Coleman $683,300 to complete the work. The contract expressly provided that the time for completing the project was \u201cof the essence\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the project had to be substantially completed within 120 days of the date of commencement of the project. A liquidated-damages provision made clear that Boone Coleman would pay $700 to Piketon for each day after the specified completion date that the contract was not substantially completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">{\u00b6 4} The date of commencement of the project was set for July 30, 2007. Thus, the contract required that the project be substantially completed 120 days later on November 27, 2007. Piketon granted Boone Coleman\u2019s first request for an extension, which moved the completion date to May 30, 2008. But when Boone Coleman sought another extension, Piketon refused to grant it and notified Boone Coleman that it would assess the contractually specified liquidated damages of $700 per day if the project was not completed by May 30, 2008. Boone Coleman did not finish the project by then and on July 7, 2008, Piketon informed Boone Coleman that it was assessing damages of $700 per day as of May 31, 2008, until the completion of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">{\u00b6 5} Boone Coleman did not complete the project until July 2, 2009 \u2014 well over a year (397 days) after the parties\u2019 extended completion date of May 30, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Boone Coleman brought suit against Piketon in the Pike County Common Pleas Court. Among other things, it alleged that Piketon had improperly faded to pay $147,477 of the contract price for the construction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Piketon counterclaimed for liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">{\u00b6 7} Piketon moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted Piketon\u2019s motion and entered judgment in its favor, awarding Piketon $277,900 in liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">{\u00b6 8} Boone Coleman appealed, asserting that the trial court erred in awarding Piketon liquidated damages. The appellate court agreed. Citing our decision in <em>Samson Sales, Inc. v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>12 Ohio St.3d 27, 465 N.E.2d 392 (1984), it held, \u201c[W]hen we view the contract as a whole <em>in its application, </em>we conclude the amount of damages is so manifestly unreasonable and disproportionate that it is plainly unrealistic and inequitable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 2014-Ohio-2377, 13 N.E.3d 1190, at \u00b6 40. It concluded that because the \u201cresulting amount [of liquidated damages] is manifestly inequitable and unrealistic, courts are justified in determining the provision to be an unenforceable penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 43, citing <em>Samson Sales </em>at 28. It reversed that portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">{\u00b6 9} We granted Piketon\u2019s request for discretionary review and agreed to address two related propositions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">When evaluating the enforceability of a liquidated damages provision in a construction contract, the court must conduct its analysis prospectively, based on the per diem amount of the liquidated damages at the time the contract is executed, and not retrospectively, based on the total liquidated damages that ultimately accrue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Liquidated damages are not deemed a penalty simply because a project consists of new construction of an improvement that did not exist previously and no proof of actual damages is required to enforce liquidated damages pursuant to such a contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><em>See </em>140 Ohio St.3d 1451, 2014-Ohio-4414, 17 N.E.3d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">\n<em>Standard of Review for Contractual Liquidated-Damages Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">{\u00b6 10} We review the interpretation of a contract, a question of law, de novo. <em>Arnott v. Arnott, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 401, 2012-Ohio-3208, 972 N.E.2d 586, \u00b6 14. Similarly, the question of whether a contract clause provides for liquidated damages or an unenforceable penalty is a question of law that we also review de novo. <em>Lake Ridge Academy v. Carney, </em>66 Ohio St.3d 376, 380, 613 N.E.2d 183 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">\n<em>Substantive Law on Liquidated Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">{\u00b6 11} Simply stated, liquidated damages are damages that the parties to a contract agree upon, or stipulate to, as the actual damages that will result from a future breach of the contract. <em>Sheffield-King Milling Co. v. Domestic Science Baking Co., </em>95 Ohio St. 180, 183, 115 N.E. 1014 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c \u2018The effect of a clause for stipulated damages in a contract is to substitute the amount agreed upon as liquidated damages for the actual damages resulting from breach of the contract, and thereby prevents [sic] a controversy between the parties as to the amount of damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dave Gustafson &amp; Co., Inc. v. South Dakota, </em>83 S.D. 160, 164, 156 N.W.2d 185 (1968), quoting 22 American Jurisprudence 2d, Damages, Section 235, at 321 (1965). \u201c \u2018If a provision is construed to be one for liquidated damages, the sum stipulated forms, in general, the measure of damages in case of a breach, and the recovery must be for that amount. No larger or smaller sum can be awarded even though the actual loss may be greater or less.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting Section 235 at 321. Put another way, \u201ca liquidated damages clause in a contract is an advance settlement of the anticipated actual damages arising from a future breach.\u201d <em>Carrothers Constr. Co., L.L.C. v. S. Hutchinson, </em>288 Kan. 743, 754, 207 P.3d 231 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">{\u00b6 13} The common law viewed liquidated-damages provisions \u201cwith a gimlet eye,\u201d <em>Dist. Cablevision Ltd. Partnership v. Bassin, </em>828 A.2d 714, 723 (D.C.App. 2003), but that historical antipathy dissipated as parties to contracts, attorneys, and the courts recognized that such provisions serve valuable purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cToday the law does not look with disfavor upon \u2018liquidated damages\u2019 provisions in contracts. When they are fair and reasonable attempts to fix just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>compensation for anticipated loss caused by breach of contract, they are enforced.\u201d <em>Priebe &amp; Sons, Inc. v. United States, </em>332 U.S. 407, 411, 68 S.Ct. 123, 92 L.Ed. 32 (1947). The modern rule is \u201cto look with candor, if not with favor\u201d upon liquidated-damages provisions in contracts when those provisions were \u201cdeliberately entered into between parties who have equality of opportunity for understanding and insisting upon their rights.\u201d <em>Wise v. United States, </em>249 U.S. 361, 365, 39 S.Ct. 303, 63 L.Ed. 647 (1919). <em>See also Bassin </em>at 724, quoting <em>Wilmington Trust Co. v. Aerovias de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., </em>893 F.Supp. 215, 218 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (\u201c \u2018Relevant to this inquiry is the sophistication of the parties and whether both sides were represented by able counsel who negotiated the contract at arms length without the ability to overreach the other side\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">{\u00b6 15} Part of the appeal of liquidated-damages provisions is that they allow the contracting parties to \u201cprotect themselves against the difficulty, uncertainty, and expenses that necessarily follow judicial proceedings when trying to ascertain damages.\u201d <em>Carrothers Constr. Co., </em>288 Kan. at 754, 207 P.3d 231. This benefit is particularly valuable when \u201cactual damages are likely to be difficult to quantify in the event that the contract is breached.\u201d <em>Bassin </em>at 723. Liquidated-damages provisions thereby \u201cpromot[e] prompt performance of contracts\u201d and \u201cadjust[ ] in advance, and amicably, matters the settlement of which through courts would often involve difficulty, uncertainty, delay and expense.\u201d <em>Wise </em>at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">{\u00b6 16} Ohio has long recognized liquidated-damages provisions as valid and enforceable, <em>see Samson Sales, </em>12 Ohio St.3d at 28, 465 N.E.2d 392, citing <em>Jones v. Stevens, </em>112 Ohio St. 43, 146 N.E. 894 (1925), and <em>Lange v. Werke, </em>2 Ohio St. 519 (1853), as long as the provisions are not ones for penalties. <em>Samson Sales </em>at 28. And therein lies the rub. \u201cThe difficult problem, in each case, is to determine whether or not the stipulated sum is an unenforceable penalty or an enforceable provision for liquidated damages.\u201d <em>Dave Gustafson &amp; Co., </em>83 S.D. at 165, 156 N.W.2d 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">{\u00b6 17} In addressing whether a contract includes a permissible liquidated-damages provision or an unenforceable penalty, one of our appellate courts has explained that a \u201cpenalty\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">\u201ca sum inserted in a contract, not as the measure of compensation for its breach, but rather as a punishment for default, or by way of security for actual damages which may be sustained by reason of nonperformance, and it involves the idea of punishment. A penalty is an agreement to pay a stipulated sum on breach of contract, irrespective of the damage sustained. Its essence is a payment of money stipulated as in terrorem of the offending party, <em>while the essence of liquidated damages is a genuine </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>covenanted, pre-estimate of damages. </em>The amount is fixed and is not subject to change; however, if the stipulated sum is deemed to be a penalty, it is not enforceable and the nondefaulting party is left to the recovery of such actual damages as he can prove.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">(Emphasis sic.) <em>Piper v. Stewart &amp; Inlow, </em>5th Dist. Licking No. CA-2530, 1978 WL 217430, *1 (June 14, 1978), quoting 22 American Jurisprudence 2d, Damages, Section 213, at 298 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>Samson Sales, </em>we set forth Ohio\u2019s tripartite test to determine whether a contractual provision should be considered a liquidated-damages provision or an unenforceable penalty. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">Where the parties have agreed on the amount of damages, ascertained by estimation and adjustment, and have expressed this agreement in clear and unambiguous terms, the amount so fixed should be treated as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, if the damages would be (1) uncertain as to amount and difficult of proof, and if (2) the contract as a whole is not so manifestly unconscionable, unreasonable, and disproportionate in amount as to justify the conclusion that it does not express the true intention of the parties, and if (3) the contract is consistent with the conclusion that it was the intention of the parties that damages in the amount stated should follow the breach thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-7\"><em>Samson Sales, </em>12 Ohio St.3d 27, 465 N.E.2d 392, at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">{\u00b6 19} Valid and enforceable liquidated-damages provisions are those intended by the parties to give reasonable compensation for damages, but provisions that impose amounts that are \u201cmanifestly inequitable and unrealistic\u201d are deemed unenforceable penalties. <em>Id. </em>at 28. Since <em>Samson Sales, </em>we have reiterated its holding once, in <em>Lake Ridge Academy v. Carney, </em>66 Ohio St.3d 376, 380, 613 N.E.2d 183 (1993), and have not departed from its teachings. This case requires that we consider our precedent in a context we have not previously addressed: public-works-construction contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">\n<em>Liquidated Damages in Public-Works-Construction Contracts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">{\u00b6 20} The benefits of liquidated-damages provisions in building and construction contracts are well documented. R. Harper Heckman &amp; Benjamin R. Edwards, <em>Time is Money: Recovery of Liquidated Damages by the Owner, </em>24 Constr.Lawyer 28, 29 (Fall 2004). The provisions create firm expectations and allow the parties to allocate damages caused by delays in completing construction. <em>Id. </em>The ability to agree about damages is particularly important in public-works-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>construction contracts because \u201c[i]t is uniquely difficult to calculate damages to the general public interest caused by a contractor\u2019s breach of its agreement to provide public improvements.\u201d <em>Carrothers Constr. Co., </em>288 Kan. at 756, 207 P.3d 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">{\u00b6 21} In a public-roadway-construction contract, each delay in completing the project adds to inconvenience, increased costs, and loss of use of the roadway. <em>Dave Gustafson &amp; Co., </em>83 S.D. at 167, 156 N.W.2d 185. But \u201c \u2018each day\u2019s delay, while unquestionably injurious, is injurious frequently in ways that are difficult to estimate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting 5 Jaeger, <em>Williston on Contracts, </em>Section 785, 733 (3d Ed.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">{\u00b6 22} We recognize that liquidated-damages provisions in public-construction projects play an important civic purpose in that they help foster timely completion of the projects, thereby avoiding the loss of billions of taxpayers\u2019 dollars caused by contractors\u2019 delays. <em>See, e.g., </em>Scott M. Tyler, <em>No (Easy) Way Out: \u201cLiquidating\u201d Stipulated Damages for Contractor Delay in Public Construction Contracts, </em>44 Duke L.J. 357, 358-359 (1994); Christian, <em>Public Entities in Nevada Beware, </em>12-OCT Nevada Lawyer 16. We are not alone in that recognition. The Supreme Court and many state and federal appellate courts also recognize that liquidated-damages provisions in public contracts are particularly valuable given the unique difficulty in calculating the damages associated with a public contractor\u2019s breach of its promise to timely complete a public-improvement project. <em>See, e.g., Priebe &amp; Sons, </em>332 U.S. at 411, 68 S.Ct. 123, 92 L.Ed. 32 (recognizing that liquidated-damages provisions \u201cserve a particularly useful function when damages are uncertain in nature or amount or are unmeasurable, as is the case in many government contracts\u201d); <em>Hovas Constr., Inc. v. W. Line Consol. School Dist. Bd. of Trustees, </em>111 So.3d 663, 666-667 (Miss.App.2013); <em>Carrothers Constr. Co. </em>at 756 (the unique difficulty of calculating damages when a contractor breaches a public-works contract \u201cshould be an important consideration in such cases and weigh favorably in finding a liquidated damages provision to be reasonable\u201d); <em>Fortune Bridge Co. v. Dept. of Transp., </em>242 Ga. 531, 533-534, 250 S.E.2d 401 (1978) (noting that \u201cdamages flowing from the contractor\u2019s failure to complete [public] roadway and bridges in a timely fashion are, as a practical matter, incapable of proof\u2019); <em>Brooks v. Wichita, </em>114 F. 297, 299 (8th Cir.1902) (recognizing that liquidated-damages provisions are the only way for a city to obtain adequate compensation for breach of a public contract; the damages sustained by the public in such cases are not capable of \u201cjudicial ascertainment,\u201d because they are \u201ctoo remote, conjectural, and speculative\u201d to prove); <em>Dade Cty. Pub. Health Trust v. Romart Constr., Inc., </em>577 So.2d 636, 638 (Fla.App.1991) (fact that public entity may have suffered no monetary loss from breach does not render liquidated-damages provision unconscionable, because public project was intended for public use, not for profit).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>{\u00b6 23} We agree with those courts that find that \u201cthe protection of the public interest is a proper consideration in determining [the] validity of a liquidated damages provision.\u201d <em>Carrothers Constr. Co., </em>288 Kan. at 756, 207 P.3d 231. The Ohio General Assembly requires that every state-funded public-improvement-construction contract include a liquidated-damages provision. R.C. 153.19. Many states have similar requirements. <em>Dave Gustafson &amp; Co. </em>at 166; <em>Fortune Bridge Co. </em>at 534. <em>See also Bale Contracting, Inc. v. Westerville, </em>7 Ohio App.3d 271, 272, 455 N.E.2d 517 (10th Dist.1982) (recognizing the materiality of a completion date in a public-works-construction project and that a bid for such a project is incomplete when it fails to specify the time for performance, citing R.C. 153.19).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">{\u00b6 24} With these principles in mind, we turn to the appellate court\u2019s opinion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">\n<em>The Appellate Court\u2019s Analysis of the Liquidated-Damages Provision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">{\u00b6 25} In considering whether the liquidated-damages provision in this case constituted an unenforceable penalty, the court of appeals properly applied the first and third parts of the test in <em>Samson Sales, </em>12 Ohio St.3d 27, 465 N.E.2d 392. The appellate court recognized that \u201cthe damages incurred as a result of a delay [by Boone Coleman in completing the project] were uncertain as to amount and difficult to prove\u201d and that \u201cthe plain and unambiguous language of the liquidated damages clause is consistent with the conclusion that the parties intended that damages in the amount of $700 per day would follow the contractor\u2019s breach of the project completion deadline.\u201d 2014-Ohio-2377,13 N.E.3d 1190, \u00b6 38 and 39, citing <em>Samson Sales. </em>But the appellate court concluded that the provision did not pass the second prong of the <em>Samson Sales </em>test. The second prong requires a court reviewing a liquidated-damages provision to consider whether \u201cthe contract as a whole is not so manifestly unconscionable, unreasonable, and disproportionate in amount as to justify the conclusion that it does not express the true intention of the parties.\u201d <em>Samson Sales, </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">{\u00b6 26} Even though the appellate court had already determined that the provision reflected the parties\u2019 intentions, the appellate court focused solely on the aggregate amount of the penalty, $277,900, in relation to the total value of the contract, $683,300. <em>See </em>2014-Ohio-2377, 13 N.E.3d 1190, \u00b6 42. Only after finding that the liquidated-damages aggregate award constituted a third of the total contract price did the court determine that <em>the application </em>of the provision rendered it an unenforceable penalty. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 40. For several reasons, it was error to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">{\u00b6 27} First, the appellate court relied heavily on a decision of one of its sister courts, <em>Harmon v. Haehn, </em>7th Dist. Mahoning No. 10 MA 177, 2011-Ohio-6449, 2011 WL 6296731. But <em>Harmon </em>is wholly distinguishable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Given \u201cthe wide range and variety of contracts, and of their subject-matter, it is sometimes difficult to determine whether the terms thus agreed upon in advance actually provide for damages or for a penalty.\u201d <em>Sheffield-King Milling Co., </em>95 Ohio St. at 183, 115 N.E. 1014. <em>See also Lange, </em>2 Ohio St. at 533 (noting that in evaluating a liquidated-damages provision, \u201c[arbitrary rules can not help us, and judicial decisions are of less value than upon most other questions, as each case depends so peculiarly on its own circumstances\u201d). Thus, when courts review liquidated-damages provisions, they often look to similar provisions in contracts that govern similar subject matter. <em>See, e.g., Kurtz v. W. Property, L.L.C., </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 10AP-1099, 2011-Ohio-6726, 2011 WL 6916196, \u00b6 33 (in a case involving delay in sale of real estate, cases involving breaches in other contexts are \u201creadily distinguishable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">{\u00b6 29} Here, <em>Harmon </em>is of limited value because it arose from a private commercial real-estate lease rather than a public-works-construction contract. 2011-Ohio-6449, 2011 WL 6296731, \u00b6 1. That distinction is particularly relevant because the actual damages at issue in <em>Harmon </em>were far easier to quantify than those at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">{\u00b6 30} Moreover, <em>Harmon </em>involved a liquidated-damages provision that contemplated a lump sum. Piketon and Boone Coleman did not contract for a lump sum. Rather, the parties contracted for a per diem measure of damages which, as Chief Justice Marshall recognized, is more likely to be an enforceable liquidated-damages provision than an unenforceable penalty: \u201c[T]he agreement to pay a specified sum weekly during the failure of the party to perform the work, partakes much more of the character of liquidated damages than the reservation of a sum in gross.\u201d <em>Tayloe v. T. &amp; S. Sandiford, </em>20 U.S. 13, 18, 7 Wheat. 13, 5 L.Ed. 384 (1822). In failing to recognize this distinction, the appellate court committed its second error.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">{\u00b6 31} More importantly, the appellate court\u2019s myopic focus on the reasonableness of the <em>total amount </em>of liquidated damages in application, rather than on the reasonableness of the <em>per diem </em>amount in the contract terms, was not proper. The correct analysis looks at whether it was conscionable to assess $700 <em>per day </em>in liquidated damages for each day that the contract was not completed rather than looking at the aggregate amount of the damages awarded. <em>Accord Carrothers Constr. Co., </em>288 Kan. at 759, 207 P.3d 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">{\u00b6 32} Although per diem amounts vary greatly in the case law, courts have upheld liquidated-damages provisions in public-construction contracts with per diem amounts similar to those at issue here. <em>See, e.g., Sec. Fence Group, Inc. v. Cincinnati, </em>1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-020827, 2003-Ohio-5263, 2003 WL 22270179 (enforcing a per diem liquidated-damages provision in a public-bridge-replacement project that imposed $600 per day); <em>see also Carter Steel &amp; Fabricating Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number><em>v. Ohio Dept. of Transp., </em>102 Ohio Misc.2d 1, 721 N.E.2d 1115 (Ct. of C1.1999) (impliedly recognizing the validity of a liquidated-damages per diem provision in bridge-construction project that imposed $600 in liquidated damages per day, but refusing to enforce it against subcontractor who had no control over delay); <em>Hovas Constr., </em>111 So.3d at 667 (upholding as reasonable a $500 per diem assessment of liquidated damages in public-construction contract); <em>Carrothers Constr. Co. </em>at 759 ($850 per diem assessment of liquidated damages held reasonable in public-construction contract). In fact, courts have upheld far greater amounts of per diem damages in construction contracts. <em>See, e.g., Dade Cty. Pub. Health Trust, </em>577 So.2d at 638 (upholding as \u201cperfectly reasonable\u201d a liquidated-damages provision imposing $2,500 in damages per day in public-construction project for medical facility); <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Chicago, </em>350 F.2d 649 (7th Cir.1965) (upholding a liquidated-damages provision imposing $1,000 in damages per day in public-construction project for elevated highway, even though contractor\u2019s delay did not prevent highway from opening to public on date scheduled). <em>See also </em>Unruh &amp; Worden, 34 Santa Clara L.Rev. 1, at fn. 1 (in commercial construction contracts, \u201ca typical <em>per diem </em>liquidated damages provision might provide that the general contractor pay the owner/developer $10,000 for each calendar day\u201d of delay).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">{\u00b6 33} Moreover, the per diem liquidated damages imposed by the contract between Piketon and Boone Coleman reflect the Ohio Department of Transportation\u2019s 2013 Construction and Material Specifications. Those specifications not only require liquidated damages to be deducted from any sum owed the contractor for each day by which the contractor exceeds the completion date, but set out the specific amount of the per diem damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The per diem damages are thus consistent with Ohio public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>{\u00b6 34} Finally and most importantly, we note that the appellate court stated that its conclusion resulted from viewing \u201cthe contract as a whole <em>in its application.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 2014-Ohio-2377, 13 N.E.3d 1190, \u00b6 3. The use of the phrase \u201cin its application\u201d is not part of our test from <em>Samson Sales. </em>The appellate court\u2019s use of this invented perspective resulted in a distorted analysis of our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">{\u00b6 35} We reaffirm that Ohio law requires a court, when considering a liquidated-damages provision, to \u201cexamine it in light of what the parties knew at the time the contract was formed.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>112 Ohio St. 43, 146 N.E. 894, at paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Miller v. Blockberger, </em>111 Ohio St. 798, 146 N.E. 206 (1924), paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Sec.

Co., </em>288 Kan. 743, 207 P.3d 231, at paragraph nine of the syllabus. The prospective approach properly focuses on whether (1) the parties evaluated, at the time of contract formation, the probable loss resulting from delay in completing the construction, (2) the parties clearly intended to use liquidated damages in case of a delay because actual damages would be difficult to ascertain, and (3) the parties reached an agreement as to a per diem amount for delays. <em>Carrothers Constr. Co. </em>at 757. <em>See also Hutton Contracting Co., Inc. v. Coffeyville, </em>487 F.3d 772, 781 (10th Cir.2007), quoting <em>Kelly v.

McNamara, <em>Calculating Construction Damages, </em>Section 13.02, at 257-258 (2d Ed.2015) (\u201cThe reasonableness of the forecast or estimate [in a liquidated-damages provision] is usually determined in view of the facts known <em>at the time of contracting, </em>and not at the time of the breach or delayed completion\u201d [emphasis sic]).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>{\u00b6 37} Here, the appellate court improperly engaged in retrospective analysis, i.e., it looked, with hindsight, to the aggregate application of the per diem liquidated damages to conclude that the provision was unconscionable. But it did not determine that the per diem amount was unconscionable at the time the parties entered into the contract. The question whether the liquidated-damages provision is conscionable \u201cmust be viewed by the court from the standpoint of the parties at the time of the contract, and not <em>ex post facto </em>when the litigation is up for trial. Contracts are always so construed and a stipulation for liquidated damages is no exception.\u201d <em>Jacobs v. Shannon Furniture Co., </em>22 Ohio C.D. 51, 53, 1910 WL 1170 (1910), citing <em>Sun Printing &amp; Pub. Assn. v. Moore, </em>183 U.S. 642, 672, 22 S.Ct. 240, 46 L.Ed. 366 (1902), and <em>Knox Rocky-Blasting Co. v. Grafton Stone Co., </em>64 Ohio St. 361, 366, 60 N.E. 563 (1901). Moreover, when the appellate court determined that the award was an unenforceable penalty because the amount was \u201cso unreasonably high and so disproportionate to the consideration paid,\u201d 2014-Ohio-2377, 13 N.E.3d 1190, \u00b6 40, the court failed to fully consider that the amount was large only because Boone Coleman failed to complete the project for more than a year after the agreed-upon completion date, with full awareness of the consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">{\u00b6 38} By the appellate court\u2019s reasoning, the same provision might have been enforceable if Boone Coleman\u2019s delay had been briefer, e.g., two days, two weeks, or even two months, but not so long as to accrue the significant damages that arose here. It is a perverse rule of law to hold that a court can relieve a breaching party of the consequences it agreed to by refusing to enforce a per diem liquidated-damages provision solely because the breach was an egregious one. We decline to adopt that rationale, and we vacate the judgment of the appellate court in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">{\u00b6 39} We remind our appellate courts that in engaging in prospective analysis, the appellate court\u2019s role is not to determine what the parties should have contracted for based on the court\u2019s understanding of the damages after the breach. <em>Lake Ridge Academy, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 382, 613 N.E.2d 183. This court has made clear for over 150 years that judges have no more power to disregard a valid liquidated-damages provision than they do to disregard any other contractual provision. <em>Lange, </em>2 Ohio St. at 533; <em>see also Knox Rock-Blasting Co. </em>at 367-368. The proper course is to enforce contracts according to their plain meaning and \u201cnot to undertake to be wiser than the parties.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>112 Ohio St. at 56, 146 N.E. 894. \u201cIt is certainly not incumbent on the appellate courts * * * to change the contracts of people, after the fact, in the name of public policy.\u201d <em>Court Rooms of Am., Inc. v.

Boone Coleman would have done well to follow that advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">{\u00b6 41} Boone Coleman entered a contract that required it to perform the project within 120 days. It took four times that long to do so. It may not avoid the result of the valid liquidated-damages provision it negotiated through able counsel. \u201cThere is no sound reason why persons competent and free to contract may not agree upon this subject [of liquidated damages] as fully as upon any other, or why their agreement, when fairly and understandingly entered into with a view to just compensation for the anticipated loss, should not be enforced.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>249 U.S. at 365, 39 S.Ct. 303, 63 L.Ed. 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">{\u00b6 42} The appellate court erred in its use of a retrospective analysis to find that the total amount of damages awarded to Piketon was so unreasonable as to constitute a penalty, and in failing to focus on the per diem nature of the liquidated damages. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Fourth District Court of Appeals and remand the cause to that court to reconsider the enforceability of the liquidated-damages provision in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Judgment vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b718-10\">O\u2019Donnell, Kennedy, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Apan\">Lanzinger and French, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AE6D\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\">.

The parties also recognize the delays, expense, and difficulties involved in proving in a legal or arbitration [proceeding] the actual loss suffered by OWNER if the Work is not completed on time.

In its complaint, Boone Coleman asserted that the liquidated-damages provision was a penalty and also argued that it should have been awarded additional compensation based on work it performed to correct subsurface road problems and to perform revisions on the retaining wall and traffic signal. The trial court denied that relief and the appellate court affirmed, holding that \u201cBoone Coleman did not follow the parties\u2019 unambiguous notice provisions to claim additional compensation. And the contract explicitly precluded recovery for additional costs related to subsurface conditions encountered by Boone Coleman.\u201d 2014-Ohio-2377,13 N.E.3d 1190, \u00b6 4. Nevertheless, the dissenting opinion asserts, \u201cBoone Coleman already suffered a loss from performing additional work for which it was not paid\u201d and seemingly gives credence to Boone Coleman\u2019s claim that Piketon provided inaccurate site information.

It seems, then, that the dissent\u2019s insistence on adhering to its own conclusion, without regard to the facts of this case or the law controlling it, is where \u201cfrontier justice\u201d comes into play.

Given the circumstances of this case, which include Piketon allegedly providing inaccurate site plans to Boone Coleman, the court of appeals got it right. It disallowed Boone Coleman\u2019s requests for additional payment because they were not properly submitted and refused to enforce the liquidated-damages clause because it was so unreasonable and disproportionate as to amount to a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">{\u00b6 48} Because the court is neither dismissing the ease nor affirming the court of appeals, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
