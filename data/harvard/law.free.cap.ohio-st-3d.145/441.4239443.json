We answer both questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">I. Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">{\u00b6 2} As set forth in the facts supplied by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, petitioners Daren and Angela Messer executed a promissory note and mortgage on November 26, 2007, in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registrations Systems, Inc., in which the notary acknowledgment on the mortgage was left blank, providing no indication as to whether the Messers executed the mortgage in front of a notary. On December 4, 2007, the mortgage was recorded with the Franklin County Recorder with the notary section incomplete. In 2013, all interest in the mortgage was assigned to respondent JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA (\u201cJP Morgan\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">{\u00b6 3} The Messers later initiated a Chapter 13 bankruptcy and then commenced an adversary proceeding asking to avoid the mortgage as defectively executed under R.C. 5301.01. The bankruptcy court determined that its interpretation of R.C. 1301.401 would be dispositive in this case, but found no interpretation of that provision by any court. It accordingly certified to this court questions of state law concerning whether R.C. 1301.401 has an effect on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>{\u00b6 4} We agreed to answer the two questions of state law certified by the bankruptcy court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\">1. Does O.R.C \u00a7 1301.401 apply to all recorded mortgages in Ohio?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">2. Does O.R.C. \u00a7 1301.401 act to provide constructive notice to the world of a recorded mortgage that was deficiently executed under O.R.C. \u00a7 5301.01?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">141 Ohio St.3d 1452, 2015-Ohio-239, 23 N.E.3d 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">{\u00b6 5} Because resolution of this case depends upon the clear language of the relevant statutes, our analysis begins by looking at that language. R.C. 5301.01(A) sets forth the requirements for a mortgage in Ohio. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">A * * * mortgage * * * shall be signed by the * * * mortgagor * * *. The signing shall be acknowledged by the * * * mortgagor * * * before a judge or clerk of a court of record in this state, or a county auditor, county engineer, notary public, or mayor, who shall certify the acknowledgement and subscribe the official\u2019s name to the certificate of the acknowledgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 1301.401 provides that the recording of certain documents provides constructive notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-11\">(B) <em>The recording with any county recorder of any document </em>described in division (A)(1) of this section * * * <em>shall be constructive notice </em>to the whole world <em>of the existence and contents </em>of [the] document as a public record and of any transaction referred to in that public record, including, but not limited to, any transfer, conveyance, or assignment reflected in that record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-12\">(C) Any person contesting the validity or effectiveness of any transaction referred to in a public record is considered to have discovered that public record and any transaction referred to in the record as of the time that the record was first * * * tendered to a county recorder for recording.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">(Emphasis added.) R.C. 1301.401(B) refers to \u201cany document described in division (A)(1)\u201d of that statute. R.C. 1301.401(A)(1) names \u201c[a]ny document described or referred to\u201d in R.C. 317.08. Included among the documents listed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>R.C. 317.08 are \u201c[mjortgages, including amendments, supplements, modifications, and extensions of mortgages, or other instruments of writing by which lands, tenements, or hereditaments are or may be mortgaged or otherwise conditionally sold, conveyed, 'affected, or encumbered.\u201d R.C. 317.08(A)(19).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\n<em>A. R.C. 1301401 applies to all recorded mortgages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aq1\">{\u00b6 7} The Messers argue that R.C. 1301.401\u2019s placement in the portion of the Revised Code consisting of Ohio\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d) means that the statute applies only to transactions governed by the UCC and does not apply to mortgages, which they state are contracts governed by Ohio contract law. They reason that the legislature\u2019s intention that R.C. 1301.401 does not apply to mortgages is evidenced by the fact that the statute appears in the UCC, rather than in Title 53 of the Revised Code, which covers real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">{\u00b6 8} We disagree with the Messers that R.C. 1301.401 applies only to commercial transactions governed by the UCC, and not to mortgages. The statute\u2019s clear and broad language indicates that it applies to \u201cany document described in division (A)(1)\u201d of the section. R.C. 1301.401(A)(1) clearly states that any document described or referred to in R.C. 317.08 is included in the statute\u2019s purview. R.C. 317.08(A)(19), in turn, explicitly includes mortgages. Based on this unambiguous statutory language, we hold that R.C. 1301.401 applies to all recorded mortgages in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">\n<em>B. The act of recording a mortgage provides constructive notice to the world of that mortgage, even if the mortgage was deficiently executed under R.C. 5301.01</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A6N\">{\u00b6 9} The Messers argue that application of R.C. 1301.401 to recorded mortgages is inconsistent with R.C. 5301.25(A), which provides that all \u201cinstruments of writing properly executed for the conveyance or encumbrance of lands * * * shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the premises are situated\u201d and that \u201c[ujntil so recorded or filed for record, they are fraudulent insofar as they relate to a subsequent bona fide purchaser having, at the time of purchase, no knowledge of the existence of that * * * instrument.\u201d Thus, they argue, a mortgage does not provide constructive notice if it is not \u201cproperly executed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">{\u00b6 10} We do not agree. R.C. 5301.25(A) requires properly executed mortgages to be recorded and provides that until they are recorded they are deemed as fraudulent to a bona fide purchaser who has no knowledge of the existence of that mortgage. Rather than contradict this basic principle, R.C. 1301.401 simply provides that the act of recording a \u201cmortgage\u201d provides constructive notice to the whole world of the existence and contents of the mortgage document. No mention is made of whether the mortgage has been properly executed, whether it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>was required to be filed, or whether it is free from defects. If it is a \u201cmortgage,\u201d notice of the contents is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">{\u00b6 11} The Messers also argue that R.C. 5301.01(B) and 5301.23(B) support their contention that R.C. 1301.401 does not provide for constructive notice of deficiently executed mortgages that have been recorded. R.C. 5301.01(B)(1) states that the recording of a mortgage executed prior to February 1, 2002, and not acknowledged in the presence of, or not attested by, two witnesses constitutes constructive notice of the mortgage. R.C. 5301.23(B) provides that the omission of the current mailing address of the mortgagee does not affect the validity of the mortgage or render it ineffective for purposes of constructive notice. The Messers reason that the existence of these statutes shows that if the General Assembly wished to create constructive notice for deficiently executed mortgages, it would have done so in R.C. Chapter 5301. They further argue that these statutes preclude any other types of deficient mortgages from providing constructive notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">{\u00b6 12} We disagree. These statutes set forth two instances in which the recording of a deficiently executed mortgage will provide constructive notice: (1) pre-February 1, 2002 mortgages that were not acknowledged in the presence of, or not attested by, two witnesses and (2) mortgages that omit the current mailing address of the mortgagee. The existence of these two statutes does not preclude the General Assembly from recognizing other instances in which the recording of a deficiently executed mortgage can provide constructive notice. Neither R.C. 5301.01(B) nor 5301.23(B) contains language preventing constructive notice for other types of deficiently executed mortgages. The portion of R.C. 1301.401 stating that the act of recording provides constructive notice to the whole world of the existence and contents of the mortgage document is completely compatible with R.C. 5301.01(B), R.C. 5301.23(B), and the rest of the Revised Code. Furthermore, as noted above, the fact that R.C. 1301.401 is not located in R.C. Chapter 5301 does not preclude it from applying to mortgages. For these reasons, we hold that R.C. 1301.401 acts to provide constructive notice to the world of a recorded mortgage that was deficiently executed under R.C. 5301.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">{\u00b6 13} We hold that R.C. 1301.401 applies to all recorded mortgages in Ohio. We further hold that that statute acts to provide constructive notice to the world of the existence and contents of a recorded mortgage that was deficiently executed under R.C. 5301.01. We accordingly answer each question of state law certified by the bankruptcy court in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">So answered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b701-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., \u2022 concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"ARXG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Fisher, Skrobot &amp; Sheraw, L.L.C., Brett R.
