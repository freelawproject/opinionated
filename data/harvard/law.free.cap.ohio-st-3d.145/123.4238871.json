South, </em>144 Ohio St.3d 295, 2015-Ohio-3930, 42 N.E.3d 734, I dissented from the majority\u2019s conclusion that a trial court has discretion to sentence an offender for an underlying third-degree-felony offense of operating a vehicle while under the influence (\u201cOVI\u201d) only to the prison terms specified in R.C. 2929.14(A)(3)(b). It was my opinion that based on the statutory language of R.C. 2929.14(B)(4), it is within a trial court\u2019s discretion to impose an additional prison term of any duration as set forth in R.C. 2929.14(A)(3)(a) <em>and </em>(b) for the underlying OVI conviction for a felony of the third degree. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 44 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Because the majority opinion in <em>South </em>is controlling law, I respectfully concur in judgment only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
