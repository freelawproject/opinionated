The Lucas County Court of Common Pleas ordered Polus to serve the sentences imposed for the two offenses consecutively. Polus appealed, and the Sixth District Court of Appeals reversed the part of the trial court\u2019s order that imposed the two sentences consecutively. At the request of the state of Ohio, we recognized a conflict, 140 Ohio St.3d 1413, 2014-Ohio-3785, 15 N.E.3d 882, and now consider the following issue: \u201cWhether a trial court may impose consecutive sentences for felony and misdemeanor convictions under R.C. 2929.41(B)(1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">{\u00b6 2} We answer the certified question in the negative, affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">{\u00b6 3} On two occasions, Polus purchased tools that he suspected were stolen and later offered them for sale. The state sought and acquired a grand-jury indictment that charged Polus in February 2013 with two fifth-degree felony counts of receiving stolen property. The state asked the trial court to amend the second count to a first-degree misdemeanor, and in return Polus agreed to plead guilty to those two charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-15\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court accepted the guilty pleas to the charges as amended, sentencing Polus to serve an 11-month term in prison for the felony and a six-month term for the misdemeanor. The court ordered Polus to serve the felony and misdemeanor sentences consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-16\">{\u00b6 5} Thereafter, in a separate case involving other charges, Polus pled guilty to \u2014 and was convicted of \u2014 two fifth-degree felony counts of receiving stolen property. The court imposed two 11-month prison terms for these convictions and ordered Polus to serve them consecutively to one another and to the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>imposed in the case stemming from the February 2013 indictment. Neither party has raised any issue with the consecutive-sentencing order in the case involving the subsequently filed charges, and we do not address that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">{\u00b6 6} Polus appealed to the Sixth District Court of Appeals. He argued that a sentencing order requiring a jail term for a misdemeanor to be served consecutively to a prison sentence for a felony is contrary to R.C. 2929.41(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consistent with prior decisions from the Sixth District, the court of appeals held that the language of R.C. 2929.41(A) and 2929.41(B)(1) creates an ambiguity that must be construed against the state under R.C. 2901.04(A). 2014-Ohio-2321, 12 N.E.3d 1237, \u00b6 15. The court therefore reversed the trial court\u2019s sentencing order insofar as the misdemeanor jail term was consecutive to the felony prison sentence and modified the sentence to run the terms of confinement concurrently. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23-24. Sua sponte, the court of appeals certified that its holding conflicted with holdings issued by the Fifth and Eighth District Courts of Appeals in <em>State v. Vanmeter, </em>5th Dist. Fairfield No. 2011-CA-0032, 2011-Ohio-6110, 2011 WL 5904662; <em>State v. Varney, </em>5th Dist. Perry No. 13 CA 00002, 2014-Ohio-193, 2014 WL 260531; and <em>State v. Barker, </em>8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99320, 2013-Ohio-4038, 2013 WL 5310168. 2014-Ohio-2321, 12 N.E.3d 1237, at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 7} The threshold issue in this matter is whether the statute is ambiguous. In the normal course, statutes mean what they say by their plain language. <em>In re T.R., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 136, 2008-Ohio-5219, 896 N.E.2d 1003, \u00b6 8. \u201cIf the language is clear and unambiguous, we must apply the statute as written.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a statute presents an ambiguity, however, the legislature has directed us in R.C. 1.49 to consider several factors to determine legislative intent. In criminal cases, we construe \u201csections of the Revised Code defining offenses or penalties * * * against the state, and liberally * * * in favor of the accused.\u201d R.C. 2901.04(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 2929.41 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">(A) Except as provided in division (B) of this section, * * * a prison term, jail term, or sentence of imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this state, another state, or the United States. <em>Except as provided in division (B)(3) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor shall be served concurrently </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for felony served in a state or federal correctional institution.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">(B)(1) A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of section 2907.322, 2921.34, or 2923.131 of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">(B)(3) A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor violation of section 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19 of the Revised Code shall be served consecutively to a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of section 2903.06, 2903.07, 2903.08, or 4511.19 of the Revised Code or a felony violation of section 2903.04 of the Revised Code involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">{\u00b6 9} The court of appeals determined that R.C. 2929.41 is ambiguous because \u201cprovision (B)(1) vests the trial court with authority to impose consecutive sentences\u201d while the above-italicized language in R.C. 2929.41(A) \u201cwould appear to prohibit consecutive sentences for a felony and misdemeanor unless provision (B)(3) applies.\u201d 2014-Ohio-2321, 12 N.E.3d 1237, at \u00b6 7. As the court noted and neither party disputes, R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) is inapplicable to this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">{\u00b6 10} We find no ambiguity in R.C. 2929.41 regarding the issue that we resolve today. The first sentence of R.C. 2929.41(A) enacts the general rule requiring concurrent sentencing with only clearly delineated exceptions, including the provisions in R.C. 2929.41(B) and other statutes not applicable to this matter. The second sentence of R.C. 2929.41(A) creates a more specific rule that speaks directly to the certified question in this matter: subject only to the exceptions stated in R.C. 2929.41(B)(3), a trial court must impose concurrent sentences for felony and misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">{\u00b6 11} Our prior authorities regarding R.C. 2929.41 do not control the outcome of this matter, but they do support our determination. The last time we considered this question, we held that \u201cR.C. 2929.41(A) requires that a sentence imposed for a misdemeanor conviction must be served concurrently with any felony sentence.\u201d <em>State v. Butts, </em>58 Ohio St.3d 250, 569 N.E.2d 885 (1991), syllabus. When we decided <em>Butts, </em>the second sentence of R.C. 2929.41(A) stated, \u201c <em>\u2018In any case, </em>a sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor <em>shall be served concurrently </em>with a sentence of imprisonment for felony served in a state or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>federal penal or reformatory institution.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Butts </em>at 251, quoting former R.C. 2929.41(A), Am.Sub.S.B. No. 258, 143 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1307, 1438. In 2000, the General Assembly replaced the phrase \u201c[i]n any case\u201d with the phrase \u201c[ejxcept as provided in division (B)(2) of this section.\u201d Am.Sub.S.B. No. 22, 148 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 8353, 8389. R.C. 2929.41(B)(2) was renumbered as R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) effective in 2004, Am.Sub.S.B. No. 123,149 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2467, 2661, and it is substantially the same today. This new language has no effect on our analysis, as it is undisputed that subsection (B)(3) does not apply in this matter as an exception to the general rule in favor of concurrent sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">{\u00b6 12} Although some lower courts have read R.C. 2929.41(B)(1) to contradict our conclusion, we do not. We must presume that the General Assembly intended every part of the statute to be effective. R.C. 1.47(B). \u201cNo part [of a statute] should be treated as superfluous unless that is manifestly required, and the court should avoid that construction which renders a provision meaningless or inoperative.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Myers v. Spencer Twp. Rural School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>95 Ohio St. 367, 373, 116 N.E. 516 (1917). Accordingly, we cannot say that a trial court may impose consecutive sentences for any set of felony and misdemeanor convictions under R.C. 2929.41(B)(1) because R.C. 2929.41(B)(3) more narrowly circumscribes the authority of the trial courts. To do so would be to write subsection (B)(3) out of the Revised Code. Instead, we hold that R.C. 2929.41(B)(1) merely \u201crequires a sentencing court to impose sentences for misdemeanor violations of R.C. 2907.322 (pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor), 2921.34 (escape), or 2923.131 (possession of deadly weapon while under detention) \u2018consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of imprisonment.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 541, 2008-Ohio-69, 880 N.E.2d 896, \u00b6 14, quoting R.C. 2929.41(B)(1). The reference in R.C. 2929.41(B)(1) to a trial court\u2019s authority to \u201cspecifly]\u201d consecutive sentences refers only to the authority delineated in R.C. 2929.41(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">{\u00b6 13} Accordingly, we answer the certified question in the negative, affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Judgment affirmed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b525-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b525-9\">O\u2019Donnell, J., dissents.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A-v\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Julia R.
