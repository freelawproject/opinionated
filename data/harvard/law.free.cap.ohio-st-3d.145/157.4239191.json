The county sought exemption for the entire property, including both the park and the marina/restaurant, but the tax commissioner invoked his authority under R.C. 5713.04 to order a split between the taxable and exempt portions: the park was declared to be exempt as \u201cpublic property used exclusively for a public purpose\u201d pursuant to R.C. 5709.08(A)(1), while the marina and restaurant were retained on the taxable-property list.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">{\u00b6 2} The tax commissioner\u2019s determination specifically found that \u201c[t]he marina and restaurant operations must be evaluated separately from the public park.\u201d The county\u2019s notice of appeal to the BTA did not contest that finding, and the BTA affirmed on the primary ground that the marina and restaurant were operated with a view to profit. On appeal, the county asserts that the marina and restaurant, \u201coperated by [the] County with a lakefront park,\u201d are exempt because they are \u201cnot operated at a profit, nor with a view toward a profit.\u201d For the reasons stated below, the county has not preserved its argument that the marina <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>and restaurant should be evaluated together with the park as a unit, and the BTA\u2019s finding \u2014 that the marina and restaurant when considered separately from the park are not exempt \u2014 is neither unreasonable nor unlawful. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"Ayc\">\n<em>Why the county acquired Whiskey Island</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AlR\">{\u00b6 3} Cuyahoga County claims exemption for property generally referred to as \u201cWhiskey Island,\u201d an approximately 65-acre<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> lakefront property consisting of two parcels that lie west of Cleveland\u2019s downtown at the western side of the mouth of the Cuyahoga River. The county acquired the property in December 2004 from Whiskey Island Partners, L.P. (\u201cPartners\u201d), a for-profit limited partnership, for $6,250,000, and the county simultaneously entered into a contractual agreement, the \u201cMarina Management Agreement\u201d (\u201cMMA\u201d), by which Partners was hired to manage the marina and restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">{\u00b6 4} Under the MMA, the county owned the whole property, supervised Partners\u2019 management of the marina and restaurant, and developed the park using proceeds from the marina and restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">{\u00b6 5} John \u201cTim\u201d McCormack, currently a judge of the Eighth District Court of Appeals, served as a county commissioner from 1996 until the beginning of 2005. The county acquired Whiskey Island in December 2004, near the end of his tenure in that position. He favored the acquisition, and he testified at the hearing before the BTA, detailing the circumstances surrounding the acquisition. As a reason for the purchase, McCormack stated that part of \u201csavfing] the city of Cleveland\u201d was to provide access to lakefront public-park property, given that the city traditionally had \u201cturned [its] back on the lake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">{\u00b6 6} When acquiring Whiskey Island toward the end of 2004, the county\u2019s intent was to preserve the green space and to prevent the Port Authority from acquiring it for use as a dumping ground. Although the park was the primary object for acquisition, given the time constraints imposed by the approaching end of McCormack\u2019s term, the county purchased the marina and restaurant as well as the park area. \u201c[W]e took the elbows and the knees and the feet as well as the pitiful face,\u201d McCormack testified, \u201cbecause it had to go as a package.\u201d At all times the long-term plan of the county, which has no parks department, was to maintain and develop Whiskey Island to the point when the property would be transferred to Cleveland Metroparks for permanent operation by the park <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>system. Citing an article from Cleveland\u2019s <em>Plain Dealer, </em>the county\u2019s merit brief states that Metroparks purchased the property in 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\n<em>Terms of the MMA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">{\u00b6 7} The MMA provides that Partners would perform a comprehensive set of duties through its own employees for a management fee. The fee is set at 7.5 percent of the gross revenue, which is broadly defined to include all amounts realized from the operations of the marina and restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 8} One of Partners\u2019 duties under the MMA is to deposit all proceeds in an \u201cagency [bank] account\u201d owned by the county, with Partners as its agent. The management fee is paid from that account, as are operational expenses relating to the marina and restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">{\u00b6 9} The MMA grants the county the option to sell the marina \u2014 but not the park \u2014 back to Partners for a stated price of $2,250,000, at any time from the second anniversary of the MMA to the tenth anniversary. In other words, if the county proved unable to sell the totality to Cleveland Metroparks as envisioned, it could retain the park and sell the marina back to Partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\n<em>Direction and control by the county</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">{\u00b6 10} One of Partners\u2019 duties as contractor is to put together an annual budget for the county\u2019s approval. All expenditures must be made pursuant to the budget, and except in emergency circumstances, any expenditures beyond the budget must be preapproved by the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">{\u00b6 11} The testimony of county officials and personnel associated with Partners generally corroborated the application of this provision in practice. That testimony indicated, as the tax commissioner emphasizes, that the county took a relatively \u201chands-off\u2019 approach and deferred to Partners\u2019 judgment given the county\u2019s lack of expertise in managing parks and marinas.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">\n<em>Expenditure of general funds by the county</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">{\u00b6 12} Soon after purchasing the property, the county spent about $2,000,000 on bridge repair for access to Whiskey Island. In addition, the county paid for certain park improvements. Later, the county spent about $23,000 toward a watering system for fire safety. For the most part, however, operational expenses at Whiskey Island were paid out of proceeds from the operations of the marina and restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">\n<em>Public accessibility mandated by the MMA and the sale contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">{\u00b6 13} The MMA requires Partners to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>keep the Property accessible and open to the general public on a non-discriminating basis during normal days and hours of operation (which shall be no fewer than the days and hours of operation of comparable marinas owned or operated by the MetroParks park system), except for safety and security reasons the docks and areas used by heavy equipment will not be publicly accessible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">This provision parallels the sale contract. Thus, the purchase and operation of the property, including the marina, contemplated accessibility to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 14} According to testimony presented at the BTA hearing, some of the dock slips were available to the public. Nancy Keene, an employee of a Partners affiliate who prepared financial statements for the marina, testified that \u201ccourtesy docks\u201d were open to the public, with many of them free for short periods. The business was seasonal, but during the summer months the courtesy docks would be full.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\n<em>Long-term leasing of dock space: persisting, but limited by contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">{\u00b6 15} When Partners began developing the marina in 1993, it entered into long-term leases for dock space \u2014 so-called \u201cdockominiums\u201d \u2014 as a financing mechanism. Terms were for as long as 99 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">{\u00b6 16} The exact percentage of facilities devoted to leased space versus space open to the general public is not attested in the record. McCormack spoke very generally of \u201cscores of leases.\u201d But significantly, the sale contract specifically acknowledges that the county as purchaser may wish to buy out existing leases and forbids Partners from entering into any new ones. Partners is also obligated to inform the county of any dockominium leases that become available for sale. The s\u00e1le contract specifically provides that Partners\u2019 obligations survive the closing and recording of the deed. (Thus, the obligation not to enter into long-term leases of dock slips presumably extended to the assumption of operations by Partners under the MMA.) Consistent with these provisions, the MMA limits Partners\u2019 leasing authority by making \u201c[a]ll lease documents containing a term of more than one boating season or 1 year * * * subject to [the county]\u2019s approval\u201d and requires them to \u201cbe executed by [the county].\u201d There is no indication that any new long-term leases were approved or entered into after acquisition by the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">\n<em>Before the tax commissioner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">{\u00b6 17} The county filed its exemption application on June 21, 2006, and the tax commissioner issued his final determination on February 22, 2011. The commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>sioner granted the application as to the 38-aere park portion but denied the application as to the remainder, which constituted the marina and restaurant. The commissioner relied on R.C. 5713.04 as authority for splitting the property into taxable and exempt portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">{\u00b6 18} Considering the status of the marina under R.C. 5709.08(A)(1), which exempts \u201cpublic property used exclusively for a public purpose,\u201d the final determination first stated that \u201c[t]he marina and restaurant operations must be evaluated separately from the public park.\u201d The determination examined the relationship between Partners and the county, finding that the county had \u201cturned over the management of its County-owned marina and restaurant to a for-profit partnership\u201d and that Partners operated as an independent contractor on its own behalf rather than the county\u2019s. The case law on which the determination relied most heavily involves property leased to for-profit entities, in particular <em>Parma Hts. v. Wilkins, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 463, 2005-Ohio-2818, 828 N.E.2d 998. The commissioner found that the for-profit character of Partners defeated the exemption claim because the marina and restaurant were operated \u201cwith a view to profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 19} The final determination also considered and denied exemption under R.C. 5709.081, which pertains to public recreational facilities. That claim has not been pursued on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\n<em>Before the BTA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 20} The county appealed to the BTA on April 21, 2011, contending that the commissioner erred by finding that the property was not used exclusively for a public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">{\u00b6 21} The BTA held a hearing on July 31, 2013, at which the county presented the testimony of five witnesses, and both sides presented numerous exhibits, including the MMA and the Whiskey Island sale contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">{\u00b6 22} On April 25, 2014, the BTA issued its decision, which affirmed the tax commissioner\u2019s determination. Unlike the commissioner, the BTA properly cited R.C. 5709.121 as being relevant to determining \u201cexclusive\u201d use for a public purpose.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But like the tax commissioner, the BTA relied on the case law concerning leased property, particularly <em>Parma Hts., </em>105 Ohio St.3d 463, 2005-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Ohio-2818, 828 N.E.2d 998. And like the commissioner, the BTA found that the marina and restaurant were used \u201cwith a view to profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 23} The county appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\"><em>1. The county views the manna-and restaurant in conjunction with the park </em>\u2014 but <em>we lack jurisdiction to consider that argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">{\u00b6 24} There is no dispute in this appeal about the park portion of the Whiskey Island property: the tax commissioner granted exemption to the park itself. But the tax commissioner\u2019s determination then states that \u201c[t]he marina and restaurant operations must be evaluated separately from the public park.\u201d Similarly, the BTA treated the claim of exemption for the marina and restaurant as standing independently of the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">{\u00b6 25} Before us, the county contends that the \u201cCounty-owned marina and restaurant operated by County <em>with a lakefront park </em>and not operated at a profit, nor with a view toward a profit, [are] exempt from real property taxation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) On the other side, the tax commissioner asserts that because he granted the exemption to the park portion of the property, \u201cthe Board\u2019s decision correctly reflects that the <em>only </em>property at issue in this appeal is the part of Whiskey Island <em>comprising the marina and restaurant.\u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) Between us and the consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, however, lies an insuperable obstacle: the county\u2019s notice of appeal to the BTA fails to specify the separate treatment of the two uses as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">\u25a0{\u00b6 26} Former R.C. 5717.02 required that a notice of appeal to the BTA from a determination of the tax commissioner \u201cspecify the errors therein complained of:\u201d 2011 Sub.H.B. No. 225.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is well settled that \u201cthe BTA lacks jurisdiction to grant relief from a final determination based on * * * alleged errors that were not sufficiently specified in the notice of appeal.\u201d <em>Brown v. Levin, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 335, 2008-Ohio-4081, 894 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 17; <em>see also Global Knowledge Training, L.L.C. v. Levin, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 34, 2010-Ohio-4411, 936 N.E.2d 463, \u00b6 15 (specification requirement of R.C. 5717.02 constitutes a \u201cjurisdictional prerequisite[ ] to the exercise of authority by the BTA or this court on appeal\u201d). Moreover, under analogous circumstances, we have held that a specific finding must be challenged explicitly in the notice of appeal in order to vest jurisdiction in the BTA and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ultimately, in this court. <em>Ellwood Engineered Castings Co. v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 424, 2003-Ohio-1812, 786 N.E.2d 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">{\u00b6 27} In this case, the parties have not asserted or briefed the issue of our jurisdiction to consider the status of the marina and restaurant in conjunction with that of the park rather than separately, as the tribunals below did. That does not, however, deter us from raising the jurisdiction issue on our own motion. <em>See Crown Communication, Inc. v. Testa, </em>136 Ohio St.3d 209, 2013-Ohio-3126, 992 N.E.2d 1135, \u00b6 27 (this court \u201cexereise[s] plenary authority to consider issues that concern the jurisdiction of the tax tribunals\u201d). And we have held that the failure to specify error before the BTA means not only that the BTA lacked jurisdiction but also that on appeal we derive no authority to consider the omitted issue. <em>See Osborne Bros. Welding Supply, Inc. v. Limbach, </em>40 Ohio St.3d 175, 178, 532 N.E.2d 739 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 28} We hold that we lack jurisdiction to consider a challenge to the tax commissioner\u2019s finding that the marina and restaurant must be evaluated separately from the public park. It follows that the exemption claim may only be considered at this juncture viewing the operation of the marina and restaurant separate and apart from the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\n<em>2. When the marina and restaurant are considered in isolation from the park, the denial of exemption was neither unreasonable nor unlawful</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">{\u00b6 29} We review the decisions of the BTA to determine whether they are reasonable and lawful. R.C. 5717.04. We have noted that \u201c[t]he standard for conducting that review ranges from abuse of discretion, which applies when we are asked to reverse the BTA\u2019s determination regarding credibility of witnesses, to de novo review of legal issues.\u201d <em>Grace Cathedral, Inc. v. Testa, </em>143 Ohio St.3d 212, 2015-Ohio-2067, 36 N.E.3d 136, \u00b6 16. Like other exemption cases, the situation here calls for the proper construction and application of the statutes, which is a question of law, commingled with the issue whether the marina and restaurant were operated \u201cwith a view to profit,\u201d which involves an element of fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">{\u00b6 30} The county\u2019s appeal confronted the BTA with the issue whether the marina and restaurant, viewed separately from the park, were \u201cused exclusively for a public purpose\u201d by the county. Although the BTA did not mention the statute, in reviewing its determination we necessarily consult R.C. 5709.121, which describes what constitutes an exclusive use. <em>See Cincinnati v. Testa, </em>143 Ohio St.3d 371, 2015-Ohio-1775, 38 N.E.3d 847, \u00b6 19. R.C. 5709.121(A)(2) informs us that public property may be considered to be used exclusively for a public purpose when it \u201cis made available under the direction or control of * * * [a] political subdivision for use in furtherance of or incidental to its * * * public purposes and not with the view to profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>{\u00b6 31} The tax commissioner has continually stressed the fact that the county originally wanted to purchase only the park but had to take the marina and restaurant as the \u201celbows and the knees and the feet as well as the pitiful face because it had to go as a package,\u201d as former commissioner McCormack colorfully expressed it. Since the county originally viewed the park as the object of its attention to the exclusion of the marina and restaurant, the commissioner reasoned that their taxable status must be looked at separately and that the marina should be judged in the light of its ongoing operation by a for-profit entity to generate revenue and even profit. The BTA essentially adopted this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">{\u00b6 32} The county forcefully contests the \u201cview to profit\u201d finding, but we hold that under all these circumstances, that finding can be regarded as primarily a determination of fact that merits our deference. After all, the county acquired and managed the marina in order to acquire and develop the park and did not originally have a separate public purpose in mind for the marina. And in fact, the marina over time served as a revenue source for developing the park, thereby raising the inference that its purpose in the eyes of the county was to generate funds for the park. When considered separately from the park as here it must be, the revenue generated was not merely covering costs; it was \u201cprofit\u201d in the sense that the surplus was used for something other than defraying the costs incurred by the marina and restaurant themselves. <em>See Toledo v. Jenkins, </em>143 Ohio St. 141, 152, 54 N.E.2d 656 (1944) (\u201cthe mere fact that revenue is received\u201d for parts of a municipal airport rented out to private parties \u201cto promote aviation by extending service at the airport to all the public using its facilities\u201d did \u201cnot change the public aspect, so long as the purpose of the utility is subserved and the objective is not primarily to obtain revenue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">{\u00b6 33} Beyond the \u201cview to profit\u201d finding, however, we find additional support for denying the exemption in the second prong of the test set forth in R.C. 5709.121(A)(2). Namely, the long-term (90-year-plus) leases of docks \u2014 referred to as the \u201cdockominiums\u201d \u2014 cannot be viewed as a use of property \u201cin furtherance of or incidental to\u201d a public purpose in the qualitative sense. Nor can those leases be seen as a purely de minimis use from a quantitative standpoint here. Long-term leasing of marina facilities, by limiting the general public\u2019s access, tends to negate the public purpose of the use. <em>See Gregory Marina, Inc. v. Detroit, </em>378 Mich. 364, 383, 144 N.W.2d 503 (1966) (\u201c \u2018The right of the public to receive and enjoy the benefit of the use determines whether the use is public or private\u2019 \u201d), quoting 37 American Jurisprudence, Municipal Corporations, Section 120, at 735 (1941); Opinion to the Governor, 76 R.I. 365, 369-370, 70 A.2d 817 (1950) (\u201cThe promotion of service to the public is considered to be the primary object of such a development [i.e., a marina],\u201d given the underlying principle that \u201cthe construction of docks and wharves * * * <em>for general public use </em>is a public purpose\u201d [emphasis altered]). Although the county took measures in acquiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the property to limit such long-term leases, their continued existence militates against exemption because it limits public access.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Asl\">Timothy McGinty, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Mark R.
