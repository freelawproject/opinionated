Because we hold that the Tier II registration requirements imposed upon him are not so extreme as to be grossly disproportionate to the crime or shocking to a reasonable person and to the community\u2019s sense of justice, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In 2011, Blankenship began communicating with M.H. through a social media site called PhoneZoo.com. During an online conversation he told M.H. that he was 21, and she informed him that she was 15. After meeting in person, they began a sexual relationship and had intercourse on two different dates. M.H. reported that it was consensual each time.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">{\u00b6 3} A bill of information charged Blankenship with one count of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor who was over 13 but less than 16 years of age, a violation of R.C. 2907.04, a fourth-degree felony. Blankenship pled guilty and was evaluated by a psychologist as part of the presentence investigation ordered by the court. The psychologist characterized Blankenship as showing none of the characteristics of what he considers a sex offender despite his commission of a sex offense and concluded that Blankenship\u2019s risk of reoffending was low. Yet while the presentence investigation was pending, Blankenship contacted the victim and lied to the psychologist about it. As a result, the court postponed sentencing and ordered a reevaluation. After the new evaluation, the psychologist\u2019s opinion and recommendations remained the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court then sentenced Blankenship to five years of community control with conditions, including a six-month jail sentence, which was suspended after Blankenship served 12 days. Blankenship was also designated a Tier II sex offender/child-victim offender, R.C. 2950.01(F)(1)(b), and pursuant to R.C. 2950.04(A)(2) was required to register in person with the sheriff of the county where he establishes residency within three days of coming into that county, as well as with the sheriff of the county in which he attends school or in which he is employed immediately upon coming into that county. He is also required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>verify his residence address, place of employment, and place of education in person every 180 days for 25 years. R.C. 2950.06(B)(2) and 2950.07(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">{\u00b6 5} On appeal, Blankenship argued that these Tier II sex-offender requirements imposed upon him violated the prohibition of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution against cruel and unusual punishment. Blankenship stressed the psychologist\u2019s opinion to support the contention that he was not a sex offender. He argued that his relationship with M.H. was \u201ccaring\u201d and that the circumstances showed no aggravating facts. He contended that a 25-year registration period would serve no legitimate penological purpose in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">{\u00b6 6} The Second District, in a two-to-one decision, affirmed the judgment of the trial court and concluded that Blankenship\u2019s sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">{\u00b6 7} Blankenship appealed to this court, and we accepted jurisdiction on his sole proposition of law: \u201cMandatory sex offender classifications under Senate Bill 10 constitute cruel and unusual punishment where the classification is grossly disproportionate to the nature of the offense and character of the offender.\u201d 139 Ohio St.3d 1404, 2014-Ohio-2245, 9 N.E.3d 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">{\u00b6 8} Although the proposition of law refers only to the mandatory sex-offender classification, Blankenship\u2019s brief also contains numerous references to the registration requirements. Indeed, it would be difficult to discuss the impact of being classified as a sex offender without referring to those mandatory requirements. We therefore will address both classification and registration in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">{\u00b6 9} We have already set forth the history of Ohio\u2019s sex-offender-registration legislation in <em>State v. Bodyke, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 266, 2010-Ohio-2424, 933 N.E.2d 753, \u00b6 3-28. While classification and registration schemes vary across states, most states addressing Eighth Amendment challenges to mandatory sex-offender classification for adults have dismissed those challenges based on their findings that the registration schemes are remedial rather than punitive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>have held that the enhanced sex-offender reporting and notification requirements contained in R.C. Chapter 2950 enacted by Am.Sub.S.B. No. 10 (\u201cS.B. 10\u201d) are punitive in nature: \u201cFollowing the enactment of S.B. 10, all doubt has been removed: R.C. Chapter 2950 is punitive.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 344, 2011-Ohio-3374, 952 N.E.2d 1108, \u00b6 16. In addition, we also have held unconstitutional the prospective, automatic application of those reporting and notification requirements to certain juvenile offenders. <em>In re C.P., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 513, 2012-Ohio-1446, 967 N.E.2d 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 10} Blankenship, although not a juvenile, claims that his classification and requirement to register as a sex offender violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. He relies heavily on his psychologist\u2019s opinion that he is not a sex offender. But this reliance is misplaced because the state statutory scheme provides for automatic consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 11} Ohio\u2019s current sex-offender-registration statutes create a three-tier classification system. Unlike the earlier \u201clabeling\u201d classification system under Megan\u2019s Law, 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2560, in which a judge could consider the characteristics of an offender before sentencing, \u201ctier\u201d classification is based solely upon the offense for which a person is convicted and the judge has no discretion to modify the classification. <em>Williams, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 344, 2011-Ohio-3374, 952 N.E.2d 1108, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 12} Blankenship pled guilty to a violation of R.C. 2907.04, unlawful sexual conduct with a minor. Generally, a violation of R.C. 2907.04 is a fourth-degree felony; the statute prohibits sexual conduct between a person 18 or older and someone 13, 14, or 15 years old. R.C. 2907.04(A) and (B)(1). The offense is a third-degree felony if the age span is ten or more years, R.C. 2907.04(B)(3), and becomes a second-degree felony if the offender has certain prior offenses, R.C. 2907.04(B)(4). The offense is reduced to a misdemeanor of the first degree if the age span is less than four years. R.C. 2907.04(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">{\u00b6 13} <em>For </em>purposes of R.C. Chapter 2950, certain violations of R.C. 2907.04 qualify as \u201csexually oriented offenses.\u201d R.C. 2950.01(A)(2) and (3). A \u201csex offender\u201d is a person who is convicted of \u201cany sexually oriented offense.\u201d R.C. 2950.01(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">{\u00b6 14} A person convicted of violating R.C. 2907.04 is a Tier I sex offender if the offender was less than four years older than the victim, there was no consent, and the offender has not been convicted of or pled guilty to certain sex offenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>R.C. 2950.01(E)(1)(b). But if the offender is at least four years older than the victim, or if the offender is less than four years older but has been convicted of or pled guilty to certain sex offenses, the classification is raised to that of Tier II sex offender. R.C. 2950.01(F)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">{\u00b6 15} Blankenship was convicted of the fourth-degree-felony version of R.C. 2907.04 in this case because he was six years older than M.H., the person with whom he engaged in sexual conduct, and he did not have prior offenses. His Tier II classification requires him to register and verify his address semiannually for 25 years as specified by R.C. 2950.06(B)(2) and 2950.07(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">{\u00b6 16} Blankenship bases his claim of cruel and unusual punishment on both the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 9 of the Ohio Constitution. We will therefore examine his claim under both federal and state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">A. Federal Law</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">{\u00b6 17} The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution states, \u201cExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d \u201cThe Amendment proscribes \u2018all excessive punishments, as well as cruel and unusual punishments that may or may not be excessive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kennedy v. Louisiana, </em>554 U.S. 407, 419, 128 S.Ct. 2641, 171 L.Ed.2d 525 (2008), quoting <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 311, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002), fn. 7. It is elementary that the Eighth Amendment prohibits torture. <em>Wilkerson v. Utah, </em>99 U.S. 130, 136, 25 L.Ed. 345 (1878). But the bulk of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence concerns not whether a particular punishment constitutes torture, but whether it is disproportionate to the crime. The central precept is that \u201cpunishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] offense.\u201d <em>Weems v. United States, </em>217 U.S. 349, 367, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">{\u00b6 18} The United States Supreme Court has observed that its cases addressing proportionality fall into two categories. The first involves \u201cchallenges to the length of term-of-years sentences given all the circumstances in a particular case.\u201d <em>Graham v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 48, 59, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 176 L.Ed.2d 825 (2010). The second involves categorical restrictions that, until <em>Graham, </em>applied only in capital cases. The second approach traditionally involves \u201ccases in which the Court implements the proportionality standard by certain categorical restrictions on the death penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These restrictions include a prohibition on the death penalty for nonhomicide crimes, for defendants who committed the crime before the age of 18, and for defendants with low mental functioning. <em>See Kennedy v. Louisiana, </em>554 U.S. 407, 128 S.Ct. 2641, 171 L.Ed.2d 525 (2008) (prohibiting death as a punishment for nonhomicide crimes); <em>Roper v. Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (prohibiting the death penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>for defendants who committed crimes before turning 18); <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002) (prohibiting the death penalty for persons with low intellectual functioning).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Graham v. Florida, </em>the court applied the categorical approach, as in <em>Roper, Kennedy, </em>and <em>Atkins, </em>and concluded that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of life without parole on a juvenile who did not commit homicide. But Blankenship does not fit into this categorical restriction \u2014 he was not a juvenile when he committed his sex offense. He does not identify, either in briefing or at oral argument, any other group into which he fits where a categorical rule has been established making requirements such as Tier II registration cruel and unusual. At best, Blankenship suggests that we adopt a categorical prohibition of Tier II registration for young adult offenders who are shown to present a low risk of recidivism, who have a consensual relationship with the victim, and whose psychological profile shows none of the features typical of sex offenders. For an Eighth Amendment analysis, we must determine whether a new categorical rule is constitutionally mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">{\u00b6 20} When considering Eighth Amendment challenges and whether to adopt a categorical rule, the United States Supreme Court engages in a two-step process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">The Court first considers \u201cobjective indicia of society\u2019s standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice\u201d to determine whether there is a national consensus against the sentencing practice at issue. <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 563. Next, guided by \u201cthe standards elaborated by controlling precedents and by the Court\u2019s own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s text, history, meaning, and purpose,\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>554 U.S., at 421, the Court must determine in the exercise of its own independent judgment whether the punishment in question violates the Constitution. <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 564.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-8\"><em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 61, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 176 L.Ed.2d 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">{\u00b6 21} In analyzing Blankenship\u2019s challenge to the registration requirements imposed on him, we must bear in mind the overriding principle that \u201c[t]he concept of proportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59. Thus, the goal of the two-step process described above is to determine whether Blankenship\u2019s punishment is proportionate to his crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">{\u00b6 22} Because Blankenship concedes the lack of a national consensus against lengthy sex-offender registration for individuals like himself, we need not discuss the first step. With regard to the second step, a review undertaken in our own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>independent judgment, there are three considerations: (1) the culpability of the offender in light of his crime and characteristics, (2) the severity of the punishment in question, and (3) the penological justification. <em>Graham </em>at 67. We now consider these three areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\n<em>Culpability of the Offender</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">{\u00b6 23} The first consideration in the independent review is assessing the culpability of the offender. As a matter of law, Blankenship\u2019s conviction for a sexually oriented offense makes him a sex offender. R.C. 2950.01(B)(1). Blankenship urges us to consider the analysis in <em>In re C.P. </em>regarding juveniles as equally applicable to young adult offenders like himself who do not have a criminal history and who pose no real threat to the community. But in <em>C.P., </em>we emphasized that Ohio\u2019s system for juveniles assumes that \u201cchildren are not as culpable for their acts as adults.\u201d 131 Ohio St.3d 513, 2012-Ohio-1446, 967 N.E.2d 729, \u00b6 39. We are not persuaded that this longstanding distinction between the culpability of juveniles and adults, even young adults, should be set aside in this case. Blankenship is an adult and thus <em>In re C.P. </em>does not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">{\u00b6 24} Blankenship was himself 21 when the relationship began, and he knew that M.H. was only 15; she told him so over the Internet. Despite his awareness of her age, he had intercourse with her twice. He also contacted her while his case was pending in direct violation of the court\u2019s presentence order. These facts show Blankenship\u2019s culpability in engaging in sexual conduct when the offender \u201cknows the other person is thirteen years of age or older but less than sixteen years of age.\u201d R.C. 2907.04(A). It is true that if M.H. had been only one year older, she would have been at the age of consent and there would have been no crime. But the legislature has chosen to draw the line at a difference of four years between the offender and the victim. Blankenship was six years older than M.H. and is therefore deemed more culpable and more deserving of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\n<em>Severity of the Punishment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">{\u00b6 25} The second consideration is the severity of the punishment. Blankenship, an adult, had a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old, fully aware of her age. He could have received 18 months in prison as a maximum sentence. R.C. 2929.14(A)(4) (fourth-degree felony). Instead, he was placed on community control and served 12 days of a six-month sentence. If M.H. had been three years younger, Blankenship would have faced an indefinite prison term of a minimum of ten years to a maximum term of life. R.C. 2907.02(B); 2971.03(B)(1)(a). These legislative gradations according to the victim\u2019s age reflect society\u2019s judgment that the culpability of the offender increases as the age of the victim decreases. There is no support in the law for Blankenship\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>contention that the maturity level of a \u201cyoung adult\u201d of 21 is similar to that of a juvenile and that his culpability should be reduced accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">{\u00b6 26} In addition, we cannot say that the state has no interest in protecting minors who may otherwise \u201cconsent\u201d to sexual activity. Consent plays no role and is not a viable defense in determining whether a person has violated R.C. 2907.04. A child under 16 is simply not legally capable of consent to sexual conduct with an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">{\u00b6 27} Tier II registration requirements associated with a conviction for unlawful sexual conduct with a minor are not so severe as to amount to cruel and unusual punishment under the federal Constitution. Blankenship\u2019s obligation to register in person in any county where he establishes residency, goes to school, or takes a job and to verify his residence address, place of employment, and place of education in person every 180 days for 25 years is burdensome but does not reach that constitutional level. Our research reveals no case in which similar registration and verification requirements have been held to be cruel and unusual punishment. Blankenship has not persuaded us to extend the law in the manner he suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\n<em>Penological Justifications</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">{\u00b6 28} The final consideration in an Eighth Amendment analysis is to assess the penological justifications for the sentencing practice. <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 67, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 176 L.Ed.2d 825. The stated purpose of S.B. 10 and its registration and community-notification requirements is \u201cto protect the safety and general welfare of the people of this state.\u201d R.C. 2950.02(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">{\u00b6 29} We acknowledge that sex-offender registration schemes have been criticized on the ground that they do not actually serve the intended purpose of community protection. <em>See, e.g., </em>McLeod, <em>Regulating Sexual Harm: Strangers, Intimates, and Social Institutional Reform, </em>102 Calif.L.Rev. 1553, 1573-1580 (2014); Rodriguez, <em>The Sex Offender Under the Bridge: Has Megan\u2019s Law Run Amok?, </em>62 Rutgers L.Rev. 1023, 1052-1056 (2010); Yung, <em>The Emerging Criminal War on Sex Offenders, </em>45 Harv.C.R.-C.L.L.Rev. 435, 453-459 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">{\u00b6 30} Yet we also note that while registration provisions such as the one at issue have been criticized by some as unjustified, the penological grounds for imposing such requirements are still accepted in many quarters and are justified in part based upon the perceived high rate of recidivism and resistance to treatment among sex offenders. Proponents consider registration to be a more economical method of monitoring and preventing recidivism than the costly alternative of imprisonment. Wilkes, <em>Sex Offender Registration and Community Notification Laws: Will These Laws Survive?, </em>37 U.Rich.L.Rev. 1245, 1251-1252 (2003). We cannot say that the requirements of semiannual address registration and verification are so unjustified as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>B. Ohio Law</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">{\u00b6 31} The Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 9, contains its own prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. While it contains the same language as the United States Constitution (\u201c[e]xcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed; nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted\u201d), it provides unique protection for Ohioans:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">The Ohio Constitution is a document of independent force. In the areas of individual rights and civil liberties, the United States Constitution, where applicable to the states, provides a floor below which state court decisions may not fall. As long as state courts provide at least as much protection as the United States Supreme Court has provided in its interpretation of the federal Bill of Rights, state courts are unrestricted in according greater civil liberties and protections to individuals and groups.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\"><em>Arnold v. Cleveland, </em>67 Ohio St.3d 35, 616 N.E.2d 163 (1993), paragraph one of the syllabus. Thus, Article I, Section 9. of the Ohio Constitution provides protection independent of the protection provided by the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">{\u00b6 32} We have recognized that cases involving cruel and unusual punishments are rare, \u201climited to those involving sanctions which under the circumstances would be considered shocking to any reasonable person.\u201d <em>McDougle v. Maxwell, </em>1 Ohio St.2d 68, 70, 203 N.E.2d 334 (1964). As with the Eighth Amendment, lack of proportionality is a key factor: \u201cA punishment does not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments, if it be not so greatly disproportionate to the offense as to shock the sense of justice of the community.\u201d <em>State v. Chaffin, </em>30 Ohio St.2d 13, 282 N.E.2d 46 (1972), paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">{\u00b6 33} Our review is focused on the portion of Blankenship\u2019s sentence that imposes an obligation on him to comply with the registration and address-verification requirements for Tier II sex offenders. We have established that the enhanced sex-offender reporting and notification requirements enacted by S.B. 10 are punitive in nature, <em>Williams, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 344, 2011-Ohio-3374, 952 N.E.2d 1108, \u00b6 16, and violate the Eighth Amendment when applied to certain juveniles, <em>In re C.P., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 513, 2012-Ohio-1446, 967 N.E.2d 729. But we have not considered whether the punishment is cruel and unusual when applied to adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">{\u00b6 34} Blankenship cites <em>In re C.P., </em>in which we were asked to address whether lifetime registration for a new class of juvenile sex-offender registrants constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the federal and state Constitutions. We examined each separately, and in holding that R.C. 2152.86 violated the Ohio Constitution, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>S.B. 10 forces registration and notification requirements into a juvenile system where rehabilitation is paramount, confidentiality is elemental, and individualized treatment from judges is essential. The public punishments required by R.C. 2152.86 are automatic, lifelong, and contrary to the rehabilitative goals of the juvenile system. We conclude that they \u201cshock the sense of justice of the community\u201d and thus violate Ohio\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-5\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 69. While <em>In re C.P. </em>was pending, the First District Court of Appeals determined that the Tier II registration requirements associated with a conviction for unlawful sexual conduct with a minor did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment. <em>State v. Bradley, </em>1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-100833, 2011-Ohio-6266, 2011 WL 6153624. As a point of comparison, the First District relied upon <em>State v. Hairston, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 289, 2008-Ohio-2338, 888 N.E.2d 1073, a case in which we upheld a prison sentence of 134 years against a claim of cruel and unusual punishment. After examining the facts in its own case, the First District concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">We cannot say that the requirement that Bradley register as a sexual offender for 25 years and verify his information every 180 days constitutes one of those rare cases where the punishment is so extreme as to be grossly disproportionate to the crime or that it is shocking to a reasonable person and to the community\u2019s sense of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">{\u00b6 35} In similar fashion, Blankenship has not overcome the hurdle of showing that his punishment is cruel or unusual. The concerns that led us to conclude that the requirement of lifetime registration for certain juvenile offenders violated Ohio\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in <em>In re C.P. </em>are largely absent when dealing with an adult who engaged in unlawful sexual conduct with a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">{\u00b6 36} We are also mindful that \u201creviewing courts should grant substantial deference to the broad authority that legislatures possess in determining the types and limits of punishments for crimes.\u201d <em>State v. Weitbrecht, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 68, 715 N.E.2d 167 (1999). The General Assembly has seen fit to impose registration sanctions in cases involving sex offenses to protect the public. Indeed, such sanctions now are the norm. <em>People v. Temelkoski, </em>307 Mich.App. 241, 262, 859 N.W.2d 743 (2014) (\u201call 50 states and the federal government have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>enacted some form of sex offender registration and notification provisions\u201d). They cannot be said to be shocking to the sense of justice of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">{\u00b6 37} The stated legislative intent of the General Assembly in enacting S.B. 10 is to protect the public. While some may question whether the registration requirements are the best way to further public safety,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> questions concerning the wisdom of legislation are for the legislature. \u201c \u2018[WJhether the court agrees with it in that particular or not is of no consequence. * * * If the legislature has the constitutional power to enact a law, no matter whether the law be wise or otherwise it is no concern of the court.\u2019 \u201d (Ellipsis sic.) <em>Butler v.

Blankenship has not met his burden to show that Tier II sex-offender registration requirements are cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"AXY\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">{\u00b6 38} We hold that the registration and address-verification requirements for Tier II offenders under R.C. Chapter 2950 do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of either the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article I, Section 9 of the Ohio Constitution. The Tier II registration requirements do not meet the high burden of being so extreme as to be grossly disproportionate to the crime or shocking to a reasonable person. We therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b487-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and French, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b487-9\">O\u2019Donnell and Kennedy, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AY5\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Neill, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\">.

It clearly does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">{\u00b6 40} In my view, the Eighth Amendment does not apply to this case, because I believe that sex offender registration in Ohio is a civil, nonpunitive requirement. Ohio\u2019s current sex offender registration statute, 2007 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 10 (\u201cS.B. 10\u201d), does not substantially differ from prior versions of the statute upheld in <em>State v. Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d 404, 700 N.E.2d 570 (1998), <em>State v. Williams, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 513, 528, 728 N.E.2d 342 (2000), <em>State v.

Ferguson, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 7, 2008-Ohio-4824, 896 N.E.2d 110, cases recognizing that sex offender registration is not a form of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">{\u00b6 41} The General Assembly enacted S.B. 10 in compliance with the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, 42 U.S.C. 16901 et seq. To avoid losing federal funds allocated to Ohio, the legislature followed a federal mandate to designate offenders and classify them as Tier I, II, or III sex offenders based on the offense of conviction and to require them to register for the durations and frequencies specified by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">{\u00b6 42} In direct conflict with this court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>State v. Williams, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 344, 2011-Ohio-3374, 952 N.E.2d 1108, and <em>In re C.P., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 513, 2012-Ohio-1446, 967 N.E.2d 729, every federal circuit court to consider the issue has recognized that the federal sex offender registration scheme, which Ohio adopted, does not impose additional criminal punishment on sex offenders. In fact, in its most recent pronouncement, the United States Supreme Court described the federal sex offender registration law as establishing \u201c[a] civil registration requirement\u201d that \u201cis eminently reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Kebodeaux, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2496, 2503, 186 L.Ed.2d 540 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">{\u00b6 43} Until the decisions in <em>Williams </em>and <em>C.P., </em>Ohio recognized registration as a civil requirement, not punitive or criminal in nature. Instead of diametrically changing Ohio law, we should follow our precedent and established federal law and hold that classifying Blankenship as a Tier II sex offender does not punish him for an offense and therefore cannot violate the United States Constitution\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Ohio History of Sex Offender Registration</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">{\u00b6 44} A review of the prior sex offender registration statutes, 1996 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 180 (\u201cH.B. 180\u201d), 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2560, subsequently amended by 2003 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 5 (\u201cS.B. 5\u201d), 150 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 6558, and our decisions interpreting them sheds light on whether S.B. 10 imposes punishment on sex offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\n<em>Megan\u2019s Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">{\u00b6 45} In 1996, the General Assembly enacted H.B. 180, better known as \u201cMegan\u2019s Law.\u201d That act revised R.C. Chapter 2950 and established a comprehensive system of sex-offender classification and registration, which applied regardless of when the underlying sex offense had been committed. Former R.C. 2950.04(A), 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, at 2609-2610. The act also provided criminal penalties for failing to comply with its registration requirements. Former R.C. 2950.99, <em>id. </em>at 2634-2635.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">{\u00b6 46} Megan\u2019s Law divided sex offenders into three categories: sexually oriented offenders, habitual sex offenders, and sexual predators. Former R.C. 2950.09, <em>id. </em>at 2618. It provided in former R.C. 2950.06(B)(2) and 2950.07(B)(3), <em>id. </em>at 2613 and 2617, that anyone convicted of a sexually oriented offense would be subject to annual reporting requirements for a period of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">{\u00b6 47} Having convicted an offender of a sexually oriented offense, if a judge determined that the offender had a previous conviction for a sexually oriented offense, then former R.C. 2950.09(E), 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, at 2623-2624, required the court to adjudicate the offender a habitual sex offender, thereby subjecting the offender to annual reporting for 20 years pursuant to former R.C. 2950.06(B)(2) and 2950.07(B)(2), <em>id. </em>at 2613, 2617.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">{\u00b6 48} The General Assembly reserved the most stringent reporting requirements for offenders who had been adjudicated by a court to be a sexual predator. Megan\u2019s Law required sexual predators to report every 90 days for life, former R.C. 2950.06(B)(1) and 2950.07(B)(2), 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, at 2613, 2616-2617, unless the court removed that classification pursuant to former R.C. 2950.09(D), <em>id. </em>at 2621-2623.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">{\u00b6 49} Megan\u2019s Law required all sex offenders to register with the sheriff in the county in which they resided or were temporarily domiciled for more than seven days. Former R.C. 2950.04(A), <em>id. </em>at 2609. It required sex offenders to provide a current residence address, the name and address of any employer, any other information required by the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, and a photograph. Former R.C. 2950.04(C), <em>id. </em>at 2610. Additionally, the law required sexual predators to provide the license plate number of each motor vehicle owned by the offender or registered in the offender\u2019s name. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">\n<em>Challenges to Megan\u2019s Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">{\u00b6 50} We considered several challenges to the constitutionality of Megan\u2019s Law, and each time, our analysis focused on whether the requirements the law enacted were punitive or civil in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">{\u00b6 51} In <em>State v. Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d 404, 700 N.E.2d 570, we considered the constitutionality of Megan\u2019s Law as applied to offenders who committed sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>oriented offenses before the effective date of the statute. We held that the law did not violate Article II, Section 28 of the Ohio Constitution, the Retroactivity Clause, because the registration requirements provided in the act were necessary to achieve the legislature\u2019s remedial purpose of protecting the public from sexual offenders. <em>Id. </em>at 412-413. Although we recognized that Megan\u2019s Law increased the frequency and duration of reporting beyond that required by prior law, <em>id. </em>at 411, we determined that these provisions only \u201cus[ed] past events to establish current status\u201d and constituted <em>\u201cde minimis </em>procedural requirements\u201d necessary to achieve the purpose of the act, <em>id. </em>at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">{\u00b6 52} Additionally, in <em>Cook, </em>we rejected an ex post facto challenge to Megan\u2019s Law, explaining that the statute did not contain any language expressing an intent to punish sex offenders for prior conduct, <em>id. </em>at 417, nor could it be considered to be punitive in practical effect, <em>id. </em>at 423. Rather, the statutory scheme furthered the stated legislative purpose of protecting the public from sexual offenders. <em>Id. </em>While weighing the seven nonexhaustive guideposts set forth in <em>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for deciding whether a statute is punitive for purposes of federal law, we determined that the act did not impose a new affirmative disability or further the traditional aims of punishment, but imposed an inconvenience comparable to the renewal of a driver\u2019s license. <em>Cook </em>at 418, 420. Because we concluded that the registration requirements were not punitive, but remedial, in nature, we held that the retrospective application of Megan\u2019s Law did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 53} Again, in <em>State v. Williams, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 528, 728 N.E.2d 342, relying on <em>Cook, </em>we held that because Megan\u2019s Law did not impose punishment, it necessarily did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Constitutions of the United States and the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>{\u00b6 54} And in <em>State v. Hayden, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 211, 2002-Ohio-4169, 773 N.E.2d 502, we considered whether Megan\u2019s Law violated an offender\u2019s right to procedural due process by imposing a sex offender classification and registration requirement without a judicial hearing. Adhering to our holdings in <em>Cook </em>and <em>Williams, </em>we determined that an offender suffers neither bodily restraint nor other punishment as a result of the de minimis registration requirements imposed by Megan\u2019s Law, and therefore due process did not require a court to conduct a hearing before finding a defendant to be a sexually oriented offender. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 14-15, 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\n<em>S.B. 5</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">{\u00b6 55} In 2003, the General Assembly enacted S.B. 5, amending Megan\u2019s Law to provide, inter alia, that regardless of when a sexually oriented offense occurred, sex offenders had to personally register with the sheriff of the county in which they (a) resided or were temporarily domiciled for more than five days, (b) attended school, and/or (c) worked for more than 14 days or for an aggregate of 30 days or more in a calendar year. Former R.C. 2950.04(A)(1), 150 Ohio Laws, Part IV, at 6657-6658. The act imposed a duty upon sex offenders to report not only their home address but also the address of their school and place of employment. Former R.C. 2950.06(A), <em>id. </em>at 6673. Adult offenders classified as sexual predators could no longer petition to remove the designation. Former R.C. 2950.07(B)(3) and 2950.09(D)(1), <em>id. </em>at 6683, 6696. Additionally, the act provided that any information provided by sex offenders to the county sheriff was available for public inspection, and it directed the attorney general to establish an Internet database providing this information to the public. Former R.C. 2950.081, 2950.13(A)(11), <em>id. </em>at 6686, 6728-6729.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\n<em>Challenges to S.B. 5</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 56} In <em>State v. Wilson, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, we considered whether Megan\u2019s Law remained a civil, regulatory scheme following its amendment by S.B. 5. The issue in <em>Wilson </em>concerned whether an appellate court should apply a civil or criminal standard of review to a trial court decision not to classify an offender as a sexual predator. Following <em>Cook </em>and <em>Williams, </em>we held that sex-offender-classification proceedings were civil in nature, not criminal. <em>Wilson, </em>at \u00b6 32. We concluded that courts reviewing the outcome of sexual-predator-classification hearings should apply the civil manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard and affirm a trial court judgment if it was supported by some competent, credible evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>{\u00b6 57} In <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 7, 2008-Ohio-4824, 896 N.E.2d 110, we addressed retroactivity and ex post facto challenges to R.C. Chapter 2950, as amended by S.B. 5. Although we recognized that the law \u201cmay pose significant and often harsh consequences for offenders,\u201d we explained that the amendments enacted by S.B. 5 had not \u201ctransmogrified the remedial statute into a punitive one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 32. Further, we acknowledged the General Assembly\u2019s \u201cclear reaffirmation of an intent to protect the public from sex offenders\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe more burdensome registration requirements * * * were not born of a desire to punish.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 35-36. Recognizing that \u201c \u2018consequences as drastic as deportation, deprivation of one\u2019s livelihood, and termination of financial support have not been considered sufficient to transform an avowedly regulatory measure into a punitive one,\u2019 \u201d we determined that the additional burdens imposed by S.B. 5 did not amount to punishment. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 39, quoting <em>Doe v. Pataki, </em>120 F.3d 1263, 1279 (2d Cir.1997). Accordingly, we held that the amendments enacted by S.B. 5 did not violate the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 40. Furthermore, based on our conclusion that R.C. Chapter 2950 established a civil, remedial regulatory scheme, we rejected Ferguson\u2019s related ex post facto challenge. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The Adam Walsh Act and SORNA</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 58} On July 27, 2006, Congress enacted the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (\u201cAdam Walsh Act\u201d) with the expressed intent \u201c[t]o protect children from sexual exploitation and violent crime, to prevent child abuse and child pornography, to promote Internet safety, and to honor the memory of Adam Walsh and other child crime victims.\u201d Title of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, Pub.L.

SORNA also requires sex offenders to update their registration within three business days of changing a residence, employment, or student status, and to provide personal information such as home, work, and school addresses, descriptions of vehicles, a current photograph, and a set of finger and palm prints and a DNA sample. 42 U.S.C. 16913; 42 U.S.C. 16914.

Lawrance, </em>548 F.3d 1329, 1333-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>1334 (10th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. W.B.H., </em>664 F.3d 848, 859-860 (11th Cir.2011); <em>see also Anderson v. Holder, </em>647 F.3d 1165, 1169 (D.C.Cir.2011) (concluding that the District of Columbia\u2019s Sex Offender Registration Act is civil and nonpunitive).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">S.B. 10</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">{\u00b6 63} This understanding that SORNA imposes only a civil registration requirement is an essential part of the analysis here, because the Ohio General Assembly enacted S.B. 10 in support of Congress\u2019s effort to adopt a national, uniform system of sex offender registration and notification and in response to the federal mandate to comply with SORNA or risk losing federal funds allocated to Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">{\u00b6 64} The General Assembly established a civil, remedial system designed to \u201cprotect the safety and general welfare of the people of this state\u201d and to \u201cassur[e] public protection,\u201d R.C. 2950.02(B), in light of its determination that \u201c[s]ex offenders and child-victim offenders pose a risk of engaging in further sexually abusive behavior even after being released from * * * confinement,\u201d R.C. 2950.02(A)(2). From the General Assembly\u2019s decision to adopt the Congressional SORNA, which by definition is civil in nature, and its legislative finding that sex-offender-registration laws are necessary to protect the public because sex offenders pose a present danger \u2014 not because additional punishment should be inflicted on them \u2014 we can infer its intent to establish sex offender registration as a civil, remedial system.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">{\u00b6 65} In accordance with SORNA, S.B. 10 replaced Ohio\u2019s prior sex offender classification scheme with a three-tiered system classifying offenders based on the offense of conviction: an adult Tier I offender is required to register every year for 15 years; an adult Tier II offender is required to register every 180 days for 25 years; and a Tier III offender is required to register every 90 days for life. R.C. 2950.01(E) through (G), 2950.06(B), and 2950.07(B). S.B. 10 also requires offenders to personally register with the sheriff of the county or counties in which they reside, attend school, and work, R.C. 2950.04(A)(2) and 2950.041(A)(2), and the offender must give at least 20 days\u2019 advance notice of a change of residence or school address and provide notice of a change of employment address, vehicle information, e-mail address, Internet identifier, or telephone number within three days of the change, R.C. 2950.05(A) and (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">{\u00b6 66} The S.B. 10 provisions do not significantly depart from the civil, remedial registration requirements we have previously upheld, and they are equivalent to the regulations adopted by Congress and held by federal circuit courts to be nonpunitive in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>{\u00b6 67} In contrast to a plethora of established case authority, this court concluded in <em>State v. Williams, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 344, 2011-Ohio-3374, 952 N.E.2d 1108, that the amendments enacted by S.B. 10 rendered R.C. Chapter 2950 punitive. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 16. The court noted that sex offender registration is based solely on the offense of conviction, without regard to an offender\u2019s future dangerousness; that the offender is required to register in person in the county of residence, the county of employment, and the county of school or college attendance; and that the duration of the registration requirements had been extended. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 20. And the court stated, \u201cNo one change compels our conclusion that S.B. 10 is punitive. It is a matter of degree * * <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. And relying on the assumption that sex offender registration is now punishment, the court in <em>In re C.P., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 513, 2012-Ohio-1446, 967 N.E.2d 729, \u00b6 58, held that the Eighth Amendment forbids the automatic imposition of lifetime sex offender registration and notification requirements on juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">{\u00b6 68} But none of the changes identified by <em>Williams </em>rendered sex offender registration in Ohio punitive in intent or effect. The purpose of classifying offenders into tiers based on the nature of the conviction is not to impose punishment for that conviction; rather, it is intended to facilitate a national system of sex offender registration that simplifies the process of classification based solely on the offense committed either in this state or another jurisdiction for the purpose of protecting the public from the risk of recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 69} Further, linking the duty to register to a conviction for a sex offense without first requiring an individual assessment of dangerousness or risk of recidivism does not make registration punitive. The United States Supreme Court, in analyzing whether Alaska\u2019s sex offender registration statute imposed punishment on sex offenders, indicated that \u201c[t]he State\u2019s determination to legislate with respect to convicted sex offenders as a class, rather than require individual determination of their dangerousness, does not make the statute a punishment * * *.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 104, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164. The court further noted: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>Smith </em>at 103. Thus, the court concluded, a state is permitted to make \u201creasonable categorical judgments that conviction of specified crimes should entail particular regulatory consequences.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Alaska could conclude that a conviction for a sex offense provides evidence of substantial risk of recidivism. The legislature\u2019s findings are consistent with grave concerns over the high rate of recidivism among convicted sex offenders and their dangerousness as a class. The risk of recidivism posed by sex offenders is \u201cfrightening and high.\u201d <em>McKune v. Lile, </em>536 U.S. 24, 34, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002) * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>{\u00b6 70} Nor does the duration of the registration requirements render them punishment. The Supreme Court rejected this argument in <em>Smith, </em>explaining that \u201c[t]he duration of the [Alaska] reporting requirements is not excessive. Empirical research on child molesters, for instance, has shown that, \u2018Rontrary to conventional wisdom, most reoffenses do not occur within the first several years after release,\u2019 but may occur \u2018as late as 20 years following release.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104, quoting R. Prentky, R. Knight &amp; A. Lee, <em>Child Sexual Molestation: Research Issues, </em>National Institute of Justice Research Report, 14 (1997). Thus, the duration of registration duties in Ohio corresponds to a continuing risk sex offenders pose to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">{\u00b6 71} Lastly, in-person registration is not a form of punishment. In <em>Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 418, 700 N.E.2d 570, we explained that \u201cRegistering may cause some inconvenience for offenders. However, the inconvenience is comparable to renewing a driver\u2019s license. Thus, we find that the inconvenience of registration is a <em>de minimis </em>administrative requirement.\u201d And the Supreme Court in <em>Smith </em>rejected the notion that registration is akin to probation or supervised release. <em>Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 101, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">{\u00b6 72} The reasons advanced in <em>Williams </em>for deciding that S.B. 10 is punishment do not withstand scrutiny. Sex offender registration is not punishment, and therefore we need not decide whether classifying Blankenship as a Tier II sex offender with a duty to report every 180 days for 25 years is proportionate to his offense of having consensual sex with a minor. Questions regarding whether this registration duty is necessary and appropriate in these circumstances do not involve the Eighth Amendment, but rather, these are matters of policy that are the province of the General Assembly, the arbiter of public policy in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">(\u00b6 73} There are no significant differences between Megan\u2019s Law, which this court characterized as a civil, remedial enactment designed to protect the welfare and safety of the public, and S.B. 10, which the legislature enacted to conform with the registration and notification requirements established by federal law. In accordance with our prior precedent and in agreement with the federal circuit courts, I would overrule our decisions in <em>Williams </em>and <em>C.P. </em>and hold that sex offender registration is not punishment for an offense. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment to affirm the court of appeals based on this analysis.</p>\n<judges id=\"b496-10\">Kennedy, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\">. These guideposts include</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u201c[w]hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment \u2014 retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned * *</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">(Footnotes omitted, brackets and ellipsis sic.) <em>Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 418, 700 N.E.2d 570, quoting <em>Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. at 168-169, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b497-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 74} The framework within which an issue is presented can unduly influence the outcome. For example, if you ask a stadium full of people whether requiring a Tier II sex offender to comply with certain reporting requirements shocks their sense of justice, you are unlikely to receive a single affirmative response. But as more information is provided, the likely response can be expected to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 75} Assume the same question but add that the offender was an adult male who had sex with a 15-year-old girl. Requiring registration and address verification will still seem reasonable, unlikely to shock a community\u2019s sense of justice. Even so, some might ask about the age of the offender and the specifics of the reporting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">{\u00b6 76} Assume the same question as above but add that the offender was a 21-year-old male, that the 15-year-old girl consented, and that the registration and address-verification requirements must be complied with every six months for 25 years, and now we are at the threshold. Many will see the consent as a mitigating factor, many will see the relatively modest age difference as a mitigating factor, and many will see the 25-year time period as unnecessarily long. As the majority notes, and I acknowledge, these potentially mitigating factors are not statutorily relevant, but they are nevertheless constitutionally relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">{\u00b6 77} Assume further that the offender has been determined by a psychologist to have none of the characteristics of a sex offender and to have a low risk of reoffending. There would be many who would be shocked at the severity and length of the punishment, i.e., the reporting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">{\u00b6 78} Assume all of the above and add that the offender could have received a sentence of up to 18 months, <em>see </em>R.C. 2929.14(A)(4), that he was sentenced to six months in prison (the shortest term possible), and that a judge released him after he had served a mere 12 days. Now the community\u2019s sense of justice has been violated. New would deem it appropriate to require a person who committed a crime that warranted a 12-day sentence to comply with reporting requirements every six months for the next 25 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">{\u00b6 79} The touchstone of federal cruel-and-unusual-punishment analysis is that the punishment must be proportional to the crime. <em>Weems v. United States, </em>217 U.S. 349, 367, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910). The case before us fails this standard. The current statutory scheme does not allow discretion on the part of the sentencing judge. Instead, all similarly situated offenders (meaning those with a similar age differential and no prior record as a sex offender) are punished according to a one-size-fits-all standard. There is no proportionality. The sentencing judge has discretion as to imposing a prison term, but not as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>registration and address-verification requirements. Offenders warranting a 12-day sentence have the same reporting requirements as those warranting an 18-month sentence. Offenders considered at low risk of reoffending have the same reporting requirements as those considered at high risk of reoffending. This lack of proportionality is constitutionally flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 80} Ohio\u2019s constitutional standard is somewhat different: a punishment is cruel and unusual when it \u201cwould be considered shocking to any reasonable person.\u201d <em>McDougle v. Maxwell, </em>1 Ohio St.2d 68, 70, 203 N.E.2d 334 (1964). It is clear to me that reasonable people would consider it shocking to require a person whose crime warranted a 12-day sentence to submit to twice-a-year reporting requirements for a 25-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">{\u00b6 81} This court has determined that the registration and address-verification requirements for Tier II sex offenders are punitive. <em>State v. Williams, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 344, 2011-Ohio-3374, 952 N.E.2d 1108, \u00b6 16. Today we should declare that in certain circumstances, the 25-year reporting requirements are onerous enough to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. I do not believe that the registration and address-verification requirements at issue in this case are cruel and unusual with respect to all Tier II sex offenders. But as applied to Blankenship, who was deemed to warrant a prison sentence of only 12 days, who has a low risk of reoffending, and who possesses none of the characteristics of a sex offender, the requirement to register and verify his address every six months for the next 25 years \u201cwould be considered shocking to any reasonable person.\u201d <em>McDougle </em>at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 82} I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals. I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b498-8\">O\u2019Neill, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b498-9\">O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKx\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">{\u00b6 83} Respectfully, I dissent. This case presents yet another example of the one-size-fits-all mentality that increasingly dictates criminal sentencing in Ohio. Judicial discretion has again been pushed aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">{\u00b6 84} A well-qualified psychologist provided the only evidence in this case that remotely touches on the question of this defendant\u2019s threat to society. He stated unequivocally that the risk of reoffending was low. Yet this 21-year-old offender will pay for his youthful indiscretion for a quarter of a century. Until he is 46 years old, Blankenship will be required to contact the sheriff in his home town every six months. If he moves, he must alert the authorities in his new town that a convicted sex criminal has moved into Pleasantville. R.C. 2950.05(A). That information will be available to the public on the Internet. R.C. 2950.081(A). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>this age of instant Internet chat rooms, imagine the future for his children when the mothers\u2019 network alerts all the grade-school children to avoid anyone who lives at 123 Elm Street. These requirements fall directly within the definition of the phrase \u201ccruel and unusual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">{\u00b6 85} I believe that imposing the Tier II sex-offender/child-victim-offender classification and its attendant registration requirements upon this defendant is a punishment grossly disproportionate to his crime. The trial court followed the law as it is written, and that is the problem. When sex offenders present a real threat to the public, the law indeed deters further crime, punishes the offender, and provides information the public can use to protect itself from offenders of the worst sort. In those cases, when there is a classic sex offender, the registration process that started with Megan\u2019s Law and continued in the Adam Walsh Act is not grossly disproportionate to the crime. However, this is not one of those cases. And yet this trial court was required to impose the penalty as prescribed. No discretion needed or permitted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">{\u00b6 86} Blankenship has never been convicted of a prior felony or a crime of violence. A psychologist considered the facts of the crime, met with Blankenship multiple times, determined that Blankenship\u2019s diagnostic tests indicated a low potential for reoffending, and he exhibited no psychopathology or sociopathy. The doctor further opined that Blankenship\u2019s conduct was not evidence of pedophilia or hebephilia. Rather, Blankenship exhibited genuine emotions toward the juvenile. The psychologist reported to the trial court that treatment specific to sex offenders is unethical for a man like Blankenship with no disorder to treat. The doctor did recommend psychotherapy to help Blankenship to cope with and move on from the loss of the relationship with the minor female, to educate him about appropriate healthy relationships, and to address cognitive distortions he used to rationalize his conduct. Blankenship consistently expressed remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">{\u00b6 87} For offenders like Blankenship, these registration requirements guarantee only an unnecessarily long term of public humiliation. And they effectively destroy any hope of leading a successful and productive life from that point forward. This mandatory registration requirement will limit Blankenship\u2019s employability for most jobs, will prevent him from engaging in any meaningful, productive relationship with the community around him, and will essentially label him as a pariah. He will have to lay his shame at the feet of everyone he encounters: employers, neighbors, love interests, friends, co-workers, and others. And for what? The public gains little of value to offset the unusual punishment because it is perfectly clear from this record that Blankenship was psychologically capable of learning his lesson the first time. And the record in this matter reflects that he has learned right from wrong. In that sense, the harsh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>punishment of sharing his personal information with the world for 25 years is grossly disproportionate to the crime. The mandatory registration requirement applied here, even though consistent with mandatory Ohio law, is constitutionally prohibited as it imposes a cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AyJ\">D.
