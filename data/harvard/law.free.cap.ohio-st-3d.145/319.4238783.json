The court of appeals granted summary judgment to ODPS and appellees Thomas P. Charles, the director of ODPS, and Jacqueline Baumann, a legal intern with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ODPS, and dismissed the petition for mandamus. The court of appeals subsequently denied Ziegler\u2019s application for reconsideration and en banc consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b62} For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 3} On June 24, 2014, Ziegler made a request for public records and information based on events surrounding the June 2, 2014 arrest of Robert Setzer. Ziegler\u2019s lengthy request sought, among other things, records of \u201cthe alleged incident and me on June 2, 2014,\u201d and \u201cany/all video and audio * * * of me being processed.\u201d In the request, Ziegler did not allege that she was with Setzer at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 4} ODPS provided some records but denied portions of the request, stating the reasons for the denial. ODPS also claimed that portions of the request sought information rather than records or were ambiguous or overly broad. After Setzer\u2019s criminal case concluded, ODPS provided Ziegler with additional records that had been withheld as confidential law-enforcement investigatory records.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 5} When ODPS did not provide all the records, Ziegler filed this action in mandamus. On January 20, 2015, the court of appeals held that appellees had provided the records that were responsive to Ziegler\u2019s request and had properly denied the portions of the request that were ambiguous or overly broad. The court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed the petition for mandamus. Two months later, on March 24, the court of appeals denied Ziegler\u2019s application for reconsideration and en banc consideration. Ziegler filed a notice of appeal on April 2, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">{\u00b6 6} The court of appeals properly determined that the requests for reconsideration and en banc consideration were a nullity. App.R. 26 provides for applications for reconsideration and for en banc consideration. But Ziegler\u2019s petition for mandamus was an original action, not an appeal, filed in the court of appeals. The Rules of Civil Procedure, not the Rules of Appellate Procedure, apply in an original action. An application for reconsideration or for en banc consideration under the appellate rules cannot be made in an original action. <em>State ex rel. Andrews v. Chardon Police Dept. </em>137 Ohio St.3d 468, 2013-Ohio-4772, 1 N.E.3d 333, \u00b6 3; <em>State ex rel. Davet v. Sutula, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 220, 2012-Ohio-759, 963 N.E.2d 811, \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">{\u00b6 7} Ziegler\u2019s request for reconsideration did not extend the time to appeal the court of appeals\u2019 entry granting summary judgment. <em>Andrews </em>at \u00b6 2. Her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>appeal from the March 24, 2015 denial of reconsideration cannot substitute for a timely appeal from the judgment on the merits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AYS\">Irm Ziegler, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aod\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Jeffery W.
