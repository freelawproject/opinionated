Chapter 1345, must have suffered injuries as a result of the conduct challenged in the suit. We hold that they must and therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">{\u00b6 2} This appeal arises from two related class-action lawsuits that were first brought by appellees, Jeffrey and Stacy Felix, nearly 15 years ago. In each suit, the Felixes sought damages from appellants, Ganley Chevrolet, Inc., and Ganley Management Company (collectively, \u201cGanley\u201d), as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. Although the issues before us are discrete legal ones, we summarize the history of the case for context.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">\n<em>The Transaction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">{\u00b6 3} The Felixes contend that they went to Ganley in March 2001 to purchase a 2000 Chevy Blazer. They allege that Ganley used a zero-percent-interest financing offer to lure Jeffrey Felix to sign a contract to purchase the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">{\u00b6 4} The purchase contract provided that it was \u201cnot binding unless accepted by seller and credit is approved, if applicable, by financial institution.\u201d The contract also contained an arbitration clause that required that \u201cany dispute between you and dealer (seller) will be resolved by binding arbitration.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>{\u00b6 5} When the Felixes returned a few days later to sign the promissory note and security agreement, Ganley purportedly told them that the financing institution would approve them for financing only at 1.9 percent interest, not at the zero percent interest previously represented to them. The Felixes reluctantly agreed to the 1.9 percent rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 6} More than a month later, Ganley informed the Felixes that they had not been approved for financing at the 1.9 percent interest rate. Ganley told the Felixes that they could obtain a 9 percent interest rate with Huntington Bank; the Felixes claim that Ganley contacted Huntington Bank without their permission. The Felixes refused. Soon thereafter, they brought the first of two suits against Ganley in the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">\n<em>The Initial Lawsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">{\u00b6 7} In their first action, which would become a class-action suit with the Felixes as representatives of the class, the Felixes sought damages under the OCSPA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">{\u00b6 8} The first three counts of the complaint alleged the class-action claims that are at issue here. The first count asserted that the arbitration clause used by Ganley was unconscionable and that various practices of Ganley pertaining to the clause violated the OCSPA. Counts two and three alleged that Ganley had committed unfair and deceptive consumer sales practices against the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">{\u00b6 9} In their prayer for relief for the class, the Felixes sought certification of their proposed classes of plaintiffs and defendants, an order declaring the arbitration clause unconscionable and void, injunctive relief, \u201cmonetary damages against Defendants, jointly and severally, where appropriate to each plaintiff,\u201d and reasonable attorney fees and costs. The Felixes did not specifically request $200 in damages for each class member. Nor did they seek actual damages for each class member. They did, however, make those requests in their prayer for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>relief in their <em>individual </em>capacities. More specifically, in their individual capacity, they sought \u201cthree times the amount of their actual damages or two hundred dollars ($200.00), for each unlawful act specified, whichever is greater,\u201d punitive damages, attorney fees and costs, and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">\n<em>The Second Lawsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 10} The second lawsuit, brought several months after the first suit, is a declaratory-judgment action. The declaratory-judgment action also became a class-action suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 11} The first count of the declaratory-judgment complaint sought a declaration that the arbitration clause is unconscionable. The second, third, and fourth counts sought declarations that Ganley committed unfair and deceptive consumer sales practices with respect to the arbitration clause. And count five requested a declaration that Ganley made false statements, representations, and disclosures of fact and defrauded customers as to the arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">{\u00b6 12} Ganley moved to stay the proceedings in both suits so that arbitration in accordance with the arbitration clause could proceed. The trial court held a consolidated hearing on the motions and denied them without opinion. Ganley appealed that order to the Eighth District Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Felix v. Ganley Chevrolet, Inc., </em>8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 86990 and 86991, 2006-Ohio-4500, 2006 WL 2507469 <em>(\u201cFelix I\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\"><em>The Initial Appeal: </em>Felix I</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">{\u00b6 13} In its appeal from the denial of the motion to stay, Ganley argued that the trial court erred by failing to stay the proceedings pending arbitration pursuant to R.C. 2711.02 because the purchase contract contains a clear and conspicuous arbitration clause. The Eighth District affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, holding that the arbitration clause was unconscionable and that there was no valid, enforceable agreement that required the parties to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">{\u00b6 14} In so doing, the appellate court recognized that R.C. 2711.02(B) requires a trial court, upon application of a party, to stay proceedings in any action in which the court is satisfied that an issue in the case is subject to arbitration pursuant to a written agreement between the parties. <em>Felix I </em>at \u00b6 12. But it also noted that R.C. 2711.01(A) provides that a provision for arbitration \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except upon grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 15. It then turned to the Felixes\u2019 claims that the arbitration provision was unconscionable and concluded that it was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>{\u00b6 15} We declined Ganley\u2019s request for review of that decision, <em>Felix v. Ganley Chevrolet, Inc., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 1470, 2007-Ohio-388, 861 N.E.2d 144, and therefore the unconscionability of the arbitration clause is not before us in this appeal. The issues before us arose after the Eighth District remanded the cause to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">\n<em>The Remand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 16} After remand, the parties litigated for another five years. Eventually, the trial court certified a class of plaintiffs pursuant to Civ.R. 23(B)(2) and (B)(3) and ruled that all class members could recover damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 17} The putative class includes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">All consumers of Vehicles from any of the 25 Ganley Companies (see Plaintiffs Chart, Exhibit A, filed August 18, 2003) within the two-year period preceding commencement through the present date (the Class Period), who signed a purchase agreement containing the arbitration clause at suit or one substantially similar thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">{\u00b6 18} The trial court held that Ganley\u2019s inclusion of the arbitration provision in its purchase agreements with consumers violated the OCSPA and established a basis for classwide relief under Civ.R. 23(B)(2) and (B)(3). It then announced that it would \u201cissue relief to protect those class members from prejudice\u201d caused by Ganley\u2019s \u201ccommon course of conduct\u201d in the use of the arbitration clause. It noted that \u201c[r]e-litigating a class member\u2019s right to relief over and over again would be a drain on the judiciary and serve no valid purpose\u201d and that \u201c[fjew if any class members would likely be able to effectively challenge [Ganley] due to the cost of litigation.\u201d The trial court ruled that the OCSPA at least permitted, and perhaps required, a classwide award of damages for Ganley\u2019s conduct, which it described as a \u201csignificant violation of the law.\u201d The trial court wrote, \u201cTo allow [Ganley] to emerge from this seven-year legal battle, during which time they continued to use the offending clause, without sanction, would defeat the policies underlying CSPA and the rule of law\u201d and \u201creward lawlessness aimed primarily at consumers.\u201d Citing its \u201cdiscretion,\u201d the trial court awarded $200 per transaction to each class member.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">{\u00b6 19} Ganley again appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\"><em>The Second Appeal: </em>Felix II</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">{\u00b6 20} Before the Eighth District, Ganley argued that the trial court \u201cerred as a matter of law and abused its discretion in certifying, for purposes of a claim under the [CSPA], a class of customers who signed purchase agreements that included an arbitration provision.\u201d (Brackets sic.) A divided panel of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order certifying the class. 2013-Ohio-3523, 2013 WL 4238945 <em>(\u201cFelix IF\u2019). </em>In so doing, it rejected Ganley\u2019s claims that the class definition, and time period were overbroad and ambiguous, <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 12-15, and that the Felixes had not established the commonality, predominance, and typicality prerequisites to class certification set forth in Civ.R. 23(B), <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 17-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">{\u00b6 21} The appellate court rejected Ganley\u2019s claim that certifying an \u201call customers\u201d class for the OCSPA violation was improper on the ground that the class contained individuals who had not sustained actual damages as a result of Ganley\u2019s inclusion of the arbitration provision in its sales agreements. But it did so without squarely addressing the crux of Ganley\u2019s claim, i.e., that there was no showing that all class members had suffered damages. Instead, the majority held that the propriety of the trial court\u2019s order on damages was outside the scope of the appellate court\u2019s scope of review because Ganley had assigned as error only the trial court\u2019s certification of the class. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\n<em>The Appeal Before Us</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">{\u00b6 22} Ganley sought this court\u2019s discretionary review. We agreed to address the following propositions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">A class action cannot be maintained on behalf of a putative class that includes individuals who did not sustain actual harm or damage as a result of the challenged conduct, which is a required part of the rigorous analysis under Ohio R. Civ. P. 23; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">In a class action brought under the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, R.C. 1345.09(B) requires the consumers to have sustained actual damages as a result of the challenged conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-10\"><em>See </em>138 Ohio St.3d 1413, 2014-Ohio-566, 3 N.E.3d 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">{\u00b6 23} This appeal arises at the intersection of class-action suits and the OCSPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">{.\u00b6 24} The procedural aspects of class-action litigation in Ohio are controlled by Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 and Civ.R. 23, depending on whether the matter proceeds in a federal or state court in Ohio. Here, Civ.R. 23 governs. Because the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure are modeled after the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, federal law interpreting the federal rule is appropriate and persuasive authority in interpreting a similar Ohio rule. <em>Stammco, L.L.C. v. United Tel. Co. of Ohio, </em>136 Ohio St.3d 231, 2013-Ohio-3019, 994 N.E.2d 408, \u00b6 18, citing <em>Myers v. Toledo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>110 Ohio St.3d 218, 2006-Ohio-4353, 852 N.E.2d 1176, \u00b6 18, and <em>Marks v. C.P. Chem. Co., Inc., </em>31 Ohio St.3d 200, 201, 509 N.E.2d 1249 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">{\u00b6 25} We are mindful that class-action suits are the exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of only the individually named parties. <em>Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, </em>569 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1426, 1432, 185 L.Ed.2d 515 (2013), citing <em>Califano v. Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 700-701, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979). To fall within that exception, the party bringing the class action must affirmatively demonstrate compliance with the procedural rules governing class actions. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>564 U.S. 338, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 2551-2552, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">{\u00b6 26} The United States Supreme Court has insisted that courts give careful consideration to the class-certification process, holding that Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 is not \u201ca mere pleading standard.\u201d <em>Dukes </em>at 350. Rather, the party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate compliance with the rules for certification and be prepared to prove \u201cthat there are <em>in fact </em>sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law and fact, etc.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Id. </em>After <em>Dukes, </em>there can be no dispute that a trial court\u2019s rigorous analysis of the evidence often requires looking into enmeshed legal and factual issues that are part of the merits of the plaintiffs underlying claims. <em>Id. </em>at 2552. <em>See also In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation </em>\u2014 MDL <em>No. 1869, </em>725 F.3d 244, 253 (D.C.Cir.2013). In doing so, however, the trial court may probe the underlying merits of the cause of action only for the purpose of determining that the plaintiff has satisfied Civ.R. 23. <em>Stammco at </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">{\u00b6 27} Because the appeal before us involves the certification of a class for claims based on alleged violations of the OCSPA, it is necessary to set forth briefly the relevant provisions in that statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">{\u00b6 28} During the period set forth in the class action, the OCSPA provided that a consumer was entitled to relief <em>in an individual action </em>by rescinding the transaction or recovering damages. Former R.C. 1345.09(A), Am.Sub.H.B. No. 681, 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3219, 3226-3227. The term \u201cdamages\u201d as used in the OCSPA encompasses all forms of pecuniary relief, although it does include \u201cactual damages\u201d and \u201ccompensatory damages.\u201d <em>See Whitaker v. M. T. Automotive, Inc., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 177, 2006-Ohio-5481, 855 N.E.2d 825, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">{\u00b6 29} Although the OCSPA authorized class actions, it limited the scope of damages that were available in them. Treble and statutory damages were not available in class-action claims brought under the OCSPA. Former R.C. 1345.09(B), 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, at 3227 (\u201cthe consumer may rescind the transaction or recover, <em>but not in a class action, </em>three times the amount of his actual damages or two hundred dollars, whichever is greater, or <em>recover damages or other appropriate relief in a class action </em>under Civil Rule 23\u201d [emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>added]). Instead, according to one Ohio court, the OCSPA limited the damages available in class actions to actual damages, <em>Washington v. Spitzer Mgt., Inc., </em>8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 81612, 2003-Ohio-1735, 2003 WL 1759617, \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">{\u00b6 30} This damage limitation is consistent with a policy determination that while treble or statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees are available in actions under consumer-protection statutes to encourage consumers with smaller amounts of damages to bring their claims, <em>Whitaker </em>at \u00b6 11, citing <em>Parker v. I &amp; F Insulation Co., Inc., </em>89 Ohio St.3d 261, 268, 730 N.E.2d 972 (2000); <em>see also </em>Sovern, <em>Private Actions Under the Deceptive Trade Practices Acts: Reconsidering the FTC Act as Rule Model, </em>52 Ohio St.L.J. 437, 462 (1991), treble statutory damages are not awarded in class actions because class-action lawsuits deter violations of the law by permitting the aggregation of claims. In fact, some courts have suggested that the General Assembly limited damages for class-action suits under the OCSPA in order to protect defendants from being held liable for \u201chuge damage awards.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Washington </em>at \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">{\u00b6 31} Plaintiffs bringing OCSPA class-action suits must allege and prove that actual damages were proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Konarzewski v. Ganley, Inc., </em>8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 92623, 2009-Ohio-5827, 2009 WL 3649787, \u00b6 46 (\u201cclass action plaintiffs must prove actual damages under the CSPA\u201d). Proof of actual damages is required before a court may properly certify a class action. <em>Searles v. Germain Ford of Columbus, L.L.C., </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 08AP-728, 2009-Ohio-1323, 2009 WL 756645, \u00b622. <em>See also Butler v. Sterling, Inc., </em>6th Cir. No. 98-3223, 2000 WL 353502, *4 (Mar. 31, 2000); <em>Johnson v. Jos. A.

It is also consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that trial courts are to give more careful consideration in the class-certification process. <em>See, e.g., Dukes, </em>564 U.S. at 351-352, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 180 L.Ed.2d 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">{\u00b6 33} Plaintiffs in class-action suits must demonstrate that they can prove, through common evidence, that all class members were in fact injured by the defendant\u2019s actions. <em>In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust </em>Litigation\u2014 <em>MDL No. 1869, </em>725 F.3d at 252.

McDonald\u2019s Sys., Inc., </em>86 F.R.D. 145, 147 (N.D.Ill.1980). As one federal trial court recently explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">When evaluating damages in the predominance inquiry, \u201c[t]he <em>amount </em>of damages is invariably an individual question and does not defeat class action treatment.\u201d <em>Blackie v.

While determining the <em>amount </em>of damages does not defeat the predominance inquiry, a proposed class action requiring the court to determine individualized <em>fact </em>of damages does not meet the predominance standards of Rule 23(b)(3). <em>See In re Live Antitrust Litigation, </em>247 F.R.D. 98 (C.D.Cal.2007) (recognizing the distinction between demonstrating the fact of damages and the amount of damages, and determining that while the latter does not preclude class certification, the former does.); <em>Catlin v.

Indeed, a key purpose of the predominance requirement is to test whether the proposed class is sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation. <em>Amchem Prods, </em>at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cPerhaps the most basic requirement to bringing a lawsuit is that the plaintiff suffer some injury. Apart from a showing of wrongful conduct and causation, proof of actual harm to the plaintiff has been an indispensable part of civil actions.\u201d Schwartz &amp; Silverman, <em>Common Sense Construction of Consumer Protection Acts, </em>54 U.Kan.L.Rev. 1, 50 (2005). We agree, and we hold that all members of a class in class-action litigation alleging violations of the OCSPA must have suffered injury as a result of the conduct challenged in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>{\u00b6 37} Here, the class, as certified, fails because there is no showing that all class members suffered an injury in fact. The broadly defined class encompasses consumers who purchased a vehicle at Ganley through a purchase contract that contained the unconscionable arbitration provision. But there is absolutely no showing that all of the consumers who purchased vehicles through a contract with the offensive arbitration provision were injured by it or suffered any damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">{\u00b6 38} The trial court\u2019s holding that it could award $200 to each member of the class as a matter of the trial court\u2019s discretion is based on a fiction. There is no authority in the statutory scheme or in our precedent to support a damages award to a class member in class-action litigation arising from the OCSPA absent a showing that the class member was injured and sustained damages as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">{\u00b6 39} To the extent that the Felixes contend that they and other class members are entitled to statutory damages as class members because R.C. 1345.09 does not limit the term \u201cdamages\u201d to \u201cactual damages,\u201d they are mistaken. That conclusion ignores the General Assembly\u2019s clear intent, expressed in the statute\u2019s language, to distinguish between damages available \u201cin an individual action,\u201d former R.C. 1345.09(A), 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, at 3227, \u201cbut not in a class action,\u201d former R.C. 1345.09(B), <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">{\u00b6 40} Nor is our review of the question of class members\u2019 damages, or lack thereof, foreclosed for want of a final, appealable order, as the Felixes contend. The certification of the putative class is before us, and as the dissenting judge in the court of appeals recognized, \u201cthe CSPA\u2019s damages limitation impacts not only the damages that may ultimately be recovered by a properly certified class but whether a putative class may be properly certified as a Civ. R. 23(B)(3) CSPA class in the first instance.\u201d <em>Felix II, </em>2013-Ohio-3523, 2013 WL 4238945, \u00b6 72 (Rocco, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">{\u00b6 41} Because the class certified in this case includes plaintiffs whose damages are, at best, inchoate, the class as certified is inconsistent with former R.C. 1345.09(B), 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, at 3227, and Civ.R. 23. <em>See Stammco, L.L.C., </em>136 Ohio St.3d 231, 2013-Ohio-3019, 994 N.E.2d 408, \u00b6 53, quoting <em>Messner, </em>669 F.3d at 824 (\u201c \u2018If * * * a class is defined so broadly as to include a great number of members who for some reason could not have been harmed by the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct, the class is defined too broadly to permit certification\u2019 \u201d). Although trial judges enjoy broad discretion in determining whether a class can be certified, that discretion is not unlimited, particularly when, as here, the trial judge completely misconstrues the letter and spirit of the law. <em>Howland, v.

Some courts treat the failure to sufficiently allege and demonstrate damages in consumer-protection claims as a failure to establish standing or ripeness. <em>See, e.g., Neese v.

If and when [the lender] seeks to compel arbitration of a [Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] claim, the plaintiffs can challenge the agreement as unenforceable at that time\u201d [footnote omitted]), citing <em>Chicago Bd. of Trade v. Commodity Futures Trading Comm., </em>704 F.2d 929, 933 (7th Cir.1983). The questions before us are framed neither as standing nor ripeness issues, and we intimate no opinion on those questions of law, particularly given that the United States Supreme Court is now considering, on standing grounds only, whether a plaintiff may bring suit under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., alleging as his injury only violations of his statutory rights under the act. <em>Robins v. Spokeo, Inc., </em>742 F.3d 409 (9th Cir.2014), <em>cert. granted, </em>135 S.Ct. 1892, 191 L.Ed.2d 762 (2015).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b595-10\">O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Au8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">{\u00b6 44} Respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">{\u00b6 45} I believe that the majority blurs the line between maintaining a class action and meeting the burden of proof in a class action that alleges violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (\u201cOCSPA\u201d), R.C. Chapter 1345. The majority distorts the distinction between the inquiry authorized by Civ.R. 23(B)(3) and the fundamental burden on all tort plaintiffs to prove damages. I write to express my concern that this confusion will fundamentally affect the class-action practice in Ohio. And that would be a terrible outcome, for class actions do indeed provide a vital protection for all citizens of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">{\u00b6 46} The majority holds that certifying a class in this case requires showing actual damages, but it fails to state whether this is a requirement under the OCSPA that is independent of the requirements laid out in Civ.R. 23. Instead, this court fuses R.C. 1345.09(B) and the Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(B)(3) predominance principles set forth in <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>564 U.S. 338, 349-350, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011). The majority concludes that the class could not be certified, because appellees, Jeffrey and Stacy Felix, had not shown that all the class members suffered an injury in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>{\u00b6 47} I agree with the majority that <em>Dukes </em>\u201crequires looking into enmeshed legal and factual issues that are part of the merits of the plaintiffs underlying claims,\u201d but \u201conly for the purpose of determining that the plaintiff has satisfied Civ.R. 23.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 26. <em>Dukes </em>recognized the \u201cnecessity of touching aspects of the merits\u201d in order to decide the <em>very 'preliminary </em>issue of class certification. <em>Dukes </em>at 351; Civ.R. 23(C)(1) (\u201cAs <em>soon as practicable </em>after the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by order whether it is to be so maintained\u201d [emphasis added]). The majority applies these principles but then elevates the preliminary inquiry into a full-blown examination of whether damages have been proved. This is simply not required in a preliminary inquiry under Civ.R. 23(B)(3). In effect, the majority touches on the merits in order to decide the merits at the class-certification phase. Under the rule announced today by the court, class-action plaintiffs will have to prove their case before they are given the opportunity to prove their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">{\u00b6 48} The predominance inquiry under Civ.R. 23(B)(3) requires that plaintiffs show that there are <em>\u201cquestions </em>of law or fact that are common to the class.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Stammco, L.L.C. v. United Tel. Co. of Ohio, </em>136 Ohio St.3d 231, 2013-Ohio-3019, 994 N.E.2d 408, \u00b6 19. Plaintiffs do not need to show up with <em>answers </em>to those questions when they are seeking class certification. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court clarified the preliminary nature of class certification in the post <em>-Dukes </em>era in <em>Amgen, Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans &amp; Trust Funds, </em>-U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1184, 185 L.Ed.2d 308 (2013). The court considered whether class-action plaintiffs had to prove an element of their claim as a prerequisite to class certification: \u201c[Fed.R.Civ.P.] 23(b)(3) requires a showing that <em>questions </em>common to the class predominate, not that those questions will be answered, on the merits, in favor of the class.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Id. </em>at 1191. The alternative, requiring the plaintiffs to \u201cestablish that [they] will win the fray,\u201d would \u201cput the cart before the horse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whether the plaintiffs can or have met their burden of proof is a question appropriately relegated to a later phase of litigation \u2014 especially with regard to the element of damages. <em>Id. </em>at 1197 (\u201c[An alleged failure of proof as to an element of the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action] is properly addressed at trial or in a ruling on a summary-judgment motion. The allegation should not be resolved in deciding whether to certify a proposed class\u201d). Under the rule announced today by the majority, from this point forward, courts in Ohio could ignore the guidance of the United States Supreme Court and might require putative class-action plaintiffs to affirmatively prove liability or causation prior to certification of a class. That is nonsense.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">{\u00b6 49} I do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that appellees met their burden under Civ.R. 23. This case is similar to <em>Amgen, </em>not <em>Dukes. </em>In <em>Amgen, </em>the putative-class plaintiffs alleged that Amgen, Inc., had made misrepresentations regarding its flagship drugs that caused an artificial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>inflation of Amgen\u2019s stock. <em>Amgen </em>at 1195-1196. Amgen argued that for the class claim to predominate over individual claims, the plaintiffs had to prove that the misrepresentation was material. <em>See id. </em>at 1191, 1195. The court observed that the question of materiality would be an objective one, applicable to the entire class of buyers. <em>Id. </em>at 1196. Therefore, there was no risk that a failure of proof on the issue would require consideration of individualized questions, rather than questions common to the class, about reliance on the misrepresentation. <em>Id. </em>at 1196. Rather, failure of proof on that element would be a \u201c \u2018fatal similarity\u2019 \u201d that would sink the entire case at a later stage. <em>Id. </em>at 1197, quoting Nagareda, <em>Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, </em>84 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 97, 107 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">{\u00b6 50} In <em>Dukes, </em>the court had to wade into the merits in order to determine whether there was a common policy of discrimination used by all of the thousands of supervisors responsible for each of the 1.5 million putative-class members. 564 U.S. 356-358,131 S.Ct. at 2541, 180 L.Ed.2d 374. The court\u2019s limited inquiry into the merits clarified that factual questions about discriminatory personnel practices would differ at each Wal-Mart store, and thus it was proper not to certify a class. <em>Id. </em>at 352-359. That is the type of case that fails for an inadequate showing of predominance under Civ.R. 23(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">{\u00b6 51} Like the plaintiffs in <em>Amgen, </em>however, appellants, Ganley Chevrolet, Inc., and Ganley Management Company (collectively, \u201cGanley\u201d), allegedly used unconscionable arbitration terms in contracts with the putative-class members. The legal issue \u2014 whether use of an unconscionable arbitration term is a violation of the OCSPA \u2014 is overwhelmingly and obviously common to the class members because every single class member\u2019s claim would be won or lost on the answer to that question. Appellees did not fail to show a class for whom common questions of law or fact predominate over any individual questions; every member of the class could lose on the question of damages at the same time. <em>See Cope v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>82 Ohio St.3d 426, 429-430, 696 N.E.2d 1001 (1998) (\u201cIt is now well established that \u2018a claim will meet the predominance requirement when there exists generalized evidence which proves or disproves an element on a simultaneous, class-wide basis, since such proof obviates the need to examine each class member\u2019s individual position.\u2019 <em>Lockwood Motors, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(D.Minn.1995), 162 F.R.D. 569, 580\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">{\u00b6 52} This court also granted jurisdiction over Ganley\u2019s second proposition of law: \u201cIn a class action brought under the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, R.C. 1345.09(B) requires the consumers to have sustained actual damages as a result of the challenged conduct.\u201d I can readily agree with this proposition, as it correctly states Ohio law. Under R.C. 1345.09(B), plaintiffs may <em>\u201crecover </em>dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ages or other appropriate relief in a class action under Civil Rule 23, as amended.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">{\u00b6 53} The last sentence of R.C. 1345.09(B) has nothing to do with class certification under Civ.R. 23. \u201cRecover\u201d means \u201cto obtain (relief) by judgment or other legal process.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1466 (10th Ed.2014). Recovery is an aspect of the very last event in a lawsuit \u2014 the judgment. But under Civ.R. 23(C)(1), class certification is one of the very first events in a lawsuit. It is hard to find any practical or conceptual relationship between R.C. 1345.09(B) and Civ.R. 23, beyond that the former refers to the latter without modifying it. To the extent that this court\u2019s past opinions can be read to hold otherwise, if was as wrong then as it is now. <em>See Marrone v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., </em>110 Ohio St.3d 5, 2006-Ohio-2869, 850 N.E.2d 31, syllabus.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even in <em>Marrone, </em>we were able to carefully distinguish the requirements of the OCSPA from those of Civ.R. 23. <em>Marrone </em>at \u00b6 8 (\u201cthis opinion does not address whether the requirements of Civ.R. 23 were met. We address only the narrow issue of whether defendant had sufficient notice for purposes of R.C. 1345.09(B) that its alleged conduct was deceptive\u201d). The majority writes additional language into the Revised Code to state that the OCSPA requires proof of damages as a prerequisite of class certification under Civ.R. 23(B)(3). This is an inquiry that should be resolved at the trial-court level as the case progresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">{\u00b6 54} The majority points to less-than-helpful cases to support muddling the class-certification standard under Civ.R. 23(B)(3) with an actual-damages requirement. <em>See, e.g., Butler v. Sterling, Inc., </em>6th Cir. No. 98-3223, 2000 WL 353502, *3 (Mar. 31, 2000) (class claims were brought under the Truth-in-Lending Act, but the trial court had disposed of the plaintiffs OCSPA claim on summary judgment before denying class certification); <em>Johnson v.

Only the Tenth District Court of Appeals has amalgamated the requirements of Civ.R. 23(B)(3) and R.C. 1345.09(B) in the same way as the majority in this case does. <em>Searles v.

That is to say, there may have been other good reasons for reversal. Although appellees properly proposed a class, it seems plainly erroneous that the trial court summarily handed out \u201cdiscretionary damages\u201d immediately upon certifying the class. Ganley asked this court to consider issues surrounding that mistake in its memorandum in support of jurisdiction. I believe that it was unwise to accept jurisdiction on the class-action issue without accepting jurisdiction over the entire matter.

Spitzer Autoworld Canton, L.L.C., </em>which held that Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-12(B)(22) was unconstitutional \u201c[t]o the extent that [the rule] conflicts with the parol evidence rule * * * and allows parol evidence contradicting the final written contract.\u201d 122 Ohio St.3d 546, 2009-Ohio-3554, 913 N.E.2d 410, paragraph one of the syllabus. With no parol-evidence issue presented, and with a number of common pleas court judgments published in the attorney general\u2019s public-information file, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the <em>Man-one </em>requirement was met.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
