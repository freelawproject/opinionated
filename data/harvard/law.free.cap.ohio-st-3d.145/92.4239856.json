Thus, upon review, the county had no obligation to release these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">{\u00b6 3} Subsequent to receipt of the public-records request, circumstances changed: Cuyahoga County moved its administrative offices to a new building; it demolished its former offices to build a hotel and convention center; and FitzGerald\u2019s term of office expired, and he is no longer the county executive. In addition, the county released the records to members of the media in January of this year and thereby waived its argument that they are not subject to the public-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>records law. Accordingly, there is no longer any basis to withhold the requested key-card-swipe data, and therefore we grant the writ and order release of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">{\u00b6 4} On May 22, 2014, Chris Schrimpf, the communications director for the ORP, e-mailed a public-records request to Celebrezze and Mary Segulin seeking \u201cthe county\u2019s key card swipe data that shows when an employee enters or leaves a county building\u201d for five individuals, including FitzGerald. He sent the request to Emily Lundgard, the county\u2019s director of communications, on June 2, and on June 9, he e-mailed her again, clarifying that his requests were based on the Cuyahoga County Code, the Cuyahoga County Charter, and the Ohio Public Records Act and indicating that because the request sought only information that the county had already denied to the Cleveland <em>Plain Dealer, </em>further delay in granting or denying the request should be unnecessary. He sent a follow-up email to Celebrezze on June 17, reiterating the prior request and also requesting the key-card-swipe data for a sixth person. Celebrezze acknowledged receiving the request the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">{\u00b6 5} The ORP filed this mandamus action on July 9, 2014, alleging that the county had failed to respond to its public-records requests, even though the same types of records \u201chave readily been provided with respect to other employees or officials of the County of Cuyahoga.\u201d The ORP asserts that the records at issue here are public records pursuant to the Public Records Act and the Cuyahoga County Code and that the county has neither fulfilled the record request nor denied it, nor has it provided a written explanation justifying denial of the request as is required by law. The ORP therefore seeks a writ of mandamus compelling respondents to produce the requested records.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">{\u00b6 6} On July 11, Majeed Makhlouf, the law director for Cuyahoga County, responded to Schrimpfs request, explaining that he could not release the key-card-swipe data for FitzGerald because \u201cthe Sheriffs Department [had] confirmed the existence of verifiable security threats barring the release of this information pursuant to R.C. 149.433.\u201d He provided the key-card-swipe data for the five other individuals but indicated that the county did not have information on when employees left the building because employees are not required to swipe their key cards to exit.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">{\u00b6 7} On July 21, Schrimpf requested key-card-swipe data going back to January 2011, and he e-mailed again on July 29 to ask when he would receive the key-card-swipe records he had requested but not yet received.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">{\u00b6 8} The next day, Makhlouf responded that the July 21 request was being processed \u201cas expeditiously as possible\u201d in light of the move to the new county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>administration building. On July 31, he e-mailed the key-card-swipe data requested but again excluded data relating to FitzGerald.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 9} We granted an alternative writ on September 24, 140 Ohio St.3d 1435, 2014-Ohio-4160, 16 N.E.3d 681, and the parties submitted briefs and evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">{\u00b6 10} In support of its position that the key-card-swipe data is excepted from disclosure, the county presented the affidavit of David DeGrandis, a senior administrative officer with the Cuyahoga County Department of Information Technology, who averred that the county installed the key-card system \u201cfor the protection of [the county\u2019s] facilities and those who use them.\u201d He explained that users have different levels of access to the building and that the key-card-swipe system is used to determine whether a user has security clearance to access a particular part of the building. He also stated that the key-card-swipe data can reveal \u201csensitive security information,\u201d so that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">if an individual with high-level security credentials, such as the County Executive, utilizes a non-public entryway to enter an area that is secured via the key-card system without the presence of security personnel, the security key-card data will not only reveal the time patterns of entry, but it will also reveal the existence of the non-public, secured entryway itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">{\u00b6 11} The county also presented the affidavit of D. Paul Soprek, a detective with the Cuyahoga County sheriffs department and director of the Principal Protection Unit, which is charged with protecting the county\u2019s public officials. He claimed that the Principal Protection Unit \u201cis investigating a number of verified threats * * * against Executive FitzGerald\u201d and asserted that \u201cit is critical to protect the manner and pattern of travel, ingress and egress, and timing. This is precisely the kind of information that the county\u2019s security key-card data reveals. Release of the security key-card data for the County Executive diminishes the effectiveness of the Principal Protection Unit and its ability to protect the County Executive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">{\u00b6 12} Nonetheless, on January 7, 2015, Lundgard, the county\u2019s director of communications, released FitzGerald\u2019s key-card-swipe data to the <em>Plain Dealer. </em>The ORP e-mailed Makhlouf asking whether the county would fulfill its public-records request, but Makhlouf replied that the request had been properly denied when it was submitted and invited the ORP to submit a new request \u201cbased on the changed circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">\n<em>Motion for oral argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">{\u00b6 13} The ORP has moved for oral argument, which is discretionary in an original action. S.Ct.Prac.R. 17.02(A). Because we are able to decide the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>in this case without oral argument, we deny that motion. <em>State ex rel. Mahajan v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 497, 2010-Ohio-5995, 940 N.E.2d 1280, \u00b6 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\n<em>Show-cause order and motion to strike</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">{\u00b6 14} On March 25, 2015, we ordered the ORP to show cause why the case should not be dismissed as moot based on media reports that the county had released the key-card-swipe data to the press. 142 Ohio St.3d 1407, 2015-Ohio-1099, 27 N.E.3d 538. As we explained in <em>State ex rel. Anderson v. Vermilion, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 120, 2012-Ohio-5320, 980 N.E.2d 975, \u00b6 18, \u201cproviding the requested records to a relator generally renders moot a public-records mandamus claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AdP\">{\u00b6 15} However, in response to the show-cause order, the ORP asserts that the county still has not provided it all of the requested records. The county admits in its memorandum in response that it released \u201csimilar\u201d records to the <em>Plain Dealer, </em>but it contends that the records sought in this action are security and infrastructure records that the county is not required to release. And the county indicates that if the ORP submitted a new request, the county would \u201cplace it through the appropriate channels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">{\u00b6 16} The ORP then moved to strike the county\u2019s memorandum in response, arguing that it constitutes \u201csupplemental argument and briefing\u201d in violation of S.Ct.Prac.R. 16.08. However, the county submitted additional evidence to prove that it had exercised its discretion to provide FitzGerald\u2019s key-card-swipe data to the press, information that is relevant to determining whether this action is moot. In <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer, Div. of Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc. v. Dupuis, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 126, 2002-Ohio-7041, 781 N.E.2d 163, \u00b6 8, we noted that \u201c[a]n event that causes a case to become moot may be proved by extrinsic evidence outside the record.\u201d We therefore deny the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 17} And because the county has not released the records to the ORP and continues to maintain that pursuant to R.C. 149.433, FitzGerald\u2019s key-card-swipe data are not public records that must be released, we conclude that this case is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\n<em>Motions to take judicial notice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">{\u00b6 18} The ORP filed two motions asking the court to take judicial notice of information on the county\u2019s governmental website \u2014 specifically, the county\u2019s announcements that the county executive\u2019s office had moved to a new building and that a new county executive had replaced FitzGerald. Pursuant to Evid.R. 201(B), courts may take judicial notice of facts not subject to reasonable dispute, and here, these motions are unopposed and the county posted the information on its own website. Thus, the motions to take judicial notice of this information are well taken and granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>\n<em>Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cMandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Physicians Commt. for Responsible Medicine v. Ohio State Univ. Bd. of Trustees, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-903, 843 N.E.2d 174, \u00b6 6; R.C. 149.43(C)(1). Although we liberally construe the Public Records Act in favor of access to public records, \u201cthe relator must still establish entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>State ex rel. McCaffrey v. Mahoning Cty. Prosecutor\u2019s Office, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 139, 2012-Ohio-4246, 976 N.E.2d 877, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">{\u00b6 20} But here, the county asserts that the requested records are exempt from disclosure pursuant to R.C. 149.433. As we explained in <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Jones-Kelley, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 81, 2008-Ohio-1770, 886 N.E.2d 206,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">[ejxceptions <em>to </em>disclosure under the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, are strictly construed against the public-records custodian, and the custodian has the burden to establish the applicability of an exception. * * * A custodian does not meet this burden if it has not proven that the requested records fall squarely within the exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 149.433(B) provides that \u201c[a] record kept by a public office that is a security record or an infrastructure record is not a public record under section 149.43 of the Revised Code and is not subject to mandatory release or disclosure under that section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 149.433(A)(3)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> defines the term \u201csecurity record\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-11\">(3) \u201cSecurity record\u201d means any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-12\">(a) Any record that contains information directly used for protecting or maintaining the security of a public office against attack, interference, or sabotage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-13\">(b) Any record assembled, prepared, or maintained by a public office or public body to prevent, mitigate, or respond to acts of terrorism, including any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>(i) Those portions of records containing specific and unique vulnerability assessments or specific and unique response plans either of which is intended to prevent or mitigate acts of terrorism, and communication codes or deployment plans of law enforcement or emergency response personnel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">(ii) Specific intelligence information and specific investigative records shared by federal and international law enforcement agencies with state and local law enforcement and public safety agencies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">(iii) National security records classified under federal executive order and not subject to public disclosure under federal law that are shared by federal agencies, and other records related to national security briefings to assist state and local government with domestic preparedness for acts of terrorism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">(c) An emergency management plan adopted pursuant to section 3313.536 of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">{\u00b6 23} We construed R.C. 149.433(A)(3) in <em>State ex rel. Plunderbund Media, L.L.C., v. Born, </em>141 Ohio St.3d 422, 2014-Ohio-3679, 25 N.E.3d 988, explaining that \u201csecurity records\u201d include those that are directly used for protecting and maintaining the security of a public office as well as the public officials and employees of that office. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 20. There, the Director of Public Safety had presented evidence that disclosure of records documenting threats against the governor \u201c \u2018would expose security limitations and vulnerabilities,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 24 (quoting the affidavit of John Born), could \u201c \u2018reveal patterns, techniques or information\u2019 related to security,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b625 (quoting the affidavit of Highway Patrol Superintendent Paul Pride), and \u201c \u2018could be used to commit terrorism, intimidation, or violence,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 26 (quoting the affidavit of Ohio Homeland Security Executive Director Richard Baron). Based on that evidence, we concluded that those records, which involved direct threats against the governor, were security records not subject to release as public records, because they were directly used to protect and maintain the secure functioning of the governor\u2019s office. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">{\u00b6 24} Similarly, in this case, the county withheld release of the key-card-swipe data because there had been verified threats against FitzGerald, and according to Detective Soprek, it was \u201ccritical\u201d to protect information regarding FitzGerald\u2019s \u201cmanner and pattern of travel, ingress and egress, and timing\u201d that would be revealed by the key-card-swipe data. Soprek also averred that release of the key-card-swipe data would \u201cdiminish[ ] the effectiveness of the Principal Protection Unit and its ability to protect the County Executive.\u201d Thus, pursuant to <em>Plunderbund, </em>the key-card-swipe data contain information directly used for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>protecting or maintaining the security of a public office, and for that reason, they are \u201csecurity records\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 149.433(A)(3). <em>See Plunderbund </em>at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">{\u00b6 25} We reject the county\u2019s contention that the key-card-swipe data are exempt from release as infrastructure records. R.C. 149.433(A)(2) defines \u201cinfrastructure record\u201d to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">any record that discloses the configuration of a public office\u2019s or chartered nonpublic school\u2019s critical systems including, but not limited to, communication, computer, electrical, mechanical, ventilation, water, and plumbing systems, security codes, or the infrastructure or structural configuration of the building in which a public office or chartered nonpublic school is located. \u201cInfrastructure record\u201d does not mean a simple floor plan that discloses only the spatial relationship of components of a public office or chartered nonpublic school or the building in which a public office or chartered nonpublic school is located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">{\u00b6 26} The key-swipe data sought by the ORP do not disclose the configuration of a public office\u2019s critical systems. Rather, they show when FitzGerald entered the building each day \u2014 facts unrelated to the building\u2019s structural configuration. And although the affidavit of David DeGrandis indicates that the key-swipe data could \u201creveal the existence of [a] nonpublic, secured entryway,\u201d DeGrandis does not specify that the data would reveal the <em>location </em>of such an entryway\u2014 information the ORP did not seek in its request. In any case, the location of any secured entrances would be observable by the public and would appear on \u201ca simple floor plan that discloses only the spatial relationship of components of * * * the building in which a public office * * * is located,\u201d and such a floor plan is expressly excluded from the definition of an infrastructure record. R.C. 149.433(A)(2). Thus, even if the key-card-swipe data reveal the location of nonpublic, secured entrances, they are not excepted from disclosure as infrastructure records.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">{\u00b6 27} At the time of the request, R.C. 149.433 exempted FitzGerald\u2019s key-card-swipe data from disclosure because FitzGerald had received threats. The undisputed evidence now demonstrates that the data are neither security records nor infrastructure records. Cuyahoga County\u2019s website reflects that as of July 2014, its administrative offices are now located in a new building. <em>See </em>http:// www.cuyahogacounty.us/en-US/HQ-Background.aspx; http://www.cuyahogacoun ty.us/en-US/New-County-Admin-HQ.aspx (accessed Oct. 15, 2015). In addition, the old county administration building has been demolished. <em>See </em>http://www.cu yahogacounty.us/en-US/InterimLocations.aspx (accessed Oct. 15, 2015). Lastly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>FitzGerald is no longer the county executive. http://executive.cuyahoga county .us /en-US/Budish-Takes-Oath-of-Office.aspx (accessed Oct. 15, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">{\u00b628} Thus, because FitzGerald is no longer the county executive, the key-card-swipe data are no longer security records, and because the old county administration building has been demolished, that data cannot disclose the configuration of its critical systems and are not infrastructure records.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 29} Release of FitzGerald\u2019s key-card-swipe data to the press also precludes the assertion that the data are excepted from disclosure pursuant to the public-records law. <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 126, 2002-Ohio-7041, 781 N.E.2d 163, \u00b6 22 (\u201cVoluntarily disclosing the requested record can waive any right to claim an exemption to disclosure\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc. v. Petro, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 261, 265, 685 N.E.2d 1223 (1997) (state auditor waived right to assert that records were exempt from disclosure partly because he made the records available to the public, represented to the relators that the records were public records, and orally described the records to a representative from the newspaper).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 30} Accordingly, FitzGerald\u2019s key-card-swipe data are public records, and the county has failed to demonstrate that they are exempt from disclosure pursuant to R.C. 149.433. Thus, we grant the requested writ of mandamus and order the release of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b355-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, Sadler, and Singer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b355-9\">Pfeifer, Lanzinger, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b355-10\">Lisa L.

Today the court revives a denied public-records request. I do not disagree with the court\u2019s determination that the records at issue are subject today to release as public records. Rather, I disagree with its determination that the court should issue a writ of mandamus to compel respondents to release documents based on a request that was previously properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">{\u00b6 32} The majority opinion boils down the three-part standard for granting a writ of mandamus to the simple statement that \u201c \u2018[m]andamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Majority opinion at \u00b6 19, quoting <em>State ex rel. Physicians Commt. for Responsible Medicine v. Ohio State Univ. Bd. of Trustees, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-903, 843 N.E.2d 174, \u00b6 6; R.C. 149.43(C)(1). As a common practice, this court has made this simple observation in public-records cases. <em>E.g., State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Bond, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 146, 2002-Ohio-7117, 781 N.E.2d 180, \u00b6 49. But in the normal course of reviewing a mandamus action, we traditionally conduct a three-part inquiry when considering whether to grant the writ: the relator must establish (1) a clear legal right to the requested relief, (2) a clear legal duty on the part of the respondent, and (3) the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>E.g., State ex rel. Simpson v. State Teachers Retirement Bd., </em>143 Ohio St.3d 307, 2015-Ohio-149, 37 N.E.3d 1176, \u00b6 17. We have held that the legislature, by enacting R.C. 149.43(C), made mandamus the only appropriate remedy for enforcing the public-records law. <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson, </em>70 Ohio St.3d 420, 426-427, 639 N.E.2d 83 (1994). Accordingly, we no longer reject petitions seeking an order compelling disclosure of public records on the basis that there is an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>Id. </em>Until today, we have not done away with the other two prongs of the mandamus standard in public-records cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 33} Through changed circumstances subsequent to respondents\u2019 denial of relator\u2019s request, relator has inarguably become entitled to the records at issue. The building in question no longer exists; the public official is no longer in office; and the security risk has gone away. In light of these new developments, what is respondents\u2019 duty with regard to the request? I would say they have none.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">{\u00b6 34} When any person requests public records, a public office must promptly prepare any records for inspection that are responsive to the request. R.C. 149.43(B)(1). The public office must also make copies of the requested records available at cost. <em>Id. </em>If some of the responsive records contain information that is exempt from inspection, the public office must still provide all of the nonexempt public records. <em>Id. </em>The public office must notify the requester of any redactions, and a redaction is treated as a denial of the public-records request. <em>Id. </em>If all or part of a request is denied, the public office shall provide an explanation for the denial with citations to legal authority. R.C. 149.43(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">{\u00b6 35} It is plain that respondents complied with these clear legal duties on July 11 and 31, 2014. At that time, the county provided the key-card-swipe data that relator was entitled to and provided an explanation for the partial denial. The majority readily agrees that the records withheld from relator were not subject to disclosure at that time. Majority at \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">{\u00b6 36} Respondents did not fail to perform any act that they had a duty to perform. There is no provision in the Revised Code requiring public offices to keep track of whether the circumstances that justified the denial of a public-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>records request subsequently change. Likewise, public offices are not required to act on their own initiative to revive denied requests, even if they may be compelled to grant new requests for the same records based on new circumstances.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AjL\">Law Firm of Curt C.

Murphy v. Graves, </em>91 Ohio St. 36, 38, 109 N.E. 590 (1914); <em>State ex rel. Ingerson v. Berry, </em>14 Ohio St. 315, 323 (1863) (\u201cDesigned only as a remedy to prevent the failure of <em>justice, </em>[mandamus] must not be made the minister of <em>injustice, </em>and the law does not require the performance of things which are either impossible or useless\u201d [emphasis sic]). Instead of showing reserve in the interest of doing only what justice demands, the majority stretches the law in this matter to vindicate relator\u2019s litigious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">{\u00b6 38} A proper public-records request was made. It was properly denied. Any action taken by anyone subsequent to that final denial is irrelevant, and the majority\u2019s focus on those acts obfuscates the question before us. Does the subsequent demolition of the building in question, the departure from office of the official involved, or the <em>Plain </em>Dealer\u2019s receipt of the records requested change anything for our legal analysis? No. The request was properly denied at the time, and respondents do not have a duty to examine old requests to determine whether the conditions that permitted denial of the request have subsequently changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 39} Therefore, I must dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b357-7\">Pfeifer and Lanzinger, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
