Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">{\u00b6 1} This contract dispute is a portion of ongoing litigation initiated by appellants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the governing boards of ten Cleveland community schools, commonly called \u201ccharter schools\u201d (collectively, \u201cthe schools\u201d). The defendants-appellees are private for-profit companies White Hat Management, L.L.C., and WHLS of Ohio, L.L.C., and ten subsidiary companies (collectively, \u201cthe companies\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that operated and managed the schools (collectively, \u201cWhite Hat\u201d), pursuant to contracts with each school. The State Board of Education was also named in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>complaint. The schools ask us to decide the ownership of personal property used by White Hat in the schools\u2019 daily operations. White Hat claims the right to retain the disputed property unless the schools make certain payments to the management companies as set forth in the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Although, as will be seen, the wisdom of the buy-back term can be questioned, we hold that the term is enforceable and that this case must be returned to the trial court for an inventory of the property and its disposition according to the contracts. We rule narrowly on the issues before us, leaving public-policy matters to the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">II. The Background of the Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">{\u00b6 3} As permitted by statute, <em>see </em>R.C. 3314.03, the governing authority of each school entered into an individual management agreement (collectively, \u201cthe contracts\u201d) in November 2005 with one of the ten named education-management organizations owned by White Hat. Each contract was substantially identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">{\u00b6 4} Under the contracts, White Hat was paid either 95 or 96 percent of the revenue-per-student funding that the school received from the state of Ohio Department of Education pursuant to R.C. Title 33 and other applicable statutes. This fixed amount, sometimes characterized as a per-pupil payment, was known in the contract as the \u201cContinuing Fee.\u201d In addition, all federal, state, and local government education grants were to be paid to White Hat.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">{\u00b6 5} In return, White Hat agreed to provide all functions relating to the provision of the White Hat educational model and the day-to-day management and operation of the schools. The schools retained the right to perform their own accounting, financial reporting, and audit functions, but White Hat was responsible for most other aspects of the operation of the schools, including providing a facility, meeting all staffing and academic needs, and purchasing all furniture, computers, books, and other equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">{\u00b6 6} The various management contracts ran from November 1, 2005, until June 30, 2007, and provided for automatic renewal thereafter for consecutive one-year terms through June 30, 2010, unless terminated for cause. The schools did not perform well under White Hat\u2019s management. Of the ten original schools, as of the 2010-2011 school year, two Hope Academies had been shut down by the Department of Education due to academic failure and three were on \u201cacademic watch\u201d; one of the Life Skills Centers was on academic watch and a second was on \u201cacademic emergency\u201d (one step away from shut-down). This poor performance caused the schools to raise several issues, including how White Hat spent the money it received to operate the schools. Financial information revealed that White Hat spent money to purchase buildings ultimately owned by or renovated for the benefit of its own affiliates. According to the schools, although White Hat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>used part of the continuing fee to purchase personal property for use in the schools, it improperly titled that property in its own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">{\u00b6 7} The governing authorities of the schools filed the instant lawsuit on May 17, 2010, after White Hat refused to provide further information concerning the use of allegedly public funds. The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, an accounting, and damages for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. As part of their allegations, the schools disputed White Hat\u2019s claim of entitlement to all property White Hat purchased using public funds. Specifically, the schools challenged the operation of Section 8.a.i of the contracts, which stated that the schools could retain personal property owned by White Hat after termination of the contracts only by \u201cpaying to [White Hat] an amount equal to the \u2018remaining cost\u2019 basis of the personal property on the date of termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">{\u00b6 8} After the action was filed, the parties executed a series of interim or \u201cstandstill\u201d management agreements, which permitted them to continue operations as if the contracts were still in effect. On February 21, 2012, the schools filed a motion for partial summary judgment, asking the court to declare the property rights of the parties under the terms of their contracts and applicable laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">{\u00b6 9} On May 11, 2012, the trial court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The court upheld the contract term that required the schools to pay Wfiiite Hat an amount equal to the \u201cremaining cost basis\u201d before obtaining the personal property titled in White Hat\u2019s name. It also upheld the schools\u2019 right to assume existing leases or to enter into new leases of facilities owned by WTiite Hat at fair market value.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court granted the schools\u2019 motion for a Civ.R. 54(B) certification and found that there was no just reason for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">{\u00b6 10} The schools appealed. The Tenth District Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment and held that the continuing fee paid to White Hat lost its nature as \u201cpublic funds\u201d once the funds came into Wfiiite Hat\u2019s possession and control. <em>Hope Academy Broadway Campus v. White Hat Mgt., L.L.C., </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 12AP-496, 2013-Ohio-5036, 4 N.E.3d 1087, \u00b6 24. The appellate court held that the contract was unambiguous and that it conferred on White Hat the authority to require the schools to buy back any personal property purchased by White Hat using the continuing fee. The court also stated that there was \u201cno formal general fiduciary duty created by the agreements that required White Hat to purchase and hold property for the schools\u2019 benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>III. Issues Before This Court</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">{\u00b6 11} We accepted the schools\u2019 appeal on three propositions of law, summarized as follows: (1) Public funds paid to a private entity exercising a governmental function, such as the operation of a community school, retain their character as public funds even after they are in the possession and control of the private entity; (2) When a private entity operating a community school uses funds designated by the Ohio Department of Education for the education of public-school students to purchase furniture, computers, software, equipment, and other personal property for the school, the private entity is acting as a purchasing agent and the property must be titled in the name of the community school; (3) A private entity that agrees to operate all functions of a community school has a fiduciary relationship with the community school. 138 Ohio St.3d 1448, 2014-Ohio-1182, 5 N.E.3d 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">{\u00b6 12} While we affirm that portion of the judgment of the court of appeals that upheld the buy-back provision as enforceable against the schools, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals on the issue of the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the parties. We hold that an entity that manages the daily operations of a community school pursuant to a contract with the school\u2019s governing authority is an \u201coperator\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 3314.02(A)(8)(a). We also hold that a management company that undertakes daily operation of a community school has a fiduciary relationship with the community school it operates. Because the management company of a community school is performing a traditional government function, that fiduciary relationship between the company and its community school is implicated when the company spends public funds to purchase personal property for use in the school it operates. We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Tenth District Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">IY. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">{\u00b6 13} A brief overview of relevant legislation is needed to place this dispute in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\n<em>Community-School Legislation: R.C. Chapter 8311</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">{\u00b6 14} Community-school legislation became effective in 1997 when the General Assembly enacted R.C. Chapter 3314, titled the Community Schools Act. Am.Sub. H.B. No. 215, 147 Ohio Laws, Part I, 909, 1187. The General Assembly declared that its purposes in enacting this chapter included \u201cproviding parents a choice of academic environments for their children and providing the education community with the opportunity to establish limited experimental educational programs in a deregulated setting.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Section 50.52, Subsection 2(B), 147 Ohio Laws, Part I, 2043.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>{\u00b6 15} We upheld the statutes as constitutional and held that community-schools are part of Ohio\u2019s public school system. <em>State ex rel. Ohio Congress of Parents &amp; Teachers v. State Bd. of </em>Edn., 111 Ohio St.3d 568, 2006-Ohio-5512, 857 N.E.2d 1148, syllabus, and \u00b6 32. <em>See also </em>R.C. 3314.01(B) (\u201cA community school created under this chapter is a public school * * * \u201d). We also recognized that educational policy decisions are within the purview of the General Assembly. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 73. Since its enactment, R.C. Chapter 3314 has been amended repeatedly. Yet, as this case shows, many aspects remain unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">{\u00b6 16} The legislation establishing community schools distinguishes among three types of entities: sponsors, governing authorities, and operators. These terms should be closely examined to more fully understand R.C. Chapter 3314.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\n<em>Sponsors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">{\u00b6 17} The community school operates under a contract with a \u201csponsor\u201d that monitors the school\u2019s performance according to state laws and regulations. R.C. 3314.02(A)(1) arid (C)(1); 3314.03(A)(4). A sponsor must first be approved and then monitored on its performance by the Ohio Department of Education. R.C. 3314.015(A)(2) and (3). It must enter into a detailed contract with the governing authority of the school, the required terms of which are set by statute. R.C. 3314.03(A)(1) through (26). The school must also submit to the sponsor a comprehensive plan for the school, R.C. 3314.03(B), which must specify certain details, such as internal financial controls and the process by which the governing authority\u2019s members will be selected in the future, R.C. 3314.03(B)(1) and (5). The sponsor must monitor the governing authority\u2019s compliance with its contract, evaluate the community school\u2019s academic and fiscal performance, and take action if the community school fails academically or financially. R.C. 3314.03(D)(1), (2), and (5). The sponsor may suspend the operation of a community school that does not comply with its contract. R.C. 3314.07(B)(1)(c). Sponsors may receive fees of up to 3 percent of total payments for operating expenses that the school receives from the state. R.C. 3314.03(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\n<em>Governing Authorities</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">{\u00b6 18} A community school itself must be organized as either a \u201cnonprofit corporation\u201d or a \u201cpublic benefit corporation\u201d depending on when it was established. R.C. 3314.03(A)(1). Each community school must have a \u201cgoverning authority,\u201d which shall consist of a board of no fewer than five individuals. R.C. 3314.03(A)(14); 3314.02(E)(1). Even though community schools are exempt from most of the state laws and regulations that apply to other public schools, <em>see </em>R.C. 3314.04, they are not free from oversight. The community school\u2019s governing authority must account to its sponsor for the school\u2019s performance, and the sponsor is, in turn, accountable to the Ohio Department of Education. <em>State ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>rel. Ohio Congress of Parents &amp; Teachers v. State Bd. of Edn., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 568, 2006-Ohio-5512, 857 N.E.2d 1148, at \u00b6 7. R.C. 3314.04 exempts community-schools from the rules governing boards of education set forth in R.C. Chapter 3313, but R.C. Chapter 3314 imposes its own duties and responsibilities on community schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\n<em>Operators</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">{\u00b6 19} A community school may contract \u201cfor any services necessary for the operation of the school.\u201d R.C. 3314.01(B). The governing authority of a community school has the option to hire an operator (usually a management company) to manage the day-to-day workings of the school. <em>See </em>R.C. 3314.02(A)(8)(a); 3314.026. An operator is an entity that is distinct from a sponsor. R.C. 3314.02(A)(1) (defining \u201csponsor\u201d) and 3314.02(A)(8) (defining \u201coperator\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">{\u00b6 20} In this ease, the schools contracted with White Hat for the daily management and operation of their community schools. Yet it remains a fact that operators, unlike sponsors and governing authorities, remain largely unregulated. R.C. 3314.02(A)(8) defines an \u201coperator\u201d as either (a) an individual or organization that manages a community school\u2019s daily operations pursuant to a contract with the school\u2019s governing authority or (b) a nonprofit organization that provides \u201cprogrammatic oversight and support\u201d to a community school pursuant to a contract with its governing authority. White Hat fits squarely within the first definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">{\u00b6 21} But although the statutes define what an operator is, R.C. Chapter 3314 is largely silent on an operator\u2019s duties and its status vis-\u00e1-vis a community school\u2019s governing authority and its sponsor. Although legislation has been introduced to further amend the Community Schools Act and to provide enhanced oversight, there are currently no specific requirements for the content of the contracts between the governing authority and an operator.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Most of the existing statutory references to an operator are nonsubstantive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While fees to <em>sponsors </em>are capped, R.C. 3314.03(C), there is no ceiling on the amount of funding that can be passed on to private operators such as White Hat. Indeed, the schools in this case transferred to White Hat nearly all of the taxpayer dollars they otherwise would have retained for the education of students.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>\n<em>Positions of the Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">{\u00b6 22} Now that their contracts have terminated, the parties dispute ownership of the personal property that was used in the schools\u2019 daily operations during the lives of the contracts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The schools argue that operating a community school for public-school students is a governmental function and that White Hat should be accountable for the public funds it received because these funds remained public even after they were transferred to White Hat\u2019s possession. The schools also contend that funds designated for educating public-school students must be used for the schools\u2019 benefit and that a private entity operating a community school has a fiduciary relationship with that school.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">{\u00b6 23} White Hat responds that the General Assembly has already provided for accountability by requiring White Hat to submit detailed financial accounts for inclusion in the community school\u2019s financial statements, which are subject to audit. R.C. 3314.024. White Hat argues that funds do not retain their public character after they have been received by the party being paid. White Hat also emphasizes that community-school legislation expressly contemplates that the parties will negotiate their respective duties and privileges in an enforceable contract and that its contracts state that the operator is an independent contractor rather than an agent or fiduciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">{\u00b6 24} We now examine the contract terms that relate to this dispute over personal property used in the schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\n<em>The Contract Language</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">{\u00b6 25} Section 2 of the contract sets out the services that White Hat must provide the schools. Subsection 2.b.i (subtitled \u201cEquipment\u201d) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">The Company [i.e., the relevant White Hat subsidiary-operator] shall purchase or lease all furniture, computers, software, equipment and other personal property necessary for the operation of the School. Additionally, <em>the Company shall purchase on behalf of the School </em>any furniture, computers, software, equipment, and other personal property <em>which, by the nature of the funding source, </em>must be titled in the School\u2019s name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">{\u00b6 26} Section 8 provides for payment of fees and defines the \u201ccontinuing fee\u201d as either 95 or 96 percent (depending on the school) \u201cof the revenue per student received by the School from the State of Ohio Department of Education\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>certain other payments paid to the school by government sources. Section 8.a.i then provides that all costs incurred in providing the White Hat educational model shall be paid by White Hat, including the cost of purchasing books, computers, equipment, and other property for use in the schools. The source of funds for those purchases is, of course, the continuing fee, i.e., public money. In the same subsection related to payment of costs, 8.i, the contract states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">It is understood that at the School\u2019s election, upon termination of this Agreement all personal property used in the operation of the School and owned by the Company or one of its affiliates and used in the operation of the School, other than proprietary materials owned by the Company, <em>may become the property of the School free and clear of all liens or other encumbrances upon the School paying to the Company an amount equal to the \u201cremaining cost basis\u201d of the personal property on the date of termination.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">{\u00b6 27} Section 12.c of each contract again refers to the schools\u2019 obligation to pay before they may receive title to personal property used to operate the schools:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">Equipment and Personal Property. On or before the Termination Date, and <em>after the payment of the \u201cremaining cost basis\u201d to be made by the School in accordance with Section 8(a), herein </em>the Company shall transfer title to the School, or assign to the School the leases (to the extent such leases are assignable), for any and all computers, software, office equipment, furniture and personal property used to operate the School, other than the Company\u2019s proprietary materials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">{\u00b6 28} The schools maintain that the contract cannot be interpreted to require them, upon termination of the contract, to buy back the personal property used in the schools\u2019 operation. The schools point to the phrase from Section 2.b.i: \u201cthe Company shall purchase on behalf of the School any * * * personal property <em>which, by the nature of the funding source, </em>must be titled in the School\u2019s name.\u201d When the nature of the funding source is public, title of the property must reside in the schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">{\u00b6 29} White Hat counters that this interpretation renders meaningless the contractual requirement that White Hat purchase the personal property. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>claims that the funding source referred to was \u201cusually a grant,\u201d which requires the property to be titled in the schools\u2019 name.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">{\u00b6 30} But nothing in the contract defines the \u201cnature of the funding source\u201d or clarifies when the nature of the funding source requires that the schools have title to the purchased property. The provision creates a certain amount of uncertainty on the issue of who owns the personal property used in the schools after the contracts have terminated. Did the funds used to purchase the personal property lose their public character once transferred to White Hat, a private entity?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\n<em>Public Funds Paid to Private Entities</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">{\u00b6 31} In its first proposition of law, the schools seek a broad statement that public funds retain their character even after being paid to a private entity. R.C. 117.01(C) states that \u201cpublic money\u201d means \u201cany money received, collected by, or due a public official under color of office, as well as any money collected by any individual on behalf of a public office or as a purported representative or agent of the public office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">{\u00b6 32} Community schools are public schools. R.C. 3314.01(B); <em>Cordray v. Internatl. Preparatory School, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 50, 2010-Ohio-6136, 941 N.E.2d 1170, \u00b6 24. And as an entity established by the laws of this state for the exercise of a function of government, namely education, a community school is a public office. <em>Id.; </em>R.C. 117.01(D). We outlined the framework for determining \u201cpublic official\u201d status in <em>Cordray, </em>in which we decided that the treasurer of a community school was a public official obligated to account for and disburse public funds. We explained that a \u201cpublic official\u201d is \u201c \u2018any officer, employee, or duly authorized representative or agent of a public office.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19, quoting R.C. 117.01(E). We then confirmed that any \u201cduly authorized representative or agent\u201d of a community school, therefore, is a \u201cpublic official.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">{\u00b6 33} The public funds received by a community school from the Department of Education are \u201creceived or collected\u201d under color of office. <em>Cordray, </em>\u00b6 27. When those funds are transferred directly to an operator, they are also public funds \u201creceived or collected\u201d under color of office to the extent that those funds are used to perform a governmental function. While we cannot broadly hold that public funds always retain their status as public funds, a private entity such as White Hat engaged in the business of education is accountable for the manner in which it uses public funds. Free public education, whether provided by public or private actors, is historically an exclusively governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">{\u00b6 34} The contracts contemplate that funds designated by the Ohio Department of Education for the education of public-school students will be used for the benefit of public schools and not their private operators. The personal property at issue in this case, which includes furniture, computers, software, and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>equipment, is essential for the schools to carry out the governmental function of providing an education to Ohio\u2019s children. The notion that .the schools would knowingly transfer their funds to White Hat for White Hat to purchase the property for itself (and then later require the schools to buy the property back with additional public funds) does not seem supportable but was an agreed-upon term.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">{\u00b6 35} We interpret the contract between the schools and White Hat as we interpret contracts between individuals, \u201c \u2018with a view to ascertaining the intention of the parties and to give it effect accordingly, if that can be done consistently with the terms of the instrument.\u2019 \u201d <em>S &amp; M Constructors, Inc. v. Columbus, </em>70 Ohio St.2d 69, 71, 434 N.E.2d 1349 (1982), quoting <em>Hollerbach v. United States, </em>233 U.S. 165, 171-172, 34 S.Ct. 553, 58 L.Ed. 898 (1914). We have consistently explained that parties may contract for the terms they want and that the \u201cintent of the parties is presumed to reside in the language they chose to use in their agreement.\u201d <em>Graham v. Drydock Coal Co., </em>76 Ohio St.3d 311, 313, 667 N.E.2d 949 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">{\u00b6 36} Common words in a contract are given their plain and ordinary meaning, unless another meaning is clearly evident from the face or overall content of the contract, or unless the result is manifestly absurd. <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co., </em>53 Ohio St.2d 241, 374 N.E.2d 146 (1978), paragraph two of the syllabus. Courts apply clear and unambiguous contract provisions without regard to the relative advantages gained or hardships suffered by the parties. <em>Dugan &amp; Meyers Constr. Co., Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Adm. Servs., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 226, 2007-Ohio-1687, 864 N.E.2d 68, \u00b6 29, quoting <em>Ohio Crane Co. v. Hicks, </em>110 Ohio St. 168, 172, 143 N.E. 388 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cIt is not the responsibility or function of this court to rewrite the parties\u2019 contract in order to provide for a more equitable result. A contract \u2018does not become ambiguous by reason of the fact that in its operation it will work a hardship upon one of the parties thereto.\u2019 \u201d <em>Foster Wheeler Enviresponse, Inc. v. Franklin Cty. Convention Facilities Auth., </em>78 Ohio St.3d 353, 362, 678 N.E.2d 519 (1997), quoting <em>Ohio Crane Co. </em>at 172. Unless there is \u201c \u2018fraud or other unlawfulness involved, courts are powerless to save a competent person from the effects of his own voluntary agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dugan &amp; Meyers </em>at \u00b6 29, quoting <em>Ullmann v. May, </em>147 Ohio St. 468, 476, 72 N.E.2d 63 (1947). The schools have not argued that the contracts were unconscionable, and we will not address issues not argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">{\u00b6 38} The schools were represented by their own legal counsel, and they agreed to the provisions in the contracts. They may not rewrite terms simply because they now seem unfair. The contracts call for White Hat to title property in the schools\u2019 name in one situation: \u201cthe Company shall purchase on behalf of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the School any furniture, computers, software, equipment, and other personal property which, by the nature of the funding source, must be titled in the School\u2019s name.\u201d Section 2.b.l. At the same time, the \u201cproperty purchased by the School shall continue to be owned by the School.\u201d Section 8.a.ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">{\u00b6 39} So, if the nature of the funding source was such that White Hat was required to purchase the personal property in the schools\u2019 names, that property belongs to the schools outright. But the contracts require additional payment from the schools if they wish to obtain the other personal property that White Hat purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\n<em>White Hat as a Fiduciary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">{\u00b6 40} The schools contend that they should not have to pay anything to White Hat for the contested personal property, claiming that in agreeing to undertake the operation of the schools, White Hat assumed a fiduciary relationship to the schools. They urge that the broad authority conferred on White Hat by the contracts to act in key matters on behalf of the schools and its control of all functions of the schools\u2019 day-to-day operations created a duty to act primarily for the benefit of the schools. The complaint alleges that the operators failed to account for the use of public funds. The complaint also alleges that White Hat improperly used public funds for other than educational purposes in violation of its fiduciary duty. White Hat, on the other hand, insists that the operators do not owe fiduciary duties, because they are not public officials. White Hat bases this argument on Section 14 of the contracts, which states that \u201c[t]he parties hereby acknowledge that their relationship is that of an independent contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">{\u00b6 41} We first note that the parties\u2019 characterization of their relationship in the contracts is not controlling. Restatement of Agency 3d, Section 1.02; <em>see N &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lindley, </em>56 Ohio St.2d 415, 417, 384 N.E.2d 704 (1978), fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">{\u00b6 42} The contract between the schools and White Hat makes the operator the authorized representative of the community schools that it operates, for purposes of hiring, training, supervising, and firing staff, selecting a curriculum, purchasing equipment, maintaining academic standards, and monitoring student performance, either under the direction of the schools or subject to their approval. Clearly, pursuant to the contracts, White Hat is the \u201cduly authorized representative\u201d for the schools in a broad range of functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">{\u00b6 43} We have defined the term \u201cfiduciary relationship\u201d as one \u201cin which special confidence and trust is reposed in the integrity and fidelity of another and there is a resulting position of superiority or influence, acquired by virtue of this special trust.\u201d <em>In re Termination of Emp. of Pratt, </em>40 Ohio St.2d 107, 115, 321 N.E.2d 603 (1974). In determining whether a fiduciary relationship has been created, the main question is whether a party agreed to act primarily for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>benefit of another in matters connected with its undertaking. <em>Strock v. Pressnell, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 207, 216, 527 N.E.2d 1235 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">{\u00b6 44} In a recent and analogous case, a federal district court in Missouri held that a fiduciary relationship existed between a charter school\u2019s board and its operator. <em>Renaissance Academy for Math &amp; Science of Missouri, Inc. v. Imagine Schools, Inc., </em>W.D.Mo. No. 4:13-CV-00645-NKL, 2014 WL 7267033 (Dec. 18, 2014). Applying that state\u2019s test for determining the existence of a fiduciary duty, the court concluded that a fiduciary relationship existed between the charter school and its operator. The court so held because under the terms of the operating agreement, the charter school\u2019s board was required to give the operator virtually all money and property that the board received from taxpayers. <em>Id. </em>at *3. And without the board\u2019s initial receipt of the money, the operator would not have had access to those funds. <em>Id. </em>The court found that the board placed its trust and confidence in its operator to create a successful learning environment and to manage the school\u2019s operations. In short, the operator took over the de facto persona of the school\u2019s governing authority. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">{\u00b6 45} Similarly, under Section 2 of the contracts, White Hat assumed broad authority, contracting with the schools to perform \u201call functions relating to the provision of the [relevant] Educational Model and the management and operation of the School in accordance with the terms of the Contract,\u201d except for certain financial functions. Section 2.b.i. of the contracts makes the operators the purchasing agent for the schools in certain situations, authorizing the operators to make purchases \u201con behalf of\u2019 the schools and to title property in the schools\u2019 names. Certain crucial functions, such as staffing levels, recordkeeping, teacher training, and hiring and firing teachers, are entrusted to White Hat. White Hat agreed to act on behalf of the schools to help them carry out their purpose as outlined in R.C. Chapter 3314. White Hat\u2019s purpose, reflected in the contracts, was to advance the schools\u2019 interests. The schools contracted with White Hat to operate \u201call functions\u201d of their day-to-day operations. It is evident that the schools have granted broad discretion to White Hat, placing special confidence and trust in the management companies and placing them in positions of superiority and influence. These are hallmarks of a fiduciary relationship. <em>See Pratt </em>at 115; <em>Groob v. KeyBank, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 348, 2006-Ohio-1189, 843 N.E.2d 1170, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">{\u00b6 46} While it appears that a fiduciary relationship was created by the conduct of the parties, we cannot say whether a fiduciary duty was breached based on the record before us. The issue of unconscionability also invites further exploration in this case, but we may not consider issues not properly raised before us. The legislature has enacted statutes that take a laissez-faire attitude toward operators of community schools. We leave it to the General Assembly to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>whether public policy requires stiffening of the regulatory scheme governing these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Y. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">{\u00b6 47} We hold that an entity that manages the daily operations of a community school pursuant to a contract with the school\u2019s governing authority is an \u201coperator\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 3314.02(A)(8)(a). We further hold that a management company that undertakes the daily operation of a community school has a fiduciary relationship with the community school that it operates. That fiduciary relationship between an operator and its community school is implicated when the company uses public funds to purchase personal property for use in the school that it operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 48} We therefore affirm the judgment of the Tenth District Court of Appeals to the extent that it held that the buy-back provision of the contracts was enforceable and that the schools are obliged under that provision to pay for the personal property purchased by White Hat as described in the contract. We reverse the portion of the judgment of the Tenth District Court of Appeals on the issue of the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the parties. This case is remanded to the trial court for an inventory of the property and its disposition according to the contract terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b298-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Wise, J., concur in syllabus and judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b298-9\">Kennedy and French, JJ., concur in judgment in part and dissent in part and concur in paragraph one of the syllabus.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b298-10\">O\u2019Neill, J., concurs in the syllabus but dissents from the opinion and judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b298-11\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b298-12\">John W.

I agree with paragraph one of the syllabus, which merely reiterates R.C. 3314.02(A)(8)(a)\u2019s definition of \u201coperator\u201d as an \u201corganization * * * that manages the daily operations of a community school pursuant to a contract between the operator and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>school\u2019s governing authority.\u201d I also concur in the judgment to the extent that it affirms the judgment of the court of appeals. I disagree with paragraphs two and three of the syllabus and dissent from the part of the judgment reversing the judgment of the court of appeals, although it is unclear what part of the judgment it reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">{\u00b6 50} Also, because I believe that a discussion of agency is central to the analysis, I would address the second proposition of law. Finally, I reject the dicta of the opinion asserting that independent contractors can be fiduciaries without any agreement to that effect. This dicta contradicts settled law and appears to be without legal significance here. Also, as a factual matter, I do not believe that ordering an inventory is required because under the contract, the parties titled the personal property upon purchase, and there is no dispute about what is titled to whom. I would affirm the judgment and adopt the reasoning of the court of appeals in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">{\u00b6 51} While I agree with the recitation of the facts in the lead opinion as far as it goes, I note that the opinion pays scant attention to the sole focus of this dispute, which is the comprehensive nature of the contract between the parties. By ignoring the contract\u2019s sweep, the lead opinion conflates the roles of the Hope Academy and Life Skills schools (collectively, \u201cHope Academy\u201d), who are the schools\u2019 governing boards, and the White Hat Management companies, who, by explicit agreement, operate as independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">{\u00b6 52} The terms of that agreement are not in dispute. The contracts state that the Hope Academy governing boards are subcontracting all day-to-day management of the schools to the White Hat companies, leaving the governing boards no control over management. Section 14 of the agreement, identified as \u201cRelationship of the Parties,\u201d states, \u201cThe parties hereto acknowledge that their relationship is that of an independent contractor. No employee of either party shall be deemed an employee of the other party. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to create a partnership or joint venture between the parties.\u201d In Section 2, the parties agree that Hope Academy will divest itself of control over school management \u201cto the extent permitted by law.\u201d White Hat agrees to provide \u201call functions relating to the provision of the HOPE Academy Educational Model and the management and operation of the School * * * except for the School accounting, financial reporting and audit functions which will be performed by the designated fiscal officer hired by the Board.\u201d This language, as well as the rest of the contract, reveals that White Hat was granted full responsibility to implement Hope Academy\u2019s educational approach using White Hat\u2019s own expertise to educate students to the satisfaction of the governing board and its sponsors. Hope Academy explicitly subcontracted all management authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>over the educational operations of its schools to White Hat, as allowed by R.C. 3314.01(B), reserving no control. Only a fiscal officer, as required by R.C. 3314.011, comes under Hope Academy\u2019s direct authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">{\u00b6 53} However, while Hope Academy subcontracted the school\u2019s management to White Hat, the Revised Code does not authorize contracting out financial responsibility to the management company. The parties\u2019 contract, as well as R.C. 3314.011 and 3314.024, requires that financial oversight remains with the sponsors or governing board. For example, management companies, such as White Hat, providing services costing more than 20 percent of the school\u2019s gross annual revenues must \u201cprovide a detailed accounting including the nature and costs of the services it provides to the community school.\u201d R.C. 3314.024. And the school\u2019s sponsor, not an independent contractor, must make sure, through contracts executed with its governing board, that its schools comply with a broad array of state education laws to ensure effectiveness, including teacher licensing and academic and financial accountability. R.C. 3314.029(A)(1)(f), (g), (h), and (i) and 3314.03(A)(3), (4), (5), (8), (10), and (11). The law requires transparency. Every contract between a sponsor and a governing board is filed with the state superintendent of public instruction and is available to the public on the Department of Education\u2019s website. R.C. 3314.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">{\u00b6 54} The duties that White Hat undertook were comprehensive. The 16-page contract delegates all the governing board\u2019s day-to-day management duties to White Hat, including acquiring buildings, technology, and insurance, complying with all governmental requirements, and hiring and managing personnel. White Hat, not the governing board, covers the entire payroll, and the personnel are employees of White Hat. As with any other school, and as the parties agreed, operating the school required almost the full amount of government dollars allocated to the governing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">{\u00b6 55} The lead opinion suggests nefariousness when it asserts that the schools \u201ctransferred to White Hat nearly all of the taxpayer dollars they otherwise would have retained for the education of students.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21. In fact, the Revised Code places limits only on the amount of money that <em>sponsors </em>may retain. \u201cThe total amount of * * * payments [to the sponsor] for oversight and monitoring of the school shall not exceed three percent\u201d of revenues for operating expenses. R.C. 3314.03(C). In contrast, the Revised Code authorizes the schools to contract for services in exchange for fees, R.C. 3314.01(B), but does not limit the amounts that governing boards may pay to management companies. However, the governing boards\u2019 resources are limited by statute. R.C. 3314.08(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">{\u00b6 56} To be completely accurate, the governing board transferred to Wfiiite Hat not only money but also responsibilities, expenses, and risk. The parties did so specifically \u201cto implement the HOPE Academy Educational Model,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Hope Academy apparently devised but did not have the expertise or resources to implement. Contrary to the innuendo of the lead opinion, the parties\u2019 agreement did not diminish the amount of funds dedicated to \u201cthe education of students\u201d because Hope Academy did not retain any responsibility for educating students.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">{\u00b6 57} The only issue now is whether that part of the contract between the parties addressing ownership of property is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">{\u00b6 58} A complete recitation of the propositions of law will bring these matters into sharper focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Proposition of Law I</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">{\u00b6 59} Proposition of law I, which was not presented to the court of appeals as an assignment of error, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">Public funds paid to a private entity exercising a government function, such as the operation of a community school, retain their character as public funds even after they are in the possession and control of the private entity. Although the private entity may earn a profit out of the public funds, such profit is earned only after the private entity has fully discharged its contractual, statutory, and fiduciary obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">{\u00b6 60} As a preliminary matter, I do not take the second sentence of this or the third proposition to suggest that our holding must apply uniquely to for-profit entities. The lead opinion should make clear that funds transferred pursuant to a valid contract are earned according to the terms of that contract, regardless of whether the contracting entities operate for profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">{\u00b6 61} Otherwise, the proposition is easily rejected. <em>State ex rel. Oriana House, Inc. v. Montgomery, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 419, 2006-Ohio-1325, 844 N.E.2d 323, cited by Hope Academy, does not support its position. That case merely holds that the state auditor may audit private entities receiving public funds. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 1, 27. It does not hold that a private company can never retain property titled in its name when the property is- purchased with public funds. <em>Oriana House </em>does state that \u201c[individuals or entities have a duty to account for their handling of those funds,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 13, but accountability is not the issue here. At most, <em>Oriana House </em>can be cited for the proposition that when a private entity receives public funds to perform a government function, it is <em>subject to audit </em>by the state auditor. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 15. White Hat acknowledges that it is subject to audit under R.C. 3314.024 and that it has, in fact, been audited.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">{\u00b6 62} In addition, Hope Academy cites no binding authority that actually supports its statement that public funds do not automatically lose their public character when they are transferred to a private entity. By contrast, White Hat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>cites authority very much on point. In <em>State ex rel. Yovich v. Cuyahoga Falls City School Dist Bd. of Edn., </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 91AP-1325, 1992 WL 142263, *2 (June 23, 1992), the court held that public funds \u201clost their chief characteristic of \u2018public funds\u2019 once the funds came into possession and control of * * * a private entity.\u201d The funds here, like those in <em>Yovieh, </em>were initially public, but were used by a public entity to pay a private entity for services rendered to a school, and the private entity used those funds to pay the persons actually rendering the service. And like the funds in <em>Yovieh, </em>the funds in this case were spent by a private corporation \u201cwhose funds were not controlled or held by\u201d the public entity. <em>Id. </em>The court in <em>Yovieh </em>then \u201crejected] the contention that [the provider of the service] was paid with public funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hope Academy offers nothing persuasive in support of a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">{\u00b6 63} The lead opinion invokes <em>Cordray v. Internatl. Preparatory School, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 50, 2010-Ohio-6136, 941 N.E.2d 1170, \u00b6 25, to claim that White Hat was receiving public funds from Hope Academy \u201cunder color of office.\u201d Therefore, according to the majority, the buy-back pi-ovision of the contract \u201cdoes not seem supportable,\u201d although it was \u201can agreed-upon term.\u201d Opinion at \u00b6 34. However, as recited above, Hope Academy has its own fiscal officers, and White Hat and Hope Academy agreed that White Hat is an independent contractor. Nor, as I discuss under the next proposition of law, does White Hat fit the legal definition of \u201cagent\u201d for the schools. Therefore, White Hat cannot be receiving public funds \u201cunder color of office\u201d in any way that would put the legitimacy of the contract into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">{\u00b6 64} Notwithstanding my concerns about the lead opinion\u2019s analysis of the first proposition of law, I concur in its ultimate holding that the parties legitimately agreed that White Hat would own all property that it purchased with the money that Hope Academy provided as the continuing fee. As the lead opinion concludes, the contract is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Proposition of Law II</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">{\u00b6 65} The lead opinion does not address Hope Academy\u2019s second proposition of law, but it is central to a full analysis of whether <em>Cordray </em>is relevant. Therefore, it should be addressed. Proposition of law II reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">When a private entity uses funds designated by the Ohio Department of Education for the education of public-school students to purchase furniture, computers, software, equipment, and other personal property to operate a community school, the private entity is acting as a purchasing agent and the property must be titled in the name of the community school.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>{\u00b6 66} I note first that this proposition applies only to property that White Hat bought with the continuing fee. White Hat essentially concedes that it operated as a purchasing agent when it used grant money to purchase property that had to be titled in the schools\u2019 name.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">{\u00b6 67} I begin with longstanding tenets of principal-agency law. First, a principal-agency relationship is created by agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">(1) Agency is the fiduciary relation which results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control, and consent by the other so to act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">(2) The one for whom action is to be taken is the principal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">(3) The one who is to act is the agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Restatement of the Law 2d, Agency, Section 1 (1958). However, the parties agreed in their contract that White Hat was an independent contractor. An \u201cindependent contractor\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">An independent contractor is a person who contracts with another to do something for him but who is not controlled by the other nor subject to the other\u2019s right to control with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the undertaking. <em>He may or may not be an agent.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">(Emphasis added.) Restatement of Agency, Section 2(3). <em>See also Soberay Mach. &amp; Equip. Co. v. MRF Ltd., Inc., </em>181 F.3d 759, 767 (6th Cir.1999) (\u201c[ujnder the Restatement (Second) of Agency, which Ohio has adopted, an independent contractor may also be an agent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">{\u00b6 68} To determine whether White Hat, an independent contractor, is also an agent, we must apply the test of <em>Councell v. Douglas, </em>163 Ohio St. 292, 126 N.E.2d 597 (1955), paragraph one of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-13\">The relationship of principal and agent or master and servant is distinguished from the relationship of employer and independent contractor by the following test: Did the employer retain control of, or the right to control, the mode and manner of doing the work contracted for? If he did, the relationship is that of principal and agent or master and servant. If he did not but is interested merely in the ultimate result to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>accomplished, the relationship is that of employer and independent contractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">{\u00b6 69} Review of the contract clearly shows that the governing boards conferred on the White Hat companies \u201call functions\u201d relating to management of the schools, leaving the governing boards no control over management. The motive was to implement Hope Academy\u2019s educational model. However, as stated above, Hope Academy wanted no responsibility for or control over the implementation. It contracted, \u201cto the extent permitted by law, * * * all functions relating to the provision of the HOPE Academy Educational Model and the management and operation of the School\u201d except for fiscal matters. This language, as well as the rest of the contract, reveals that White Hat was retained to implement Hope Academy\u2019s educational approach as it saw fit. Hope Academy\u2019s interest was the \u201cultimate result to be accomplished,\u201d i.e., properly educating children, while subcontracting control to White Hat. Under Ohio law, then, White Hat is an independent contractor and not an agent of the governing boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Proposition of Law III</p>\n<p id=\"AUEr\">{\u00b6 70} Proposition of law III reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">A private entity that agrees to operate all functions of a community school has a fiduciary relationship with the community school. Although the private entity may earn a profit for the services it provides, it must act primarily for the benefit of the community school.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">{\u00b6 71} All contracts contain an implied duty of good faith. <em>Ed Schory &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Soc. Natl. Bank, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 433, 443, 662 N.E.2d 1074 (1996). However, \u201c[a] \u2018fiduciary relationship\u2019 is one in which special confidence and trust is reposed in the integrity and fidelity of another and there is a resulting position of superiority or influence, acquired by virtue of this special trust.\u201d <em>In re Termination of Emp. of Pratt, </em>40 Ohio St.2d 107, 115, 321 N.E.2d 603 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">{\u00b6 72} First, I emphatically disagree with the assertion that a fiduciary duty exists between the parties here. Paragraphs two and three of the syllabus are especially confusing because they are wholly dicta, with no identified relevance to this case and therefore with uncertain application in the future. I would note that the lead opinion\u2019s rationale actually suggests that it is Hope Academy who violated its fiduciary duty to the citizens of Ohio by foolishly subcontracting its educational duties to White Hat.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>{\u00b6 73} The black-letter law on fiduciary relationships also contradicts the third proposition of law. First, fiduciary relationships are established by agreement. The agreement here identified White Hat as an independent contractor. \u201cUnder Ohio law, there is generally no fiduciary relationship between an independent contractor and his employer unless both parties understand that the relationship is one of special trust and confidence.\u201d <em>Schulman v. Wolske &amp; Blue Co., L.P.A., </em>125 Ohio App.3d 365, 372, 708 N.E.2d 753 (10th Dist.1998). No evidence exists here that a special relationship was understood, and the parties\u2019 written agreement demonstrates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">{\u00b6 74} Furthermore, a fiduciary relationship cannot be created by the principal alone. \u201cA fiduciary relationship need not be created by contract; it may arise out of an informal relationship where <em>both parties understand that a special trust or confidence has been reposed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Stone v. Davis, </em>66 Ohio St.2d 74, 78, 419 N.E.2d 1094 (1981). Hope Academy does not identify any agreement that a fiduciary relationship was established either in the written contract or by mutual understanding, and neither does the lead opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">{\u00b6 75} Finally, <em>Renaissance Academy for Math &amp; Science of Missouri, Inc. v. Imagine Schools, Inc., </em>W.D.Mo. No. 4:13-CV-00645-NKL, 2014 WL 7267033 (Dec. 18, 2014), does not support the lead opinion\u2019s theory. In <em>Renaissance, </em>a judge determined, after a week-long trial, that under the extremely unusual facts of that case, the charter-school management company had had a fiduciary relationship with the charter school. To reach this conclusion, the judge applied the five-factor test under Missouri law for fiduciary relationships. The first factor requires showing one dominant and one subservient mind \u201cas a result of age, state of health, illiteracy, mental disability, or ignorance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">{\u00b6 76} The evidence before the judge showed that the members of the governing board were \u201cnot qualified to run a charter school,\u201d that they were \u201cweak and confused,\u201d and that in fact, the management company had recruited those very board members because they were weak and pliable rather than independent and dominant. <em>Id. </em>at *2. The management company obstructed the board\u2019s access to the information it needed, pressured and manipulated the board members, and exerted such complete control over the board that there was a \u201csurrender of independence\u201d by the board. <em>Id. </em>at *3. The judgment was not appealed. <em>Renaissance </em>does not stand for the assertion that operators are always fiduciaries, and no one is claiming that Hope Academy is weak, incompetent, or submissive to White Hat to the point of surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">{\u00b6 77} For the above reasons, I respectfully concur in the lead opinion only to the extent that it affirms the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b305-9\">French, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQL\">concurring in syllabus and dissenting from opinion and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">{\u00b6 78} I concur that a management company has a fiduciary relationship with a community school when it undertakes the daily operation of a community school. However, I dissent from the decision to uphold the contract, as it violates public policy and is unenforceable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">{\u00b6 79} Simply stated, defendant White Hat Management, L.L.C., voluntarily signed a contract that bound it as a fiduciary to two distinct entities: the taxpayers of the state of Ohio and the parents of the children who attend the community schools operated by White Hat. By contract, White Hat promised to safeguard and effectively utilize $90 million of public funds that were specifically set aside to educate the children of Ohio. And by contract, White Hat promised the children of Hope Academy that it, White Hat, would fulfill its fiduciary duty by providing a quality education for the sum of $90 million. The only part of that contract that was fulfilled was that White Hat thoroughly and efficiently received the $90 million. There has been no quality education, there has been no safeguarding of public funds, and there most certainly has been no benefit to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">{\u00b6 80} It is presumed that there are good community schools. These White Hat schools are not in that category. The record is clear: White Hat provides substandard service for outrageous fees in the name of profit. The schools in this case received more than $90 million in public money from 2007 to 2010. And their performance level as attested to by the state was consistently poor. Indeed, only two of the ten schools performed satisfactorily under state standards during that time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">{\u00b6 81} Against this backdrop of failed promises and termination for failure to deliver, a majority of this court intends to reward White Hat with the termination bonus that White Hat arranged for itself in the contract. Neither public policy nor contract law can ever be stretched far enough to reach that preordained result.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">{\u00b6 82} As the lead opinion correctly concludes, the relationship between White Hat and the schools has the legal hallmarks of a fiduciary relationship. \u201c <em>\u2018A </em>\u201cfiduciary relationship\u201d is one in which special confidence and trust is reposed in the integrity and fidelity of another and there is a resulting position of superiority or influence, acquired by virtue of this special trust.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stone v. Davis, </em>66 Ohio St.2d 74, 79, 419 N.E.2d 1094 (1981), quoting <em>In re Termination of Emp. of Pratt, </em>40 Ohio St.2d 107, 115, 321 N.E.2d 603 (1974). As stated in the opinion, \u201cWhite Hat agreed to act on behalf of the schools to help them carry out their purpose as outlined in R.C. Chapter 3314. White Hat\u2019s purpose, reflected in the contracts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>was to advance the schools\u2019 interests.\u201d Lead opinion at \u00b6 45. White Hat was responsible for the day-to-day operation of the schools. Under the contract, White Hat was responsible for providing the training and curriculum, hiring and firing staff, purchasing the equipment, and maintaining academic standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">{\u00b6 83} Under what circumstances would it be permissible for a fiduciary to convert the assets of its principal to its own use? None. Under what circumstances would it be permissible to allow a trustee to award the corpus of the trust to itself? None. Yet the lead opinion concludes that \u201c[w]hile it appears that a fiduciary relationship was created by the conduct of the parties, we cannot say whether a fiduciary duty was breached based on the record before us.\u201d Lead opinion at \u00b6 46. And then, feigning powerlessness, the opinion rewards White Hat with the spoils not of its victory, but of its failure, all under the guise of contract law. This is not an enforceable contract. It is a fraudulent conversion of public funds into personal profit. That is not the relationship that was bargained for, and it is not one that this court can magically create to protect the profits of White Hat.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">{\u00b6 84} Under the contract, the schools were required to turn over nearly 96 percent of the public funds that they received from the state to White Hat. It is to be remembered that if that same amount of money had gone to a traditional public school rather than a community school, it would be inconceivable to suggest that anyone would be entitled to walk away with everything purchased using those public funds. And let\u2019s be clear here. If this contract did not exist, these public funds would remain in the public-school system, which would have then been required to have its performance monitored by the state and evaluated on an annual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">{\u00b6 85} It is irrelevant how White Hat chooses to characterize the funds received. The fact is that the money financing community schools \u2014 -whether general revenue funds or grant funds \u2014 qualifies as public money under the definition in R.C. 117.01(C). This public money was used to purchase public property to educate children. The public money used to purchase the school equipment did not magically become private money simply because it was disbursed by White Hat. Indeed, because White Hat was a duly authorized representative of the schools, it was acting as a public official. <em>See Cordray v. Internatl. Preparatory School, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 50, 2010-Ohio-6136, 941 N.E.2d 1170, at \u00b6 12, quoting <em>Crane Twp. ex rel. Stalter v. Secoy, </em>103 Ohio St. 258, 259-260, 132 N.E. 851 (1921). Regardless of what the contract says, whether it is ambiguous or foolishly entered into,' the only way to interpret this contract to permit White Hat to keep public-school property as its own is to essentially disregard the law of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">{\u00b6 86} The lead opinion is absolutely correct. This contract does indeed permit an operator who is providing a substandard education to squander public money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>and then, upon termination for poor performance, reap a bonus, paid for by public money. And that is why this contract is unenforceable as a matter of public policy and contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">{\u00b6 87} The Ohio General Assembly has unequivocally stated that public money means any money received or collected by or on behalf of a public office or representative of a public office. R.C. 117.01(C). The Ohio General Assembly has also unequivocally stated that community schools are public schools. R.C. 3314.01(B). And this court has held that a duly authorized representative of a community school is a public official and may be held <em>strictly liable to the state for the loss of public funds. Cordray </em>at \u00b6 1. This court has also held that public property and public money in the hands of or under the control of public officials constitutes a trust fund, for which the official as a trustee should be held responsible to the same degree as the trustee of a private trust. <em>Crane Twp. </em>at 259-260. It simply cannot be disputed that White Hat has voluntarily become a public entity distributing public funds on behalf of the taxpayers of Ohio. It is axiomatic that one who becomes a steward of public funds also becomes the guardian of those same funds. Certainly the court majority would not countenance the prospect of $90 million being placed in front of a fan on the ledge of an open window. While from an educational standpoint the result would be the same, the waste of public funds in any instance cannot be woven into the fabric of Ohio public policy. Finally, this court has held that contracts that bring about results that the law seeks to prevent are unenforceable as being against public policy. <em>Cincinnati City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Conners, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 468, 2012-Ohio-2447, 974 N.E.2d 78, \u00b6 17. This has been the law of Ohio until today. Until now, the public interest was not something that could be subverted or contracted away. In refusing to apply the law in this case, the opinion invalidates an extensive body of law designed to safeguard the public purse and the public interest. The failure of White Hat to properly educate these children is an outrage. Today\u2019s opinion adds insult to that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">{\u00b6 88} In all the pages of the record in this case, it remains unclear how much of the public property of the failed schools White Hat believes it owns. Under the law it owns none. It is unfortunate, in the truest sense of the word, that these schools contracted with such a poor steward of our precious resources \u2014 our children and our tax dollars.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For that choice, the state has already paid dearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>once. Refusing to uphold the buy-back provision of this contract is neither judicial activism nor rewriting the parties\u2019 contract in order to provide a more equitable result. Rather, it is the application of existing statutes and Supreme Court of Ohio case law to prevent theft of public property. While freedom to contract is \u201cas fundamental to our society as the right to write and speak without restraint,\u201d it is not unlimited. <em>Nottingdale Homeowners\u2019 Assn., Inc. v. Darby, </em>33 Ohio St.3d 32, 36, 514 N.E.2d 702 (1987), citing <em>Blount v. Smith, </em>12 Ohio St.2d 41, 47, 231 N.E.2d 301 (1967). The state may interfere with this right, but only in \u201cexceptional cases where intrusion is absolutely necessary, such as promoting illegal acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>I reject the lead opinion\u2019s statement that the schools are seeking to rewrite the terms of the contract simply because they now seem unfair. This contract provision was illegal and unenforceable ab initio, and it is this court\u2019s constitutional obligation to put an end to this tragic legal fiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">{\u00b6 89} I would hold that a contract that vests title to public property purchased with public funds in a private entity violates public policy and is unenforceable as a matter of law. To do anything else rewards failure and encourages its repetition in the future in the name of profit. I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\">. The Akron Beacon Journal recently reported that since 2001, state auditors have uncovered $27.3 million in state tax dollars that have been improperly spent by charter schools, many run by for-profit companies.

In theory, they rescue children from broken urban school districts and educate them in smaller settings, similar to private schools, where families can have direct ownership in their child\u2019s education. Unfortunately, the consensus is that the theory has miserably failed to meet the expectations, whether because of flawed legislation, ineffective management, structural defects in the for-profit school model, unmotivated students, or any number of other plausible reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">{\u00b6 91} This case could be little more than an academic exercise because one can only assume that much of the furniture, computers, and other educational and instructional materials at issue are now obsolete, untraceable, lost, or converted to other uses. Even so, the lead opinion is wrong on the merits. The key contract language is not nearly so dispositive as the opinion suggests. The contract states, among other things, that \u201cthe Company shall purchase on behalf of the School any furniture, computers, software, equipment, and other personal property which, by the nature of the funding source, must be titled in the School\u2019s name.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AuE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Dinsmore &amp; Shohl, L.L.P., Karen S.

But that reading is not required by the language. The opinion reads the sentence such that the only items that must be titled in the school\u2019s name are those items that are required to be so titled by the funding source. That reading of the sentence is overly restrictive, ignores the fact that the companies had a fiduciary responsibility to the schools, and does not promote the intention of the parties, or in any event, not the intention of the schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">{\u00b6 93} A better reading of this key sentence subordinates the significance of \u201cby the nature of the funding source.\u201d This is not a restrictive term; it is more in the nature of an aside. With this understanding, the sentence essentially states that assets purchased on behalf of the school must be titled in the school\u2019s name because of the nature of the funding source.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">{\u00b6 94} Moreover, the contracts in this case are plainly and obviously unconscionable. In effect, the contracts call for the public to give money to a company to buy materials for the company to use on the public\u2019s behalf to operate a public school. The contracts require that after the public pays to buy those materials for a public use, the public must then pay the companies if it wants to retain ownership of the materials. This contract term is not merely unwise as the lead opinion would have us believe; it is extremely unfair, so unfair, in fact, as to be unconscionable. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1757 (10th Ed.2014). The contract term is so one-sided that we should refuse to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">{\u00b6 95} Methinks the opinion doth protest too much, going out of its way to support the insupportable.
