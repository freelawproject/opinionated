Duclos, seeks a writ of prohibition against respondents, the Hamilton County Board of Elections and its members, Timothy M. Burke, Alex M. Triantafilou, Caleb Faux, and Charles H. Gerhardt III,\u2019to remove the name of Gary W. Lee from the March 15, 2016 primary ballot as a candidate for sheriff. We hold that Duclos\u2019s petition is barred by laches, and accordingly, we deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">{\u00b6 2} On December 1, 2015, Lee filed his petition and declaration of candidacy at the board of elections. As part of his filing, he submitted a letter from Judge Robert Winkler, Hamilton County Common Pleas Court administrative judge, to the director of the board of elections, which indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-13\">[Lee\u2019s] fingerprints have been taken at my direction and he has been the subject of a search of local, state, and national fingerprint files to disclose any criminal record. Enclosed please find copies of the correspondence I have received from the respective agencies indicating no disqualifying criminal record on file.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">Along with Judge Winkler\u2019s letter, Lee submitted the result sheets of fingerprint searches from the Hamilton County Regional Crime Information Center and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d). However, contrary to the statement in Judge Winkler\u2019s letter, a fingerprint-search result sheet from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) was not attached, and thus not submitted to the board of elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Lee\u2019s paperwork also included a journal entry signed by Judge Winkler. In the entry, Judge Winkler made findings that fingerprint searches by the FBI and BCI did not disclose any disqualifying criminal convictions and that Lee was eligible to be a candidate for the office of Hamilton County Sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">{\u00b6 4} On January 4, 2016, Duelos filed a written protest with the board of elections. He alleged that Lee\u2019s application was incomplete because it failed to include the result sheet of an FBI background check.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">{\u00b6 5} The board of elections conducted a protest hearing on January 11, 2016. In the course of that hearing, the report from the FBI, showing no relevant convictions, was entered into evidence. That same day, the board denied the protest by a vote of four to zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">{\u00b6 6} On January 14, 2016, Duelos, through counsel, filed a mandamus complaint in this court. <em>Duclos v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>case No. 2016-0052. But five days later (two business days), on January 19, 2016, he filed an application to dismiss that action because it sought the wrong relief and filed a new complaint for a writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">{\u00b6 7} Respondents and Lee, as an amicus curiae, argue that Duelos unreasonably delayed bringing this action to their prejudice. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">\n<em>Laches</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">{\u00b6 8} Laches may bar relief in an election-related matter if the person seeking relief fails to act with the \u201c \u2018utmost diligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Monroe v. Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>137 Ohio St.3d 62, 2013-Ohio-4490, 997 N.E.2d 524, \u00b6 30, quoting <em>State ex rel. Fuller v. Medina Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 221, 2002-Ohio-5922, 778 N.E.2d 37, \u00b6 7. While a laches defense rarely prevails in election cases, we hold that the defense applies in this case because of Duclos\u2019s failure to act with any diligence whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">{\u00b6 9} Lee\u2019s candidacy was ripe for protest on December 1, 2015, when he filed his allegedly incomplete paperwork. But Duelos waited over a month, until January 4, 2016, to file his protest. According to Duelos, he did not discover the omission of the FBI report until December 16, 2016, when he examined Lee\u2019s filing. But he does not explain why he waited two weeks to check the filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">{\u00b6 10} In his reply brief, he suggests that his protest was triggered not by Lee\u2019s filing but by the board\u2019s decision to certify Lee for the ballot on December 21, 2015. But even using that date as the starting point, and even allowing for some delay over the holidays, Duelos does not explain why he waited two weeks to file his protest. And after the board rendered its decision, Duelos caused additional delay by dismissing his first lawsuit in favor of a second.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">{\u00b6 11} In all, at least six weeks elapsed between the filing of Lee\u2019s application and the commencement of suit in this court. Only one of those weeks was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>attributable to the board of elections. This delay has had two serious consequences. First, had Duelos acted promptly when Lee filed his application, the board could have adjudicated the protest and Duelos would have had ample time to consult with counsel and file suit in this court before December 16, 2015, the 90th day before the date of the election. In other words, the delay caused this case to become an expedited election case, which constitutes prejudice for purposes of laches. <em>State ex rel. Willke v. Taft, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-5303, 836 N.E.2d 536, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">{\u00b6 12} Second, and of greater seriousness, Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act absentee ballots became available on Saturday, January 30, 2016. Because Duelos failed to act with appropriate speed, voting in the contested primary has begun with the matter still unresolved and, therefore, with the possibility of disqualification still hanging over Lee\u2019s candidacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe elements of laches are (1) unreasonable delay or lapse of time in asserting a right, (2) absence of an excuse for the delay, (3) knowledge, actual or constructive, of the injury or wrong, and (4) prejudice to the other party.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Polo v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 143, 145, 656 N.E.2d 1277 (1995). We hold that all the elements of laches are present in this case. Given this disposition, we offer no comment on the other legal arguments raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 14} We deny Duclos\u2019s petition for a writ of prohibition on the grounds of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Writ denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b512-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b512-10\">Pfeifer and Kennedy, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b512-11\">O\u2019Neill, J., concurs separately in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b512-12\">O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AOp\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">{\u00b6 15} I concur in judgment only. I would also deny the request for a writ of prohibition, but I would do so for a different reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-14\">{\u00b6 16} I agree that respondents, the Hamilton County Board of Elections and its members, did their job, but I write separately to state my view that the writ should be denied based on the merits of the claim made by relator, David B. Duelos. The question presented is significant. This court should determine what material a candidate for sheriff must file with a board of elections, and in turn disclose to the public, in support of his or her qualifications for the ballot. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>dismiss on the issue of laches does a disservice to the legal concept. There was no unreasonable delay by this relator.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqc\">Lisa Rabanus, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AdD\">Joseph T. Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and David T. Stevenson and Cooper D. Bowen, Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 17} Gary W. Lee, the candidate for sheriff, filed his petition to be placed on the ballot on December 1, 2015. That was 61 days before the ballots needed to be mailed under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. No one on the face of the earth, including relator, could have known of the alleged defect in the petition prior to that date. Indeed, there was nothing to file in a court until the board of elections had reviewed the petition. Relator took all of two weeks after the petition was certified, from December 21, 2015, to January 4, 2016, to sound the alarm to the board of elections through a written protest. The board conducted a hearing one week later on January 11, 2016. Eight days after a final decision from the board, relator filed a complaint in this court. That is not sitting on one\u2019s rights for purposes of laches. <em>See State ex rel. Hackworth v. Hughes, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 110, 2002-Ohio-5334, 776 N.E.2d 1050, \u00b6 27 (petition for writ that was filed in this court three days after city council failed to place charter amendment on ballot not barred by laches). Relator took advantage of an alternative legal remedy available within the administrative structure of the board of elections. Now this court finds that doing so was unreasonable and prejudiced respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 18} We can and should absolutely deny this petition on the merits. Lee strictly complied with the plain language of R.C. 311.01(B)(6) by \u201cnotifying] the board of elections * * * of the judge\u2019s findings\u201d and with the plain language of R.C. 311.01(B)(7). Lee simply did not need to provide every bit of paperwork reviewed by Judge Winkler to the board of elections. The judge\u2019s findings were sufficient, and the board of elections and its members complied with their legal duties. In light of this court\u2019s preference for resolving cases on their merits, <em>Hackworth </em>at \u00b6 26, rather than on procedural minutiae, we should give boards of elections a real answer to a real question.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 19} I would deny the writ on its merits and not on laches. This time line is not a precedent anyone would want to follow.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AnP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Charles M.
