Appellant, Steak \u2018n Shake, Inc., n.k.a. Steak \u2018n Shake Operations, Inc., filed a complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>seeking a reduction of the value assigned to its property; appellee Warren County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) retained appellee auditor\u2019s original valuation for the property. At the hearing before the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d), the property owner presented an appraisal report and testimony from an appraiser, while the county presented an appraisal prepared by an employee of the county\u2019s valuation consultant. The BTA adopted the county\u2019s valuation, and Steak \u2018n Shake has appealed, challenging both the competency and the probative force of the county\u2019s valuation of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">{\u00b6 2} Under the circumstances, we must reject Steak \u2018n Shake\u2019s competency arguments. We do, however, agree with Steak \u2018n Shake that the BTA erred in its uncritical acceptance of the county appraiser\u2019s reliance on encumbered comparable properties in determining the value of the subject property, which is occupied by its owner. We therefore reverse the decision of the BTA, and we remand for a determination of value based on the property owner\u2019s appraisal and/or any other evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Factual background</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 3} At issue is a 1.5-acre parcel improved with a 3,496-square-foot restaurant, a Steak \u2018n Shake, visible from 1-71 on the northern outskirts of Cincinnati. It was built in 1995 and is occupied by the owner-operator. An additional improvement is the parking lot with space for 66 cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\n<em>The BOR proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">{\u00b6 4} On March 17, 2010, Steak \u2018n Shake filed a complaint seeking a reduction for tax year 2009 from the auditor\u2019s valuation of $1,259,590 to $832,000. The Mason City School District Board of Education (\u201cschool board\u201d) filed a counter-complaint on April 8, seeking retention of .the auditor\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">{\u00b6 5} On October 19, 2010, the BOR held a hearing at which Steak \u2018n Shake presented an owner\u2019s opinion of value. The owner\u2019s opinion consisted of an income approach arriving at a valuation of $778,000 and a sales-comparison approach concluding a value of $822,000; the owner suggested a reconciliation value of $800,000. Counsel explained the opinion at the BOR hearing without testimony from the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">{\u00b6 6} At the hearing, the auditor\u2019s consultant, Ed Rinck, offered his opinion that a different capitalization rate ought to be used under the income approach: he arrived at a value of $1,082,790, which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">{\u00b6 7} Steak \u2018n Shake appealed to the BTA. At the BTA hearing on February 19, 2013, Steak \u2018n Shake and the county both presented appraisal reports along with testimony of the appraisers.</p>\n<p id=\"Akm\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>\n<em>The property owmer\u2019s appraisal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">{\u00b6 8} Steak \u2018n Shake presented the appraisal report and testimony of commercial-real-estate appraiser W. Shaun Wilkins, a longtime state-certified appraiser and member of the Appraisal Institute with extensive experience appraising commercial properties, including some in Warren County.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 9} Wilkins determined that \u201c[t]he restaurant building is concluded to be the highest and best use\u201d of the property as improved. Deciding that the cost approach was not applicable because of the size and age of the property, Wilkins proceeded to evaluate four comparable sales in the Cincinnati area while confining his analysis to sales before the lien date on the theory that such information would be within the knowledge of market participants on the lien date. Wilkins adjusted the sale prices of the comparable properties and adopted the average, $180 per square foot, to determine the value for the subject property under the sales-comparison approach: $629,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 10} Under the income approach, Wilkins identified seven comparable properties in the Cincinnati area, all of which were leased, and examined the leases and premises; four of the leased comparable properties were Steak \u2018n Shakes. Rents ranged from $14.73 to $24.93 per square foot, and Wilkins located the property at issue in the upper part of the range at $22 per square foot, with a potential gross income of $76,912 for the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">{\u00b6 11} Wilkins then allowed deductions for loss because of vacancy and for minor expenses on the assumption of leasing on a net basis. At the end, net income was calculated to be $66,692. Using both market-comparison and band-of-investment methods, Wilkins derived a capitalization rate of 9.11 percent. When the income, $66,692, was divided by the capitalization rate, .0911, the value of the property was calculated to be $732,075, which Wilkins rounded to $732,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">{\u00b6 12} Finally, Wilkins reconciled the two approaches by averaging the two values to $680,500, rounded to $680,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">\n<em>The county\u2019s appraisal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">{\u00b6 13} The Warren County auditor and the BOR presented the report and testimony of Edward Rinck, an employee of Ward &amp; Associates, the firm hired by Warren County to perform mass-appraisal services for the auditor. Rinck had prepared a report that looked to three properties allegedly comparable for both sale and rent values. Each of the properties was a restaurant subject to lease that had sold: an Arby\u2019s in Lebanon built in 1987 that sold in October 2010 for $775,000; a Kentucky Fried Chicken in Middletown built in 1985 that sold in June 2012 for $760,000; and an Applebee\u2019s in the same township as the subject property built in 1997 that sold in September 2010 for $1,473,742.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Rinck made some adjustments for the size and quality of the construction of the properties; no adjustments were made for the time of the sales (during recovery from a recession as opposed to the January 1, 2009 lien date for the subject property) or for the fact that they were subject to a lease, which could affect the sale price and rent. Rinck derived a value of $996,000 from the sales comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">{\u00b6 15} All three comparable properties were subject to long-term leases, and Rinck used the lease values for the income method. The Arby\u2019s transaction in 2010 was a sale-leaseback with rent at $27.66 per square foot; the Kentucky Fried Chicken was sold subject to a lease that ran from January 2007 to October 2016 with rent at $19.36 per square foot; and the Applebee\u2019s was sold subject to a lease that began September 2010 with rent at $24.42 per square foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 16} Rinck made adjustments to the lease rates, then applied a capitalization rate of 8.75 percent, which he apparently extracted from the values used for the three comparable properties, that is, he divided the income by the sale price to obtain the capitalization rate for each property, then averaged them to 8.75 percent for the property at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b6 17} Under the sales-comparison method, Rinck derived a value of $996,000, and under the income method, Rinck derived a value of $998,000. He also averaged the two figures as his method of reconciliation: he concluded that the property value was $997,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\n<em>The BTA\u2019s decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">{\u00b6 18} On April 15, 2014, the BTA issued its decision. The board began by noting that the two appraisals stood in conflict concerning \u201cthe proper elements to be considered in the income approach and the proximity of the transfers of the sale comparable to the tax lien date.\u201d BTA No. 2010-3527, 2014 Ohio Tax LEXIS 2425, 4-5 (Apr. 15, 2014). Evaluating those conflicts, the board stated: \u201c[W]e find that Rinck\u2019s report more accurately reflects the nature of the subject property and its optimal location in [a] highly visible and trafficked area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. By contrast, the BTA found that Wilkins\u2019s comparable properties were less reliable, given that the earlier owners had stopped doing business at those locations, that the properties had had extended stays on the market, and that they currently \u201cwere in a second generation use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In a footnote, the BTA brushed aside Steak \u2018n Shake\u2019s objections to Rinck\u2019s qualifications to testify, finding that he was \u201ccompetent to provide testimony as to the valuation of the subject property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4, fn. 2. Accordingly, the board adopted Rinck\u2019s valuation, $997,000, as the property value for tax year 2009. Steak \u2018n Shake then appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Steak \u2018n Shake\u2019s objections to the competency and lack OF INDEPENDENCE OF RlNCK\u2019S APPRAISAL ARE REJECTED</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 19} Steak \u2018n Shake impugns Rinck\u2019s qualifications to have offered an opinion at the BTA. Additionally, Steak \u2018n Shake argues that because Rinck is an employee of the county\u2019s mass-appraisal consultant, he lacks the independence necessary to qualify to give expert testimony before the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\n<em>Admissibility issues lie within the BTA\u2019s discretion as fact-finder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cOrdinarily, testimony as to property value is not competent and admissible unless it is the professional opinion of an expert.\u201d <em>Worthington City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>140 Ohio St.3d 248, 2014-Ohio-3620, 17 N.E.3d 537, \u00b6 18. We have regarded the proper use of expert opinions as lying within the sound discretion of the BTA. We defer to the BTA\u2019s determination of the <em>competency </em>as well as to the board\u2019s determination of the <em>credibility </em>of the evidence presented to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 21} Thus, when confronted with the contention that a witness could not qualify as an expert because he was not a state-certified appraiser, we consulted the certification statute and concluded that \u201can individual may testify before the BTA about the appraisal of real estate without being certified under R.C. Chapter 4763 if he is otherwise qualified, as determined by the BTA.\u201d <em>N. Olmsted Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 595, 597, 664 N.E.2d 1285 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 22} As for whether the appraiser must be independent of the interests of the parties, we have treated the matter as within the BTA\u2019s discretion as fact-finder. In <em>Witt Co. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 155, 158, 573 N.E.2d 661 (1991), an employee of the property owner\u2019s consultant, which was entitled to a fee only if a reduction was ordered, presented an appraisal that the BTA rejected on the grounds that it was not independent. On appeal, this court affirmed the BTA\u2019s disposition not based on an analysis of the independence of the appraisal evidence but instead on the ground that the decision to exclude the appraisal fell within the BTA\u2019s general discretion to determine a witness\u2019s credibility. Similarly, in <em>Loveland Pines v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>66 Ohio St.3d 387, 388, 613 N.E.2d 191 (1993), we affirmed the BTA\u2019s reliance on an appraisal by an employee of the county auditor\u2019s office, which the property owner objected to because of the employee\u2019s \u201clack of education and outside experience.\u201d We stated, \u201c \u2018All these facts bear on the witness\u2019 credibility, which is within the sound discretion of the BTA.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Witt Co. </em>at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">\n<em>No objection was lodged to the admissibility of Rinck\u2019s opinion, and the BTA\u2019s consideration of it did not constitute plain error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">{\u00b6 23} We have also held that when an objection to evidence could have been made before the tax tribunals but was not, a plain-error standard applies on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>appeal. <em>See Plain Local Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 230, 2011-Ohio-3362, 957 N.E.2d 268, \u00b6 20-21; <em>Sapina v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>136 Ohio St.3d 188, 2013-ohio-3028, 992 N.E.2d 1117, \u00b6 17. We conclude that there is no basis for a finding of plain error as to any of the waived objections here.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 24} Rinck is an experienced appraiser who had been in the profession for 36 years at the time of the hearing and who was employed by the consultant used by Warren County. His testimony has been accepted in other contexts, as the county argued. Specifically, he has testified several times before the BTA, and one court of appeals has noted that he had been providing appraisals for years; that same court also found that the board of revision and the common pleas court acted within their discretion in finding his testimony to be credible. <em>Eastbrook Farms, Inc. v. Warren Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>194 Ohio App.3d 193, 2011-Ohio-2103, 955 N.E.2d 418, \u00b6 26 (12th Dist.).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 25} Rinck\u2019s background suffices to establish that there was no plain error in the BTA\u2019s considering his report and his testimony as evidence of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 26} Nor is Rinck\u2019s alleged noncompliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice plain error upon which we may predicate reversal. Although compliance with appraisal-industry standards may in other contexts be mandatory, nothing makes it mandatory <em>before the BTA </em>\u2014 compliance with those standards goes to the weight and probative character to be ascribed to the appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Rinck\u2019s supplemental testimony concerning HIGHEST AND BEST USE WAS ADMISSIBLE</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">{\u00b6 27} Counsel for Steak \u2018n Shake did object to Rinck testifying as to the highest-and-best-use and location analyses, neither of which was discussed in Rinck\u2019s appraisal report. Steak \u2018n Shake argues in its brief that the testimony violated discovery rules as well as the BTA\u2019s own rules regarding disclosure of expert reports: because the report was skimpy and fleshed out only at the hearing, counsel did not properly have the opportunity to prepare. But the BTA\u2019s rules, the Civil Rules, and the case law did not establish a legal right to have the testimony excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">{\u00b6 28} At the time the BTA conducted its hearing in this matter, the BTA\u2019s rules required generally that witnesses and exhibits be identified 14 days before the hearing. Former Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-15(1), 2008-2009 Ohio Monthly Record 2-2562, effective Feb. 1, 2009. This requirement was made specifically applicable to expert witnesses and their written reports. Former Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-11(A)(5), <em>id. </em>The rules also provided that discovery be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>conducted in accordance with the Civil Rules to the extent that they are not inconsistent with other board rules. Former Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-11(A), <em>id. </em>at 2-2561.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">{\u00b6 29} These cited provisions furnish no grounds for Steak \u2018n Shake to establish <em>a legal right </em>to have had Rinck\u2019s testimony excluded. It appears that Rinck was timely identified and that Rinck\u2019s report was timely disclosed. The supplemental testimony at the hearing does not violate the rules, and remedying any secondary violation of their letter or spirit lay within the BTA\u2019s sound discretion. Moreover, the availability of discovery afforded Steak \u00a3n Shake the right to depose Rinck to question him about the extent of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 30} Steak \u2018n Shake fares no better under the case law cited in its brief. It cites <em>Shumaker v. Oliver B. Cannon &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>28 Ohio St.3d 367, 370, 504 N.E.2d 44 (1986), <em>abrogated on other grounds by State v. D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>67 Ohio St.3d 185, 191, 616 N.E.2d 909 (1993), for the general proposition that timely discovery of expert testimony is important to preserve the right of effective cross-examination \u2014 but nothing in the case supports the legal right, as asserted by the property owner here, to exclude certain testimony. In <em>Shumaker, </em>allowing the expert testimony was an abuse of discretion because <em>no notice had been given </em>that Shumaker claimed that he had cancer. The cancer diagnosis was not made until after he had filed an action claiming that his pulmonary and respiratory illnesses were linked to chemicals in his workplace. That situation is not present here, since Rinck\u2019s report, though less than complete under usual standards, plainly gives notice of the substantive nature of his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">{\u00b6 31} Steak \u2018n Shake argues that because highest-and-best-use testimony is an essential part of appraising the market value of real property, the county had a duty to supplement discovery to notify it of Rinck\u2019s opinions. This claim fails because there is nothing particularly surprising about Rinck\u2019s highest-and-best-use testimony in light of his written report. Rinck\u2019s highest-and-best-use testimony consisted of his affirmative answer to the following question: \u201cIn your opinion, is the use as a restaurant the highest and best use of the subject property?\u201d Given Rinck\u2019s use in the written report of sales and rent for three comparable properties that were all identified as restaurant properties, Steak \u2018n Shake cannot legitimately claim to be surprised. The testimony was reasonably implied by Rinck\u2019s choice of comparable properties. Because there is no ambush present here, there is insufficient ground to exclude the testimony on the theory that a discovery violation occurred. <em>Compare Shumaker </em>at 371, (reversing judgment when undisclosed physician testimony had been admitted because \u201c[t]here appears to be an element of \u2018ambush\u2019 in the present case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">{\u00b6 32} Although Rinck\u2019s written report may fall short of the standard for matters that ought to be addressed in such a report, we conclude that Steak \u2018n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Shake has not demonstrated reversible error based on its objection to Rinck\u2019s highest-and-best-use testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Rinck\u2019s reliance on unadjusted sale prices of encumbered COMPARABLE PROPERTIES WAS IMPROPER, SINCE THE SPECIAL-PURPOSE DOCTRINE DOES NOT APPLY</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">{\u00b6 33} Although we reject its procedural objections, Steak \u2018n Shake does advance a valid objection to the Rinck appraisal <em>on substantive grounds. </em>Quite simply, Rinck\u2019s appraisal failed to adjust the sales prices of the comparable properties to remove the effect that long-term leases would have had on those prices. Since the property at issue was unencumbered by a lease, it would likely have sold for less.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">{\u00b6 34} The county and amicus curiae, the County Auditors\u2019 Association of Ohio, rely on <em>Meijer Stores Ltd. Partnership v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 447, 2009-Ohio-3479, 912 N.E.2d 560, to oppose this point. By doing so, they underscore the value-in-use issue, because Meijer\u2019s analysis depended upon the fact that one of the competing appraisals recognized that the special adaptation of the property to Meijer\u2019s use affected its value. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24-26. No special adaptation has been established here.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\n<em>Because the encumbrance of a lease may affect market value, sale prices of leased properties generally must be adjusted when determining the value of comparable unleased properties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">{If 35} Amicus curiae points out that \u201cthis Court has repeatedly held that sales do not need to be adjusted to reflect beneficial lease terms.\u201d Amicus curiae then cites a parade of cases: <em>Cummins Property Servs., L.L.C. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 516, 2008-Ohio-1473, 885 N.E.2d 222; <em>AEI Net Lease Income &amp; Growth Fund v. Erie Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 563, 2008-Ohio-5203, 895 N.E.2d 830; and most recently, <em>HIN, L.L.C. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>138 Ohio St.3d 223, 2014-Ohio-523, 5 N.E.3d 637, \u00b6 19-20 (\u201cHIN claims that the 2004 sales price represents the value of the leased fee, not the unencumbered fee simple. It argues that we must value property in its unencumbered state. We have rejected this argument numerous times\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">{\u00b6 36} Amicus curiae argues that because sale prices do not need to be adjusted for the effect of long-term leases, Rinck did not need to adjust the sale prices for the encumbered properties he used as comparable properties in this case. That argument is, however, mistaken. <em>Precisely because </em>the encumbrances affect sale price, and <em>precisely because </em>the difference in sales price is a difference in value for tax purposes, Rinck was required to adjust the sale prices for his comparable properties to reflect the fact that the subject property was not encumbered and would therefore likely sell for less.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Meijer <em>is inapposite because Steak \u2018n Shake has not been shown to come within the special-purpose doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">{\u00b6 37} The next step in the defense of the Rinck appraisal relies on <em>Meijer, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 447, 2009-Ohio-3479, 912 N.E.2d 560. Because the use of unadjusted sales of leased properties could be appropriate in the context of the <em>Meijer </em>case, the county argues that Rinck\u2019s reliance on unadjusted sales of encumbered properties is proper here. That also is mistaken, for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">{\u00b6 38} First, in <em>Meijer, </em>the appraisal adopted by the BTA did not place <em>exclusive </em>reliance on unadjusted encumbered sales, as Rinck did in his appraisal in this case. To the contrary, in <em>Meijer, </em>the appraisal adopted by the BTA reflected the appraiser\u2019s conviction that the \u201cmarket rent applicable to the property at issue \u2018is considered to lie somewhere between the ranges indicated by the first and second generation comparables, with a strong bias towards those rents indicated by the first generation lease comparables.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meijer, </em>\u00b6 11, quoting the appraiser\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">{\u00b6 39} Second and more significantly, the use of unadjusted sales prices for encumbered comparable properties was more appropriate in <em>Meijer </em>because that case involved the proper application of the \u201cspecial-purpose doctrine.\u201d Namely, in <em>Meijer </em>\u2014 unlike in the present case \u2014 the BTA evaluated and rejected the owner\u2019s appraisal, which looked straightforwardly at what Meijer could realistically sell the brand-new facility for, given that it was an outsize building adapted for Meijer\u2019s type of comprehensive retail business. <em>See Meijer, </em>\u00b6 7 (\u201c[The property owner\u2019s appraiser] looked at the big-box store as adding only modest market value because the structure would not be easily adaptable to the needs of a potential buyer, <em>a factor that he opined would impair the property\u2019s marketability </em>\u201d [emphasis added]). In other words, the property owner wanted to appraise the property as though it were a shuttered Kmart \u2014 yet Meijer had just recently built the 193,000-square-foot store and was operating it with apparent success. Under these circumstances, we held that the BTA acted reasonably and lawfully by preferring the competing appraisal, which considered the value of the property in its use by <em>Meijer </em>itself: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>(Brackets sic.) <em>Meijer, </em>\u00b6 25, quoting <em>Dinner Bell Meats, Inc. v.
