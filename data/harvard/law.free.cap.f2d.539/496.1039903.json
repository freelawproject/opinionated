MORGAN,- Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Plaintiff Glen Drewett sued defendant National Flood Insurers Association in federal district court to recover on a flood insurance policy issued under the provisions of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4001 <em>et seq. </em>After a bench trial the district court denied recovery, and Drewett appeals. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">This court also must dispose of appellant Drewett\u2019s motion to tax to the appellee the cost of allegedly unnecessary portions of the appendix on appeal ordered by appellee. For the reasons stated herein, we grant this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">I. MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">On May 2, 1973 Drewett applied for and was issued a flood insurance policy under the National Flood Insurance Program covering his \u201ccamp house\u201d which rested on wooden \u201cstilts\u201d above the ground. On and before that date flood waters had already risen three to four feet up the stilts, although the waters had not yet reached the living quarters of the house itself. On May 5 the levee surrounding the house broke and the waters rose yet further, entering the living quarters of the house. The defendant Association denied Drewett\u2019s claim under his policy, and Drewett sued in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4053.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">The district court in a written opinion held for defendant on the ground that, under general principles of insurance law, where a loss already is in progress at the time a policy is issued, the contract of insurance does not take effect. The district court also ordered the Association to return to Drewett the premium he had paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">Drewett appeals on the ground that the district court erred in applying the \u201closs-in-progress\u201d principle to a policy issued under the provisions of the National Flood Insurance Program. He argues that, because the statute creating the Program anticipates that premiums may be charged that are lower than the actuarial cost of insuring property in flood-prone areas (the difference being subsidized by the federal government), <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4014 and 4015, it is inappropriate to apply insurance law principles developed originally to apply to profit-seeking insurers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While conced<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ing that the Association is not liable for damage which the flood did to his house before the policy was issued, Drewett argues that he should recover for the additional damage done when the waters continued to rise after the policy was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Drewett\u2019s contention is without merit. The Flood Insurance Program is administered with cooperation between the federal government and private insurance companies; the private companies carry some of the risk, although the federal government stands ready to reinsure and reimburse excessive losses. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4017, 4041-84. The Program also requires ongoing actuarial studies to help set the premiums to be charged, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4014. The eventual goal of the Program is to discourage building in flood-prone areas by raising, over time, the premiums actually charged to equal the actuarial cost of flood insurance. <em>See </em>U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News (1968) at 2969, <em>reprinting </em>House Report No. 1585, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In short, although the Program offers subsidized flood insurance, it is designed to operate much like any private insurance company and eventually to eliminate the subsidy. Because the Program\u2019s exposure to claims and its premiums are required to be estimated in accordance with standard insurance practices, and because private insurers carry part of the risk, it is clear that Congress did not intend to abrogate standard insurance law principles which affect such estimates and risks. Nothing in the statute or regulations promulgated under it, <em>see </em>24 C.F.R. Parts 1909-18, requires otherwise. Drewett cites no authority to suggest the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In a case very nearly identical to this one, <em>Presley v. National Flood Insurers </em>Association, 399 F.Supp. 1242 (E.D.Mo. 1975), the district court held that the \u201closs-in-progress\u201d principle applies to policies issued under the Program, rejecting the same arguments made by Drewett here. This plainly is the correct conclusion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">II. APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION TO TAX COSTS OF SUPPLEMENTAL APPENDIX TO APPELLEE</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">Appellant filed a 31 page Appendix with his brief to this court, containing reproductions of the docket entries in the district court; his complaint and appellee\u2019s answer; appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, appellant\u2019s response in opposition, and the district court\u2019s partial grant of the motion; both patties\u2019 trial memoranda; the written opinion of the district court holding for appellee on the merits; the judgment; and the contract of insurance. The Appendix cost $76.30 to print.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">Appellee designated, as additional portions of the record to be reproduced as a Supplemental Appendix, literally everything else in the record below. This Supplemental Appendix is 212 pages long. Among other things, it contains a reproduction of the entire trial transcript (Supp.App. at 82-187); a copy of the insurance contract, which was already reproduced in the original Appendix <em>(compare </em>Supp.App. at 190-94 <em>with </em>App. at 27-31); copies of 24 photographs of appellant\u2019s camp house (Supp.App. at 23, 32-33,198-205, 209); two separate reproductions of the same diagram of the floor plan of the camp house <em>(compare </em>Supp.App. at 22 <em>with id. </em>at 208); two separate copies of the same statement of Glen Drewett dated August 8, 1973 (compare Supp.App. at 24 <em>with id. </em>at 211); copies of miscellaneous correspondence among the parties and the district court relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>such matters as the filing of pleadings, bonds, interrogatories, and motions (Supp. App. at 8-10,14-15, 26, 34, 38,43, 50, 55, 58, 63, 70-76, 78, 81); copies of the parties\u2019 motions and memoranda of law to the trial court on a variety of issues at all stages of the proceedings (Supp.App. at 1-7, 16-17, 27-29, 39-42, 44-48, 51-54, 56-57, 64-69); copies of interrogatories, answers, and affidavits (Supp.App. at 11-12, 18-21, 30-31, 35); a copy of the pre-trial order (Supp. App. at 59-62); copies of the notice of appeal and receipt for appeal bond (Supp. App. at 77, 80); and more. This Supplemental Appendix cost $533.68 to print.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Appellant alleges that appellee\u2019s designation of the entire record for reproduction in the Supplemental Appendix was not necessary to enable us to decide the issue on appeal, and he moves that the cost of printing the Supplemental Appendix be charged to appellee. Fed.R.App.P. 30(a) and (b) describe the portions of the record<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which are to be reproduced in the appendix and the methods by which the parties are to determine the contents of the appendix; and (b) authorizes the court of appeals to impose the cost of unnecessary portions of the appendix on the party designating them. These sections state (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">(a) <em>Duty of Appellant to Prepare and File; Content of Appendix </em>The appellant shall prepare and file an appendix to the briefs which shall contain: (1) the <em>relevant </em>docket entries in the proceeding below; (2) any <em>relevant </em>portions of the pleadings, charge, findings or opinion; (3) the judgment, order or decision in question; and (4) any other parts of the record <em>to which the parties wish to direct the particular attention of the court. </em>The fact that parts of the record are not included in the appendix shall not prevent the parties or the court from relying on such parts. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">(b) <em>Determination of Contents of Appendix; Cost of Producing. </em>The parties are encouraged to agree as to the contents of the appendix. In the absence of agreement, the appellant shall . . . serve on the appellee a designation of the parts of the record which he intends to include in the appendix and a statement of the issues which he intends to present for review. <em>If the appellee deems it necessary to direct the particular attention of the court to parts of the record not designated by the appellant, </em>he shall . serve upon the appellant a designation of those parts. The appellant shall include in the appendix the parts thus designated. <em>In designating parts of the record for inclusion in the appendix, the parties shall have regard for the fact that the entire record is always available to the court for reference and examination and shall not engage in unnecessary designation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-12\">Unless the parties otherwise agree, the cost of producing the appendix shall initially be paid by the appellant, but if the appellant considers that parts of the record designated by the appellee for inclusion are unnecessary for the determination of the issues presented he may so advise the appellee and the appellee shall advance the cost of including such parts. The cost of producing the appendix shall be taxed as costs in the case, but <em>if either party shall cause matters to be included in the appendix unnecessarily the court may impose the cost of producing such parts on the party.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>This court, through adoption of Fifth Circuit Local Rule 13(b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> has emphasized its concern that the cost to the parties of appeals should not be inflated unnecessarily by careless practice in designating portions of the record to be reproduced in the appendix: <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\">(b) <em>Contents of Appendix: </em>Counsel should bear in mind the Court\u2019s desire to minimize the cost of reproducing the appendix, consistent with the obligation and responsibility of the parties to reproduce therein those parts of the record which are essential to the Court\u2019s consideration and determination of the issues raised by the appeal. Any parts of the record which are inadvertently omitted from the reproduced appendix may be referred to by appropriate references to the original record. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">We think that appellee here clearly has disregarded the dictates of Fed.R. App.P. 30 and Local Rule 13(b). For instance, because the issue on appeal is one of law and involves no dispute as to the salient facts,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it was wholly unnecessary to order reproduction of the entire trial transcript and all the exhibits in the Supplemental Appendix. <em>Oliver v. Michigan State Board of Education, </em>519 F.2d 619, 621-24 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>Bernard v. Omaha Hotel, Inc., </em>482 F.2d 1222, 1225-26 (8th Cir. 1973). Similarly, reproduction in the Supplemental Appendix of all the memoranda of law submitted to the trial court by both parties on all issues \u2014 not one of which memoranda is referred to in appellee\u2019s brief \u2014 was unnecessary. <em>Aquascutum of London Inc. v. S. S. American Champion, </em>426 F.2d 205, 213 n. 6 (2d Cir. 1970); <em>Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Church, </em>413 F.2d 1126, 1128 (9th Cir. 1969). The same is true of the correspondence among the parties and the district court, the interrogatories, answers, and affidavits, the pre-trial order, and the notice of appeal and receipt for appeal bond \u2014 none of which is cited in appellee\u2019s brief. There is, of course, no excuse for printing the same matter in the Supplemental Appendix twice or for duplicating in the Supplemental Appendix material already in the Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">Appellee\u2019s \u201cOpposition to Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s Motion to have Appellee Pay Cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Unnecessary Portion of Appendix Requested\u201d states in conclusory fashion that inclusion of \u201call testimony, evidence and the entire record ... is essential to the just disposition of this matter and reference thereto is made in the brief of defendantappellee . . . \u201d The fact of the matter, however, is that appellee\u2019s brief refers to only minute portions of the record that is reproduced in the Supplemental Appendix, and the portions therein referred to have no bearing on the issue of law on appeal. <em>Compare </em>Brief for Appellee at 5-8 <em>with </em>text and note at note 6 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Although we have no desire or intent to discourage litigants from reproducing all the relevant portions of the record in their appendices to this court, we cannot condone the extravagance practiced by appellee here. Because of the evident carelessness and disregard for Fed.R.App.P. 30 and Local Rule 13(b) with which appellee\u2019s Supplemental Appendix was assembled, appellant\u2019s motion to tax the costs of the Supplemental Appendix against appellee is granted. <em>See </em>cases cited <em>supra; Sivertsen v. Guardian Life Insurance Company, </em>423 F.2d 443, 446 (4th Cir. 1970); 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 230.02[2] \u2014 [4]; <em>cf. Lester v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, </em>240 F.2d 676, 677-78 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>354 U.S. 923, 77 S.Ct. 1383, 1 L.Ed.2d 1437 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-12\">. Defendant asserts that Drewett did not raise this argument in the court below and hence should be deemed to have waived it. Brief for Appellee at 3-4. This contention is frivolous in view of the following arguments in the plaintiffs trial memorandum to the district court, <em>reprinted </em>at Appendix at 18-19:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-13\">Defendant argued on an earlier motion . that the National Flood Insurance Act creates a particular type of insurance applicable to a particular kind of loss which must be considered on its own merits and not in terms of Louisiana insurance law or other general principles of insurance law which are not applicable. Plaintiff shows that this is indeed the case in terms of applying the loss in progress principle of insurance law to these particular facts and circumstances. There was no loss in progress clause in the policy of insurance involved herein. There was no loss in progress involved as it was common knowledge that there was water in that area when the policy was issued for the very reason that there must be a threat of a flood before National Flood Insurance will even be approved for an area and become available to the people who may be threatened by the flood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoS\">In the defendant\u2019s trial memorandum, he refers to the fact that regular insurance companies would not issue a policy of insurance which goes against common sense and sound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>business practices. However, the National Flood Insurance Association is not set up to make a profit or to deal in sound business practices, but rather to provide relief to possible flood disaster victims, in order to remedy this national problem. It is plaintiff\u2019s contention that no clause with a loss in progress provision was inserted in the policy in order to avoid the varied arguments that are now being made by the defendants in this case. The insurance is designed to cover a flood damage and is not readily available in the market place as other insurance is.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\">. The \u201crecord on appeal\u201d is defined in Fed.R. App.P. 10(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">The original papers and exhibits filed in the district court, the transcript of proceedings, if any, and a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the clerk of the district court shall constitute the record on appeal in all cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-13\"><em>See generally </em>9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice U 210.04.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AUS\">.

The issue on appeal is framed by appellant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">Did the Trial Court err in applying principles of Louisiana law and the general insurance law which regulate and apply to insurance companies who are in business with a profit motive to the flood insurance contract herein between plaintiff and defendant, NATIONAL FLOOD INSURERS ASSOCIATION, defeating the purposes and intentions of the National Flood Insurance Program, and depriving plaintiff of his legitimate claim for damages under said contract?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">Brief for Appellant at iv.</p>\n<p id=\"AGW\">Appellee itself states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAD\">Absolutely no argument has been made that the trial court\u2019s determination of the facts (that the plaintiff\u2019s camp sustained substantial damages as result of the presence of flood water around the foundations of the camp prior to the date he applied for the policy . . .) is unsupported by the facts or, for that matter, clearly erroneous. This has not been raised as an issue before this court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXK\">Brief for Appellee at 4-5. We agree. The trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AalV\">[A] substantial element of the total loss claimed by plaintiff ... is directly related to the presence of three to four feet of water around the foundations of the camp prior to May 2, 1973.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIg\">Opinion of District Court, <em>reprinted at </em>Appendix at 22, 23. Appellant concedes that \u201chis camp had water under it at the time the policy was issued\u201d and does not dispute that \u201cthere was some damage to the foundation because of the presence of the water at the time of the issuance of this policy.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
