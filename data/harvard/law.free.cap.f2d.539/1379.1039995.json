The principal defenses raised by the appellant included misrepresentation of the accounts receivable of one of the purchased corporations and breach of a non-competition agreement incident to the sale. The appellant also alleged that it had partially satisfied its obligation on the note before its default.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-19\">The appellees initiated discovery by requests to produce documents in January 1975. They filed additional requests, interrogatories, and supplemental interrogatories through February 1975. The appellant failed fully to comply with these requests and on June 5, 1975, the district court granted the appellees\u2019 motion to compel discovery. On July 15, the court ordered the appellant to comply with the June 5 order within five days. The appellant only partly complied. On October 17, 1975, the court considered the appellees\u2019 motion for sanctions. The court again ordered the appellant fully to comply, observing that the appellant\u2019s failure to comply had been \u201cunbelievably flagrant.\u201d On November 24, the district court found that the appellant had still not completely complied with its previous orders and that the appellant\u2019s disregard of those orders remained \u201cunbelievably flagrant.\u201d The court ordered judgment against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-20\">The appellant contends that it has complied with the district court\u2019s orders. Its strongest argument is that it was unable to comply with the appellees\u2019 request for \u201cledgers and journals\u201d because the appellant did not keep ledgers or journals. The appellant avers that its business records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>were kept by computer and were available only on a codified computer print-out. This argument was not raised prior to November 1975. The appellant nevertheless argues that the district court determined only in November 1975 that the computerized summary constituted a ledger or journal. Consequently, according to the appellant, the court should then, rather than striking the appellant\u2019s pleadings, merely have ordered the production of such material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-5\">The discretion of the district court to order sanctions under Rule 37(b)(2) is broad but not unlimited. The due process clause of the fifth amendment limits the power of courts to dismiss an action without affording a party the opportunity for a hearing on the merits of his cause. <em>Societe Internationale v. Rogers, </em>357 U.S. 197, 78 S.Ct. 1087, 2 L.Ed.2d 1255 (1958). When the disobedient party is a plaintiff, dismissal with prejudice is a sanction of last resort, applicable only in extreme circumstances. <em>Thomas v. United States, </em>531 F.2d 746, 749 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Bon Air Hotel, Inc. v. Time, Inc., </em>376 F.2d 118 (5th Cir. 1967).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the disobedient party shows that his recalcitrance was based on factors beyond his control or on his exercise of constitutional privilege, a reviewing court is justified in terming the dismissal an abuse of discretion. <em>See Thomas </em>v. <em>United States, supra; Dorsey v. Academy Moving &amp; Storage, </em>423 F.2d 858, 861 (5th Cir. 1970). When, as here, a defendant\u2019s pleadings are stricken, an appellate court\u2019s review should be particularly scrupulous lest the district court too lightly resort to this extreme sanction, amounting to judgment against the defendant without an opportunity to be heard on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-6\">Nevertheless, when a defendant demonstrates flagrant bad faith and callous disregard of its responsibilities, the district court\u2019s choice of the extreme sanction is not an abuse of discretion. It is not our responsibility as a reviewing court to say whether we would have chosen a more moderate sanction. It is our responsibility solely to decide whether the district court could, in its discretion, have determined the appellant\u2019s conduct to be so flagrant as to justify striking its pleadings. In the case at bar, the district court\u2019s findings that the appellant was in \u201cflagrant disregard\u201d of the court\u2019s orders finds support in the record. We cannot say the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-13\">Although we could infer that, following imposition of a more lenient sanction, the chastened appellant might have complied with the district court\u2019s orders, the Supreme Court has emphasized the deterrent aspect of Rule 37(b)(2) sanctions. In <em>National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, </em>Inc.,-U.S.-,-, 96 S.Ct. 2778, 2781, 49 L.Ed.2d-(1976) (per curiam), the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-17\">If the decision of the Court of Appeals [holding that the district court abused its discretion] remained undisturbed in this case, it might well be that <em>these </em>respondents would faithfully comply with all future discovery orders entered by the District Court in this case. But other parties to other lawsuits would feel freer than we think Rule 37 contemplates they should feel to flout other discovery orders of other district courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1459-18\">The order of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AqK\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1458-12\">.
