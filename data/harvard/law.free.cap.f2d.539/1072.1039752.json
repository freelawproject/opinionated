BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1151-19\">Because this case presented important and unsettled questions of Alabama contract law, once again we made use of the valuable tool of certification provided by the Alabama Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alabama Constitution Art. VI, section 140(b)(3). The facts and certified questions are fully set out in <em>Tyler v. Insurance Company of North America, Inc., </em>5 Cir., 1975, 520 F.2d 341. The Alabama Supreme Court has responded with the final statement of Alabama law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the basis of the legal standards set by the Alabama Supreme Court and applicable principles of federal law, we reverse the District Court and hold that Assured, Tyler, must recover and on remand direct the entry of a judgment in Assured\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-20\">Two portions of the policy insuring Cecil Tyler were at issue, (i) whether he was \u201calighting from\u201d the automobile at the time he received the fatal injuries (clause (c)) and (ii) whether he was \u201cstruck by an automobile\u201d (clause (d)) when a rope attached to a boat on a trailer towed by the car caught his foot causing him to be dragged behind the car.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The District court held for Insurer on both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-21\">Although this Court, <em>Tyler, supra, </em>520 F.2d at 341, and the Alabama Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>Court, <em>Tyler, supra, </em>331 So.2d at 644 recited that the District Court granted a summary judgment in favor of Insurer, Insurer now contends that the District Court reached the merits and decided the fact issues in favor of Insurer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Insurer argues, therefore, that even under the principles of Alabama law as they are now decided, it is entitled to judgment because the District Judge made fact findings that preclude plaintiff\u2019s position. We reject this argument. Whatever the technical disposition by the District Judge, our disposition on appeal following consideration by the Alabama Supreme Court is the same. Any fact findings based on an erroneous legal standard cannot be credited. <em>Battlestein Investment Co. v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 442 F.2d 87, 89; <em>Fulton National Bank v. Tate, </em>5 Cir., 1966, 363 F.2d 562, 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">The District Court did not reach the question whether under Alabama law the policy covered the present fact situation where Assured was struck by something other than the auto itself, since the Trial Judge found that there was no \u201cstriking\u201d because there was no \u201csudden or forcible contact\u201d with Assured. The Alabama Supreme Court has now told us, however, not only that \u201cno actual physical contact between the plaintiff and the automobile is required for recovery\u201d but also \u201cstruck\u201d does not require sudden impact. <em>Tyler, supra, </em>331 So.2d at 646. The Alabama Court stated, \u201cThis court concludes that a finding of contact with an object whose motive force is an automobile is sufficient to bring the facts within the meaning of \u2018struck by an automobile\u2019 as used in the contract of insurance in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 646.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here the rope was given motive force by the automobile as it pulled forward. The rope then came into contact with Assured and the contact caused him to be pulled to the ground and dragged behind the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-10\">Looking at the Record and at the Alabama law from the federal perspective of the substantial evidence rule, <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>5 Cir., 1969, 411 F.2d 365, 373-75 (en banc), we conclude that there is nothing to be gained by a remand in this case. The evidence is undisputed that Assured was \u201cstruck by an automobile\u201d within the now-ascertained Alabama meaning of the policy. We decide this not because we are bound by the statement by the Alabama Supreme Court that summary judgment for Assured on this issue would have been correct,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but on the basis of federal standards and our reading of the evidence and agreed statement of facts in the light of this authoritative Alabama holding. <em>See Tyler, supra, </em>520 F.2d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-11\">Since we hold that Assured was entitled to judgment on the authoritative ruling of Alabama law on the evidence that he was struck, consideration of that portion of the policy concerning \u201calighting from\u201d is unnecessary. We point out, however, that the Alabama Supreme Court concluded that the facts raised a jury issue on this point under their interpretation that the term \u201cpleasure-type\u201d modifies \u201calighting\u201d as well as automobile. The Court said that if there were a remand the factfinder should consider whether Assured\u2019s activities would constitute an alighting \u201cas normally per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>formed on a <em>pleasure fishing trip </em>under similar circumstances.\u201d <em>Tyler, supra, </em>331 So.2d at 645.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">Once again we praise this useful device of federalism which has provided a final answer based not on our extrapolation of uncharted law, but on the Alabama legal principles as determined by that State\u2019s highest Court. By it, with no uncertainty as to legal principles, and a record which meets our <em>Boeing </em>standards, we bring this case to an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH DIRECTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1151-15\">. We recently had opportunity to praise this \u201cexercise of responsible federal-state relations\u201d in <em>Barnes v. Atlantic &amp; Pac. Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>5 Cir., 1976, 530 F.2d 98, 99 (certified questions set out at 514 F.2d 704). For other cases certified from this Court to the Alabama Court, see <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v.

American Fire &amp; </em>Casualty Co., 249 S.C. 39, 152 S.E.2d 247 (1967), the South Carolina Supreme Court had occasion to construe the term \u201cstruck\u201d as used in an accidental insurance contract. The court noted that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-8\">\u201cThe word \u2018struck\u2019 is the past tense of the word \u2018strike\u2019 which in its plain, ordinary and popular sense means \u2018to hit with some force\u2019; \u2018to come in collision with\u2019; \u2018to give a blow to\u2019; \u2018to come into contact forcibly\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akb\">The important phrase in this definition for our purposes is the phrase \u201cto come into contact [with]\u201d \u2014 the contact being sufficient if its result is injury to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-13\">331 So.2d at 646.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1152-14\">.
