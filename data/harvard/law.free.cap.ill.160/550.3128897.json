Officers\u2014removal of a city officer by the mayor\u2014effect. Removal by the mayor of a city officer, under the statute, (Laws of 1879, p. 65,) takes effect at once and deprives the removed officer of the right to further discharge the functions of the office, notwithstanding the provisions for the subsequent filing of charges by the mayor and the subsequent action of the city council thereon.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b550-15\" pgmap=\"550(24) 551(52)\">2. Injunction\u2014will not lie to enforce political rights\u2014-power of court of equity. An injunction will not lie to restrain the mayor of a city from interfering with the exercise of an office by an officer whom he has removed, upon the ground that the removal was illegal and no successor was appointed, as the court cannot determine political questions between the mayor and council or exercise jurisdiction in determining the right to an office.</headnotes><history data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b551-5\" pgmap=\"551\">Hutchins v.

John D. Crab-tree, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-7\" pgmap=\"551(262) 552(90)\">Appellant was chief of the fire department of the city of Rockford, having been appointed in the spring of 1891, and was the incumbent of that office in 1893, when the appellee was selected mayor of that city. The office of fire marshal, the chief of the fire department, is one to which the mayor appoints with the consent of the' city council. After appellee became mayor, in 1893, appellant desired to be re-appointed, but the mayor appointed Stephen T. Julian, whose appointment was neither confirmed nor rejected by the city council, but was laid on the table by a vote of nine to five and not subsequently acted upon, and for the year following appellant discharged the duties of the office. Again Julian was appointed by the mayor, and his appointment was rejected by the city council. The mayor then appointed Prank E. Peats, who was also rejected by the city council. Then Prank E. Thomas was appointed, with a like result. On the 7th of May, 189-1, appellee removed appellant, and directed him to vacate the office and turn over the property of the department in his possession to a subordinate officer, and threatened to eject him if he refused to comply. On the next day appellant sued out this writ of injunction, ordered by the master in chancery, enjoining appellee from removing or interfering with appellant, etc. A motion to dissolve, heard before the circuit judge at chambers, resulted in a modification of the injunction, restraining appellee, as mayor, from all interference with appellant in Ms office until he should be lawfully removed or his successor appointed and qualified. On a hearing this decree was made perpetual, and the appellee appealed to the Appellate Court for the Second District, where the decree was reversed, with directions to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the bill. From the judgment of the Appellate Court this appeal is prosecuted by this appellant, who assigns error in reversing the decree of the circuit court and remanding the cause with directions to dismiss the bill.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b552-4\" pgmap=\"552\">N.

Even if equity was a remedy in such a case, we insist that complainant is, at best, only a de facto officer, and as such can claim nothing for himself. People v. Weber, 86 Ill. 285.</p> <opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b553-7\" pgmap=\"553\">Mr. Justice Phillips</author> <p id=\"AxV\" pgmap=\"553\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p> <p id=\"b553-8\" pgmap=\"553\">Two questions are presented on this record. The first is as to the right of the mayor of the city to remove an officer appointed and confirmed, etc.; and the second is as to the jurisdiction of the court of chancery to enjoin the mayor from so removing such officer.</p> <p id=\"b553-9\" pgmap=\"553(111) 554(65)\">By section 7, article 2, chapter 24, of the Revised Statutes, it is declared : \u201cThe mayor shall have power to remove any officer appointed by him, on any formal charge, whenever he shall be of the opinion that the interests of the city demand such removal, but he shall report the reasons for such removal to the council at a meeting to be held not less than five days nor more than ten days after such removal; and if the mayor shall fail or refuse to file with the city clerk a statement of the reasons for such removal, or if the council, by a two-thirds (|) vote of all its members authorized by law to be elected, by yeas aud nays to be entered upon its record, disapprove of such removal, such officer shall thereupon become restored to the office from which be was so removed; but he shall give new bonds and take a new oath of office. No officer shall be removed the second time for the same offense.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b554-5\" pgmap=\"554\">Under this section the right to remove is conferred, and when exercised, the officer so removed no longer has a right to exercise the duties of the office. The fact that after such removal time is given the mayor to file charges with the clerk, and the further fact that if by a two-thirds vote the council disapproves the removal, etc., such officer shall thereupon become restored and shall file new bond, etc., preclude the idea that after removal by the mayor such officer shall act until after the action of the city council. When the order for removal was made and the officer directed to turn over the property in his possession to another, it was his duty to comply with that order, and he no longer had any right to discharge the functions of the office.</p> <p id=\"b554-6\" pgmap=\"554\">It is not within the jurisdiction of a court of equity to interfere with the public duties of the departments of government. (Chicago Public Stock Exchange v. McClaughry, 148 Ill. 372.) Its jurisdiction pertains only to questions of the maintenance of civil rights,\u2014property rights, as contradistinguished from political rights. (City of Chicago v. Wright, 69 Ill. 318 ; Delahanty v. Warner, 75 id. 185; Sheridan v. Colvin, 78 id. 237.) It can have no jurisdiction to determine political questions between the mayor and council of a city concerning the appointment and removal of officers, nor can it exercise jurisdiction in determining the right of a party to an office. ^</p> <p id=\"b554-7\" pgmap=\"554\">The injunction was improperly issued, and should have been dissolved. The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"Alf\" pgmap=\"554\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b554-9\" pgmap=\"554\">Cartwright, J., took no part.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
