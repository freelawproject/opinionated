We cannot agree, however, with the reason he gave for it, that the language in Sec. 933(f) \u201cinstitutes proceedings within the period preseribed in section 913\u201d refers not to the third party action but to the claim for compensation.! Nevertheless, though we think that the deputy 'commissioner was right, the district judge wrong in this respect,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we think it plain that there is nothing in the:statute which, in the circumstances of this case supports the result found by the commissioner. This is so because nowhere in the statute is it provided that the failure to file the third party action within one year bars the claim for compensation. The language is directory, not mandatory, and, in the absence of gome positive showing of undue delay and of injury resulting from the failure to file within one year, it would be, we think, an unreasonable construction to re\u00e1d it as a statute automatically forfeiting claims to compensation without a showing of prejudice or injury. While the precise question here presented has not been authoritatively decided in any appellate court, in our opinion the decisions, dealing with analogous situations \u00a1and generally giving the statute a liberal construction, preclude the construction contended for here.

D.C., 139 F.Supp. 568.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-10\">. Magnus T. Weber, claimant\u2019s husband, died on Aug. 23, 1950, allegedly from injuries suffered in the course of his employment as longshoreman by Charles Ferran &amp; Co., Inc., at New Orleans, Louisiana. On Oct. 23, 1950, Mrs. Weber filed notice of election to sue a third party and instituted proceedings before respondent by the filing of a claim for any deficiency between the amount recovered in the third party action and the amount to which claimant and her child would be entitled under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The third party suit, filed on Feb. 28, 1952, was subsequently dismissed by the court after arguments and briefs. Thereafter, when libellant sought to press her claim for deficiency compensation, the Deputy Commissioner ruled as stated above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b111-17\">. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 933(f) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-18\">\u201cIf the person entitled to compensation or the representative elects to recover damages against such third person and notifies the Secretary of his election and institutes proceedings within the period prescribed in section 913 of this chapter, the employer shall he required to pay as compensation under this chapter a sum equal to the excess of the amount which the Secretary determines is payable on account of such injury or death over the amount recovered against such third person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-19\">33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 933(d) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-20\">\u201cSuch employer on account of such assignment may either institute proceedings for the recovery of such damages or may compromise with such third person either without or after instituting such proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-21\">33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 913(a) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-22\">\u201cThe right to compensation for dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>ability under this chapter shall be barred unless a claim therefor is filed within one year after the injury, and the right to compensation for death shall be barred unless a claim therefor is filed within one yeah after the death, except that if payment of compensation has been made without an award on account of such injury or death a claim may be filed within one year after the date of the last payment.
