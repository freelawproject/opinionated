BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b345-19\">The insurer, United Services Automobile Association, asserting, as it has frequently but unsuccessfully in these family automobile situations, United Services Automobile Association v. Preferred Accident Insurance Co., 10 Cir., 190 F.2d 404; United Services Automobile Association v. Zeller, Tex.Civ.App., 135 S.W.2d 161, error dismissed, judgment correct, that use of the car was not with permission of the named assured, denies liability outright. But unwilling, perhaps in keeping with the military status of its clientele, to put its trust altogether in this Maginot Line, it, as do so many others, Maryland Casualty Co. v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance Co., 5 Cir., 235 F.2d 679; Continental Casualty Co. v. Suttenfield, 5 Cir., 236 F.2d 433, falls back on fluid defenses 'the effect of which is to say that it is not liable because <em>another </em>is, or partially is. And, like General Insurance Co. of America v. Western Fire &amp; Casualty Co., 5 Cir., 241 F.2d 289, all but forgotten is the accident<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> between Enslen and the Russoms which set these intermeshing cogs in motion. For now concern is whether United\u2019s <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> policy protects Enslen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>as an additional assured under the Omnibus Clause; and if it does, whether it must bear the loss altogether or can parcel all or part of it out to Enslen\u2019s insurer, Standard,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> especially since Standard was the moving figure<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the disposition of the Ohio suits and, as lender under a loan receipt,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is a substantial beneficiary of the jury verdict'and judgment below against United.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In the course of itjs defenses, United takes us on a spirited, nationwide juridical conflicts bus iide as it proceeds from Ohio to Texas,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Texas to Ohio, to Kentucky, and back to Ohio stopping en route only long enough to take on, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>passengers, favorable local jurisprudence but departing quickly lest unfavorable and unwanted principles might come aboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Beginning our fast travels, this time to ^ Ohio, United s contention that Enslen did not have Col. Critchfield s permission to use the car is, in this mid-twentieth automotive century, almost a feudal recrudescence. For despite the fact that the 1948 Oldsmobile was the Critchfield family car for use by both husband and wife and was loaned from time to time by Mrs. Critchfield with the Colonel s acquiescence to friends and relatives for temporary trips, United msists that the Colonel had never <em>expressly </em>clothed his wife with authority to allow others to use it, and Ohio, as a matter of law, declares that the named assured cannot impliedly authorize his permittee to allow sub-permittees to use the ve \u00edc e.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The claim is unsupported by facts and, if Ohio law applies, it does not impose this unrealistic result. Enslen was no stranger to the Critchfield household, Indeed, they had an acute interest in him as did he in the 1948 Oldsmobile. A few days before, about January 9, 1950, he had answered the Critchfield\u2019s classified ad offering this car for sale at which time the Colonel allowed him to take it on a short demonstration drive. A day or so later, he returned and, in the Colonel\u2019s absence, obtained Mrs. Critchfield\u2019s permission to demonstrate the car to his family for a couple of hours. Colonel Critchfield learned of this but never chastised or rebuked his wife or indicated, any more than would any other contemporary husband, that his wife had exceeded the scope of her employment, agency, or authority. Subsequently, a bargain was struck, Enslen gave the Colonel a $250.00 check as a down payment, and the next day Enslen and the Colonel drove the car to a bank to arrange financing. As some delay was encountered in financing, the car was to remain with the Critchfields until the transaction was closed. On the day of j-be accident, desiring to obtain a new set o;f tires for this car (he intended to use the Critchfield old tires on his present automobile to enhance its resale value)&gt; Englen sought&gt; and obtained, Mrs. Critchiield&gt;s permiSsion to drive the car tQ Cincinnati to buy some specially adver-tiged tireg&lt; Qn thig ^ the acddent 0CCurre(L When Colonel Critchfield returned a few dayg latei. he reported the accident to United on the assumpti011 that Enfll uging tbe car under these circuinstances, was covered. UsebyEns-len wag further ratified gince tWe wag subsequenlly transferred formally to Englen January 26) 1950_</p>\n<p id=\"ARy\">j-f this does not compel, at least it amply supports, the jury special findings that in lending the car to Enslen, Mrs. Critchfield \u201chad the implied authority of her husband to permit * * * Enslen to use * * * \u201d it and Enslen\u2019s use of the car was \u201c * * * with the implied permission of Colonel Critchfield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZJp\">If Ohio<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> law is the governing standard, then Fox v. Crawford, Ohio App., 80 N.E.2d 187, 189, does not, as United insists, forbid implied authorization, Portions of the opinion perhaps declare that the named assured may only give express permission to a user to allow others to use the car. But from the opinion as a whole, it is clear that all the case stands for is that authority in the permittee to allow use by a sub-permittee will not be implied merely from the original grant of permission by the named assured. But it does not remotely hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>that authority may not be implied. For it recognizes that it is but a question of agency and \u201c * * * authority to act for * * * [named assured] may be implied, as in other agencies, by acts and conduct, but in order to bind * * * [the named assured] by * * * [the permittee\u2019s] acts his authorization must be express, implied or subsequently ratified by * * * [the named assured] * * * \u201d; and in this process, the named assured can \u201c * * * signify her permission to use the insured automobile by a course of conduct, or * * * mere silence to bring * * * [the sub-permittee] within the omnibus clause * * * \u201d so long as \u201c * * * such implied permission * * * [was] by act or conduct of * * * the named insured, and * * * amounted to her intended selection of him as such driver * * And see Marolt v. Lisitz, 94 Ohio App. 298, 115 N.E.2d 169, 175; West v. McNamara, 159 Ohio St. 187, 111 N.E.2d 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Ohio then fits in with the general principle that whether the named assured authorized the permittee to allow others to use the vehicle is to be measured in a realistic way in which, once established, implied permission has exactly the same significant force as one expressly made with more elaborate formality. Indiana Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Ins. Co. v. Janes, 5 Cir., 230 F.2d 500; Pennsylvania Thresherman &amp; Farmers\u2019 Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Crapet, 5 Cir., 199 F.2d 850; United Services Automobile Association v. Preferred Accident Insurance Co., 10 Cir., 190 F.2d 404; United Services Automobile Association v. Zeller, Tex.Civ.App., 135 S.W.2d 161, error dismissed, judgment correct; Robinson v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York, 190 Va. 368, 57 S.E.2d 93; Drake v. General Accident, 88 Ga.App. 408, 77 S.E.2d 71; 7 Appleman\u2019s Insurance Law and Practice, Sec. 4365.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">A fact some underwriters are reluctant to appreciate is that,' by the Omnibus Clause, the insurer has! committed to the named assured a wide capacity to determine to whom and under what circumstances coverage will lie extended. Uncertainty, on the proofs, as to whether the assured has impliedly given his consent to the particular use does not weaken the decisive effect o:: it once that fact has been judicially dete ermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Enslen was, therefor entitled, as of right, to ed. s, an assured and defense by Unit-</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">But here United, now dissatisfied with Ohio, resumes its perambulations on this scenic-conflicts tour. The immediate cause is it? contention that disposition of the Ohio litigation, note 4, supra, was in reality a mere settlement and not an actual! trial required by the No-action Clause <footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of the policy. Fearing that Ranallo v. Hinman Bros. Const. Co., D.C.Ohio, 49 F.Supp. 920, affirmed Buckeye Union Casualty Co. v. Ranallo, 6 Cir., 135 F.2d 921, certiorari denied 320 U.S. 745, 64 S.Ct. 47, 88 L.Ed. 442, establishes for Ohio too loose a practice or that Section 9510-4 of the Ohio Code of 1948 may give an absolute statutory right to a jjudgment creditor to proceed directly against the underwriter, it speeds swiftly to Dallas, Texas, to obtain the benefit of Wright v. Allstate Ins. Co., Tex.Civ.App., 285 S.W. 2d 376, error refused, NRE, while carefully avoiding San Antonio, the situs of its home office, because of Great American Indemnity Co. v. McMenamin, Tex.Civ.App., 134 S.W.2d 734, writ of error dismissed, correct judgment, which it classes along with Ranallo. United asserts that the testimony<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of Enslen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>(Standard\u2019s) Ohio counsel, inlerentially rejected by the Court below as conclusions purporting to alter the judicial record of a judgment after trial, shows that this was but a voluntary settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Both Ranallo and McMenamin indicate strongly that if, in good faith, the ultimate decision is left to the Judge, if it is he who, on evidence offered, must determine whether judgment goes for plaintiff or defendant, and who then must fix the amount of the award, it is not the less adversary if counsel states that no appeal will be taken if judgment does not exceed an indicated amount. But we need not determine either the rule of conflicts or substantive law. For United, having breached, as we hold, its unconditional contractual obligation to defend, cannot hold the assured (or those deriving through him) to performance of a contract term that envisages a continuation, not repudiation, of mutual obligations. So long as there is no fraud or collusion wrongfully destroying or impairing the insurer\u2019s rights, repudiation of the insurer\u2019s duty to defend excuses <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> compliance by the assured (named or under the Omnibus) with the No-action Clause. The assured at that stage is entitled to handle the claim as would a prudent uninsured person.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">And this seems a wise and fair result. For the contrary would mean that, to protect the defaulting insurer against improvident settlements not controlled by it, the assured, left in lonely isolation facing the damage claimants, would have to expose his whole fortune to the risk<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of exorbitant jury verdicts with only the hope that some Court in some state would sometime hold, see Maryland Casualty Co. v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance Co., supra, that some insurer was liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">The interstate journey commences again, this time on United\u2019s Complaint of the Trial Court\u2019s refusal to join Standard as an involuntary plaintiff. United again departs Texas, this time for Ohio, not merely to seize onto Cleveland Paint &amp; Color Co. v. Bauer, 155 Ohio St. 17, 97 N.E.2d 545, and see, Rosenfeld v. Continental Building Operating Co., D.C.Mo., 135 F.Supp. 465, which it deems favorable, but to flee from the whole Fifth Circuit to escape altogether our decision in Celanese Corp. of America v. John Clark Industries, 5 Cir., 214 F.2d 551, and see, Augusta Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 5 Cir., 170 F.2d 199, which holds that where, under a loan receipt substantially similar to that involved here, note 5, supra, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Court has sufficient control to assure full trial of all claims and defenses and a final judgment binding on all. United States v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 338 U.S. 366, 70 S.Ct. 207, 94 L.Ed. 171, then Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. rule 17, 28 U.S.C.A. does not compel the joinder of the person advancing the funds. If the purpose here was to contaminate the jury's mind, this decision is decisive, and if the purpose was to assert acommon or liability-over, no harm could have come since this was fully presented and determined on Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"Avh\">United, not yet out of defenses or fuel, takes us next to Kentucky, the place of execution and delivery of Standard's policy. This concerns its contention that Standard, if not liable solely as primary insurance, should share pro rata under the Other Insurance Clause (note 2, supra). While there it seeks the advantage of the Sixth Circuit's decision of a Kentucky controversy in New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., 108 F.2d 653, 655, which perhaps holds that the phrase \"other valid and collectible insurance\" available to the insured refers to insurance then in force at the time of the issuance of the second policy. On this, and the fact that Standard's policy was issued prior to United's, it claims that the clause (note 3, supra) in Standard's policy that it \"shall be excess insurance\" could not apply as to insurance subsequently obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"AtT\">To make this side trip more inviting to the Russoms and Critchfields to whom -as well as United-Kentucky is a place foreign to any dealings or occurrences, United asserts that no Texas case is available and there is \"some degree of confusion in Ohio deci~ions.\" We think these perambulations unnecessary and unfruitful for Kentucky (State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co. v. Hall, 292 Ky. 22, 165 S.W.2d 838), Ohio (Traveler's Indemnity Co. v. State Automobile Insurance Co., 67 Ohio App. 457, 37 N.E.2d 198; Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co. v. Buckeye Union Cas. Co., Ohio App., 105 N.E.2d 568; Trinity UniversaI Ins. Co. v. General Accident, 138 Ohio St. 488, 35 N.E.2d 836) and Texas (Great American Indemnity v. McMenamin, supra) as do we (Continental Casualty Co. v. Suttenfield, supra; General Insurance Co. of America v. Western Fire &amp; Casualty Co., supra) give effect to the plain meaning of the words \"shall be ~xcess over.\" At the time of the accidei~it, at which time Enslen's rights attach~d, he had valid and collectible insurance as an additional assured under Unitt~d's policy. Until that coverage was exhausted, Standard had no liability under ~ts drive-other-car extension.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Acej\">This eliminates alto~ether the necessity of a slight deto~ir back to Ohio which United was pre~ared to make if the Kentucky journey was a failure to assert that under Ohio cases, Maryland Casualty Co. v. Bankers Indemnity Insurance Co., 51 Ohio App. 323, 200 N.E. 849; Standard Surety &amp; Casualty Co. of New York v. Metropolitan Casualty Co., Ohio App., 67 N.E.2d 634, Enslen (its own assured) was the ~uilty party so, as between it and Standarki, \"his\" insurance (with Standard) was primarily liable.</p>\n<p id=\"A87F\">Near the jourr~ey's end, we come finally to the contention that interest was recoverable only on those amounts adjudged to each plaintif<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> within its policy limits and not, as held below, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>full amount (\u00a725,032.98) of the Russom judgments from the date of the Ohio entry until United pays its portion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Acknowledging that, at least as to this, there are no Texas, Ohio or Fifth Circuit cases, United has no place in particular to take us, but insists<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that practically everywhere liability is restricted to interest on amounts within policy limits for which the insurer is liable. The District Court thought the words plain and unambiguous and following<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> two contrary cases and some insurance text writings, held that interest was recoverable on the full amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">We agree with the District Court. And for good reason. Payment of interest, as well as the obligation to defend, pay premiums on appeal bonds, pay expenses of insurer and assured in the investigation and defense of claims, are, by their nature, undertakings to pay sums over and above the policy limits frequently in substantial amounts which may, and often do, exceed the liability limits. Many of them bear only an accidental relation to the amount of the policy limits. Moreover, the policy,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> categorically stating this, presumably recognizes that, since the almost exclusive direction and control of the defense of the claim is in the insurer\u2019s hands and the assured takes independent action toward settlement or disposition only at his peril, the accrual of interest on the whole claim (for items within the coverage) is, in the overall strategy of defense, but one of the expected costs and, as any other, is to be borne by the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-17\">The journey thus ends where it began \u2014judgment against United on the jury verdict, which is</p>\n<p id=\"AM2\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-10\">. The vehicle involved, a 1948 Oldsmobile registered in the name of Lt. Col. Richard E. Critchfield, U.S.A.F., stationed in Dayton, Ohio, was, at the time of the accident, January 14, 1950, being used and driven by Enslen with the express permission of Mrs. Critchfield. Col. Critch-field was away from his home on an Air Force mission. Margaret Russom, Jean Lee and Thomas Combs, occupants of the Russom automobile were injured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-11\">. United Services Automobile Association issued its policy at San Antonio, Texas, September 15, 1949, the face of the policy showing \u201cName of insured\u201d to be Lt. Col. Richard E. Critchfield, Dayton, Ohio. Policy limits for bodily injury were $10,-000.00/$20,000.00 It contained the traditional Omnibus Clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-21\">\u201cIII <em>Definition of Insured. </em>With respect to the insurance for bodily injury liability * * * the unqualified word! \u2018insured\u2019 includes the named insured and<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> also includes any person while using the-automobile * * *, provided the actual use of tile automobile is by the named insured or with his permission. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-23\">As to P.L. and P.D. liability coverage, \u2022it also contained the usual \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5a\">\u201c18.

Standard Accident Insurance Company issued at Newport, Kentucky, August 1, 1949, a policy with $10,000.00/320,0C0.00 limits, with Norbert W. Enslen as \u201cName of insured\u201d covering his specified automobile. It contained a drive-other-ear extension of coverage so that insurance was available to Enslen while driving the Critchfield car.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The Omnibus and Other Insurance Clauses were identical with United\u2019s clauses, note 2, supra. Especially significant is the italicized portion Clause 18, note 2, supra, which makes Standard\u2019s drive-other-ear coverage \u201cexcess\u201d insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\">. Immediately on his return to Dayton, Col. Critchfield gave required notice to United of the accident, and it undertook investigation and handling of the claim on behalf of Enslen with no indication that coverage would be denied. On December 11, 1950, four suits were filed in Court of Common Pleas, Ohio, by the Russom group against Enslen. Apparently it .was the filing of these suits which led United on December 27, 1950, to demand, and obtain a non-waiver agreement from Enslen. Within two months, on February 27, 1951, United formally denied any and all liability to Enslen.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">Standard by non-waiver agreement, June 21, 1951, asserting failure by Ens-len to give notice prior to March 25, 1951, undertook the defense of these suits. October 18, 1954, the cases were heard and presented to the Court after waiver of jury trial. The plaintiffs testified; some medical testimony was put on; the defendant did not cross examine nor offer rebuttal evidence and Enslen\u2019s counsel stated in open court that if the court fixed damages in amounts not exceeding a specified . sum for each, defendant would not appeal. The Court entered judgment for those specific amounts:</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">Margaret Russom $20,003.00</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">James B.
