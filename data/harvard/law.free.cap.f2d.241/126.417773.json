In this situation the cause has become moot. Thus, in Weber v. Squier, 315 U.S. 810, 62 S.Ct. 800, 86 L.Ed. 1209, the Supreme Court, in denying a petition for certiorari stated: \u201cPetition for writj of certiorari * * * denied on the ground that the cause is moot, it appearing that petitioner has been released upon order of the United States Board of Parole and that he is no longer in the respondent\u2019s custody.\u201d The same result was reached in Sier-covich v. McDonald, 5 Cir., 193 F.2d 118; Factor v. Fox, 6 Cir., 175 F.2d 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">The petitioner, in resisting the entry of this order, cites Mackenzie v. Barrett, 141 F. 964, decided by this Court. However, the facts are not parallel.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-17\">Under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, we vacate the opinion of this Court and the judgment entered in pursuance thereof, and direct judgment to be entered for the respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
