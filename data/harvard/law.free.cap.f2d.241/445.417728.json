EDGERTON, Chief</author>\n<p id=\"pAsx\">Case, one of the The Denver Service Civil Aeronautics Board\u2019s major area proceedings dealing wjith proposals for new or improved air s with an application of Trans World Airlines, filed in 1945, to add Denver to its transcontinental routes conference, in which \u00a1the present petitioners did not participate, was held February 24, 1953. On April 3, 1953, petitioners, who are three large irregular air carriers and their \u00a1affiliates,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applied for extensive new routes, including one from San Francisco via Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago and other points to New York. They moved to application \u201c * * * thereof as the Board may deem proper in the Denver Service consolidate their or such parts \u00bfase and in other area proceedings. Tie Board consolidated the part of petit: that sought authority oners\u2019 application east of Chicago <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>with the New York-Chicago Service Case; another part with another case; and the part that sought authority \u201cbetween Los Angeles and Chicago via Denver and Kansas City\u201d with the Denver Service Case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">On April 29, 1954, some eight months after the initial consolidation order, and after another prehearing conference had been held, exhibits exchanged, and the proceeding noticed for hearing, petitioners m^ved for either (1) consolidation in the Denver Service Case of the part of their original application that sought authority east of Chicago, or (2) elimination from the Denver Service Case of \u201cthe issue of nonstop service from points east of the gateways\u201d (Chicago and St. Louis). Petitioners contended that awards to other applicants, coupled with existing routes of those applicants, would make such service possible, and that petitioners were entitled to simultaneous hearing in regard to it. The Board denied the motion, both as untimely and as unduly expanding the issues and delaying the case. After hearing, the Board denied petitioners\u2019 application for new routes. Petitioners appeal from both denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"> Ashbacker Radio Corp. v. Federal Communications Commission, 326 U.S. 327, 66 S.Ct. 148, 90 L.Ed. 108, held that mutually exclusive radio applications must be heard together. But the Court said: \u201cApparently no regulation exists which, for orderly administration, requires an application for a frequency, previously applied for, to be filed within a certain date.\u201d 326 U.S. at page 333, 66 S.Ct. at page 151. When we decided Northwest Airlines v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 158, 194 F.2d 339, no regulation of the Board required an application for consolidation to be filed within a certain date. But the Board\u2019s Rule 12 now requires that a motion to consolidate one application with another be filed not later than the pre-hearing conference on the other, unless \u201cgood cause\u201d for late filing is shown.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board granted petitioners\u2019 first motion for consolidation because it found good cause for its being filed late. The order granting that motion contained the very provisions on which petitioners, after long delay, based their motion for a further consolidation. The Board denied this later motion on the ground that it was not timely filed and that granting it would greatly expand the geographic scope of the proceeding. The Board did not act arbitrarily in denying this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Petitioners asked for authority to operate air coach service between large cities. Their contentions, fully set out by the Examiner, are chiefly that air transportation now requires the entry of a new passenger trunkline carrier, and that as low-fare coach operators petitioners have a unique record. The Examiner cited the Transcontinental Coach-Type Service Case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in which the Board recognized the benefits of coach service but did not conclude that certification of those offering such service would be in the public interest. The Examiner pointed out that the \u201cBoard\u2019s basic problem is still to increase competition while strengthening existing carriers to be self-sustaining in accordance with the mandates of the Act.\u201d The Board\u2019s awards to Continental and to Western were based in large part on a desire to strengthen those existing carriers. And the Board thought the services offered by North American would be for various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>reasons less \u201ceffective\u201d than those that other carriers could furnish. We think the record supports these and similar findings of. the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">After making these findings the Board said: \u201cFinally, we are denying North American\u2019s application because we are unable to find the applicant \u2018willing\u2019 to comply with the Act and the Board\u2019s regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this regard, we adhere to our findings set forth in the New York-Chicago Case.\u201d In the New York-Chicago Case the Board declared itself unable, because of past violations of the Act to find the present petitioners \u201cwilling to comply\u201d. When we reviewed that case petitioners argued, as they do now, that the Board should not consider their violations without considering those of other applicants. We rejected that argument, largely on the. ground that petitioners\u2019 violations \u201chad nothing to do with the Board\u2019s order\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, of course, the situation is different, at least in the Board\u2019s choice of language. But the Board\u2019s findings that the intervenors would serve the public interest by their proposed operations, whereas petitioners would not, were valid, and sufficient to support its action. Petitioners\u2019 application could justifiably be denied on the basis of those findings, absent some essential unfairness or failure to observe statutory requirements. We find neither in this case. Accordingly, no useful purpose would be served by our reviewing the Board\u2019s finding in regard to \u201cwillingness\u201d. Cf. Kuhn v.

Tlic Board afterwards amended its order to make it clear that the application involved San Francisco as well as Los Angeles.
