Without going into greater detail it will suffice to say that the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tion alleges in substance that on November 5, 1956 the stockholders of International Paper Company, a New York corporation, and the stockholders of two Missouri corporations, Long-Bell Lumber Corporation and Long-Bell Lumber Company, voted upon and approved a plan of merger; that on November 6, 1956 the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint charging that International by acquisition of the two Long-Bell companies had violated section 7 of the amended Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 18, in that such acquisition may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly as more particularly specified in the complaint; and that if the Commission, after hearings, should find that section 7 has been violated and should order International to divest itself of stock and assets acquired, \u201cit will be impossible to separate the acquired assets from those which are the joint result of the combined operations and the assets of International,\u201d if action contemplated by the respondent with respect to the acquired companies is allowed to occur. The prayer for injunc-tive relief in substance asks that the status quo be maintained until conclusion of the administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The Clayton Act contains a scheme of dual enforcement. United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303. Section 7 of the Act, and certain other sections not here relevant, may be enforced either by cease and desist orders of the Commission, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 21, or by suits in equity instituted by the several district attorneys in their respective districts, under the direction of the Attorney General, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 25. United States Alkali Export Ass\u2019n v. United States, 325 U.S. 196, 208, 65 S.Ct. 1120, 89 L.Ed. 1554. Individuals may also have injunctive relief against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the anti-trust laws under the same conditions and principles as govern the granting of injunctions by courts of equity, that is to say, district courts, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 26. These specific provisions as to who may seek injunctive relief, and in what courts, imply that the Commission itself is not authorized to do so. This implication is required by the statutory provisions of 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 21, under which a court of appeals acquires jurisdiction to review an order of the Commission only after the administrative proceeding has been concluded and a transcript of the record therein filed with the court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive upon the court, and if either party shows grounds for adducing additional evidence, the court may order it to be taken before the Commission. The Clayton Act clearly recognizes that a court of appeals has no fact finding powers, and that if an injunction is to be obtained by a United States Attorney or a private litigant it must be sought in a U. S. District Court under sections 25 or 26 of Title 15, U.S.C.A. Nor did this legislation contemplate applications by the Commission for interlocutory relief by way of injunction to maintain the status quo during the pend-ency of a proceeding before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Relying upon Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System v. Transamerica Corp., 9 Cir., 184 F.2d 311, the Commission argues that authority for it to seek an injunction here may be implied from the \u201call writs\u201d section, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), which authorizes the Courts of Appeals to issue any writ \u201cnecessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.\u201d But, since the pattern of enforcement adopted by the Congress in the Clayton Act makes clear that the Commission was not intended to have such authority, the \u201call writs\u201d section cannot be invoked to circumvent this limitation. And, if the Commission has no authority to seek an injunction, it is clear we have no power to grant it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>such relief! With all due respect to our brethren of the Ninth Circuit, we are therefore constrained to disagree with the conclusion arrived at in the Transamerica case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Action dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-5\">. Cf. Federal Power Comm. v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 304 U.S. 375, 58 S.Ct. 963, 82 L.Ed. 1408; In re National Labor Relations Board, 304 U.S. 486, 58 S.Ct. 1001, 82 L.Ed. 1482.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-28\">. It may well be that the Third Circuit in the recent Farm Journal case, D. 6388, also disagreed -with the Transamerica case, but, as no opinion was written, the precise ground on whibl the Third Circuit refused to grant the requested injunction does not appear.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
