The district court found as a fact that the cliib had a card room, a liquor room, a cocktail room; that ladies were allowed to come to the club and that from liquor sales alone a substantial profit was made by the club. Thereupon he found that the organization \u201cwas in truth and in fact a social club in which a large sum of money was made as profits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-18\">. The facts stipulated and testified to, fully support the findings of the trial court. They do not greatly differ from those which the court found present in the Downtown Club of Dallas v. United States of America, 5 Cir., 240 F.2d 159. On the authority of that case and in view; of the fact that whether or not the social aspects of an organization of businessmen are so material as to bring it within the provisions of Section 1710 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1710, and the applicable Treasury Regulation 43 (1941 edition, Sections 101.24 and 101.25) is -a question of fact, the judgment of the trial court is</p>\n<p id=\"b878-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
