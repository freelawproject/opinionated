DORSEY WA|TKINS, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b436-25\">This is an appeal by H. E. Crawford Company, Inc. (Crawford), plaintiff-appellant, from a judgment in favor of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Ire. (Dun &amp; Bradstreet), defendant-appellee, entered by the court after trial, under Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. rule 50(b), 28 U.S.C.A., on Dun &amp; Bradstreet\u2019s motion for directed verdict, in an action based upon an alleged libelous credit report.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-30\">Crawford is a North Carolina corporation. Since at least 1949 it has been engaged, among the production of textile knitting machines, knitting mad line attachments, and replacement partis. Its most important textile machine permitted machine knitting of argyle socks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-31\">In June 1949 Crawford had entered into a contract with Standard Hosier^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Mills<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Standard), under which Crawford produced argyle knitting machines exclusively for Standard, and Standard reimbursed Crawford for equipment for manufacturing the machines, together with the cost of the machines plus 10%, and paid Crawford a royalty<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of 10 cents per dozen on all socks made by Standard on these machines. Under this arrangement Crawford produced for and sold to Standard 151 argyle machines and received approximately $500,000 in payment for the equipment and machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">An accounting was reached on August 31, 1951 pursuant to which Crawford executed a note and chattel mortgage to Standard in the amount of $56,-017.90, the note being payable in two installments of $28,008.95 with interest, the first being due July 1, 1952, and the second July 1, 1953. The mortgage, in which Standard\u2019s attorney, Kenneth W. Young, was named as trustee, was secured by \u201call the capital, machinery and equipment owned by\u201d Crawford<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and by additional collateral.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On September 2, 1952, the note was in default, with an unpaid balance of $37,598.45. A renewal note for this amount, with the same security, was executed. Crawford was obligated to pay monthly installments of $1,500 and accrued interest beginning November 15, 1952, and a lump payment of $9,234.02 on May 1, 1953. Payments of $9,234.02 and of one installment of $1,500 were made.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In June or July, 1953, Standard\u2019s attorney discussed the overdue indebtedness with Crawford, and also discussed various possible settlements, including the assignment of amounts to be received on the delivery of various machines being built by Crawford under contracts hereinafter described. On August 6, 1953, Crawford was given written notice that if the unpaid principal and interest of $28,132.47 was not paid by August 10, 1953, legal action would be taken to enforce payment of the balance. No payment was made, and on August 10, 1953, an action was instituted in the Superior Court of Ala-mance County, North Carolina, to secure a judgment for the balance due. \u201cClaim and delivery\u201d proceedings<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ancillary thereto were issued with summons directed to the Sheriff of For-syth County to repossess the machinery and equipment, all of which were located in Forsyth County, listed in the chattel mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">Before the ancillary proceedings were sent to Forsyth County for service, Crawford arranged with Standard to hold up service of the claim and delivery on Crawford\u2019s undertaking to make an immediate payment of $7,000 on the indebtedness; to authorize the application against the note of a parts account of $6,663.50 owed by Standard; and to pay the balance of $14,832.50 not later than August 20, 1953. The indebtedness was reduced by the first two amounts, but the balance due August 20th was not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">In connection with the renewal note of September 2, 1952, Standard released <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>'Crawford from its obligation to manufacture argyle machines exclusively for <em>\u25a0it; </em>and Crawford released Standard from the payment of \u201croyalties\u201d on socks thereafter manufactured by Standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Beginning in December 1952 through August 1953, Crawford secured orders for 121 of its argyle knitting machines. Crawford was unable to finance the construction of these machines and accordingly required substantial advances from its customers at the inception of the contracts, far in excess of the 10% deposit required by its competitor. The customers therefore required Crawford to furnish performance bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The following contracts were obtained:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Griffin Hosiery Mills (Griffin), contract dated December 31, 1952, for 30 machines costing $66,000; deposit by Griffin of $50,000; machines to be delivered August 15, 1953;</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Bear Brand Hosiery Company (Bear), contract dated January 7, 1953, for 31 machines costing $70,000; deposit by Bear of $50,000; machines to be delivered August 31, 1953;</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Harriss &amp; Covington Hosiery Mills (Harriss <em>&amp; </em>Covington), contract dated March 2, 1953, for 30 machines costing $80,000; deposit by Harriss &amp; Coving-ton of $50,000; machines to be delivered August 31, 1953; and</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Unique Knitting Company (Unique), contract dated August 11, 1953 for 30 machines costing $78,300; deposit by Unique of $30,000; machines to be delivered December 31, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">The Griffin and Bear Brand contracts were each secured by a- $50,000 advance payment performance bond executed by Ceiitury Indemnity Company (Century) as surety. The Harriss &amp; Covington contract was secured by a $50,000 advance payment performance bond executed by United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company (U. S. F. &amp; G.) as surety.</p>\n<p id=\"pAeUN\">Each bond contained indemnity provisions, and each provided that changes in Crawford\u2019s financia condition were to be communicated to the surety,</p>\n<p id=\"AcD\">Crawford was unablej to secure a corporate surety for the Unique advance payment,' and the parties controlling Crawford gave their personal undertakings, secured by collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-15\">As of August 19, 1953 Crawford was in default on the Griffin contract; had delivered only 3 of the 131 machines due Bear by August 31, 1\u00d353; and had delivered only one of the 30 machines due Harriss &amp; Covington; by August 31, 1953.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-16\">Dun &amp; Bradstreet is\u00a1 a Delaware corporation, engaged, among other things, in the furnishing to subscribers to its service of commercial credit ratings and reports. In addition to a compilation of ratings, it furbishes reports upon individual companies pursuant to contracts each of which contains the provision that all information furnished \u201cshall be held in .strict confidence, and shall never be revealed or made accessible in any manner whatever to the persons reported upoii or to any others.\u201d i</p>\n<p id=\"b438-17\">Dun &amp; Bradstreet employs a number of investigators or reporters. It is their duty to investigate any person, firm or corporation assigned to them, and also to check courjt records and report any suits or judgments against anyone appearing in the Dun &amp; Bradstreet lists. The reporter in Alamance County in checking the court records for that county learned of the claim and delivery proceedings brought on August 10, 1953 by Standard against Crawford. He did not then have any of the reporting forms generally used by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, which permit specific indication as to 'whether the proceeding is a suit or a judgment. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>copied on plain paper and sent to the Dun &amp; Bradstreet office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (Forsyth County, where Crawford is located), the following :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201cStandard Hosiery Mills, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\u201cKenneth W.

As an ancillary remedy the plaintiff, Kenneth W. Young, Trustee, recover the possession of said personal properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-13\">\u201c3. That the Court order the sale of the said personal properties by the plaintiff, Kenneth W. Young, Trustee, for the satisfaction of any judgment obtained in this cause and that the plaintiff further recover the cost of this action to be taxed by the clerk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">No contention has been made that this was an inaccurate summary. In Winston-Salem, this was received in ordinary course by one of Dun &amp; Bradstreet\u2019s \u201creporters\u201d who dictated the following report on a transcribing machine :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-15\">\u201cInvestigation of Guilford County for court records reveal Standard Hosiery Mills, Kenneth W. Young, Trustee, obtained judgment against subject (H. E. Crawford Co., Inc.) in amount of $28,132.47 together with interest from September 1952. Investigation indicates subject has defaulted in payment of a promissory note dated August 13, 1951 and renewal obligation dated September 2, 1952 in amount of $37,598.45. The court has ordered sale of said personal properties of (sic) the plaintiff, Kenneth W. Young, Trustee, for the satisfaction of any judgment obtained in this cause, and that plaintiff further recover the cost of the action to be taxed by the Clerk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">No completely satisfactory explanation for the admittedly erroneous report was given. The reporter had dictated a number of judgment reports that day, and apparently treated this case as one of the series.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-18\">On or about August. 19, 1953, this report was mailed by Dun &amp; Bradstreet to 43 of its subscribers, each of whom had specially requested credit reports of and concerning Crawford.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-19\">At that time, in addition to the situation of Crawford with respect to its contracts for the production of argyle machines, set out above, Crawford was in the following position:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-20\">(1) Income taxes with interest, withholding taxes with interest and penalties, and social security taxes, in the aggregate amount of $12,889.11 were due and owing; (2) the Standard note was in default, and Crawford was unable to pay it; (3) Crawford could not meet its next payroll and could not finance its operations; (4) Crawford could not, and for several weeks had been unable to, obtain commercial bonds; and (5) trade accounts of some $23,000 were due.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-21\">On September 15, 1953, Dun &amp; Bradstreet was notified by Crawford\u2019s attorney of the errors in the August 19, 1953 report. On or about the same day a \u201cretraction notice\u201d was sent by Dun &amp; Bradstreet to each of the 43 subscribers to whom the August 19th report had been sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-22\">On June 22, 1954, Crawford sued Dun &amp; Bradstreet for the publication of a. \u201cfalse, malicious and defamatory libel.'1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>General allegations of loss and damage were made in the complaint, but without specification of parties or amounts. General and punitive damages were prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Dun &amp; Bradstreet pleaded as special defenses (1) that the August 19, 1953 report was a \u201cmistake * * * innocently made without malice or improper purpose,\u201d \u201cmade in the ordinary course of business and without any ulterior or malicious motive;\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the making and distributing of the report complained of * * * in no way affected the credit or reputation of\u201d Crawford \u201cunfavorably and resulted in no injury or damage to\u201d Crawford.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">At the end of the case, after a week\u2019s trial, Dun &amp; Bradstreet moved for a directed verdict. The court reserved its ruling on this motion, (F.R.C.P. 50 (b)) and the case was submitted to the jury on special issues. These issues, and the answers of the jury thereto, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asq8\">\u201c1. Was the statement published by defendant of and concerning the plaintiff materially false and libelous as alleged in the Complaint? Answer: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">\u201c2. If so, was the report published through carelessness and heedlessness on the part of the defendant? Answer: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">\u201c3. If so, was the report published with actual malice? Answer: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">\u201c4. What actual damages, if any, is the plaintiff entitled to recover of the defendant? Answer: $23,750.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-12\">\u201c5. What amount, if any, of punitive damages is the plaintiff entitled to recover of the defendant? Answer: None.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">' After the verdict, Dun &amp; Bradstreet renewed its motion for a directed verdict, and in the alternative moved for judgment in its favor notwithstanding the verdict, or for a new trial. The district judge heard argument on the motion, and rendered an opinion. He contractual obli-information con-subscribers had found as facts that Dun &amp; Bradstreet was under contractual obligation to furnish the August 19, 1)53 report to the 43 subscribers to vhom it was sent; that they were under gation to treat the fidentially; that \u201cthe an interest in such information and a duty commensurate with the duty imposed on the defendant to supply the information\u201d; and that there was no substantial evidence that Dun &amp; Bradstreet was activated by ill will, \u201cor that it acted in any true sense with a malicious motive or with actual malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-19\">As to the applicable law, the district court stated that (1) ijiad Dun &amp; Bradstreet \u201creported truthfully the information in its possession\u201d the occasion would be one of qualified privilege, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet would not be liable in damages, even although the information so published \u201c absence of proof that with malice\u201d; (2) where a person ports facts that are materially contrary to the truth that he has in his possession\u201d it cannot be said to have been \u201cdone in good faith, and where such a report is made that :s materially and substantially false and particularly if it is done in a negligent, careless and heedless manner, it would not seem necessary in that case to show that it was done with malice, before the aggrieved person would be entitled to damages\u201d; (3) \u201cderogatory financial report concerning a business establishment undoubtedly can be libelous per se and the Court thinks that such a report comes was false, in the it was published re-within the category o that is slanderous or f slander or libel libelous per se if it adversely affects the credit of a commercial concern\u201d; and (4) that the distinction between the facts stated in the August 19th report and the true facts at the time such report was published \u201cis not sufficient as a matter of law to constitute a (sic) report as being, materially different from the true facts, and it is on this theory that the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>is of the opinion that the motion for directed verdict should be granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"atp-dedup-1\">The Court entered judgment that \u201cthe motion for directed verdict should have been and is now granted in favor of the defendant * * *\u2022 ^un &amp; Bradstreet ^ excepted to the failure of the Court in granting the directed verdiet to include as a basis for granting the directed verdict the further grounds that the report was privileged and that no malice was shown that would destroy the qualified privilege of the de- \u201e ,' . , . , . ,, <em>j. </em>.i fendant, and to include the further . .. - grounds that there was no evidence of . . . ,, , . damage shown by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"aqo-dedup-0\">We reach the same result as the district judge, but by a different line of reasoning and upon different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"aia-dedup-0\">1. <em>Difference between true facts and publication.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AYgc\">We are unable to agree with the conclusion of the district court that there was no material difference between the true facts at the time of the August 19, 1953 report, and the alleged facts recited in that report. The question is not simply whether or not at that time Crawford was in a precarious financial condition. Nor is it simply a question of whether the truth would have hurt more (or less) than the publication, assuming that the publication caused any damage to Crawford. An action on a defaulted promissory note, for a judgment for an undue balance of $28,132.47, with ancillary possessory remedies, and with a prayer for an order of sale to satisfy a judgment if obtained, is different from a judgment for $28,132.47, for the satisfaction of which an order of sale has been entered. It is the difference between the mere institution of a suit, and the successful termination of a suit. To us, the difference is a material one.</p>\n<p id=\"A_-H\">2. <em>Qualified privilege.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3_\">The delivery of financial information by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a eorporation engaged in the collection and <em>dissemination </em>of such information, to subscribers, and only to subscribers, specifically requesting reports on Crawfordj would prima facie \u00a3aI1 within the gC0pC o\u00a3 privileged communications; \u00a3kat \u00a3\u00a3ie occasjon was privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"at-dedup-0\">... , . . .

On the contrary, the evidence clearly established that Crawford sustained no loss attributable to the publication, but if anything, received a benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">-In B adame v. Lampke, 1955, 242 N. \u2022C. 755, 756, 89. S.E.2d 466, the court announced the general rule that in case of unprivileged libel per se, the plaintiff would be entitled to- recover at least nominal damages, without any specific proof of injury or damages. \u2022 However, in Stevenson v. Northington, 1933, 204 ,N.C. 690,'694, 169 S.E. 622, a case of .libel \u201cundoubtedly actionable\u201d, the court seriously entertained the contention that the action should be dismissed because no damage had been shown, but found the point \u201cwithout merit\u201d, as plaintiff had proved financial loss, and injury to her reputation and standing in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"AH7\">This case was tried below on the theory that for plaintiff to recover it was .necessary for it to show actual damages. The bulk of plaintiff\u2019s evidence was devoted to that point. Its only request for instructions on damages was that \u201cthe defendant is liable for damages caused by or resulting directly and proximately from the publication * * * \u201d Among the issues it tendered for submission to the -jury was one as to \u201cWhat amount, if any, is the plaintiff entitled to recover of the defendant-by .way of compensatory damages?\u201d and a similar oiie as to punitive damages. It took no exception to issue No. 4, propounded by tjie court: \u201cWhat actual damages, if any1,, is the plaintiff entitled to recover of thje defendant ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A0g\">The court\u2019s charge to the jury repeatedly referred to the necessity that the publication occasion \u201cinjury\u201d or be of an \u201cinjurious nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-13\">In explaining the fourth issue, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-14\">\u201cIf the plaintiff is entitled to recover any actual damages at all it is entitled to recover such sum as will be a fair and just compensation for the injury, if any, inflicted by the defendant on the plaintiff by reason of the publication of a materially false and libelous statement which was published through the recklessness and carelessness of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">The court then devoted over one-fourth of the charge to a review of .\u201cthe contentions * * * with respect to whether or not the plaintiff had been damaged,\u201d concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-16\">\u201cIf you award the plaintiff <em>any damages at all </em>it is, your duty to award him such as he establishes by the greater weight of the evidence that he <em>actually </em>sustained as the immediate and proximate cause flowing from and due entirely to the publication of the report * * * The defendant * * * can in no event be liable for <em>any damage </em>except that \u00a1damage which immediately and prqximately flowed from the publication by the defendant of a false statement.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The plaintiff took no exceptions, and requested no other or different instructions. (F.R.C.P. 51). Not one word appears in the record on nominal damages or damages from the mere false publication of the report. On appeal, the plaintiff devoted only one page of its brief to this point, and of course gave no record citations that would support consideration of it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">This background is of great significance in the disposition of the points that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The availability of the defense of qualified privilege may, of course, be lost if the statement on such occasion is made with actual malice (as distinguished from legal malice, inferred merely from the falsity of the publication). Such actual malice, whether in connection with publication on a privileged occasion, or as a foundation for punitive damages, has been variously defined, although all definitions in substance come down to the equivalent of \u201cbad faith.\u201d For instance, actual malice has been defined as \u201cany indirect and wicked motive\u201d; an act done \u201cmaliciously or for no good purpose\u201d; an act \u201cgoverned by a bad motive\u201d (Stevenson v. Northington, 1933, 204 N.C. 690, 694, 169 S.E. 622, 624); injury \u201cinflicted in a malicious, wanton, and reckless manner\u201d; conduct \u201cactually malicious or wanton, displaying a spirt of mischief toward the plaintiff, or reckless and criminal indifference to his rights * * * \u201d (Broadway v.

Winslow, 1922, 184 N.C. 1, 5, 113 S.E. 570, 572). And in Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Watson, 4 Cir., 1932, 55 F.2d 184, at page 188 (a case from West Virginia), this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">\u201cIn the case, of a privileged communication, however, express malice as distinguished from malice in law must be shown; that is to say, if the occasion be privileged, the plaintiff may not recover, although he proves that defendant used language actionable per se, and that same was false, unless he goes further and shows that in using same defendant was moved by actual malice, such as ill will, spite, grudge, or some ulterior motive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">The trial court accordingly correctly instructed the jury as to the meaning of actual malice when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-12\">\u201cActual malice means ill will, spite or vengeance, bad motives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">He then continued immediately:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_Cm\">\u201cThere is no real direct evidence here that the defendant Dun &amp; Bradstreet had any ill will toward the plaintiff.

Kilgo, supra, 128 N.C. at page 412, 38 S.E. at page 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-16\">But the court did submit the issue of actual malice to the jury, which answered in the negative. A fortiori, the case should then have peen withdrawn from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-17\">In point is Fields v. Page Trust Co., 1928, 195 N.C. 304, 142 S.E. 7. In an action for libel, it was claimed that the defendant had returned <em>a </em>check negotiated by the plaintiff, with the endorsed notation \u201csignature forged.\u201d On issues submitted to them, the jury found (1) that defendant had caused the notation in question to be endorsed; (2) that the notation amounted t&gt; a charge that plaintiff had forged the check, or uttered it knowing it to have been forged; (3) that' such charge was false; (4) that defendant had actec \u201cin good faith in placing said notation on the check\u201d; and (5) that plaintiff sustained $150 damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-18\">The trial judge entered a verdict for the defendant, notwithstanding the verdict. This was approved in a four line opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-19\">\u201cJudgment was correctly entered for the defendant. The occasion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>having been a qualifiedly privileged one, and the jury having found that the defendant acted in good faith, the answer to the fifth issue was properly disregarded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-P\">Defendant urged in the court below, and in this court, that negligence in the transmission of an incorrect report destroys the defense of privilege.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Substantially the only case<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> cited in support of this position is Douglass v. Daisley, 1 Cir., 1902, 114 F. 628, 57 L.R.A. 475. In that case, the defendant<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Dun &amp; Bradstreet) had received from a correspondent a report that the plaintiff had made an assignment to secure the endorser of a promissory note. The Boston office of defendant reported this to subscribers as an assignment for the benefit of creditors. The court held that if by the exercise of ordinary care the mistake could have been avoided, \u201cthe privilege would fail.\u201d The acceptance of the construction of the opinion urged by Crawford presents several difficulties:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">(1) The court emphasized that the error occurred in the transmitting office, rather than in the field \u2014 in the collection of the information. If the rule of negligence is to be applied, we see no reason to distinguish between points of origin or occurrence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">(2) It is difficult to pinpoint the court\u2019s concept of negligence. It says that if the erroneous publication \u201cwas a pure mistake, involving no negligence or culpability, the privilege would not fail\u201d; \u201cwhether the variance resulted from an excusable mistake, or from indifference or heedlessness\u201d would be determinative. (114 F. at page 634).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">Defendant in the Daisley case had received a report on a general assignment form. The body of the report clearly disclosed the nature of the assignment. The continuance of the privilege was said to turn upon \u201cwhether reasonable care required the home office to read the whole paper and gather all the information that it contained, and whether it was reasonable to act upon the general appearance of the assignment form, and send the information which it did. If it was carelessness, the privilege was lost. If it was a mistake which could not have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>care, privilege and immunity were not lost.\u201d (114 F. 635). We do not regard this as furnishing a rule safely to be substituted for the requirement that actual malice or a bad motive must be shown to destroy the defense of privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">(3) The language of the court, and the disposition of the ease on remand, clearly indicate that although the publication be libelous per se, the plaintiff could recover only upon, and to the extent of, proof of actual damages. The court of appeals twice referred (114 F. at pages 634, 635), to the question of whether or not the publication was \u201cinjurious.\u201d In holding that recovery could be had for \u201cimmediate diminution of business and loss of credit\u201d the court approved instructions which had \u201cconfined the jury to such injury by way of diminution of business and loss of credit as they should find from the general facts and the whole situation was caused by the publication.\u201d (114 F. at page 638). The court pointed out that no question had been raised as to the sufficiency of the proofs of damage, and stated that the general rule as to compensation for injury \u201cwas given to the jury with a limitation in general terms that, in order to recover for diminution, the injury suffered must have resulted directly from the wrongful publication * * * must have been the natural consequence of the injurious publication, or such as naturally and proximately resulted * * * \u201d. (114 F. at page 638). In conclusion, the court stated that in view of the instructions as to damages (as to which no exceptions were taken) the jury were warranted \u201cto determine what part, if any, of the loss was attributable to the publication.\u201d (114 F. at pages 638-639).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">On remand, Daisley v. Douglass, C.C.1902, 119 F. 485, 486, the trial court referred to the \u201cmuch stronger\u201d case made by the defendant in the second trial. \u201cThe defendant has now introduced witnesses who show that all, or nearly all, partiesj who were subscribers to the defendant's reports to whom the libel was published, did not withdraw credit afteif the publication. He has met in that way, not with absolute certainty, blit with as much certainty as is possible in a court of law, the suggestion' that the jury might be justified in going into this unexplored field * <em>\u2022* </em>(119 F. 486).;</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The trial court therefore limited the recovery to the \u201cdilminution of the plaintiff\u2019s net profits \u00bfrising out of the proved loss of business\u201d, and ordered a remittitur of the excess, or a new trial. !</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">The only otherj citation by Crawford in support of the contention that defendant\u2019s publication had lost its privileged status is Harrison v. Garrett, 1903, 132 N.C. 172, 43 S.E. 594,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> holding that for the privilege to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>exist, there must be an honest belief in the truth of the statement. Such requirement may fully be accepted; but it is quite different from saying that every negligent act is committed in bad faith. The presumption is that a publication on a privileged occasion is made bona fide; and proof of falsity is not sufficient to establish malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u201cThe presumption in favor of the defendant arising from the privileged occasion remains till it is rebutted by evidence of malice * * Elmore v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co., 1925, 189 N.C. 658, 669, 127 S.E. 710; Yancey v. Gillespie, 1955, 242 N.C. 227, 230, 87 S.E.2d 210; Fields v. Bynum, 1911, 156 N.C. 413, 72 S.E. 449; Ramsey v. Cheek, 1891, 109 N.C. 270, 13 S.E. 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">No contention is made that defendant knew the publication to be false. No evidence was offered to rebut the presumption of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">In this case, the trial court expressly found that there was no actual malice. The jury expressly so found on an issue directed to that very point. In view of the North Carolina authorities above cited, requiring actual malice to destroy privilege, and defining malice in terms of bad motive, we are unable to find that negligence is the equivalent of, or may be substituted for, actual malice under the circumstances of this case.'<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">We therefore hold that the district court, under the circumstances of this case, should have directed a verdict for Dun &amp; Bradstreet on the ground that the publication of August 19, 1953, was upon a privileged occasion, and that the privilege had not been lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-19\">3. <em>Occurrences following report of August 19,1953.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-20\">The Dun <em>&amp; </em>Bradstreet report of August 19, 1953 was received by Century, surety on the Griffin and Bear contracts, on August 24, 1953. Century immediately called its local office and had its local attorney, Gay, begin an investigation. The attorney did not at that time see, and had not to the time of the trial seen, a copy of the Dun &amp; Bradstreet report. He immediately examined the Alamance County court records and then got in touch with the attorney for Standard 'from whom he learned the full details of the events leading up to the suit by Standard against Crawford on the promissory note and the claim and delivery proceedings. He persuaded Standard to withhold delivery of the proceedings to the Sheriff of Forsyth County pending further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-21\">Within the next day or two Gay discussed the entire situation with Bear and Griffin, and although his company was not on the Harriss &amp; Covington bond, he also had a conference with that company. On August 25, he saw Crawford, Sr., and received a general statement from him of Crawford\u2019s condition, which was later supplemented by a detailed financial statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-22\">Harriss &amp; Covington was not a subscriber to Dun <em>&amp; </em>Bradstreet Service, had not received a copy of the report, and did not know about it until Gay\u2019s conference. Harriss &amp; Covington then communicated with U. S. F. &amp; G., sure<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ty on its performance bond, and the adjuster of that company met with Gay. Thereafter, Gay reported to Century that because of Crawford\u2019s precarious financial condition, Century would either have to pay the two bonds or finance Crawford\u2019s operations by paying off the Standard note, advancing payrolls, and assisting' in the tax situation and in forestalling action by other creditors. He had hoped that U. S. F. &amp; G. would assume one-third of whatever costs might be involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Gay was able to persuade Griffin to extend the time for performance of its contract and \u201cafter much difficulty\u201d was also able to have Bear similarly extend the time for the performance of its contract. Harriss &amp; Covington was unwilling to extend the time for performance unless U. S. F. &amp; G. would guarantee a future schedule of delivery .\u2022of the 30 argyle machines. In view .of Crawford\u2019s situation U. S. F. &amp; G. was unwilling to undertake this obligation and on September 18, 1953, Harriss &amp; Covington served notice of its cancellation of the contract with Crawford and demanded return of the $50,000 deposit.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As late as November 12, 1953, Harriss &amp; Covington offered to take delivery of the machines upon a schedule extending from 30 to 114 days but Crawford declined to accept the offer as other arrangements had been made for the sale of machines. In fact, they were subsequently sold at higher prices.</p>\n<p id=\"A5x\">Century paid Crawford\u2019s payrolls from the last part of August to January, 1954, and made some payments on account to creditors for a total of more than $14,000, and incurred attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses of over $10,000; agreed on September 11, 1953, to pay off the Standard note, and on September 15, 1953, paid it in and took an assignment thereof. In adition Century assisted Crawford in working out plans with the tax authorities.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAD7\">Cen As a result of the ford\u2019s business by Bear and Unique<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> cot pleted in January or financing of Craw-tury, the Griffin, htracts were com-February of 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"AO9\">Although the activi permitted the perform; tracts for the manui; machines, \u2018 which othe: have been performed, ford in business, Crav it nevertheless was Dun &amp; Bradstreet re ities of Century anee of the con-acture of argyle rwise could not and kept Crawford claimed that damaged by the port in that:</p>\n<p id=\"anh-dedup-0\">(a) Manufacturers ing machines because of the report. No testimony of any potential customer was offered in support of this conclusion. In fact, in the Spring of 1954 Crawford turned its activities primarily to the marketing tachment to standard and received orders for 180 of these attachments in 1954 at prices between $1250 and $1425 per attachment. ceased purchas-of an argyle at-jknitting machines</p>\n<p id=\"AqH\">(b) Crawford contended that its bank credit was hurt by the report. Officers of the two local banks testified that the report was them and that no credit changes were made. The officers of one of these banks testified that had it received the Dun &amp; Bradstreet report, it would not have affected the bank1! had it known the true j: to the tax claims and the claim and not received by s credit policy but facts with respect delivery proceedings, would have been affected. An officer of a third financial which Crawford had as to financing testified that a decision not to finance Crawford had been made the credit policy organization to made an inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>prior to receipt of the report because of the \u201csevere financial condition\u201d of Crawford.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">(c) Crawford claimed credit changes on the part of customers or suppliers. The evidence totally failed to support these generalizations. After this litigation was begun, Dun &amp; Bradstreet communicated with each of the 43 subscribers to whom the report had been sent and prepared a tabulation of their dealings with Crawford. This summary was offered in evidence by <em>Crawford </em>and showed that in no instance was the report responsible for a change in policy toward Crawford. Specifically, with respect to U. S. F. &amp; G., its local attorney testified that the action taken by his client was not \u201cas a result of that report\u201d which was only part of the picture and one bit \u201cof evidence\u201d considered by him; and Century\u2019s attorney testified that its conduct was (as the trial court found) based upon the results of its own investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In short, the evidence requires the conclusion that the Dun &amp; Bradstreet report of August 19, 1953 was not itself the cause of the intervention by the bonding companies or the source of any loss to Crawford. The report merely stimulated the bonding companies to an investigation which would have been made had Crawford, as was its obligation, reported to the bonding companies the institution of the claim and delivery pi\u2019oceedings. What was thereafter done was as a result of the bonding companies\u2019 appraisals of the true situation, not the situation as reported by Dun &amp; Bradstreet. The effect of the intervention by the bonding companies permitted the continuation of Crawford\u2019s business which otherwise would have been impossible.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-32\">.
