The continuance sought was not for the purpose of preparing a defense, It was, as shown in the record, to consider a motion to be filed for hearing exceptions to criminal jurisdiction and to the indictment, and the record does not show any motion urging the unconstitutionality of the statute under which he was charged or that the court failed or refused to consider and determine all of the matters presented to him. Besides, neither the record nor appellant\u2019s brief, points out any prejudicial error in any action of the court, including his refusal to grant any of the defendant\u2019s motions, As the government\u2019s brief points out, the validity, scope, application, and effect of the statute have been determined adversely to appellant\u2019s contentions in eases cited by it, United States v. Borgis, 7 Cir., 182 F.2d 274 and United States v. Kelley, 2 Cir., 105 F.2d 912, and no cases holding to the contrary are cited by apPe^an</p>\n<p id=\"ass-dedup-0\">We come then to his counsel\u2019s primary contention, that appellant was incompetent to waive the assistance of counsel and conduct his own case, to find that the question of mental competency of the defendant was decided in favor of his contention that he was competent, by the district judge on competent professional evidence offered by the defendant;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the record is replete with evidence that defendant had had considerable acquaintance with and experience in regard to legal matters that throughout the long record he exhibited an understanding of the proceedings, a thoroughness in examination, and a pertinacity which belies the claim his counsel is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>now making that he was ignorant, inexperienced, and gullible, a lamb among wolves; and that the court therefore erred in permitting him, at his request, to conduct his own case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Throughout the trial, in the sentence imposed, and in the proceedings subsequent thereto, including his advising the defendant to appeal his case and authorizing his appeal in forma pauperis, the district judge evidenced patience and forbearance and a recognition of the defendant\u2019s age and frailties, together with solicitude of a rare order, to assure to the defendant every rightful protection. On this record, it is impossible for us to view the case, as defendant\u2019s counsel asks us to do, as one in which defendant had been denied due process or subjected in any way to a deprivation of his rights or suppose other than that the court will, under Rule 35 Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A. \u201cCorrection or Reduction of Sentence\u201d, give careful consideration to a reduction of the sentence, including placing the defendant on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">No prejudicial error having been made to appear,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"pAvS\">. (1) The question of the mental capacity of the appellant to fully comprehend and understand the nature of the proceedings against him.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab1h\">(2) The lack of knowledge on the part of the appellant as to the seriousness of the charge against him and the possible consequences or sentence that could be imposed if found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahy\">(3) The denial of the appellant s request for a continuance prior to trial m order to prepare a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"ajb-dedup-0\">(4) The admission into evidence of certain inadmissible or objectionable en-deuce without any objection being made <em>\u00b0nJ t,FarI f </em>* afpellant .</p>\n<p id=\"apb-dedup-1\">(5) The failure of the court to motions filed by the appellant urging the unconstitutionahty of the statute under which he was charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ASF0\">. \u201cThe Court: Is the defendant ready?</p>\n<p id=\"apd-dedup-0\">\u201cMr. Kaplan: The defendant is ready, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"AWG\">\u201cThe Court: And the court is advised that counsel appointed by the court is not representing the defendant, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"AUH\">\u201cMr. Kaplan: I would like to have a trial by jury, and I represent myself.
