Mc-Nutt argues that his constitutional rights were violated when the state trial court vacated his sentence of imprisonment in the state penitentiary \u201cfor not less than ten years\u201d and entered a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>judgment and sentence in which he was sentenced to a terna of \u201cnot more than twenty years\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-24\">Under the laws of Washington the first sentence entered by the state trial court was erroneous. When this fact was brought to the attention of the trial court, McNutt was; returned to the court and a correct sentence was entered. See McNutt v. Delmore, 47 Wash.2d 563, 288 P.2d 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>We have examined the various contentions raised by appellant and find them without merit. We agree with the reasoning of the Washington Supreme Court that when a sentence has been imposed for which there is no authority in law, the trial court has the power and the duty to expunge the void sentence and pronounce legal sentence, whenever the defect is discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
