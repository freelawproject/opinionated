The answer to this question in turn hinges on the legality of Giordenello\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-24\">On January 26, 1956, William T. Finley, an enforcement agent for the Bureau of Narcotics, obtained from the United States Commissioner in Houston, Texas, a warrant for the arrest of Giordenello on a complaint sworn to by Finley and asserting that Veto Giordenello did receive, <em>conceal, </em>etc. narcotic drugs, to wit: heroin hydrochloride, with knowledge of unlawful importation, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At 6 P.M. the following day, having seen Giordenello several times meanwhile and having followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>him to a residence other than his own, Finley and another agent waited for him to reappear. He did so about half an hour later, coming out of the back of the house, going into a garage, and then emerging and approaching the gate in the fence of the backyard. They identified themselves and put him under arrest, asserting they did so under the above described warrant, and took from him a paper package he was carrying in his hand containing five ounces of heroin. After being warned of his rights, appellant freely admitted the possession, telling the officers he had obtained the heroin in Chicago and that he had adulterated it and put it into small \u201cbindles\u201d or packets. He was later indicted and tried for purchasing these five ounces of heroin, which of course could not be the offense for which the warrant had been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Before the trial, appellant filed a motion to suppress the evidence of the officers relating to the seizure and admission of the possession as well as the heroin itself. The ground for such motion was that appellant was searched without a search warrant and without probable cause. The court overruled the motion to suppress. The case proceeded to trial before the court without a jury and resulted in a judgment of guilty and sentence of eight years for a second offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The real basis of the attack on the admissibility of the evidence is appellant\u2019s contention that the seizure was made without a search warrant (which is, of course, undisputed) and that it was not permissible as incidental to an arrest under United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653, and earlier cases, because the arrest was illegal. This was so, appellant says, because the arrest either was not made under the warrant issued on January 26th, or if it was, then the warrant was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Taking these latter two points in reverse order, we shall consider first the contention that the warrant was void when the arrest was made. Appellant contends that a warrant can be issued by the United States Commissioner, or judge, only upon a complaint sworn to by the prosecuting witness, stating the essential facts constituting the offense charged;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the complaint here, fn. 2, supra, did not contain a statement of the essential facts; and that upon the taking of the testimony of the affiant it was apparent that the statements made by him were not within his personal knowledge, but must have been based upon information furnished by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">The Government counters by saying that the allegation of receiving and concealing heroin hydrochloride with knowledge of unlawful importation was substantially in the words of the statute,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that this was sufficient to state the crime of which appellant was charged. Further the Government says that so long as the complaint is sworn to positively and not on information and belief, it is immaterial on the question of validity of the warrant that the officer did not acquire his knowledge of the facts from personal observation. Finally the appellee takes the position that the preliminary hearing is the place to raise all questions as to the validity of the arrest, and a waiver of such hearing makes such defense unavailable to the accused later in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">In view of the fact that the ground for our decision makes unnecessary an inquiry into the questions whether the arrest was actually made on the warrant; whether the complaint contained an adequate statement of the essential facts; and whether the warrant was valid if issued without the personal knowledge of the affiant of the facts asserted, we go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>directly to the final point made by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">When, as here, a person is arrested upon a warrant issued on a complaint he must be brought before the nearest United States Commissioner, without unreasonable delay.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It then becomes the duty of the Commissioner to inform the defendant of the charge and of his right to a preliminary hearing at which he can inquire into the probable cause of the arrest. If the defendant waives preliminary examination the Commissioner holds him forthwith to answer in the district courts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Here appellant was represented by counsel at his commitment hearing, and, as authorized under the rules, he waived preliminary examination, a proceeding at which he would have had full opportunity to test out the sufficiency of the complaint and legality of the warrant and the legality of his arrest under it or the presence of probable cause if arrested without a valid warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We are much persuaded by the language of the opinion in United States v. Walker, 2 Cir., 197 F.2d 287, certiorari denied 344 U.S. 877, 73 S.Ct. 172, 97 L.Ed. 679, where the court dealt with the three important points here at issue: Sufficiency of the complaint as to statement of essential facts; sufficiency of the complaint as to the personal knowledge of the offense; and the waiver of defects in the complaint by waiving preliminary examination. There the court said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201cThe appellant contends that his arrest was illegal because (1) the complaint did not set forth 'the essential facts constituting the offense charged,\u2019 as required by Rule 3, F.R. Cr.P.; (2) the complaint did not set forth the source of the government agent\u2019s information. Taking up these points seriatim, it appears that the complaint, printed in the margin, substantially follows the statutory language of the offense charged, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2314. Since an indictment in the words of the statute may be sufficient, Carter v. United States, 10 Cir., 173 F.2d 684, certiorari denied 337 U.S. 946, 69 S.Ct. 1503, 93 L.Ed. 1749, a complaint in the same form may likewise be; such is the case here. Point (2) seems to be answered by the fact that on its face the complaint appears to be based on personal knowledge of the complainant. See Rice v. Ames, 180 U.S. 371, 376, 21 S.Ct. 406, 45 L.Ed. 577. When arraigned before the commissioner in Maryland the appellant could have challenged the complaint on the ground that the complainant did not have personal knowledge, but his waiver of examination and consent to removal would, in our opinion, preclude a later assertion that the complaint was not sustained by legally competent evidence. In our opinion the appellant has not established that his arrest was illegal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">United States v. Walker, 2 Cir., 197 F.2d 287, at page 289. To be sure, the waiver in the Walker case was held by the court to apply only to the raising of the objection to the fact that the af-fiant did not have personal knowledge of the facts alleged. We can see no basis for not applying the same rule to the other objection, the sufficiency of the statement of fact. Both are based on the same provision of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, and neither is less subject to waiver than the other. Nothing to the contrary appears in the opinion of Judge Augustus N. Hand in the district court case of United States v. Ruroede, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 220 F. 210, 213. In that case there was no suggestion of the gist of the offense of which the defendant was charged, and the court properly held there would be no waiver, because the invalidity was plain on the face of the complaint and warrant. Here there is no such defect. There can be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>serious contention made that Giordenello was not clearly apprised of the offense for which he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We conclude therefore that if there were defects in the warrant and if the arrest was made without proper warrant or probable cause, which we discuss later but do not here decide, such defects could have been inquired into at the preliminary examination; that the waiver by appellant of the preliminary examination constituted a waiver of any such defects, and that he will not be permitted to raise the issues by motion later.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Much can be said moreover in support of the other points on which the Government relies to sustain the trial court\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">As to the sufficiency of the statement of the offense, it is difficult to comprehend what more would be necessary to apprise Giordenello of the offense of which he was charged than the language of the statute here used in the complaint. This is legally sufficient. Brown v. United States, 9 Cir., 222 F.2d 293. The warrant would therefore not be invalid for this reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">As to the objection that it must affirmatively appear that the officer made the complaint on his own personal knowledge, it has been held by the Supreme Court that if a complaint purports to be on the knowledge of the affiant this is sufficient to authorize the issuance of the warrant. Rice v. Ames, 180 U.S. 371, 21 S.Ct. 406, 45 L.Ed. 577; United States v. Walker, supra; and see the language of the Supreme Court in the recent case of Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, where on page 363, 76 S.Ct. 406, on page 409, 100 L.Ed. 397, the Court, speaking of the validity of an indictment based entirely on hearsay testimony said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">\u201cAn indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury, <em>like an information drawn by the </em>prosecutor, if valid on its face, is enough to call for trial of the charge on the merits. The Fifth Amendment requires nothing more.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">It is difficult to see how a strict rule nullifying a complaint because based partially on the evidence of others can now be urged in the light of the Costello case in which the sole issue was whether an indictment based wholly on hearsay evidence was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">As to the delay in the use of the warrant, nothing has been cited to cause us to hold that, once armed with a warrant valid on its face, an officer is denied the right to execute it at a time when he can catch the accused \u201cwith the goods.\u201d There was evidence of reports coming to Finley that caused him to believe Giordenello would obtain heroin from Chicago. He placed him under surveillance for weeks. Giordenello disappeared and later returned; he was driving an expensive automobile bearing an Illinois license; he drove to the place where he was arrested with a local suspicious character following him in another car bumper to bumper.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These facts would not have been sufficient to justify the use by Finley of the warrant solely as \u201can investigative technique,\u201d if by that it was meant that it was obtained not for the purpose of arresting Giordenello for the commission of the offense charged, but as an excuse to search him. Finley swore positively that such was not the case. Moreover, there was enough in the record to make it clear that an honest official might well have thought he was fully observing the legal restraints placed upon his actions, and that he had good cause for arrest even if the warrant already obtained was invalid since he believed he saw a felony being committed in his presence \u2014 a belief that subsequent events proved to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-16\">We recite these facts in spite of our holding that the waiver was sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>to meet the objections raised by appellant because it is clear from the record as a whole that no injustice is being worked on the accused by holding him to his waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Many roadblocks to the swift visitation of punishment on even such criminals as purveyors of heroin are, and must be, thrown up to assure a full measure of constitutional protection for the accused. That this sometimes l\u00f3akes difficult the apprehension and punishment of the guilty must be accepted as one of the prices we pay for constitutional government. There is a limit, however, beyond which the courts should not go. That limit, we think, has been reached when as in this case the person accused was accorded every opportunity to be informed of the nature and source of the charge against him, to test out the validity of his arrest and the strength of the Government\u2019s case in a preliminary hearing, and, having waived these privileges, he still had the right to a jury trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We think the evidence was properly admitted by the trial court and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"akc-dedup-1\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-14\">. \u201c\u00a7 4704. <em>Packages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">\u201c(a) General requirement. \u2014 It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, sell, dispense, or distribute narcotic drugs except in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package; and the absence of appropriate taxpaid stamps from narcotic drugs shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this subsection by the person in whose possession the same may be found.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-16\">.

My brothers adopt the holding of the Second Circuit that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">\u201cSince an indictment in the words of the statute may be sufficient, Carter v. United States, 10 Cir., 173 F.2d 684, certiorari denied 337 U.S. 946, 69 S.Ct. 1503, 93 L.Ed. 1749, a complaint in the same form may likewise be; such is the case here.\u201d United States v. Walker, 2 Cir., 197 F.2d 287, 289.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">With deference, I submit that that holding is a non-sequitur. The case cited by the Second Circuit in support of the holding, Carter v. United States, 10 Cir., 173 F.2d 684, passed upon the validity of an indictment as a <em>pleading, </em>and did not involve the validity of an arrest. It referred to the provision of the Sixth Amendment that, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation.\u201d As a matter of pleading, when the statute embodies all the elements of the crime, an indictment following substantially the wording of the statute meets the requirements of the Sixth Amendment, and, \u201cIf the defendants wanted more definite information * * *, they could have obtained it by requesting a bill of particulars.\u201d United States v. De Brow, 346 U.S. 374, 378, 74 S.Ct. 113, 116, 98 L.Ed. 92; see, also, Rosen v. United States, 161 U.S. 29, 34, 16 S.Ct. 434, 40 L.Ed. 606.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The added \u201cprobable cause\u201d requirement of the Fourth Amendment for the issuance of a warrant is rarely applied to indictments or informations, though occasionally bench warrants do issue upon them. In each such instance, however, the existence vel non of probable cause is not left to the arresting officer, but there is interposed the Grand Jury in the case of indictments, the United States Attorney in the case of infor-mations, and in all cases the court before issuing the bench warrant. As said by Judge Prettyman in Wrightson v. United States, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 390, 222 F.2d 556, 558:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">\u201cFor a warrant to be issued upon a complaint probable cause must appear from the complaint, and, of course, probable cause is inherent in an indictment or information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"avj-dedup-1\">The \u201cprobable cause\u201d requirement of the Fourth Amendment as a prerequisite to the issuance of a warrant is different and in some ways more stringent than the pleading or notice requirements of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">A United States Commissioner acts in a judicial capacity and should issue a warrant only upon competent evidence. The facts, and not the complainant\u2019s conclusion from the facts, should have been before the commissioner. Worth-ington v. United States, 6 Cir., 166 F.2d 557, 565. What was said by the First Circuit in Giles v. United States, 1 Cir., 284 F. 208, 214, is true here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-13\">\u201cIn this case, as no facts whatever were put before the commissioner, he was ousted from his judicial function, and remitted to a performance purely perfunctory. The prohibition agent was applicant, af-fiant, in effect the judge of the existence of probable cause, and the officer serving the writ. This is a very dangerous amalgamation of powers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">See, also, United States v. Ruroede, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 220 F. 210, 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">Nowhere has the requirement been stated more clearly than by Judge Bryant in United States ex rel. King v. Gokey, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 32 F.2d 793, 794:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-16\">\u201cThe commission of a crime must be shown by facts positively stated before a commissioner has jurisdiction to issue a warrant of arrest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>This protection is guaranteed to every person by the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) through the provision that \u2018no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.\u2019 This safeguard of liberty has been jealously protected by all courts. And well it should be, for it would be intolerable to allow a warrant of arrest to be issued upon the opinion, conclusion, or suspicion of some person, unsupported by facts. The \u2018oath or affirmation\u2019 required is of facts, not opinions or conclusions, The complaint must be supported by proof, so that the magistrate may exercise his judgment or discretion in determining that an offense has been committed, and that there is probable cause to believe the accused guilty of the commission thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">If by simple rote in copying the language of the statute, and without any facts in support of his conclusions, the complaining officer could supply the \u201cprobable cause\u201d required by the Fourth Amendment, then indeed has that requirement become purely formal and ritualistic and utterly deficient as a real and genuine protection to the privacy of the individual for which it was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">\u201cUnited States commissioners are inferior officers.\u201d Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U.S. 344, 352, 51 S.Ct. 153, 156, 75 L.Ed. 374. They have such authority only as is conferred upon them by valid statute or rule. Their authority to issue warrants of arrest is that prescribed by Rules 3 and 4(a), F.R. Crim.Proc.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-12\">\u201cRule 3. <em>The Complaint</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-13\">\u201cThe complaint is a written statement of <em>the essential facts constituting the offense charged. </em>It shall be made upon oath before a commissioner or other officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the United States.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-14\">\u201cRule 4. <em>Warrant or Summons upon Complaint</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-15\">\u201c(a) <em>Issuance. If it appears from the complaint that there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant has committed it, </em>a warrant for the arrest of the defendant shall issue to any officer authorized by law to execute it.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-16\">Thus, \u201cprobable cause\u201d must appear \u201cfrom the complaint\u201d itself, and the \u201cessential facts\u201d must be stated in the complaint. In the safeguarding of such fundamental human rights, the rules wisely leave nothing to speculation nor to oral testimony as to what was before the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-17\">The officer testified positively that in arresting the appellant he was executing the arrest warrant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Though examined at length by counsel for the appellant, and obviously evasive, he never would testify that he saw the accused commit any crime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The claim that the arrest can be justified as one for a different offense made without a warrant was actually put forward not by the arresting officer, but by Government counsel, and is a distinct afterthought. The appellant was charged with the different and later offense for the first time in the indictment. No complaint was filed with the commissioner for any such offense as would have been required by Rule 5(a), F.R.Crim.Proc., had he been arrested therefor,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and appellant was committed simply for the offense for which the warrant was issued. On that earlier offense the arresting officer had had ample time to get a warrant, as is evidenced by his having in fact secured a void warrant based upon his own sheer conclusions. As said by Judge Brown for this Court in the recent case of Clay v. United States, 5 Cir., 239 F.2d 196, 204:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">\u201cFinally, while the ease and practicability of obtaining the warrant of arrest or to search, Trupiano v. United States, 334 U.S. 699, 68 S.Ct. 1229, 92 L.Ed. 1663, is no longer an invariable rule of thumb, United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653, availability of the safeguards afforded by an impartial, judicial magistrate is a factor bearing on reasonable, probable cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">See, also, Shurman v. United States, 5 Cir., 219 F.2d 282; Rent v. United States, 5 Cir., 209 F.2d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-18\">Actually, it seems clear to me that the officer did not know, nor have probable cause to believe, that the appellant was committing a felony until he had arrested him, seized the paper sack from his hand, and searched that sack.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the arrest had then been made for the different and later offense, it would come squarely within what was said by this Court in Walker v. United States, 5 Cir., 225 F.2d 447, 450: \u201cThe arrest of appellant followed and did not precede the search and was based upon the result of the illegal search.\u201d The crime involved in Walker v. United States, supra, and that involved in Johnson v. United States, supra, upon which the Walker Case re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>lied, come much nearer being committed in the presence of the officers than did the crime charged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">My brothers hold, however, that the legality of appellant\u2019s arrest and search was effectively and finally conceded because not objected to at the preliminary hearing and again they rely upon United States v. Walker, 2 Cir., 197 F.2d 287. That case differs from this in many material respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In the first place it was not a direct appeal, as here, but was a collateral attack by motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255, and the Second Circuit commented that, \u201c\u201cSuch a motion cannot ordinarily be used in lieu of appeal to correct errors committed in the course of a trial, even though such errors relate to constitur tional rights.\u201d 197 F.2d at page 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Further in that case, the search was not incidental to an arrest, as here, but the defendant in that ease, while under arrest for a different offense, had confessed the crime for which, he was later indicted and convicted and had consented to a search of his trunks which produced the evidence used at the trial. The Second Circuit further commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201cThe evidence obtained by search was found in the appellant\u2019s luggage which was in the possession of Mrs. Ashe, who consented to the search. As we stated on the prior appeal, United States v. Walker, 2 Cir., 190 F.2d 481, 483, the appellant had no right to object to the search of premises not occupied by him nor to the seizure of property not within his possession.\u201d 197 F.2d at page 289.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A43\">The most important distinction between that case and this is that there the Second Circuit did <em>not </em>hold that Walker\u2019s waiver of examination precluded him from thereafter objecting on the ground that the complaint upon which the warrant was issued did not set forth the essential facts constituting the offense charged, but held to be waived that part of what the Second Circuit called point (2) objecting that the complainant did not have personal knowledge of the facts .and had not sustained his complaint by legally competent evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> I quote the exact language of the Second Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"auq-dedup-0\">\u201c * * * When arraigned before the commissioner in Maryland the appellant could have challenged the complaint on the ground that the complainant did not have personal knowledge, but his waiver of examination and consent to removal would, in our opinion, preclude a later assertion that the complaint was not sustained by legally competent evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">\u201c6. See United States v. Ruro-ede, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 220 F. 210, 213, where Judge Augustus N. Hand said: \u2018His waiver will prevent him, as I have heretofore said, from objecting to informalities or irregularities in the warrant or in the complaint. * * * The prisoner has a .right to have evidence produced in support of the complaint and to produce evidence on his part in answer thereto; in other words, to have the benefit of a preliminary examination. If he does not desire to have it and waives it, he cannot thereafter claim that he should have had it. In other words, the waiver is as broad as the privilege and nothing more.\u2019 Compare United States ex rel. King v. Gokey, D.C.N.D.N.Y., 32 F.2d 793, 795.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">True, the Second Circuit had already held that the complaint in that case did set forth the essential facts constituting the offense charged, and, with deference, I have hereinbefore questioned the soundness of that holding. Whether sound or not, however, it was in effect a holding by the Second Circuit in that case that the complaint was sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the commissioner to issue the warrant. The distinction is made entirely clear, indeed obvious, if, instead of the extracts quoted from Judge Augustus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>N. Hand in footnote 6 to the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion, quoted supra, we read the entire paragraph of Judge Hand\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">\u201cIt is urged, however, by the United States attorney, that, inasmuch as the prisoner at the hearing before the commissioner waived examination, he is debarred now from complaining of his confinement pending an investigation by the grand jury. There is no doubt that a waiver of examination does debar a prisoner from thereafter questioning infor-malities or technical objections to the regularity of the proceeding; but I do not think that any cases cited by the United States attorney have gone so far as to hold that a waiver of examination cured a complaint which upon its face discloses no facts indicating the commission of a crime. While the government in any case is justified as far as possible in keeping secret its evidence until a matter has been submitted to the grand jury, it cannot, I think, sustain a warrant of arrest for any reason or under any circumstances, where neither the warrant nor the complaint state facts constituting the crime that is charged, even though the prisoner has at the hearing waived examination. His waiver will prevent him, as I have heretofore said, from objecting to infor-malities or irregularities in the warrant or in the complaint; but it does not, I think, debar him from attacking a process which does not upon its face state the facts which constitute the crime charged. The meaning of the waiver is, I think, simply this: The prisoner has a right to have evidence produced in support of the complaint and to produce evidence on his part in answer thereto; in other words, to have the benefit of a preliminary examination. If he does not desire to have it and waives it, he cannot thereafter claim that he should have had it. In other words, the waiver is as broad as the privilege and nothing more. He has never by any conduct of his waived the right to object to the fact of being held upon a complaint which states no cause of action and upon a process which is, therefore, void.\u201d United States v. Ruroede, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 220 F. 210, 213-214.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Again the distinction appears from the other case referred to in footnote 6 to the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion, supra, United States ex rel. King v. Gokey, D.C.N.D.N.Y., 32 F.2d 793, 795, where Judge Bryant said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">\u201cThe fact that the records show that relator upon arraignment waived examination, and consented to await the action of the District Court, does not estop him from now questioning the legality or sufficiency of the complaint. A waiver of examination, if one is had, debars a prisoner from thereafter questioning informalities or technical objections to the regularity of the proceeding, but it does not, I think, deprive him of the right to attack a process insufficient to confer jurisdiction. United States v. Ruroede (cited above); People ex rel. Perkins v. Moss, 187 N.Y. 410, 80 N.E. 383, 11 L.R.A.,N.S., 528, 10 Ann.Cas. 309.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">A somewhat similar question was presented to the Supreme Court in Albrecht v. United States, 273 U.S. 1, 47 S.Ct. 250, 71 L.Ed. 505, where the information filed by the United States Attorney, upon which a bench warrant issued, had not been verified by the United States Attorney but was supported only by the affidavits of witnesses sworn to before a notary public \u2014 a state official not authorized to administer oaths in federal criminal proceedings. Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is, speaking for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-12\">\u201c * * * A bench warrant issued, and the marshal executed it by arresting the defendants. When they were brought into court, each gave bond to appear and answer, was released from custody immediately, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>and was not thereafter in custody by virtue of the warrant or otherwise. At the time of giving the bonds, no objection was made to either the jurisdiction or the service by execution of the warrant, and nothing was done then indicating an intention to enter a special appearance. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"abs-dedup-0\">\u201cThe bail bonds bound the defendants to \u2018be and appear\u2019 in court \u2018from day to day\u2019 and \u2018to answer and stand trial upon the information herein and to stand by and abide the orders and judgment of the court in the premises.\u2019 It is urged there was a waiver by giving the bail bonds without making any objection. We are of the opinion that the failure to take the objection at that time did not waive the invalidity of the warrant or operate as a general appearance.\u201d 273 U.S. at pages 4 and 9, 47 S.Ct. at pages 251 and 253.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Further on in that opinion, Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is makes it clear that, if we assume the existence of competent evidence to prove probable cause, it would be utterly futile to demand a preliminary hearing in order to object to an illegal arrest. Commitment, or, if necessary, rearrest and ultimate commitment, would result from the preliminary hearing just the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">No lawyer would dream (or so I think) that by failing to demand an apparently unnecessary preliminary hearing he had waived the right of his client when charged with a different offense to object to the legality of his original arrest and the search that followed. Instead of thus stretching conduct not so intended into a waiver, we should, I think, \u201cindulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights.\u201d Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461, quoted and approved in Emspak v. United States, 349 U.S. 190, 198, 75 S.Ct. 687, 692, 99 L.Ed. 997, and relied on by this Circuit in Ballantyne v. United States, 5 Cir., 237 F.2d 657, 665, 669.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Being of the firm view that the warrant was invalid, the arrest illegal, and the search unauthorized, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Rehearing denied; RIVES, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">. \u201cThe protection of the Fourth Amendment extends to all equally \u2014 to those justly suspected or accused, as well as to the innocent.\u201d Agnello v.
