The District Court treated the motion as one for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>judgment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> heard the matter, and ordered dismissal. This is an appeal from that order of dismissal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">A taxpayer\u2019s right to enjoin the collection of taxes is limited by statute under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, effective August 17, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">In that Code, \u00a7 7421 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">\u201c(a) Tax. \u2014 Except as provided in sections 6212(a) and (c), and 6213 (a), no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">\u00a7 6212(a) provides that after the Secretary or his delegate determines there is a deficiency, he \u201cis authorized to send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by registered mail.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">\u00a7 6213 provides that within ninety days after the notice authorized in \u00a7 6212 is mailed, the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the proposed deficiency.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">In such an event, \u00a7 6212(c) (1) provides that the Secretary or his delegate shall have no right to determine any additional deficiency of the taxpayer for the same taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, similar restrictions on the taxpayer\u2019s right of injunction existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">Section 272, as amended, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-13\">\u201cIf in the ease of any taxpayer, the Commissioner determines that there is a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter, the Commissioner is authorized to send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by registered mail * * <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">This Section then gives the taxpayer the right, within ninety days, to petition for a redetermination of the deficiency, and no assessment, distraint or proceeding in court for collection shall be made, begun, or prosecuted \u201cuntil such notice has been mailed to the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of such ninety day period,\u201d nor if such a petition is filed, \u201cuntil the decision of the Board has become final,\u201d and if attempted, \u201c[it] may be enjoined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-16\">The facts are undisputed. On March 11, 1955, the Commissioner sent a notice of deficiency by registered mail to the taxpayer at the <em>wrong </em>address. This notice is conceded by both parties to be ineffective for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-17\">On April 14, 1955, the Commissioner mailed a notice of deficiency by ordinary mail to the taxpayer at his correct address. It was received by taxpayer the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-18\">The appellant filed no petition for re-determination of the deficiency with the Tax Court at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-19\">On July 22 1955 (more than ninety days after the notice had been received) when no action was taken by the taxpayer, appellee gave written notice and demand for payment, and issued a warrant of distraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-20\">The sole question presented is whether the notice of deficiency so received by the taxpayer is a valid statutory notice. If so, appellant has no defense to the threatened levy and distraint. If not, appellee has no authority to levy and distrain, and should be enjoined from doing so until after notice has been given by registered mail, the expiration of the ninety day period, and the failure of taxpayer to petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-21\">The earlier cases, particularly those heard by the Tax Court, applied the statutory construction rule, <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>and held that \u201cnotice by registered letter\u201d meant notice in that way, and in no other way; that notice by ordinary mail, or manual delivery, was insufficient.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-22\">\u201cAny other method of notice does not comply with the statute and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>invalid. The method directed by the statute is mandatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Day v. Commissioner, 12 B.T.A. 161; Hamilton v. Commissioner, 13 T.Ct. 747, 749; Wilson v. Commissioner, 16 B.T.A. 1280, 1290; Heinemann Chemical Co. v. Heiner, 3 Cir., 1937, 92 F.2d 344; citing Botany Worsted Mills v. United States, 278 U.S. 282, 49 S.Ct. 129, 73 L.Ed. 379, where there appears this language, interpreting the 1924 Act: <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">\u201cWhen a statute limits a thing to be done in a particular mode, it includes the negative of any other mode.\u201d 278 U.S. 282, 49 S.Ct. 129, 132.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">But, argues the Government, the statute now has been revised; it does not now so \u201climit\u201d; it merely \u201cauthorizes\u201d one method of giving notice. It points out that the 1924 Act provided that notice <em>\u201cshall be sent </em>by registered mail,\u201d the 1926 Act, \u00a7 274(a), 26 U.S.C.A.Int. Rev.Acts, p. 203 was revised to provide that the Government was <em>\u201cauthorized\u201d to so send </em>the notice; that this word \u201cis a permissive word at most; \u201d that the real objective is actual notice. If notice by registered mail was deemed indispensable, runs the Government\u2019s argument, it would have been simple for the Congress to have so provided; i. e., \u201cnotice <em>must </em>be served by registered mail.\u201d We believe that this Court should attempt to give effect to the manifest intent of Congress, when it changed the requirement <em>\u201cshall </em>use registered mail,\u201d to the permissive <em>\u201cmay </em>use registered mail.\u201d We presume the purpose of using registered mail is <em>first, </em>to provide the safest economical. method of insuring that in the greater majority of cases, notice is actually received by the taxpayer from his Government; <em>second, </em>to create some commonly accepted factual basis to permit, in good conscience, the initiation of the ninety day period against the taxpayer, without requiring the Government to face the almost impossible task of <em>proving </em>actual notice to the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">But the heart of the taxpayer\u2019s right is to have actual notice, which enables him to petition his Government if he so desires. This he had here, under the notice he admittedly received by ordinary mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">We believe a broader interpretation of the language is followed in the more recent court cases. See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Stewart, 6 Cir., 186 F.2d 239, 241, 24 A.L.R.2d 793:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">\u201cThe taxpayer contends that since the statute requires the notice of the deficiency assessment to be sent \u2018to the taxpayer by registered mail,\u2019 the action of the Commissioner in sending it to the taxpayer\u2019s auditor and attorney, instead of to the taxpayer himself, was not a compliance with the provisions of the statute, and was therefore an invalid notice. The Tax Court ruled that since the statute limited the way in which the notice could be sent it negatived any other mode of action; that the Commissioner was required to send the notice of deficiency to the taxpayer in strict accord with the statutory requirements; and since he did not do so, the petition must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-10\">\u201cWe are of the opinion that such a strict literal construction of the statute is not authorized in the present case. It is clear that the purpose of the deficiency notice is to give the taxpayer notice that the Commissioner means to assess a deficiency tax against him and to give him an opportunity to have such ruling reviewed by the Tax Court before it becomes effective. Commissioner [of Internal Revenue] v. New York Trust Co., 2 Cir., 54 F.2d 463, 465; Commissioner [of Internal Revenue] v. Forest Glen Creamery Co., 7 Cir., 98 F.2d 968, 971; Olsen v. Helvering, 2 Cir., 88 F.2d 650, 651. In addition to giving the taxpayer notice of the proposed deficiency assessment, the mailing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>the deficiency notice limits the period of time thereafter to ninety days in which the taxpayer can have the question reviewed by the Tax Court. If the taxpayer receives notice of the proposed assessment, and during the ninety-day period thereafter files his petition for review with the Tax Court, the purposes of the Act have been accomplished. Although some courts have said that strict compliance with the statutory notice provisions is necessary in order to validate the assessment and to give the Tax Court jurisdiction to review it, we do not think that such a view is the correct one. In Commissioner [of Internal Revenue] v. Forest Glen Creamery Co., supra, the Court said, 98 F.2d at page 971: 'x\u2018 * there is no indication in the statute of an intention to require the notice to be on the basis of jurisdiction of the Board in a technical sense.\u2019 As pointed out by Commissioner [of Internal Revenue] v. New York Trust Co., supra, 54 F.2d at page 465, it is the taxpayer who invokes the jurisdiction of the Board by filing his petition to review. This Court has previously ruled that a failure to strictly comply with the statutory notice provisions does not necessarily deprive the Tax Court of its jurisdiction to act in the matter. Warner Collieries Co. v. United States, 6 Cir., 63 F.2d 34; Commissioner [of Internal Revenue] v. Nichols &amp; Cox Lumber Co., 6 Cir., 65 F.2d 1009. See also Burnet v. San Joaquin Fruit &amp; Investment Co., 9 Cir., 52 F.2d 123, 128. Under Section 272(d) Internal Revenue Code, the required mailing of the deficiency notice can be waived by the taxpayer without invalidating the validity of the assessment. In the following cases it was held that defects or irregularities in giving the required statutory notice were waived by the taxpayer\u2019s action in proceeding with a petition for review in the Tax Court, which thereupon acquired jurisdiction to determine the matter: Haag v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 59 F.2d 516, 518; Commissioner [of Internal Revenue] v. New York Trust Co., supra, 54 F.2d at page 466.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">\u201cIn the present case, the taxpayer received the full measure of protection guaranteed to him by Section 272(a) of the Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">We do not go as far as the majority did in Dolezilek v. C. I. R., 1954, 94 U.S. App.D.C., 97, 212 F.2d 458, in here holding that actual notice, plus a ninety-day period thereafter within which the taxpayer may act, satisfies the statute, and that a literal compliance is unnecessary. There the majority opinion held that the mailing of an <em>undelivered </em>registered letter starts the ninety-day period running, where the taxpayer had actual notice within the ninety-day period by manual delivery and \u201cadequate time remaining within such period for preparing and filing * * * \u201d his protest. The dissent of Judge Miller points out that he believes the legislative intent was that \u201cthe notice must actually reach the taxpayer * * * before limitation begins to run from the date of mailing,\u201d and in conclusion he states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-10\">\u201cMy opinion is that Congress intended to permit an application to the Tax Court within ninety days after the mailing of a final or ninety-day deficiency letter <em>which was actually delivered </em>to the taxpayer by the post office; and, in the absence of notice by registered letter, within ninety days after the taxpayer\u2019s actual receipt of notice delivered to him by some other method. Section 272 does not, as the majority say, provide for manual delivery. But such delivery is not forbidden, and <em>the use of registered mail is not mude exclusive. </em>The essential thing is that the taxpayer have notice, and not that he have it in any particular way.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aze-dedup-0\">We agree with this reasoning. Here' the essential purpose of the statute was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>accomplished. The rights of the taxpayer were protected. He received ae-tual notice in sufficient time to petition the: Tax Court to stay the levy and dis-traint, had he desired so to do. He chose not to do so, and he cannot now complain of an alleged technical deficiency which deprived him of no rights.</p>\n<p id=\"AEC\">Our conclusion herein as to the sufficiency of the notice is based upon the circumstances of this case and our reasoning is not meant as authority for holding that actual notice is sufficient in all cases where another specific kind of notice is prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"ApSO\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-22\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1340.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b719-24\">.
