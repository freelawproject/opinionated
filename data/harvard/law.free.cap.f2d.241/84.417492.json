P. G. Lake, Inc., 5 Cir., 241 F.2d 71 and Fleming v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 241 F.2d 78 this day decided, while the respondents here oppose to them substantially the same contentions and arguments advanced by the respondents in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Referring to, without restating the considerations upon, and the reasons for, which, rejecting the commissioner\u2019s, and sustaining the taxpayer\u2019s, contentions, we conclude that those cases had been correctly decided below, it is sufficient for us to hold that, upon those same considerations and for the same reasons, we conclude that this case was correctly decided and that the decision and order appealed from should be</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-12\">. Briefly and adequately stated, they are: In 1948 the George &amp; Wrather Drilling Company, a partnership, of which the taxpayer, John Wrather, was a member, sold and conveyed to the Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative Association, Inc. (herein called COOP) three oil payments carved out of their interests in two oil and gas leases which had been held by the partnership for more than six months. One was for $130,000, payable out of 9/10 of 7/24 of 7/8 of all of the oil produced and saved from the Brown Lease; the others were for $155,000 and $12,500, respectively, payable out of 9/10 of 5/16 of 7/8 of all of the oil produced and saved from the Kieffer \u201cA\u201d Lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-23\">As consideration for these assignments, COOP paid the partnership $287,500 cash which was treated by the partners on their tax returns as gain from the sale of capital assets. The oil payment out of the Brown Lekse paid out in a period of 4 years and the oil payments out of Kieffer \u201cA\u201d Lease paid out in a period of 5 years 5 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
