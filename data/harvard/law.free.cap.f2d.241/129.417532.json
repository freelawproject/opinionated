Rubinstein, D.C.S.D.N.Y.1955, 133 F.Supp. 496, it seems clear that a stateless person, such as Malaxa was conceded to be, is not a citizen or subject of a foreign state within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332(a) (2). The complaint was properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-27\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
