Neither did it undertake to hold that if, instead of a fictional or pretended sale, as the court found that the purported sale was, there had been a real sale of an oil payment \u00a1of $115,000, the court would have been! authorized to hold or would have held, that it was insubstantial in amount and, because and only because thereof, jit was not a sale.'</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>To the contrary, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">\u201cIt is clearly true, as already indicated, that an oil payment, like royalty, is an interest in property, an interest in realty, [and] an interest in minerals in place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">and declaring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">\u201cDeciding, as we do, that not every transfer of oil payments, even for a valuable consideration, amounts to a sale of capital assets under \u00a7 117, it becomes necessary for us to determine whether, under the established principles, this transaction was or was not such a sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">the court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\">\u201cUpon careful review of the cases and equally careful consideration of the circumstances of this particular transaction, we conclude that this was not such a sale, but was, rather, an assignment of anticipated income which remained taxable to the respondent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">This is to say, that the court, correctly concluding, on the whole facts, not that there was a bona fide sale which, because in amount it was insubstantial, did not come within Section 117, but that this was not a sale at all, it was a credit arrangement, which, though in form an assignment of the oil interest it purported to deal with, was in fact and in law nothing but an anticipatory assignment of income made as security for, and in payment of, Hawn\u2019s debt to the contractor, as correctly <em>held </em>that the course of dealings did not amount to a sale or exchange of capital assets under Section 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-17\">We, therefore, agree with the taxpayer that if, as commissioner contends, this court in the Hawn case did, and we should, without a legislative standard or guide, determine as matter of fact whether and where a time limit was to be drawn upon whether a sale of oil payments was substantial or insubstantial enough to constitute a sale entitling taxpayer to capital gains treatment, the result would be not deciding but mere fiating, or at best, unwarranted judicial legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-18\">If, however, on the other hand, as the Hawn case held and we hold, the court in each case takes all of the facts into consideration for the purpose of determining whether, as matter of law, a transaction was or was not a sale of capital assets, so as to entitle it to capital gains tax treatment under Sec. 117, the court would only be following and applying the rule laid down in the cases, that not every sale of capital assets, but only those which in law come under the statute, will support capital gains treatment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that it would be running a good principle into the ground if a taxpayer would be allowed to claim as a sale of capital assets the daily use of small portions thereof in connection with his business and the payment of his day to day expenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pA6A\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>That the transaction in this case was not of an insubstantial kind is shown, by the fact that it involved a cash sale for $9,990,350 of an oil payment conveying 4,000,000 barrels of oil in place, and by the undisputed facts and the oral testimony of two witnesses, the government\u2019s brief stating, \u201cThe oral testimony is un-contradicted and accordingly there are no disputed facts\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"ASq\">T, . \u201e ,, , , I*.18 f\u201c\u2019tjher ^own by the definite and precise findings of the district court which, after setting out the full transaction, categorically and specifically, found that the. transaction, was a bona fide and effective sale.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Based upon these findmgs of fact, he concluded as matter of aw*</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsJ\">\u201cThe transaction with D. E. Blackburn was a bona fide sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH-\">\u201cThe sale to Blackburn was a sale of a royalty interest in producing oil properties in Texas, subject to a revision to plaintiffs after the royalties had produced in Blackburn\u2019s hands the prescribed amount. This was a sale of| what is commonly called an oil payment. This oil payment was a real property interest under the law of Texas, and, under the tax laws, a&gt; property interest in o\u00fc -n lace. The transaction was not intended t be and was not as a matter of fact or a matter of j an assignment 0f \u00a1income, but was the gale of a property interest to Black_ b which property interest produced income in the hands of Black_ burn. This property interest was substantial and real, representing a substantial part of the grantor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>royalty interest. The property so sold was a long-lived, and not a short-lived, oil payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">\u201cThe property interest so sold to Blackburn was a capital asset as defined in Sec. 117 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and this capital asset had been held by plaintiffs for more than six months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">It will serve no useful purpose for us to set out here the undisputed facts on which the findings and conclusions were based. It will be sufficient to say that, on the record made, the district judge was right and his judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-13\">. Fleming v.

Blackburn) intended the transaction in question to be a sale and purchase of the royalty 'interests in question. They did not intend to enter into a loan or a mortgage transaction. At no time did the Executors, individually or in their fiduciary capacity, make any guaranty or agreement to indemnify the purchaser or enter into agreements with the purchaser other than the agreement to sell, as set forth in the deed. At all times, the risks incident to the presence and production of sufficient quantities of oil to make the 'transaction profitable for the purchaser were upon the purchaser. The purchaser, D. E. Blackburn, borrowed the purchase money from Chase National Bank of New York, giving his note and deed of trust on the properties purchased by him. The bank dealt only with Blackburn and looked only to him. The plaintiffs did not have anything to do with Blackburn\u2019s bank loan. The transaction in question was real and bona fide and was, in no sense, a sham or a subterfuge. Blackburn made a substantial profit on the transaction and reported and paid tax on his profit.</p>\n<p id=\"A4M\">\u201cThe purpose of the sale of the oil payment was a bona fide business purpose, to-wit, to raise rfioney to pay federal estate taxes and state inheritance taxes, due by reason of the death of Thomas O\u2019Connor, deceased, and to pay administration expenses lof the Estate. The Estate was in need! of cash resources with which to pay these charges and for these reasons the oil payment was sold.</p>\n<p id=\"Agc\">\u201cThe sale in question was the first and only sale of oil payments or other mineral interests that thp Estate had made until that time. Neither the decedent, Thomas O\u2019Connor, nor his Estate, was in the business of selling oil payments or other mineral interest. j The limited royalty interest, the oil payment in question, was uot held primarily for sale to customers,</p>\n<p id=\"ACF\">\u201cThe oil payment \u2018paid out\u2019 after three years of produdtion, during which the properties werej owned by Blackburn, The oil payment \u2019would have taken an appreciably longer period to pay out had it not been for the fact that there was an increase in the production in the field by the operating lessees and had it not been for the further fact that there had been a substantial increase in the price of oil shortly prior to the sale of the oil payment, wjhich higher price was maintained durin'g the period of the payout.</p>\n<p id=\"AtD\">\u201cThe royalty interest (or oil payment) sold to Blackburn represented a substantial part of the plaintiffs\u2019 oil in place, .Also, in terms of the relative values of the interest sold and of the revisionary interest retained by the sellers, the transfer represented a substantial part of the sellers\u2019 royalty interest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
