They were disallowed by the Commissioner on the sole ground that elections to claim the deductions were not duly and timely made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">Here, basing their case for relief on four specifications of error,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and arguing it under two points in their brief, that under the undisputed, indeed the stipulated, facts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the claims for refund for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>amortization of bond premiums (1) constituted timely filed claims for such deductions under Section 125 I.R.C., 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 125, and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto; or (2) if the regulations deny validity and efficacy to the claims for refund, they are invalid as in conflict with the statute allowing the deductions, petitioners insist that they are entitled under the controlling principles Of law to the deductions claimed. j</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The commissioner, pointing to the express language of l Section 125(c) \u201cElection on taxable aiid partly taxable bonds\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and to that |of the Treasury Regulations, Section j 29.125-4 \u201cElection\u201d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and citing cases'<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which it claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>are controlling in principle, urges upon us that petitioners are seeking not a construction of the statute but its re-writing, not a construction of the regulation but its nullification, and that the opinion and decision of the Tax Court was right and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Upon full consideration of the record, in the light of the respective contentions of the parties and of the opinion of the Tax Court, we find ourselves in full agreement with respondent\u2019s position, that for the reasons stated by the Tax Court in its opinion, with which we agree, petitioners\u2019 position is based upon the wholly untenable assumption: that, though Section 125 expressly conditions the deduction, it provides for, on the taxpayer\u2019s election by declaring: (1) that the section shall apply \u201c * * * only if the taxpayer has elected to have this section applied\u201d, and (2) that \u201cthe election authorized under this subsection shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary shall prescribe\u201d, the conditions imposed by the Statute and regulations made under its authority may be completely disregarded. Cf. Jeffries v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 158 F.2d 225; Trust Company of Georgia v. Allen, 5 Cir., 164 F.2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Proceeding upon this assumption, petitioners argue that what and all that is under attack by the Commissioner here is the established right of a taxpayer \u201cunless barred by the Statute of Limitations, to demand a correct computation of his tax for a past year on the facts as they existed, whether originally reported or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">In so arguing, we think petitioners overlook or disregard the controlling language of the section providing for the deduction, that it shall apply to a taxpayer <em>only if he has elected to have it apply and has made the election in accordance with the regulations, </em>and the controlling and admitted fact that they did not make an election in accordance with the mandatory provisions of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">The facts and the law standing thus, petitioners are presented with the insuperable barrier of seeking the allowance of a deduction when they have not shown, and cannot show, the existence of <em>the essential facts which condition its allowance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">It will serve no useful purpose to discuss or distinguish the numerous cases put forward by petitioners in support of their claim to the deductions sought. It is suffiieient to say that in our opinion, none of them are directly in point, and not one of them even indirectly supports the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">The judgment was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\">. Reported at 24 T.C. 888.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-10\">. \u201c1. The making and entry by the Tax Court of the United States of its decision of Dec. 7, 1955, insofar as it ruled that there was no overpayment of taxes for the taxable years ended April 30, 1944, April 30, 1945, April 30, 1946, and April 30, 1947, in the amounts claimed by Petitioners as deductions for amortizable bond premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">\u201c2. The holding and ruling of the Tax Court of the United States that the election to claim the deduction for amortizable bond premiums was not effectively exercised by the taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">\u201c8. The holding and ruling of the Tax Court of the United States that Regulation 111, Section 29.125-4 should be construed so as to deny to Petitioners the right to elect to take a deduction for amortizable bond premiums by means of claims for refund filed at the times and under the circumstances shown by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">\u201c4. The failure of the Tax Court of the United States to hold that if Regulation 111, Section 29.123-4 be construed so as to deny to petitioners the right to take a deduction for amortizable bond premiums by means of claims for refund filed at the times and under the circumstances shown by the record in this cause, it would be void and unenforceable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b545-20\">. In view of the full statement of the facts in the Tax Court\u2019s opinion, a brief statement here of the essential facts will suffice. The decedents of the taxpayer estates were husband and wife who, at the dates of their deaths in 1943, were residents of Houston, Texas. The estates of both decedents remained in administration until April 30, 1947, when they were closed by direction of the executors and the respective estates were distributed to them in their capacities as trustees. The substitute trustees named in the wills at all times material herein have been and are the duly qualified and acting trustees for the respective estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>At the date of death, each decedent owned a community one-half interest in a number of 4 percent Gold Bonds of the government of the Dominion of Ganada, having a par value of $2,000,000. The bonds were interest bearing. They provided for maturity on October 1, 1980, and were callable on and after Oct. 1, 1950, but not earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Galled for redemption on Oct. 1, 1950, the proceeds were credited and distributed equally between the two estates when received. No method of computing amortizable bond premiums was established by the decedents prior to their death or by the representatives of their estates during the taxable periods involved herein. j</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">The amounts of the 'amortizable bond premiums for the respective estates, computed in accordance with the method prescribed by the Treasury Regulations were stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Income tax returns were filed by each estate in 1944, 1945, 1946, and 1947, but no deductions for amortizable bond premiums with respect <em>to </em>the Canadian bonds were made in tlfe income tax returns filed for the respective estates. However, claims for refunds for each of the years were filed on! the dates shown below and in the amoufits as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">\u201cF/Y ended April 30</p>\n<p id=\"A9ol\">Date filed</p>\n<p id=\"A6p9\">Bessie A.
