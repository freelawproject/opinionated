The order was based upon the Commission\u2019s determination that petitioner\u2019s labels, describing the kinds or types and proportions of filling materials contained in pillows, did not meet the standards of accuracy under the Trade Practice Rules for the Feather and Down Products Industry.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In this court petitioner relies on grounds which stem from the Commission\u2019s acceptance of the results of tests conducted by its own expert witness and the rejection of those conducted by petitioner\u2019s experts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These grounds were not urged before the Commission. We are, therefore, not bound to consider them now.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">We note our agreement, however, with the Courts of Appeals for the Third and Second Circuits <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in sustaining the Commission\u2019s like evaluation of these tests in related cases involving other members of this industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">The petition to set as the Commission\u2019s ordei \u00e1ide is denied, and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A8e\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-28\">.

These grounds are: \u201c(1) that testimony of petitioners\u2019 experts had been, totally disregarded because it was not styled in a manner made mandatory subsequent to its introduction; (2) that testimony of petitioners\u2019 experts had never been weighed; and (3) that rejection of testimony of petitioners\u2019 experts constituted an amendment to the Trade Practice Rules without notice to petitioners.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b500-32\">.
