When the instant application for the writ was filed Henry had served the consecutive time of both the prior sentences, assuming the two first sentences are consecutive. The pri- or sentences also imposed fines which, as well as that in the instant case, have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-21\">It is apparent that the court had jurisdiction to determine the right to imprison Henry for these federal offenses in a habeas corpus proceeding and that the question was not one required to be determined in the court of conviction under 28 U.S.C. 2255. The latter section gives the court no power to do anything except to \u201cvacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\u201d Here the applicant is not seeking to do any of these things but merely to have construed the effect of the instant sentence with reference to the two prior sentences. Therefore habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy. Butterfield v. Wilkinson, 9 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 320, 321; Fleish v. Swope, 9 Cir., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>1955, 226 F.2d 310; Lipscomb v. Madigan, 9 Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 410; Mills v. Hunter, 10 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 468, 470; Brown v. Hunter, 10 Cir., 1951, 187 F.2d 543, 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Henry first contends that the phrase \u201cto run consecutively\u201d as used in the earlier two sentences is too indefinite to have any effect because there is no designation of which is to commence first. He relies on the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Daugherty v. United States, 2 F.2d 691. The Supreme Court reversed this decision and held that where sentences are to be served consecutively without more, they are to be served consecutively in the same sequence as the counts on which the convictions are based appear in the indictment, United States v. Daugherty, 1926, 269 U.S. 360, 46 S.Ct. 156, 70 L.Ed. 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Henry next contends that the phrase \u201cconsecutive with\u201d in the last decision is not the equivalent of the phrase \u201cconsecutive to\u201d in general use. On this he relies on a dictum in Bledsoe v. Johnston, 9 Cir., 1946, 154 F.2d 458, 459. We are of the opinion that this court has correctly overruled our above dictum in stating the law in Butterfield v. Wilkinson, 9 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 320, at page 322, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">\u201cAs respects the use of the phrase \u2018consecutively with\u2019 rather than \u2018consecutively to\u2019 it seems to us that for all practical purposes one manner of putting it is as clear as the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Henry next contends that the last sentence has already been served, because the court\u2019s statement as to its \u201cterm of two years\u201d that \u201cthey will run consecutively with any sentences [plural] that are pending against you\u201d restated as \u201ca period of two years to run consecutively with any sentences [plural] now serving\u201d, made the last two years begin to run after the first four-year sentence and concurrently with the first two-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">We accept Henry\u2019s contention that the words \u201cconsecutively with any sentences that are pending against you\u201d are, as he states, \u201cthe actual words of the court\u201d, and hold that the last sentence did not begin to run till after both of the two prior \u201cpending\u201d sentences had been served.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">We would reach the same conclusion if construing the other statement of the court that the last two years are \u201cto run consecutively with any sentences now serving\u201d. Sentences do not serve themselves and the phrase \u201csentences now serving\u201d is meaningless unless it is construed as \u201csentences now pending\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">\u2019 While we think that the contention that the words \u201csentences now serving\u201d should be expanded to read \u201csentences [plural] which the defendant is now serving\u201d is unwarranted, the same result is reached. The Hawaiian court well knew that the two prior \u201csentences\u201d were consecutive and hence again the plural word \u201csentences\u201d would be meaningless unless it meant a service of all the pending sentences. We think that here \u201cwe are dealing with a <em>cumulative sentence </em>composed of a number of distinct sentences which * * * [were] to run consecutively\u201d as was the Supreme Court in Affronti v. United States, 1955, 350 U.S. 79, 82, 76 S.Ct. 171, 173, 100 L.Ed. 62. The court in that case overruled our dictum in Kirk v. United States, 9 Cir., 185 F.2d 185, at page 187 that, \u201cA prisoner serving the first of several consecutive sentences is not serving the other sentences.\u201d In none of the other cases cited to us is the later sentence made consecutive to other plural \u201csentences\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">Even where the later sentence is to be consecutive to a \u201csentence [singular] the defendant is now serving\u201d and he has not concluded the first of three consecutive five-year sentences, the Tenth Circuit holds that the language means that the later sentence is consecutive to the last of the three prior sentences. Ong v. Hunter, 10 Cir., 1952, 196 F.2d 256, 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
