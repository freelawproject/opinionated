Service was made the next day on appellant\u2019s executive vice president, Cassell. According to affidavits in support of the motion to vacate, Cassell and appellee were denied re-election at a Board of Directors meeting on April 16, 1954, and they withdrew from the meeting without mentioning the suit and the service upon CasselL Appellee obtained judgment by default on April 26,1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-26\">It appears from Cassell\u2019s affidavit that one Walker, who was employed as a property manager by appellant corporation after April 16, 1954, knew of the suit and service of process before the entry of the default judgment. Walker\u2019s affidavit, executed a week or so after Cas-sell\u2019s was filed, is completely silent as to whether he had such knowledge or, if so, conveyed it to any officer or director. There is no dispute, however, that appellant was fully advised of the judgment no later than May 7, 1954. The motion to vacate was not filed until April 25, 1955 \u2014 almost a year later.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Appellant says its motion is premised on a breach of trust by attorney against client and therefore falls within Rule 60(b) (3), Fed.R.Civ.P. Under this rule a default judgment may be set aside for \u201cfraud * * *, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party.\u201d Appellant argues that a motion to vacate for such reason may be brought any time within one year. But the rule requires that \u201cThe motion shall be made within a reasonable time, <em>and </em>[when based upon Rule 60 (b^ than one year after the [default] judgment * * *.\u201d Thus necessary that the motic in one year, but also within a reasonable time within the one-year period. Upon the record before us, the latter requirement The District Court was, therefore, correct in denying the motipn.
