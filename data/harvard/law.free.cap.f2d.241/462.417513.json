The o ly contentions on appeal are: (1) that the evidence was not sufficient to justif the jury's finding that the oil was spiled by appellant's assured; and (2) th4tt the verdict was excessive. Both cont~ntions, purely factual, are so clearly `~,ithout foundatiQn on the present recor4 as to call for no discussion. We are 1ot~ however, satisfied that the appeal w~s \"sued out merely for delay\" so as tol call for the award of damages under P~ragraph 2 of Rule 30 of this Court, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"A_f\">The judgment is tl~ierefore</p>\n<p id=\"ArK\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
