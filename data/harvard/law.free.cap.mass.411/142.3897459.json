This appeal relates to one aspect of that challenge. We allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Each plaintiff argues, as a nonunion member obliged to pay a \u201cservice fee\u201d (G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 12 [1990 ed.]), that his or her First Amendment rights have been violated because no independent auditor has certified to the correctness of the allocation of chargeable and nonchargeable expenses, on the basis of which each union determined the agency service fee it charged. The plaintiffs contend that a report of such an independent audit must be delivered to them with the union\u2019s demand for payment of an agency service fee. They rely on what the Supreme Court said in <em>Chicago Teachers Union, Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>475 U.S. 292 (1986), particularly in footnote 18 of that opinion. They also assert that State constitutional principles support their claim. None of the intervener unions obtained independent audits of their determinations of which expenses were chargeable and nonchargeable. For the purposes of this appeal, we may assume that the unions otherwise provided adequate information to their agency service fee payers.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">We affirm the commission\u2019s determination to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 charges and not to issue complaints on them insofar as those charges are based on the absence of an independently audited verification of a union\u2019s separation of chargeable from nonchargeable expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>1. We turn first to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that their First Amendment rights entitle them to an independent audit verification of the union\u2019s determination of the expenses that are chargeable to them as agency service fee payers..That position has been rejected in every Federal Circuit Court of Appeals that has passed on it. See <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Education Ass\u2019n of Cheshire, </em>829 F.2d 335, 340 (2d Cir. 1987); <em>Dashiell </em>v. <em>Montgomery County, </em>925 F.2d 750, 754-757 (4th Cir. 1991); <em>Gwirtz </em>v. <em>Ohio Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>887 F.2d 678, 680 (6th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1080 (1990); <em>Ping v. National Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>870 F.2d 1369, 1374 (7th Cir. 1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See also <em>Antry </em>v. <em>Illinois Educ. Labor Relations Bd., </em>195 Ill. App. 3d 221, 243 (1990); <em>Kuehn </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, Council No. 65, </em>435 N.W.2d 130, 135 (Minn. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 849 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Each Court of Appeals opinion appears to give weight to the fact that, under the auditing process advocated by the challenging agency service fee payers, auditors would be rendering legal opinions as to the propriety of a union\u2019s allocation of certain expenses to the chargeable and nonchargeable categories. See <em>Andrews, supra </em>at 340; <em>Dashiell, supra </em>at 756; <em>Gwirtz, supra </em>at 682 n.3; <em>Ping, supra </em>at 1374. This reason for rejecting a constitutional challenge to the absence of an audited verification of the allocation of chargeable and nonchargeable expenses is not dispositive of the issue. Pursuant to proper guidelines founded on established legal consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>erations, an auditor could probably do a satisfactory job of properly separating chargeable from nonchargeable expenses. If that were done, agency service fee payers would be more apt to accept a union\u2019s expense allocations than in the absence of such an audit, and presumably fewer proceedings would be brought to resolve challenges to expense allocations. Even such a process, however, would not foreclose challenges to unions\u2019 classifications of expenses. These challenges to allocations would generally involve legal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The crucial question is not, however, whether an independent audit would be a good idea, but rather whether the First Amendment rights of agency service fee payers can be protected only if a report of such an independent audit accompanies a union\u2019s demand for payment of an agency service fee. The language in <em>Chicago Teachers Union, Local No. 1 </em>v. Hudson, 475 U.S. 292, 307 n.18 (1986), does not explicitly require such a practice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The uncertain language of footnote 18 provides no guidance to the resolution of the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">If, as we think, the language of the <em>Hudson </em>opinion is inconclusive, the issue remains whether the First Amendment rights of agency service fee payers can be protected only if the union\u2019s chargeable and nonchargeable expense allocations are independently audited. An audit of major categories of expenses should tend to assure nonmembers that the union indeed did incur the expenses on which the agency fee was based. Certain audited categories will have expenses all of which are obviously chargeable. Perhaps others will have expenses that are equally clearly not chargeable. The audits conducted in this case meet the plaintiffs\u2019 demands as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>those two classes of categories. The focus of dispute is on those categories in which some expenses are chargeable and some are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">An independent audit of a union\u2019s allocation of expenses in these mixed categories is not required in order to protect the plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights. The information that the union must provide under the <em>Hudson </em>opinion is not intended to be dispositive of any dispute. That information is designed only to permit an agency fee payer to decide whether to oblige the union to prove before an independent fact finder that the agency fee charged was properly determined. Information from an audit of chargeable and nonchargeable expenses might be helpful in making that decision, but it would not be conclusive, and in our judgment is not necessary to provide the First Amendment protections considered in the <em>Hudson </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The major threatened First Amendment impropriety that the Supreme Court has identified is the use of agency service fee payers\u2019 funds to support political candidates and legislative lobbying or to subsidize other political union activities, outside the union\u2019s duties as exclusive bargaining agent. See <em>Lehnert </em>v. <em>Ferris Faculty Ass\u2019n, </em>111 S. Ct. 1950, 1960-1961 (1991); <em>Abood </em>v. <em>Detroit Bd. of Educ., </em>431 U.S. 209, 234 (1977). The infringement that an agency shop makes on nonunion employees\u2019 constitutional rights requires that carefully crafted procedures be developed to minimize that infringement and to give an individual \u201ca fair opportunity to identify the impact of the governmental action on his interests and to assert a meritorious First Amendment claim.\u201d <em>Chicago Teachers Union, Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>475 U.S. 292, 303 (1986). Because the disputed portion of an agency service fee is not paid to the union until the challenge is resolved, there is no way by which the union can use a protestor\u2019s funds for impermissible purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">2. The plaintiffs argue that the Constitution of the Commonwealth requires an independent audit of a union\u2019s expense allocations. This argument is presented in less than two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>pages of their brief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Our previous opinions in this general area have not been based on State, as opposed to Federal, constitutional principles. See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Soc\u2019y of Professors/Faculty Staff Union, </em>405 Mass. 56 (1989); <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>397 Mass. 498, 503 (1986); <em>School Comm. of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>385 Mass. 70 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"ASZ7\">The plaintiffs have made no reasoned argument that this court should recognize a State constitutional right to an independent audit of a union\u2019s chargeable and nonchargeable expenses. They do not argue that the use of accounts to hold contested amounts in escrow while the dispute is being resolved is unconstitutional under the State Constitution. They do not claim that the procedure established by the Labor Relations Commission to resolve disputes over the calculation of agency service fees is unconstitutional because of the financial burden placed on a successful challenger to a union\u2019s expense allocation determination. In short, the plaintiffs presume, without discussion, that the State Constitution fully and exactly requires the processes that have been adopted in response to Federal constitutional principles and that one additional element is required by the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"Abl\">We reject a State constitutional argument that does not stand on a State constitutional foundation. We are unreceptive to an unexplicated argument that a State constitutional requirement should be grafted onto a process that has been formulated exclusively in response to Federal constitutional requirements. Here the plaintiffs have not identified a State constitutional right infringed by the absence of an independent audit of the sort they want that could not be adequately protected in some other way. We do not find in their abbreviated, facial challenge to the absence of an independent audit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>an argument that calls for a decision of this court on their State constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">3. We affirm the decision of the Labor Relations Commission dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that each union\u2019s explanation of the basis for its agency service fee violated the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights because the union\u2019s breakdown of expenses was not verified by an independent audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b162-17\"> Two United States District Courts have reached a contrary conclusion. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., </em>744 F. Supp. 938, 940-941 (C.D. Cal. 1990); <em>Hohe </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>727 F. Supp. 163, 167 (M.D. Pa. 1989). The <em>Mitchell </em>opinion did not acknowledge the contrary views stated in the three previously released Circuit Court of Appeals opinions cited above. In an earlier opinion in the same case, the judge had misread the <em>Gwirtz </em>case to state that there the union had presented an audited breakdown between chargeable and nonchargeable expenses. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., </em>739 F. Supp. 511, 515 (C.D. Cal. 1990). The <em>Hohe </em>court concluded that, in requiring a verification by an independent auditor, the Supreme Court must have meant verification of a union\u2019s breakdown between chargeable and nonchargeable expenses. <em>Hohe </em>v. <em>Casey, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\"> Footnote 18 says in part that \u201cadequate disclosure surely would include the major categories of expenses, as well as verification by an independent auditor.\u201d The requirement stated in that footnote of \u201cverification by an independent auditor\u201d does not tell us clearly what is to be verified. It seems to be merely verification of \u201cthe major categories of expenses,\u201d and, if so, that requirement does not aid the plaintiffs\u2019 argument for an independent audit separating chargeable and nonchargeable expenses within categories of expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"A48\"> The plaintiffs state that the union\u2019s governmentally granted power to seize agency fees is limited by arts. 1, 10-12 (due process), arts. 6 and 7 (no special privileges), and art. 16 (free speech) of the Declaration of Rights. They cite certain opinions in which we have acknowledged the existence or possibility of different results under the Constitution of the Commonwealth from those under the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
