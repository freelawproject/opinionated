In the underlying case, <em>Society of Jesus of New England </em>v. <em>Boston Landmarks </em>Comm\u2019n, 409 Mass. 38 (1990), the Jesuits successfully defended the Superior Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in their favor. At issue is whether the petition for appellate attorneys\u2019 fees is untimely and whether the claimed fees of $142,760.88 are excessive. We conclude that the petition was timely and that the Jesuits are entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements in the amount of $63,959.88.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">We begin by summarizing the following pertinent facts and procedural history. On May 12, 1987, the commission designated the interior of the Immaculate Conception Church as a landmark. Thereafter the Jesuits brought an action challenging that designation on Federal and State constitutional grounds. They also filed two other actions challenging subsequent acts of the commission on the same grounds. In all three complaints the Jesuits requested attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The cases were consolidated in the Superior Court. On November 2, 1989, a Superior Court judge held that the designation violated the free exercise clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and, consequently, granted summary judgment in favor of the Jesuits. We granted the commission\u2019s application for direct appellate review, and on December 31, 1990, affirmed the judgment on the ground that the designation violated art. 2 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. <em>Society of Jesus of New England </em>v. <em>Boston Landmarks Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 39. In their appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>brief, the Jesuits requested an award for appellate attorneys\u2019 fees in conformity with <em>Yorke Management </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 20 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">After the expiration of the time within which the commission could, as of right, file a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Jesuits filed their petition with this court for appellate attorneys\u2019 fees. The petition seeks attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $131,335, plus disbursements of $11,425.88, for a total of $142,760.88.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">1. <em>Timeliness. </em>Although the Jesuits\u2019 petition seeks fees under a Federal statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the question of the timeliness of the petition is governed by the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Greenfield, </em>384 Mass. 444, 449 (1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 947 (1982). There is, however, no specific Massachusetts procedural rule regarding the timely filing of a petition for attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The determination of timeliness is, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>fore, within the discretion of this court. See <em>White </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Dep\u2019t of Employment Sec., </em>679 F.2d 283, 285 (1st Cir. 1982). At the outset we determine whether we should exercise that discretion to bar the Jesuits\u2019 fee petition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Gary </em>v. <em>Spires, </em>634 F.2d 772, 773 (4th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The commission argues that the filing of the fee petition after expiration of the period during which a petition for a writ of certiorari may be filed creates an equitable bar to the fee petition. To support its claim that the fee petition should be filed within the period for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari, the commission relies on <em>Gary </em>v. <em>Spires, supra, </em>and <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Gotfredson Chrysler Plymouth, </em>708 F. Supp. 270 (D. Neb. 1989). In both cases trial judges had entered judgments in favor of the defendants who later moved for attorneys\u2019 fees. In <em>Gary </em>v. <em>Spires, </em>the court rejected as inequitable the defendants\u2019 demand for \u00a7 1988 fees because the defendants made their demand two months after the appeal period had expired, having never raised the issue earlier. In <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Gotfredson Chrysler Plymouth, supra, </em>the court denied the defendants\u2019 motion for \u00a7 1988 fees because the defendants filed their motion on the last day of the appeal period and the court found such a filing to carry with it a strong indication of unfair prejudice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Neither of these decisions, nor any of which we are aware, would bar a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees in this situation. The decisions relied on by the commission involve instances where no <em>notice </em>of the defendants\u2019 claims for fees was given until after judgment. That element is lacking here. In this case, in all three complaints the Jesuits requested attorneys\u2019 fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>under \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, in their appellate brief before this court, they requested appellate attorneys\u2019 fees. In our view, this constitutes sufficient advance notice to the commission that the Jesuits intended to petition this court for appellate attorneys\u2019 fees. Therefore, on these facts, the commission\u2019s claim of unfair surprise and prejudice is without merit. Since there was a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees at the outset of the litigation and at the time of appeal, even under the most restrictive interpretation of timeliness, the fee claim would not be time barred because the judgment did not resolve the issue of fees and, therefore, anticipated further litigation on the issue. <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Greenfield, supra </em>at 450-452.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">2. <em>Discretion to award fees. </em>We recently confirmed that under \u00a7 1988 \u201ca prevailing party should recover attorneys\u2019 fees absent special circumstances rendering such an award unjust.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>410 Mass. 188, 197 (1991), citing <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Bergeron, </em>489 U.S. 87, 89 (1989). There are no special circumstances in this case that would render an award unjust. That the burden of payment falls on the taxpayers is not a special circumstance warranting denial of the Jesuits\u2019 claim for attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 197. Neither is the prevailing party\u2019s ability to pay attorneys\u2019 fees a special circumstance prohibiting an award under \u00a7 1988. <em>International Soc\u2019y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>609 F.2d 151 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">3. <em>The amount of fees. </em>This court has adopted the guidelines set out in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974), <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> for calculating \u00a7 1988 fees. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number><em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 321-322 (1982). There we stated that \u201cfair market rates for time reasonably spent should be the basic measure of reasonable fees, and should govern unless there are special reasons to depart from them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See also <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 434 (1983) (the product of \u201creasonable hours times a reasonable rate\u201d normally provides a \u201creasonable\u201d attorneys\u2019 fee within the meaning of the statute; however, other considerations may lead a court to adjust the fees upward or downward).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The Jesuits have the burden of showing that the claimed rate and number of hours are reasonable. See <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 897 (1984).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To support their fee claim of $142,760.88, the Jesuits indicate that three lawyers spent six hundred thirty-four and one quarter hours on the appeal. The Jesuits contend that the hours billed are reasonable because of the difficulty of the case and the results achieved. By contrast, the commission claims that the hours are exces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>sive and unreasonable in relation to the actual work performed. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">As the commission has urged, we have compared the Jesuits\u2019 summary judgment brief and summary judgment reply memorandum with their appellate brief. On careful examination we find that the Jesuits\u2019 appellate brief was largely a duplicated, rearranged, and somewhat expanded version of their summary judgment brief. Undoubtedly, the attorneys spent time rethinking the arguments and editing and reorganizing the summary judgment brief into an appellate brief. But the time spent is unreasonable in relation to the final product.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The appellate brief is seventy pages long. Of the seventy pages, fifty are either verbatim copies or verbatim copies with minor changes of the summary judgment brief. Of the twenty new pages of the appellate brief, four pages are devoted to their successful arguments under art. 2. Yet the time billing summary indicates that one attorney spent approximately one hundred fifty hours drafting and preparing the appellate brief and still another spent three hundred hours researching, drafting, and preparing the same brief. In the framework of a \u00a7 1988 fee, we find unreasonable four hundred fifty hours spent producing twenty new pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The billed hours also reflect a duplication of effort among the attorneys and time spent that was unessential. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Georgia Highway Express, Inc., supra </em>at <em>717. </em>For example, the time records show that three attorneys respectively spent fifty-six hours, twenty-four and one quarter hours, and four hours for a total of eighty-four and one quarter hours preparing for the twenty-five minute oral argument before this court. The records also show time billed for the same three attorneys\u2019 attendance at oral argument. We find this time duplicative and unnecessary. Although there may be some benefit to having three lawyers prepare for and attend oral argument, it is difficult to justify what might be regarded by some as overkill when assessing a \u00a7 1988 fee against an adversary. <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Key Bancshares of Me., Inc., 111 </em>F.R.D. 369, 378-379 (D. Me. 1986). See, e.g., <em>Grendel\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number><em>Den, Inc. </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>749 F.2d 945, 952-953 (1st Cir. 1984) (considerably reducing claim of hours finding no justification for presence of \u201ctwo top echelon attorneys\u201d at each proceeding). We conclude that it is unreasonable to assess as comprising a \u00a7 1988 fee the entire four hundred fifty hours devoted to produce approximately twenty new pages, the entire eighty-four and one quarter hours spent to prepare f\u00f3r a twenty-five minute oral argument, and all the hours of three attorneys to attend oral argument. Accordingly, on the record before us, we award the Jesuits attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements of $53,959.88, an amount we adjudge to reflect reasonable hours expended on their appellate litigation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Finally, the Jesuits have requested a $16,000 fee for time spent to recover their appellate fees under the authority of <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 323 (1982). We award appellate fees in the amount of $10,000 under the principles discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">We conclude that the petition was timely and that the Jesuits are entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements in the amount of $63,959.88.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\"> Rule 13.1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court (1991).
