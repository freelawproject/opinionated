(Anthony\u2019s),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and HBC Associates (HBC),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> providing for HBC\u2019s acquisition and development of Fan Pier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">The development was halted in May, 1987, as a result of a dispute between Anthony\u2019s and HBC. In January, 1988, Anthony\u2019s sued HBC. On the same day, HBC brought suit against Anthony\u2019s. Each claimed contract violations against the other (as well as other claims). The cases were consolidated for trial. After a jury-waived trial, the judge ruled that Anthony\u2019s violated the express terms of the agreements and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The judge rejected HBC\u2019s claim that Anthony\u2019s was liable to HBC under G. L. c. 93A (1990 ed.). Thereafter, there was a trial on damages. The judge ruled in favor of HBC in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>sum of $42.6 million, plus postbreach expenses incurred by HBC and monies owed by Anthony\u2019s and others for the cost of joint development consultants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both parties appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Anthony\u2019s argues that we should (1) vacate the proceedings; (2) not accord the judge\u2019s findings and rulings any deference; (3) conclude that the inconsistencies in the judge\u2019s findings and rulings preclude appellate review; (4) reject the judge\u2019s determination that there was a material breach of the express contract; (5) reject the judge\u2019s conclusion that Anthony\u2019s had violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (6) affirm the judge\u2019s holding that Anthony\u2019s is not liable to HBC under G. L. c. 93A; (7) reverse the determination on liability for evidentiary errors; (8) determine that the judge erred in using an improper measure of damages, making erroneous evidentiary rulings on damages, committing a mathematical error, and awarding post-breach expenditures; (9) determine that the judge erred in holding a number of Athanas family ventures jointly and severally liable for environmental consultants\u2019 fees; and (10) reverse the judge\u2019s partial final judgment and enter a judgment for Anthony\u2019s. HBC cross-appealed the denial of its claims for violation of G. L. c. 93A. Both sides filed applications for direct appellate review. We allowed the applications. We affirm the award of expectancy damages, postbreach rent and taxes paid by HBC to Anthony\u2019s, and consultants\u2019 fees. We set aside the award of postbreach expenditures not attributable to rent or taxes. We reverse so much of the judgment as denied G. L. c. 93A damages to HBC. We remand the matter to the trial judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The judge found the following facts. Fan Pier is a parcel (approximately eighteen and one half acres) of undeveloped land located in South Boston. Fan Pier abuts Pier Four to the east. HBC\u2019s development plans for Fan Pier included a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>high-rise hotel, office towers, luxury condominiums, and a marina. At the time that HBC was developing Fan Pier, Anthony\u2019s was developing Pier Four. Anthony\u2019s was planning a smaller but similar development on Pier Four, which was also to include a hotel, condominiums, and office and retail space.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The agreements between Anthony\u2019s and HBC to develop the Fan Pier site, among other things, confer on Anthony\u2019s limited rights of approval of changes in HBC\u2019s basic development plan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, the 1983 development agreement provides that changes in the development team and the basic development plan shall be subject to the approval of Athanas. In the agreement, \u201cAthanas acknowledges that the [bjasic [development [pjlan was flexible and tentative since it was prepared before extensive engineering studies of the property were made and before HBC commenced the public process of obtaining permits and approvals. Therefore, Athanas\u2019s approval of a change in the [bjasic [development [pjlan will be required only if such change would have a materially adverse effect on the factors set forth in (i), (ii), or (iii) below [the review conditions].\u201d The factors are: \u201c(i) ensuring that the changes are consistent with the [b]asic [development [p]Ian as previously approved; (ii) ensuring that a hotel is located reasonably close to [Anthony\u2019s] remaining property to the extent consistent with its being a waterfront hotel, it being understood that HBC shall not be required to construct the hotel closer than Pier 2; and (iii) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>ensuring that the design of such hotel integrates with and is not detrimental to [Anthony\u2019s] property adjacent to the [Fan Pier site] . . ;</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The agreements also stipulate that \u201cHBC shall submit a reasonable explanation\u201d of any changes in the basic development plan. Anthony\u2019s covenants that \u201capproval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall be deemed given if Athanas has failed to respond with specified objections within fourteen days after receipt by Athanas of HBC\u2019s request and the requisite information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Anthony\u2019s and HBC\u2019s development efforts were cooperative, with shared consultants, coordinated planning, and joint filings for public approvals. Their goal was to develop projects which would-be fully integrated and compatible with each other. Representatives of Anthony\u2019s, including Athanas himself, appeared along with HBC representatives before numerous groups \u2014 from public agencies to the Boston Globe newspaper \u2014 to promote the Fan Pier and Pier Four projects.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Fan Pier project director met with Athanas regularly in order to keep him informed of HBC\u2019s progress and to review with him decisions HBC faced as it proceeded.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">In 1984, HBC changed architects for the Fan Pier project. Athanas and his sons travelled to Chicago with HBC representatives to interview the new architectural firm (the second architects). The second architects began work on a new master plan for Fan Pier that fall. They met with Anthony\u2019s architects to coordinate the development of the Fan Pier and Pier Four master plans.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The second architects presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>their preliminary master plan to Athanas at two meetings in November, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In March, 1985, Athanas convened a meeting with the Fan Pier project director to express his concern that the Fan Pier project was moving ahead of the Pier Four project, and reiterated his desire to have the two projects proceed in tandem through the government permitting process. In response, the Fan Pier project director advised Athanas to hire \u00e1 development adviser in order to ensure that the Pier Four development proceeded apace and in tandem with the Fan Pier project. A few months later, Anthony\u2019s hired such an adviser.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Through the spring and summer of 1985, the second architects worked on developing a \u201clesser scale alternative,\u201d a refinement of their first development scheme. In the fall of 1985, HBC learned that Anthony\u2019s had, like HBC, dismissed its first architect and retained a new architectural firm. The replacement firm was instructed to prepare a new master plan for the Pier Four development that would integrate with the Fan Pier plan. In late 1985 and early 1986, architects for HBC and Anthony\u2019s made a series of joint presentations of the Fan Pier and Pier Four plans to public and government agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In January, 1986, just before the filing for the first round of applications for governmental approvals, Athanas, his development adviser, and counsel met with HBC, its counsel, and project manager to review the Fan Pier plans in order to ensure that the plans for which public approval would be sought had the approval of Anthony\u2019s under the agreement. At the meeting, an HBC architect presented the design features of the plan, and other HBC representatives presented various development aspects of the plan, including the distribution of uses and the vehicular parking provisions for each use. HBC representatives also fielded questions about the plans. At another meeting held later that month, Anthony\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>counsel said that Athanas approved of the lesser scale alternative which had been discussed at the meeting.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In 1986, HBC prepared a video to show to potential Fan Pier development investors. The video included an interview with Athanas, in which he praised the second architects\u2019 design and its integration with the Pier Four design. That same year, Anthony\u2019s development adviser printed an informational brochure about the Pier Four project. The brochure, intended to enlist support for the project, was shown to potential investors and governmental and community groups. Athanas reviewed the brochure. The brochure spoke glowingly of the Fan Pier project and its integration with the Pier Four project.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In early 1987, Anthony\u2019s counsel, responding to HBC\u2019s request for written approval of HBC\u2019s revised development team and basic development plan, drafted a letter to HBC saying, \u201cWe see very little problem other than our concern of allocation between residential and commercial, which we reserved on approval of the original [bjasic [djevelopment [pjlan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">In the fall of 1986, Athanas and his development\"adviser learned that another harborfront deal had been far more lucrative for the landlord than the Fan Pier deal promised to be for Anthony\u2019s. They began to grumble about the price terms of the deal with HBC and to pressure HBC to increase the compensation to Anthony\u2019s. Initially, their demands focused on a claim that HBC was only entitled to purchase the area beneath the footprints<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the residential buildings at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ground level.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This claim threatened to frustrate HBC\u2019s plan to build the underground parking, which HBC viewed as necessary to the development\u2019s ability to attract tenants.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Anthony\u2019s development adviser said that, even though HBC was not entitled to purchase more land, Anthony\u2019s would be willing to sell HBC the land lying outside the footprints for a higher price than that provided for land purchases in the original agreements. While they did raise a few other financial issues, neither Anthony\u2019s nor its development adviser raised any concerns relating to the design features of the Fan Pier development at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">At a December meeting between the parties, Anthony\u2019s escalated its demands. On December 30, one of Anthony\u2019s attorneys called one of HBC\u2019s attorneys with more demands, stating that Athanas \u201cwas very unhappy with the deal that he had made back in 1983.\u201d At a January 23 meeting convened to discuss the outstanding issues, Anthony\u2019s did not express any objections to any design feature of the Fan Pier plans. At a mid-February meeting, Anthony\u2019s representatives complained about the lease that HBC had negotiated with a law firm that was to be the anchor tenant in the Fan Pier commercial real estate. At least as early as February 17, 1987, Anthony\u2019s retained a new law firm. They were retained, from the outset, to assist Anthony\u2019s in its efforts to alter the terms of the original agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">On February 25, Anthony\u2019s development adviser wrote a \u201cground lease issues\u201d list in which she identified the \u201cGoal\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>as obtaining \u201cmarket value for everything.\" She defined market value as \u201c$4 million per acre, or $40 per [Floor/Area Ratio] office square foot\u201d (far more than HBC was obligated to pay under the agreements). On the same day she drafted what she referred to as the \u201cbig red flag letter,\u201d so named because it was intended to attract attention. The main points of that letter were included in a letter sent the next day to HBC by Anthony\u2019s new attorneys. The letter identified as the \u201cmost serious questions\u201d Anthony\u2019s compensation under the agreement and the sale of land to HBC in connection with the residential real estate. After receiving this letter, HBC representatives met with Athanas to discuss the issue. At that meeting, Athanas said, among other things, \u201c[He] made a lousy deal, and [he] need[ed] more money;\u201d the \u201cwhole list of issues was really only about money and that he had to get more money to be satisfied;\u201d and that \u201chis kids were only going to get a lousy $750,000 a year out of [the] arrangement.\u201d At a meeting the next day, Athanas declared, \u201cWe have no deal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">On March 2, 1987, HBC responded to Anthony\u2019s letter of February 26 by communicating its desire \u201cto undertake immediately a good faith effort to discuss [Anthony\u2019s] concerns.\u201d At a March 4 meeting, Anthony\u2019s development adviser said that certain \u201cphysical, economic and timing changes,\u201d which, she asserted, had occurred since the agreements had been signed in 1983, \u201cwarranted\u201d Pier Four\u2019s position that HBC had to \u201crenegotiate\u201d its terms. Athanas again complained of being undercompensated under the agreements. Anthony\u2019s representatives still had not objected to any features of the Fan Pier design plans as of this meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">On March 18, Anthony\u2019s attorney wrote to HBC\u2019s attorney asking him to \u201cclarify\u201d the \u201cquestion of approval by [his] client of the basic development plan,\u201d stating that his \u201crecords [were] not clear on this point, so that [he was] unable to conclude whether or not the approval was given and, if it has, of what specific plan.\u201d On March 30, the attorney followed up his request with a telephone call, stating that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>had been unable to find any written approval of the Fan Pier plan in the file that Anthony\u2019s former attorneys had turned over to him. HBC\u2019s attorney responded by saying that there had been no formal, written approval, but that Athanas, his family members, and their representatives had expressed their approval of the project throughout the process and on more than one public occasion. The HBC lawyer also expressed his surprise that Anthony\u2019s lawyer had questions about approval of the plans at such a late stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Three days later, Anthony\u2019s attorney wrote to the HBC attorney: \u201cAs you know, on what we understand is the existing record, our position is that there has been no approval of the current development plan, which is, among other things, inconsistent with my clients\u2019 economic expectations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">This was the first time that an Anthony\u2019s representative had indicated that Anthony\u2019s did not approve of the Fan Pier development plans. In its May 18 response, HBC stated that it believed that no approval by Athanas of HBC\u2019s development plan (as it existed at that time) was required, because none of the changes in that plan materially, adversely affected -the \u201creview conditions.\u201d Nevertheless, HBC asked that Anthony\u2019s, in light of its letter, formally approve the current Fan Pier development plans. Only with such approval, HBC felt, could it continue to seek investment partners and government permits and approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Ten days later, having received no response from Anthony\u2019s, one of the HBC principals arranged to meet with Athanas. At that meeting Athanas said, \u201cThis is not about approval of the plan. This is about money. After you get the letter, let\u2019s sit down and we will talk about it.\u201d On May 29, Anthony\u2019s officially notified HBC by letter that its development plans for Fan Pier had been disapproved. The letter was signed by Athanas and said, \u201cMy view is that such approval is needed, that it has never been requested until now, and that it has never been given.\u201d In his letter, Athanas asserted that HBC had never provided him with an explanation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>of changes in the plan, and that he therefore was unable \u201cto evaluate the effect of the change on [his] interests.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGF\">When HBC representatives called Athanas a few days later, Athanas told them that HBC had a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to pay him more, and that they \u201chad plenty of room in [their] deal to pay [him] more money. That is why the letter was sent.\u201d When an HBC representative called Athanas\u2019s son, Anthony Athanas, Jr., to see if the deadlock could be broken, Athanas, Jr., responded, \u201cI\u2019d rather look out of my window on nothing than on a lousy deal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In response to Anthony\u2019s disapproval of the Fan Pier plans, HBC suspended its efforts to secure approval from various governmental agencies necessary to complete the project and stopped work on the project. It continued, however, to pay rent and property taxes and spent over two million dollars on consulting fees. It did not make public Anthony\u2019s disapproval, hoping to resolve matters and proceed with the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">On January 19, 1988, HBC and Anthony\u2019s brought suit against each other.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> HBC sought declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as well as restitution, specific performance and G. L. c. 93A damages. Anthony\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>sought declaratory relief and damages for the breach by HBC of its contractual duty to proceed expeditiously with the development,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and of its covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as well as G. L. c. 93A damages. The cases were consolidated for trial. The trial was bifurcated into phases on liability and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">In the phase I (liability) trial, the judge ruled that Anthony\u2019s purported disapproval of HBC\u2019s development plan was a breach of both the express terms of the agreements and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The judge found that, from August 1, 1983, when the hotel ground lease was executed, until May 29, 1987, when Anthony\u2019s sent the disapproval letter, HBC had proceeded expeditiously in normal sequence for projects of this type. The judge denied HBC\u2019s claim for violation of G. L. c. 93A. The judge further ruled that HBC had not violated its implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">At the conclusion of the phase II (damages) trial, the judge awarded HBC expectancy damages for breach of the agreements (and, in the alternative, reliance damages), plus additional amounts for reasonable postbreach expenses incurred by HBC and for money owed to HBC by Anthony\u2019s and other Athanas entities for the cost of joint development consultants.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">1. <em>Request to vacate the proceedings. </em>During the early part of the phase I (liability) trial, the judge met separately with the principals of each side and their counsel in an effort to help the parties reach a settlement. The judge asked counsel to sign a stipulation. The stipulation states, in pertinent part, that \u201cpersons present during the mediation session who have been, are or may be witnesses in the case will not speak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>to the Court concerning the events about which they have testified or may testify\u201d and that \u201cno claims for appellate or other relief will be made based on the process itself, and . . . no claim will be made that any finding of the Court is based on or affected by information the Court may receive during the mediation process.\u201d The judge approved the stipulation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Anthony\u2019s asserts that \u201cpublic policy demands the condemnation of the practice, regardless of any consent or waiver, and that a judgment following such practice must be held to be void.\u201d The short answer to this claim is that it is untimely, unfounded, and unmeritorious. In essence, Anthony\u2019s is claiming that litigants may \u201canticipate a favorable decision, reserving a right to impeach it or set it aside if it happens to be against them for a cause which was well known to them before or during the trial.\u201d <em>Krattenstein </em>v. <em>G. Fox &amp; Co., </em>155 Conn. 609, 616 (1965). See <em>Timm </em>v. <em>Timm, </em>195 Conn. 202, 203-205 (1985). No attorney and no litigant may use a \u201cheads I win, tails you lose\u201d strategy with a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u201cThe judicial process can hardly tolerate the practice of a litigant with knowledge of circumstances suggesting possible bias or prejudice holding back, while calling upon the court for hopefully favorable rulings, and then seeking recusal when they are not forthcoming.\u201d <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Nimmo, </em>796 F.2d 1230, 1234-1235 (10th Cir. 1986). See <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Eastman Kodak Co., </em>867 F.2d 1415, 1420 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1047 (1989) (\u201cthe risk of injustice to the parties weights far more heavily on [HBC\u2019s] side of the scales; . . . and the public\u2019s confidence in the judicial process . . . would be more likely to be undermined if the law were to countenance a sundering of the result [almost four years] later on grounds other than the merits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">2. <em>Deference to the judge\u2019s factual findings. </em>Anthony\u2019s relies almost exclusively on <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>381 Mass. 234 (1980), in arguing that we should not accord the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>findings of fact the customary deference. In <em>Cormier, </em>this court held that we would apply \u201cstricter scrutiny\u201d to findings of a judge \u201cwhich fail to evidence \u2018a badge of personal analysis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cormier, supra </em>at 237, quoting <em>In re Las Colinas, Inc., </em>426 F.2d 1005, 1010 (1st Cir. 1970). At the same time, however, we noted that \u201cthe \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard of review specified by [Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974).] is not displaced.\u201d <em>Cormier, supra </em>at 237. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkesworth, </em>405 Mass. 664, 670 (1989); <em>First Pa. Mortgage Trust </em>v. <em>Dorchester Sav. Bank, </em>395 Mass. 614, 622 n.12 (1985). Thus, even in the event of verbatim adoption of a submission of counsel, an appellate court \u201ccarefully scrutinizes the record, but does not change the standard of review.\u201d <em>Hawkesworth, supra </em>at 669 n.5, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marine Bancorporation, </em>418 U.S. 602, 615 n.13 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The record indicates that the judge so revised HBC\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions \u201cthat it is clear that the findings are the product of his independent judgment.\u201d <em>Cormier, supra </em>at 238, quoting <em>Markell </em>v. <em>Sidney B. Pfeifer Found., Inc., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 412, 418 (1980). Contrary to Anthony\u2019s claim, the judge did not reproduce HBC\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions verbatim. Although he adopted many of them, the judge also rejected a number of HBC\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions. In addition, the judge deleted specific language from some of HBC\u2019s submissions that he did adopt, incorporated some of Anthony\u2019s proposed findings, and drafted findings and conclusions of his own.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Anthony\u2019s claim on this issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>3. <em>Internal consistency of findings of fact and conclusions of law. </em>Anthony\u2019s directs this court\u2019s attention to a number of the judge\u2019s findings and conclusions that it alleges are internally inconsistent. From these purported inconsistencies, Anthony\u2019s argues that the judge\u2019s findings and conclusions fail to reflect the basis of his decision and therefore preclude appellate review. This claim is without merit.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Most of the alleged inconsistencies Anthony\u2019s cites do not arise from judicial error but, rather, are the product of Anthony\u2019s disagreement with the judge\u2019s'findings of fact, and his resulting interpretation of the agreements.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">As an example of the alleged inconsistencies between the judge\u2019s rulings of law and his underlying findings of fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Anthony\u2019s points to the judge\u2019s ruling that \u201cany changes between HBC\u2019s BRA [Boston Redevelopment Authority] [m] aster [p]lan [a version of the second architects\u2019 master plan revised by the BRA and the plan in effect at the time of the breach] . . . and the [b]asic [development [p]lan are changes within the meaning of the 1983 [development [agreement.\u201d This ruling, Anthony\u2019s contends, is inconsistent with finding 546, in which the judge found that the same plan \u201cis simply another \u2018interpretation of the narrative plan and its fundamental goals,\u2019 and as such is entirely consistent with the Basic Development Plan and <em>a fortiori </em>does not materially and adversely affect the three [r]eview [conditions in the [1983] [development [agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The judge determined that differences between HBC\u2019s BRA master plan and the basic development plan are \u201cchanges\u201d within the meaning of the 1983 development agreement, but that not all differences or \u201cchanges\u201d between the two plans trigger Anthony\u2019s disapproval rights because not all changes materially and adversely affect the three review conditions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We conclude that there is no inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Anthony\u2019s similarly argues that the judge\u2019s ruling that HBC\u2019s BRA master plan did not require Anthony\u2019s approval was inconsistent with his judgment for HBC. Anthony\u2019s argues, as it did at trial, that withholding approval that was not required cannot be a violation of the agreement. This assumes that, under the contract, Anthony\u2019s was required only to approve those changes that it might rightfully disapprove. The judge ruled, however, that the agreement provided that, where HBC sought Anthony\u2019s approval for a change, Anthony\u2019s was required to give its approval unless it rightfully could withhold it. The approval was needed to obtain both financing and needed governmental approvals and permits. The judge ruled that Anthony\u2019s failure to approve the change was therefore a violation of both the express agreement and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The purported inconsistency thus results not from judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>cial error but from Anthony\u2019s disagreement with the judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Finally, Anthony\u2019s argues that the judge\u2019s ruling that the BRA master plan did not require Anthony\u2019s approval renders superfluous the judge\u2019s findings that Anthony\u2019s in fact publicly approved the plan. This alleged inconsistency between the rulings of law and the findings of fact is based entirely on Anthony\u2019s interpretation of the agreements, which the judge rejected. As discussed above, Anthony\u2019s maintains that its disapproval of the BRA Master Plan could not be a breach of contract because its approval was not required. The judge found, however, that Anthony\u2019s already had publicly approved the plan. These findings form part of the factual basis for the judge\u2019s conclusion that Anthony\u2019s purported disapproval letter of May 29, 1987, was a violation of the express agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">4. <em>Violation of the express agreement. </em>Under the 1983 agreements, Anthony\u2019s had the right to disapprove changes in the basic development plan only to the extent that such changes had \u201cmaterially adverse effect [s]\u201d on one of the review conditions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See note 21, <em>supra. </em>The judge ruled that the changes embodied in the BRA master plan did not have a \u201cmaterially adverse effect\u201d on the review conditions. Anthony\u2019s, therefore, had no right to disapprove them. The judge further ruled that Anthony\u2019s approval of the BRA master plan had been \u201cunreasonably withheld\u201d in violation of its contractual duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Anthony\u2019s disputes the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the changes embodied in the BRA master plan had no \u201cmaterially adverse effect\u201d on the review conditions. Anthony\u2019s claims that by replacing the first architect\u2019s master plan with the BRA master plan, HBC scrapped the basic development plan and substituted another, quite different blueprint for de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>velopment. Anthony\u2019s maintains that this action clearly was inconsistent with the basic development plan \u2014 as it replaced that plan with another. Anthony\u2019s claims that it therefore had a right under the contract to disapprove the BRA development plan unless HBC provided it with a reasonable explanation of the changes.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Because HBC failed to submit such an explanation, Anthony\u2019s contends, Anthony\u2019s disapproval of the BRA master plan was not a violation of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">At root, this claim is grounded on Anthony\u2019s contention that the original master plan was the basic development plan.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The judge, however, expressly rejected that contention. The judge found that although the original master plan resembled the basic development plan, the two differed from one another on the very details that Anthony\u2019s purported to disapprove in the later BRA master plan. The substitution of the BRA master plan for the original master plan was not a change that, in itself, threatened inconsistency with the basic development plan, and therefore it did not trigger Anthony\u2019s disapproval rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Anthony\u2019s next attack on the judge\u2019s conclusions is that if, as the judge ruled, HBC was not required to seek Anthony\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>approval of the BRA master plan, then Anthony\u2019s withholding of its approval could not constitute a breach of the agreement. The judge, however, ruled that Anthony\u2019s disapproval was a breach of contract. The judge read the contract as requiring HBC to submit a plan for Anthony\u2019s approval if, and only if, the changes therein had a \u201cmaterially adverse effect\u201d on the review conditions \u2014 that is, if the plan triggered Anthony\u2019s right to disapprove. The judge further interpreted the agreements, however, to require Anthony\u2019s approval if Anthony\u2019s was presented with a plan that HBC need not have submitted for approval. Anthony\u2019s approval was critical for the project\u2019s financiers and to obtain needed government approvals and permits. The judge\u2019s ruling that, by failing to give its approval, Anthony\u2019s violated the express terms of the agreement was correct. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Anthony\u2019s contends that, even if it violated the agreement, its breach was not material, and HBC therefore was not justified in renouncing the contract. Anthony\u2019s attempts to minimize the effect of the May 29, 1987, letter by arguing that, given the proportions of the deal, the letter was too small and ambiguous a dispute to constitute a material breach. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The judge found that, but for the letter, HBC would have begun construction of the hotel by the outside closing date. The letter thus had a profound effect on the transaction. As the judge\u2019s finding indicates, HBC was unable, as a practical matter, to perform its obligations under the agreements after Anthony\u2019s sent the letter. The breach thus compromised \u201can essential and inducing feature of the contract,\u201d the duty of HBC to begin construction of the hotel by the outside closing date. <em>Bucholz </em>v. <em>Green Bros., </em>272 Mass. 49, 52 (1930). See <em>Petrangelo </em>v. <em>Pollard, </em>356 Mass. 696, 700-701 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Anthony\u2019s further contends that HBC\u2019s postbreach conduct constitutes a waiver of its claim for breach. After the breach, HBC continued to pay monthly rent and real estate taxes, requested a tolling of the outside closing date, gave notices of closing on the residential, marina, and nonhotel commercial parcels, and continued to pay architects\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>consultants\u2019 fees. From these facts, Anthony\u2019s argues that HBC waived its right to renounce the contract based on Anthony\u2019s breach. \u201cThe short answer to this contention is that [Anthony\u2019s] did not plead waiver as an affirmative defense and the issue was not raised, considered, nor passed upon in the [trial] court. . . . The defense cannot be raised in this court for the first time.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Nakdimen </em>v. Baker, 111 F.2d 778, 782 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 311 U.S. 665 (1940).

The judge concluded that Anthony\u2019s purported disapproval of the BRA master plan destroyed or injured HBC\u2019s right to receive the fruits of the contract and thus violated the implied covenant. This ruling was amply supported by the evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The judge found that at a meeting in October, 1986, Anthony\u2019s development adviser warned that Anthony\u2019s belief that the \u201cagreements \u2018did not represent current market value [of the Fan Pier land and development rights]\u2019 would affect how [Anthony\u2019s] \u2018dealt\u2019 with HBC.\u201d On February 26, 1987, the judge found, Athanas met with representatives of HBC. At that meeting, Athanas explained that he had \u201cmade a lousy deal . . . and . . . need[ed] more money.\u201d He further noted that a list of issues that his representatives had previously raised with HBC \u201cwas really only about money and that [Athanas] had to get more money to be satisfied.\u201d Athanas opined that the law firm that assisted him in drafting the agreements \u201chad done a lousy job and that [Athanas\u2019s] kids were only going to get a lousy $750,000 a year out of [the] arrangement.\u201d The judge also found that Anthony\u2019s disapproval of the BRA master plan was, by Athanas\u2019s admission of May 28, 1987, \u201cnot about approval of the plan\u201d but rather \u201cabout money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The judge found that after sending the letter, Athanas explained to HBC\u2019s representatives that he wanted \u201cmore money\u201d than the agreements provided. \u201cThat is why,\u201d Athanas explained, \u201cthe [May 29] letter was sent.\u201d The judge further found that although Anthony\u2019s purported t\u00f3 disapprove the BRA master plan, Athanas admitted: \u201cI\u2019m not really disapproving the project. I want to get more money.\u201d Finally, the judge found that in June, 1987, Athanas\u2019s son told HBC that he would \u201crather look out of [his] window on nothing than on a lousy deal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The judge found that a number of the positions and actions taken by Anthony\u2019s, culminating with the purported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>disapproval of the BRA master plan, were designed to \u201cforc[e] financial concessions from HBC.\u201d Anthony\u2019s approval was crucial to HBC\u2019s efforts to obtain financial backing as well as governmental permits and approvals. Knowing that it thus could apply pressure on HBC, Anthony\u2019s withheld its approval in an attempt to force HBC to sweeten the deal. Anthony\u2019s use of a discretionary right under the agreements as a pretext justifies the judge\u2019s ruling that Anthony\u2019s breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. See <em>Northern Heel Corp. </em>v. <em>Compo Indus., Inc., </em>851 F.2d 456, 471 (1st Cir. 1988) (applying Massachusetts law, court found violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in repudiation that was \u201cbut a tool engineered to serve th[e] illicit purpose\u201d of extracting price concessions). See E.A. Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a7 7.17 (a), at 329 (1990) (\u201cIt is, therefore, bad faith to use discretion \u2018to recapture opportunities forgone on contracting\u2019 as determined by the other party\u2019s reasonable expectations \u2014 to refuse \u2018to pay the expected cost of performance,\u2019 \u201d quoting Burton, Breach of Contract and the Common Law Duty to Perform in Good Faith, 94 Harv. L. Rev. 369, 369, 372-373 [1980]).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Anthony\u2019s asks us to hold that, in contracts between sophisticated businesspeople, no covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied. We decline so to hold. We note that Anthony\u2019s cites no authority to support its contention. Indeed, the rule is clear in Massachusetts that every contract is subject to an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <em>Warner Ins.

There was no error. An examination of the record suggests that the trial judge redacted the references to Anthony\u2019s bad faith in HBC\u2019s proposed findings of fact so that his findings of fact would be consistent with his decision to deny HBC\u2019s claim under G.

According to Anthony\u2019s, the judge equated HBC\u2019s expectancy damages with the value of the land itself, failing to take into account the contract and the various risks and duties that it imposed. Anthony\u2019s is mistaken. The judge ruled \u201cthat HBC\u2019s expectancy damages can be measured by the value of its <em>interests </em>under the 1983 [agreements as of May 29, 1987, the date of the breach . . .\u201d (emphasis added). HBC\u2019s expert testified as to the value of HBC\u2019s rights under the agreements to develop the Fan Pier property, purchase the residential land, and lease the commercial real estate. The judge accepted the expert\u2019s methodology, but then discounted the expert\u2019s figures to take into account development risks and uncertainties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>There was no error in the judge\u2019s measure of expectancy damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Anthony\u2019s also argues that HBC was limited to seeking special damages (i.e., lost profits), and that the judge was therefore in error in awarding them general damages (i.e., fair market value of interests under agreements less compensation due to Anthony\u2019s). Anthony\u2019s corollary to this argument is that, because in this case lost profits are too speculative and too remote a measure of damages, HBC is entitled to zero expectancy damages. Anthony\u2019s relies on <em>American Mechanical Corp. </em>v. <em>Union Mach. Co. of Lynn, Inc., </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 97, 102 (1985). That case does not assist its claim. In that case, the Appeals Court noted that \u201cthe aim in measuring damages in the event of a breach is to place the injured party in as good a position as he would have been in had the contract been performed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101. As a result, the Appeals Court rejected a rigid formulaic approach to damages which would have undercompensated the plaintiff in that case.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">B. <em>Admission of expert testimony regarding comparably valued real estate was not erroneous. </em>Anthony\u2019s claims that the parcels of real estate used by HBC\u2019s expert as \u201ccom-parables\u201d are, as a matter of fact and law, not comparable to the Fan Pier property. The judge has broad discretion in accepting evidence on comparable values; his decision will be reversed only if manifestly erroneous. <em>Iris </em>v. <em>Hingham, </em>303 Mass. 401, 408-409 (1939). <em>Fourth Nat\u2019l Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Mass. 66, 68 (1912). Anthony\u2019s specific arguments regarding the purported dissimilarities between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the \u201ccomparables\u201d and the Fan Pier property bear only on the weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Anthony\u2019s further asserts that the testimony of HBC\u2019s expert regarding the value of the \u201ccomparables\u201d was based on inadmissible hearsay. Anthony\u2019s argues that it was error to allow the HBC expert to give his opinion based on the contents of recorded deeds because the contents of those deeds (square footage and sales prices) were not independently admissible, and, further, even if the contents were admissible, the expert should only have been allowed to state his opinion without the contents of those deeds being admitted in evidence.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">HBC\u2019s expert verified the information he obtained from the deeds by speaking with a party (or the party\u2019s counsel) to each of the comparable transactions. The direct testimony of these parties, had it been offered, would have been independently admissible. HBC was not required to \u201cproduc[e] exhibits and witnesses whose sole function is1 to construct a proper foundation for the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Nor did the judge err in allowing HBC\u2019s expert to testify to the sale prices and square footage of comparable properties in order to explain the basis for his opinion of Fan Pier\u2019s value. \u201c[Wjhen, as here, an expert\u2019s statements concerning matters on which he has relied are admitted for the limited purpose of laying the foundation for his opinion and are presented to the jury [or judge] in a manner that avoids prejudice to the opposing party, the trial judge\u2019s discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>should not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 106 (1982). Anthony\u2019s did not dispute the accuracy of any of the comparable sales data. Nor does Anthony\u2019s dispute the qualifications of the expert, or that he can give an ultimate opinion on valuation. Even if it were error, we discern no prejudice on this record. The judge found that HBC\u2019s valuation expert \u201cfailed to make those adjustments which the Court is of the opinion should have been made to substantially reduce the price paid for the comparable sales in relation to the Fan Pier property. The judge accordingly concluded that the dissim'larities between the \u201ccomparables\u201d and the Fan Pier property required that figure arrived at by HBC\u2019s expert be reduced by approximately sixty per cent.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">C. <em>Exclusion of the testimony of four of Anthony\u2019s witnesses. </em>Anthony\u2019s argues that the judge committed prejudicial error in excluding the testimony of four witnesses called to testify about the risks and uncertainties involved in the Fan Pier development. According to Anthony\u2019s, these experts would have opined that HBC\u2019s expectancy interest was zero, either because HBC could not meet the outside closing date, \u201cno knowledgeable developer would pay anything for HBC\u2019s rights,\u201d or \u201cit is not possible to determine with any reasonable certainty that HBC\u2019s interests had any value as of the date of the breach.\u201d The judge, following argument of counsel and a review of offers of proof and the witnesses\u2019 answers to interrogatories, excluded their testimony because, unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Anthony\u2019s two other expert witnesses who were real estate appraisers, they could not provide testimony that would be new and of assistance to the judge.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The judge told Anthony\u2019s that he wanted evidence on valuation, not on liability.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> These witnesses would have relitigated liability issues. The judge reasonably could exclude that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Further, a judge has discretion to exclude expert testimony. <em>Nally </em>v. <em>Volkswagen of Am., Inc., </em>405 Mass. 191, 197 (1989). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 628 (1989). It is also within the discretion of the judge to exclude excessively cumulative evidence, including expert testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durning, </em>406 Mass. 485, 497 (1990). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>381 Mass. 90, 116 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ranahan, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 201, 204 (1986). The judge did not err in excluding the testimony of Anthony\u2019s experts who were not expert in valuing real estate transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">D. <em>Award of damages. </em>Anthony\u2019s argues that the judge\u2019s damages award \u201cis merely plucked from the air, and rests upon no evidentiary foundation.\u201d Anthony\u2019s claims that the judge \u201cthoroughly rejected\u201d the analysis of HBC\u2019s valuation expert, and that his damages award perforce has no basis. In fact, the judge rejected only the expert\u2019s final figures, not his method. He found that, \u201c[ajlthough the adjustment process used by [HBC\u2019s expert] represents standard appraisal methodology when valuing land by the comparable sales method, [the expert] failed to make those adjustments which the Court is of the opinion should have been made to substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>tially reduce the price paid for the comparable sales in relation to the Fan Pier property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u201cValuation is a question of fact, and we will not disturb a judge\u2019s determination unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Sarrouf </em>v. <em>New England Patriots Football Club, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 542, 550 (1986). Here, the judge\u2019s damages award fell within the range of value opinions testified to at trial. See <em>General Dynamics Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Quincy, </em>388 Mass. 24, 35-36 (1983). Anthony\u2019s has not met its burden of showing that the damages award is clearly erroneous. See <em>First Pa. Mortgage Trust </em>v. <em>Dorchester Sav. Bank, </em>395 Mass. 614, 621 (1985); <em>Delano Growers\u2019 Coop. Winery </em>v. <em>Supreme Wine Co., </em>393 Mass. 666, 681-683 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">We do not agree that the judge\u2019s damages award lacks an evidentiary foundation. HBC offered substantial evidence as to its damages. The judge heard twelve witnesses during twenty-seven days of trial and reviewed 169 exhibits and forty-five documents. His findings of facts are recorded in 270 numbered paragraphs. The judge complied with his duty of \u201carticulating] the essential grounds of his decision,\u201d <em>Schrottman </em>v. <em>Barnicle, </em>386 Mass. 627, 638 (1982); he is not required to itemize every component of that decision. <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 472 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">E. <em>Alleged mathematical error in calculating the damages award. </em>Anthony\u2019s claims that, in calculating HBC\u2019s damages award, the judge made a mathematical error. HBC\u2019s expert opined as to the value of both HBC\u2019s interests in Fan Pier and Anthony\u2019s projected compensation under the agreements. The judge rejected both of these figures as too high, and substituted his own figures. He arrived at his damages award by subtracting the compensation due Anthony\u2019s from the value of HBC\u2019s interests. According to Anthony\u2019s, however, while the judge was free to discount the value of HBC\u2019s interests, he was barred from similarly discounting Anthony\u2019s projected compensation. The latter figure, argues Anthony\u2019s, is a constant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Anthony\u2019s compensation under the agreements has several components: the contract price to be paid for the residential land, inflated by 100% of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase between July, 1983, and the date of closing; ten per cent of HBC\u2019s share of net sales and rental profits generated from development of the residential land; basic rent for the hotel lease plus a two-stage escalation rent; and basic rent for the commercial and marina leases plus escalation rent. There are many uncertain variables involved in this compensation package: how many acres HBC ultimately would buy and develop, the CPI, inflation, and HBC\u2019s sales and profits, to name just a few. The judge found that HBC\u2019s expert, in assessing the present value of Anthony\u2019s compensation under the agreements, used formulas and variables designed to maximize projected payments to Anthony\u2019s.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In discounting HBC\u2019s expert\u2019s valuation of HBC\u2019s interests, the judge was free concomitantly to discount the expert\u2019s valuation of Anthony\u2019s compensation.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">F. <em>Postbreach expenditures. </em>The judge awarded HBC \u201cas damages reasonable postbreach expenditures of $2,388,850.15.\u201d Of this amount, $1,249,843.09 represents \u201creasonable postbreach 'expenses incurred in an effort to mitigate damages.\u201d The other $1,139,007.06 of the award represents money paid to Anthony\u2019s as rent and taxes. We reverse the first award, and affirm the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">As for the $1,249,843.09, Anthony\u2019s argues that HBC is not entitled to these postbreach expenditures because HBC did not meet its burden of proving that they were reasonably incurred in an effort to mitigate its losses. We agree. \u201cDam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ages are recoverable for special losses incurred in a reasonable effort, whether successful or not, to avoid harm that the defendant had reason to foresee as a probable result of his breach when the contract was made.\u201d Restatement, Contracts, \u00a7 336 (2). See, e.g., <em>John Hetherington &amp; Sons, Ltd. </em>v. <em>William Firth Co., </em>210 Mass. 8, 25 (1911). However, \u201c[t]he plaintiff, having the burden of proof, must of course show that the expenses incurred were reasonable.\u201d <em>Automated Donut Syss., Inc. </em>v. <em>Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 326, 335 (1981). Accord, <em>Tampa Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Nashville Coal Co., </em>214 F. Supp. 647, 652 (M.D. Tenn. 1963) (\u201cThe critical factor in determining a plaintiff\u2019s duty to mitigate is whether the - method which he employed to avoid consequential injury was reasonable in the circumstances existing at the time\u201d). During the damages phase of the trial HBC offered no evidence that any of its expenditures were reasonably incurred in an effort to mitigate its losses. Accordingly, the award of $1,249,843.09 is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The award to HBC for its postbreach payment to Anthony\u2019s of rent and taxes appears to be based on a theory of restitution. In calculating the amount of the expectancy damages, the judge valued HBC\u2019s rights under the agreements as of the- date of the breach. He arrived at this value by subtracting the consideration due to Anthony\u2019s from the fair rental value of the commercial land (in each year of the leases) and from the fair market value of the residential land.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The judge similarly calculated the consideration due to Anthony\u2019s from the date of the breach. The amount of the postbreach rent and tax payments was included in this figure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>In order to avoid counting this figure twice in Anthony\u2019s favor, the judge concluded that the postbreach rent and tax payments had to be returned to HBC. This amount, along with all other consideration due to Anthony\u2019s, was then subtracted from the gross value of HBC\u2019s rights under the agreements to arrive at HBC\u2019s net expectancy. Because the judge had subtracted the postbreach rent and tax payments from the amount he determined HBC was owed as expectancy damages, he correctly ordered the amount of those actual payments to be returned to HBC in the award. On remand, however, this portion of the award should be excluded from the damages considered under G. L. c. 93A because it is in the nature of restitution and not damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">9. <em>Joint liability. </em>In 1984, HBC hired environmental consultants. HBC and Anthony\u2019s entered into an agreement to share the environmental consultants\u2019 work and fees. During the phase I trial, HBC and Anthony\u2019s stipulated that Anthony\u2019s had not reimbursed HBC for its share of the fees. The judge entered judgment against Boston Mariner, Inc., Pier Four, Inc., and Anthony\u2019s Hawthorne, Inc., jointly and severally with Anthony\u2019s, for their share of the environmental consulting fees incurred in connection with the Fan Pier and Pier Four projects. Boston Mariner, Pier Four, Inc., and Anthony\u2019s Hawthorne argue that, because only Anthony\u2019s was a party to the stipulation, only Anthony\u2019s should be held liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">There was substantial evidence from which the judge could reasonably find that Boston Mariner, Pier Four, Inc., and Anthony\u2019s Hawthorne were all parties to the agreement regarding the environmental consultants\u2019 fees. The stipulation does not state that Anthony\u2019s was the only Athanas entity which was a party to the agreement regarding the environmental consultants\u2019 fees. Indeed, Anthony\u2019s counsel informed the judge that the stipulation was \u201cvery limited\u201d and \u201cnot that detailed.\u201d The work done by the environmental consultants benefited both the Fan Pier and Pier Four projects. By implication,* then, it also benefited Pier Four, Inc., and Anthony\u2019s Hawthorne, Inc., entities with an ownership inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>est in Pier Four, as well as the Athanas family\u2019s development company, Boston Mariner. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">10. <em>Conveyance to Fan Yards Nominee Trust. </em>On January 19, 1988, the same day that the parties brought suit against each other, Anthony\u2019s recorded a deed transferring record title in Fan Pier to the Fan Yards Nominee Trust, the trustees of which are Athanas\u2019s four sons. In response, HBC amended its complaint to add the Fan Yards parties as defendants and to allege (1) the facts of the transfer of the land; and (2) that either the transfer of the Fan Pier property was invalid or that the transferees were bound by the obligations of the original 1983 agreements, including liability for breaches by Anthony\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">At the conclusion of the phase I trial on liability, the judge issued an interlocutory order enjoining Anthony\u2019s and the Fan Yards parties, among others, from conveying, leasing or otherwise alienating the Fan Pier property. Just before the phase II trial on damages began, HBC sought to raise the issue of the validity of the conveyance of the Fan Pier property to the Fan Yards Nominee Trust. The judge noted that it was possible he might find no damages, in which case the conveyance issue would be moot, and said, \u201cI would rather not accept anything in reference to collection or anything else or judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">At the conclusion of the damages trial, the judge granted HBC\u2019s motion to enter partial final judgment under Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), instead of a final judgment, in order to leave open for future determination HBC\u2019s claims concerning collection on the judgment. Anthony\u2019s now seeks entry of a final judgment solely against Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc., and HBC seeks entry of a final judgment jointly and severally against Anthony\u2019s and the Fan Yards parties. We reject each party\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">The judge did not abuse his discretion in reserving the issues regarding the conveyances and the collection for the judgment. See <em>Dattoli </em>v. <em>Hale Hosp., </em>400 Mass. 175, 176 (1987). We affirm his partial final judgment under Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b). The factual record is insufficient for us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>enter a final judgment. Unlike the case cited by HBC as authority for the proposition that we, rather than the trial judge, may enter a final judgment, the evidence on the issue of collection of the judgment has not been heard by the judge and is not before us on this appeal. Cf. <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>249 Mass. 516, 520 (1929). It is for the trial judge, after hearing, to enter the final judgment. This matter is remanded to the trial judge for determination whether the Fan Pier parties are jointly and severally liable to HBC and other issues concerning the collection of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">11. <em>Summary. </em>We affirm so much of the partial final judgment as awarded expectancy damages, postbreach rent and taxes .paid by HBC to Anthony\u2019s, and consultants\u2019 fees. We set aside the award of postbreach expenditures not attributable to rent or taxes. We reverse so much of the judgment as denied G. L. c. 93A damages to HBC. We remand the matter to the trial judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-12\"> Anthony\u2019s is owned and operated by Anthony Athanas (Athanas) and members of his immediate family.

Anthony\u2019s says, \u201cWhat effect these ex parte conferences may have had on the judge is not ascertainable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b483-6\"> A review of the trial transcript confirms that the judge was engaged in the proceedings and in command of the issues. Anthony\u2019s accuses the judge, among other things, of \u201cabdicating his judicial responsibility\u201d; his performance, Anthony\u2019s says, \u201cmocks the deliberative process.\u201d Anthony\u2019s accusations are unfounded and unsupported by the record. In a case that Anthony\u2019s itself describes as \u201cbitterly contested . . . with an enormous record,\u201d the judge, working with very limited resources, disposed of complex litigation in just over two years. Anthony\u2019s requested that the case be expedited, and the judge did so. The case was filed on January 19, 1988. The phase I memorandum of decision, findings of fact, rulings of law, and or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>der was entered on April 14, 1989. The phase II memorandum of decision, findings of fact and rulings of law was entered on January 8, 1990. The judgment, memorandum of decision and order, and partial final judgment were entered on February 22, 1990.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\"> We conclude, infra, that the judge\u2019s ruling that Anthony\u2019s violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot be squared with his denial of damages under G. L. c. 93A to HBC. While this is a substantial inconsistency, it by no means renders the judge\u2019s findings and rulings unreviewable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b484-8\"> In addition to the conflict between the judge\u2019s rulings on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and G. L. c. 93A (see note 19, <em>supra, </em>and section 6, <em>infra), </em>there are a few inconsequential inconsistencies in the judge\u2019s findings. The argument, however, that these minor oversights fatally taint a record compiled over seventy-nine days of trial including over one thousand findings of fact and thirty-five rulings of law, together occupying 445 pages, may be characterized most charitably as frivolous. For example, in his first ruling of law on liability, the judge said that \u201cany changes between HBC\u2019s BRA [m]aster [pjlan . . . and the [bjasic [djevelopment [pjlan are changes within the meaning of the 1983 [djevelopment [ajgreement.\u201d The judge prefaced his second ruling of law by saying, \u201cTo the extent that any changes between HBC\u2019s current [m]aster [pjlan . . . and the [bjasic [djevelopment [pjlan ... are changes within the meaning of the [djevelopment [ajgreement. . . .\u201d Anthony\u2019s argues that these two rulings are inconsistent. There is no substantial inconsistency. Similarly, in his second ruling of law on liability, the judge first concluded that the changes at issue did not have \u201can effect\u201d on the review conditions and second ruled that the changes did not have a \u201cmaterially adverse effect\u201d on them. Of course, if the changes had no effect on the review conditions, they could not have had a materially adverse effect on them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\"> The review conditions appear in the text at 455, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b486-8\"> The review conditions were drafted so as to ensure that any subsequent changes would be consistent with the basic development plan, that a waterfront hotel would be located as near as possible to Athanas\u2019s remaining property, and that the design of such a hotel was consistent with that of the adjacent Pier 4 development.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\"> Neither party disputes that HBC did not send Anthony\u2019s an explanation of the changes embodied in the BRA master plan in response to Anthony\u2019s letter of May 29, 1987. The judge found, however, that HBC had extensively explained the BRA master plan to Anthony\u2019s and, indeed, that Anthony\u2019s and its officers and employees had repeatedly approved the plan in public and private statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\"> Anthony\u2019s also argues that the judge drained its disapproval rights of all meaning when he held that the \u201c[bjasic [development [p]lan is a general narrative and illustrative statement of development concepts, including \u2018preliminary site plans and preliminary massing studies . . . showing alternative approaches\u2019 \u201d to development. According to Anthony\u2019s, the basic development plan comprised only the site plans and preliminary massing studies and not the narrative portion of the booklet. In addition to its facial inconsistency with Anthony\u2019s contention that the first architects\u2019 original master plan was the basic development plan, this argument merely quarrels with the facts found by the judge. The judge\u2019s finding that the basic development plan comprised a narrative interpretation of the site plans and massing studies as well as the plans and studies themselves is supported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b489-6\"> Moreover, Anthony\u2019s trial strategy was to claim that HBC could not meet the outside closing date. In light of Anthony\u2019s trial strategy, we would not reach the waiver argument even if waiver had been pleaded. \u201cThe theory of law on which by assent a case is tried cannot be disregarded when the case comes before an appellate court for review of the acts of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Kagan </em>v. <em>Levenson, </em>334 Mass. 100, 106 (1956), quoting <em>Santa Maria </em>v. <em>Trotto, </em>297 Mass. 442, 447 (1937). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phoenix, </em>409 Mass. 408, 415 n.4 (1991). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>407 Mass. 731, 737 (1990). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>George, </em>406 Mass. 635, 636 n.4 (1990). <em>Matter of Saab, </em>406 Mass. 315, 322 n.10 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\"> Anthony\u2019s contends, however, that it is the judge\u2019s ruling that it violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that must be set aside. We do not agree. See section 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\"> In its complaint, HBC prayed for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under G. L. c. 93A. As we explain in the text, this prayer should be allowed. HBC has made no separate request for an award of appellate attorneys\u2019 fees. In these circumstances, we conclude that, as a matter of discretion, we should not award appellate attorney\u2019s fees. See <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobilehome Sales, Inc., </em>394 Mass. 270, 272 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\"> The judge, of course, should not, in multiplying the damages, include that portion of the judgment that represents prejudgment interest. <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 716 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b494-9\"> The evidence that Anthony\u2019s sought to introduce was: BRA plans prepared in October, 1987, questioning the designs of the internal canal and the hotel; testimony that one of the nine major architectural firms working for HBC quit the project in October, 1987; a December, 1987, memorandum, prepared by an HBC employee after a public meeting, that lists a number of concerns the BRA had about the project; a construction schedule prepared in the summer of 1987 that shows a 1991 date for the beginning of construction; evidence that HBC attempted to redesign the entire project in the fall of 1987 by hiring a new architectural firm; and evidence that the previous architect had stopped work on the Fan Pier project sometime after May 29, 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\"> The judge heard a full offer of proof on the expected rebuttal testimony. The excluded evidence supported Anthony\u2019s claim that HBC could not meet the outside closing date. See <em>Drake </em>v. <em>Goodman, </em>386 Mass. 88, 92 (1982) (\u201cThere is no right to present rebuttal evidence that only supports a party\u2019s affirmative case\u201d). Assuming, without deciding, that the judge erred, Anthony\u2019s could not show that the proffered evidence would have altered the judge\u2019s determination. HBC offered abundant evidence, which the judge obviously found credible, that it would have met the outside closing date. Thus, Anthony\u2019s would not be able to show prejudice in this jury-waived trial. Cf. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>392 Mass. 788, 798 (1984) (excluded evidence contained nothing of assistance; court\u2019s conclusion and outcome of case would have been the same if evidence had been admitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b496-8\"> The judge also awarded HBC $2,388,850.15 (plus interest from the date of the filing of the original complaint) for reasonable postbreach expenditures incurred by HBC and $347,216 (plus interest), the sum he found Anthony\u2019s and other Athanas entities owed HBC for the cost of joint development activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\"> Many of Anthony\u2019s arguments on the damages issues reflect its fundamental disagreement with the judge\u2019s determination that HBC would have been able to perform its obligations under the agreements. Anthony\u2019s argues that HBC is not entitled to damages, as it could not meet the outside closing date. Because we have concluded that the judge\u2019s rulings on that issue were correct, we do not comment on these arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\"> E.g., comparing land assemblage sales to single sales, see <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Duxbury Hous. Auth., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 934, 935 (1981); <em>R.H. White Realty Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 505, 507-508 (1975); comparing sales in one location to sales in another, see <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>361 Mass. 864, 865 (1972); <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Lawrence Redevelopment Auth., </em>348 Mass. 83, 85-86 (1964); comparing properties which differ in zoning, see <em>Gregori </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>348 Mass. 395, 397 (1965); <em>Lee, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\"> Witnesses with direct knowledge of the transactions testified as to the square footage and sale prices of ten of the \u201ccomparables.\u201d At a minimum, then, as to these witnesses, the testimony clearly was not hearsay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b499-6\"><em> Newton Girl Scout Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Auth., </em>335 Mass. 189 (1956), on which Anthony\u2019s relies, is not to the contrary. In <em>Newton Girl Scout, </em>the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (authority) called an expert who did \u201cnot appear to have had special experience in determining the value of the type of camp property\u201d involved in that case. <em>Id. </em>at 199. The authority\u2019s expert testified to the price for which a single property, adapted to an entirely different use, had been sold three years earlier. The president of the Girl Scouts who, unlike the authority\u2019s expert, was very knowledgeable about the camp property, was not permitted to give her opinion of the value of the property. In light of the authority\u2019s expert\u2019s lack of knowledge concerning camp property, as well as the exclusion of the Girl Scouts\u2019 expert, we said that the authority\u2019s expert testimony regarding a sole, allegedly \u201ccomparable\u201d transaction was prejudicial to the Girl Scouts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\"> The judge already had determined in the phase I trial that, as a matter of law, but for Anthony\u2019s breach, HBC would have obtained all necessary permits and approvals and met the outside closing date. See <em>supra </em>at 477. He accordingly sought testimony regarding the value of HBC\u2019s interests (factoring in all the risks and uncertainties) rather than testimony which sought to reopen an issue already litigated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b500-8\"> Anthony\u2019s position was that there was no liability because HBC could not meet the outside closing date and hence no damages. Anthony\u2019s had ample opportunity to offer evidence on valuation while preserving the liability issues for appeal. It chose not to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\"> E.g., HBC\u2019s valuation expert assumed that escalation rent would be paid to Anthony\u2019s annually and not deferred, as it might have been.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\"> Finally, Anthony\u2019s argues that HBC is not entitled to reliance damages because it failed to prove that its expenditures were reasonable. If HBC is entitled to reliance damages, Anthony\u2019s argues, it is not entitled to recover expenditures made before the contract was signed, interest on prebreach expenditures, or postbreach expenditures. Because the judge awarded reliance damages merely as an alternative to expectancy damages, and because we affirm the expectancy damages, we do not address these arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b503-5\"> In order to value HBC\u2019s leasehold interests the judge, for \u201ceach year of the lease, . . . deduct [ed] . . . from the fair rental value the consideration owed to Anthony\u2019s\u201d under the agreements. He then totalled this value, discounted it to its present value, and arrived at a total of $36 million. Similarly, in valuing HBC\u2019s option rights in the residential land, the judge calculated \u201cthe fair market value of the residential land less the value of the consideration due to Anthony\u2019s on the purchase of the residential land\u201d under the agreements. After discounting to present value, he arrived at a figure of $6.6 million. The total of the two figures, $42.6 million, is the amount of the expectancy damages award.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
