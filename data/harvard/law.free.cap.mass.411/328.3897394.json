Rule 111, as now amended, authorizes urinalysis drug testing of police officers both on reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>able suspicion and on a random basis. In this action, the plaintiff, a Boston police officer, relying solely on art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, challenges the constitutionality of the random testing proposed by Rule 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The plaintiff in no respect relies on the Constitution of the United States. Any claim of a violation of the Fourth Amendment seems foreclosed by the determination in <em>Guiney </em>v. <em>Roache, </em>873 F.2d 1557, 1558 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 963 (1989). That court held, in light of <em>National Treasury Employees Union </em>v. <em>Von Raab, </em>489 U.S. 656 (1989), that Rule 111, to the extent that it calls for random testing of those police officers who carry firearms or participate in drug interdiction, does not prescribe any search or seizure in violation of a police officer\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Guiney </em>v. <em>Roache, supra </em>at 1558.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">A judge of the Superior Court ruled that the random urinalysis provisions of Rule 111 did not violate art. 14. She, therefore, allowed the commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action. We granted the commissioner\u2019s petition for direct appellate review. We reverse and direct that summary judgment be entered declaring that Rule 111 violates art. 14 insofar as Rule 111 prescribes random urinalysis testing of Boston police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The factual record before us by stipulation is the same as that before the Federal Court and consists of Rule 111, as amended, and nothing else of significance. Rule 111, as amended, appears in <em>Guiney </em>v. <em>Roache, </em>654 F. Supp. 1287, 1289-1294 (D. Mass. 1987).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The details of Rule 111 are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>important for our purposes. Any police officer to be tested, except on the basis of reasonable suspicion, \u201cwill be selected by randomized independent computer process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291. Rule 111, if followed, thus eliminates any prospect of an improper exercise of discretion to test a particular police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Rule 111 states that the rule is necessary to preserve the \u201cintegrity of the Department and its personnel; to guard against the harmful consequences to the public good occasioned by the unauthorized unlawful use\u201d of drugs by law enforcement personnel; and to \u201cmaintain a high degree of public confidence in all those charged with upholding public order and public safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1290. There is nothing in the record to indicate that there has been any problem, or any public perception of a problem, arising from the illicit use of drugs by Boston police officers. Indeed, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Boston police officers have unlawfully used controlled substances on or off duty. Moreover, there is no showing of how random drug testing by urinalysis will provide information that is needed to identify officers whose on-duty performance was affected by illicit drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The commissioner rightly concedes that the random urinalysis testing called for by Rule 111 involves a search and seizure for the purposes of art. 14. See <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>408 Mass. 324, 326 (1990); <em>Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent &amp; Protective Ass\u2019n, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>403 Mass. 692, 699-700 (1989). The question is whether the unannounced, warrantless, suspicionless, random urinalysis testing procedure that Rule 111 imposes is an <em>unreasonable </em>search and seizure under art. 14. If such an intrusive testing process could ever be justified as reasonable in an art. 14 sense (barring the police officer\u2019s consent to the testing), the government would have to make a strong factual showing that a substantial public need exists for the imposition of such a process applicable to all police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">We have considered challenges to drug test requirements before. In <em>Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent &amp; Protective Ass\u2019n, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 705, this court concluded that art. 14 prohibited random drug testing by urinalysis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>pursuant to a drug testing regulation, of persons licensed by the State racing commission. The commission claimed that the testing program deterred drug use, ensured the integrity of betting on horse races, and encouraged safety. The court rejected these arguments because they \u201care merely speculative, and have no basis in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The commission failed to meet its burden of advancing \u201ca sufficiently compelling reason to justify the highly invasive monitored urine specimen collection it seeks to impose on all licensees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Justice Greaney, writing in concurrence in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 332 (Greaney, J., concurring), made the same point with respect to the record in that case. \u201c[T]he important constitutional right of privacy established by art. 14\u201d should not be overruled by \u201cabstract goals of safety and integrity . . . without any factual information in the record to demonstrate frequency of drug use by police officers or to demonstrate any connection between such use and grave harm to the force or public safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In the <em>O\u2019Connor </em>case, which concerned the testing of police cadets for drug usage, the police cadet had consented to the search, and, therefore, he had little or no reasonable expectation of privacy. In such circumstances, the generalized but undocumented governmental need for the search \u2014 discovering and deterring drug use by police cadets \u2014 made the search, in the court\u2019s view, reasonable under art. 14. Three concurring Justices concluded that the cadet\u2019s consent alone made the search reasonable under art. 14 and that either no balancing of public interests against privacy interests should ever be undertaken in a case like this <em>(id. </em>at 332 [Liacos, C.J., concurring])<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or that, because of the cadet\u2019s consent, no balancing of interests was needed <em>(id. </em>at 332 [Greaney, J., concurring, joined by Liacos, C.J., and Abrams, J.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In the case before us, no consent to the searches is contemplated by Rule 111, and the commissioner has made no dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>onstration, on the record or otherwise, that facts exist that warrant random drug tests of police officers. The record offers nothing to show that there is a drug problem in the Boston police department. Nor is there anything outside the record of which we could take note that would permit such a conclusion. There is also no fact in the record, or otherwise established, to which the commissioner points to show that a substantial public purpose requires and justifies random testing of the urine of Boston police officers. In striking down the random search aspect of Rule 111, Judge Keeton reached the conclusion that the record before him (which is the record before us) was inadequate to support the government\u2019s position. <em>Guiney </em>v. <em>Roache, </em>686 F. Supp. 956, 961 (D. Mass. 1988). The commissioner\u2019s argument is' speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">By contrast, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, </em>396 Mass. 81 (1985), where the court upheld the use of roadblocks (conducted pursuant to carefully crafted guidelines) to deter and detect drunk drivers, there was a clear demonstration that drunk motorists presented a substantial problem on the highways of this State. <em>Id. </em>at 86-87. Although the stopping of a motorist\u2019s vehicle at a roadblock is a seizure for constitutional purposes <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, </em>389 Mass. 137, 139 [1983]), the intrusion of a roadblock on a motorist\u2019s privacy is fleeting and certainly does not involve the random taking of body fluids. This court has never approved the non-consensual taking of blood or urine of a person in the absence of a demonstrated, particularized basis for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The court should not infer or assume the existence of facts that might justify the governmental intrusion. The reasonableness of a mandated urinalysis cannot fairly be supported by unsubstantiated possibilities. If the government is to meet the requirements of art. 14, it must show at least a concrete, substantial governmental interest that will be well served by imposing random urinalysis on unconsenting citizens.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>such a case, the justification for body searches, if there ever can be one, cannot rest on some generalized sense that there is a drug problem in this country, in Boston, or in the Boston police department and that random urinalyses of police officers will solve, or at least help to solve, the problem or its consequences. We reject the view of the majority of the Justices of the Supreme Court that such proof is not required because \u201c[i]t is sufficient that the Government have a compelling interest in preventing an otherwise pervasive societal problem from spreading to the particular context.\u201d See <em>National Treasury Employees Union </em>v. <em>Von Raab, supra </em>at 675 n.3.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Thus, whether one rejects the balancing of interests test as a standard for protecting art. 14 rights or whether one might apply such a test on a proper showing of a compelling reason for nonconsensual random drug testing, Rule 111 violates art. 14 to the extent that it purports to authorize random searches. Constitutional safeguards should not be abandoned simply because there is a drug problem in this country. Arti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ele 14 of the Declaration of Rights should not be a casualty in the war on drugs. It is at times when pressures on constitutional rights are greatest that courts must be especially vigilant in the protection of those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The judgment is reversed. Summary judgment shall be entered for the plaintiff declaring that, on the record before the court, the random testing of urine purportedly authorized by Boston Police Department Rule 111 would violate the rights under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights of any police officer ordered to be tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\"> A Federal District Court judge had ruled before the release of the <em>Von Raab </em>opinion and of <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>489 U.S. 602 (1989), that the procedures of Rule 111 violated Fourth Amendment rights to the extent that Rule 111 directed random urinalysis tests to be conducted. <em>Guiney </em>v. <em>Roache, </em>686 F.

Usually that means, for art. 14 purposes, that the government must demonstrate probable cause for the search and seizure, and that the search must have been pursuant to a search warrant, absent some exception to the warrant requirement. Under the random testing aspect of Rule 111, there can be neither a search warrant nor probable (or any other specific) cause, because the search is a random one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Justice Scalia dissented in <em>National Treasury Employees Union </em>v. <em>Von Raab, supra </em>at 680, 681 (Scalia, J., dissenting, joined by Stevens, J.), because the government failed to demonstrate (1) the frequency of the use of alcohol and drugs by United States Customs Service employees and (2) the connection of such uses to harm. In that case, the court held that the Customs Service did not violate the Fourth Amendment by requiring a urinalysis test from each employee who seeks transfer or promotion to certain positions. Justice Scalia pointed out that \u201c[w]hat is absent in the Government\u2019s justifications \u2014 notably absent, revealingly absent, and as far as I am concerned dispositively absent \u2014 is the recitation of <em>even a single instance </em>in which any of the speculated horribles actually occurred: an instance, that is, in which the cause of bribetaking, or of poor aim, or of unsympathetic law enforcement, or of compromise of classified information, was drug use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b352-7\">Liacos, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"As5\">(concurring). I join the court in rejecting as unconstitutional Boston Police Department Rule Ill\u2019s authorization of random, mandatory urinalysis for Boston police officers. The facts of the present case differ sharply from those in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>408 Mass. 324, 332 (1990) (Liacos, C.J., concurring), where I concurred with this court\u2019s decision that mandatory urinalysis for a police cadet did not constitute an unreasonable search and seizure. The keystone of my concurrence in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>was the fact that the plaintiff cadet had consented to submit to mandatory urinalysis. <em>Id. </em>The present case, however, involves no such consent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">While I concur with the result reached in this case, I must reiterate my concern with this court\u2019s willingness to consider the \u201cbalance\u201d of public interests \u00e1gainst privacy interests in determining the constitutionality of searches and seizures. See <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 332 (Liacos, C.J., concurring); <em>Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent &amp; Protective Ass\u2019n, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>403 Mass. 692, 706 (1989) (Liacos, J., concurring). Notwithstanding its allusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>to the laws of physics, and their concomitant certainty and precision, a \u201cbalancing\u201d test subjects the constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures to a standard only slightly more enduring than the latest public opinion poll. It is my firm belief that the use of these tests, no matter how well-intended, will result in the eventual dissolution of this precious constitutional right. The focus of the constitutional analysis must remain on the issue whether reasonable cause exists to justify the particular search and seizure at issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>402 Mass. 162, 169 (1988) (Liacos, J., dissenting).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-9\"> A question arises as to whether an employer constitutionally can require an employee to consent to mandatory urinalysis as a condition of employment. Because the facts of the present case do not involve this scenario, I reserve my opinion on this issue for a more appropriate case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b353-6\">Nolan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_X\">(dissenting). Once again a majority of this court has found some hidden meaning within article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights to deviate from a decision of the United States Supreme Court in a question concerning the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amendola, </em>406 Mass. 592 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass. 61 (1987). My disagreement with this approach has been made clear. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amendola, supra </em>at 602 (Nolan, J., dissenting); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, supra </em>at 78 (Nolan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">What is of paramount concern today is that the majority opinion is totally devoid of any standard used to deviate from the position of the Supreme Court. This court has characterized that area where art. 14 and the Fourth Amendment diverge as a \u201cspecial category,\u201d and one that should apply to a particular situation only if there is some \u201ccompelling reason\u201d to do so. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 907 (1990). In this case, the plaintiff failed to present any coherent rationale for this court to disagree with the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>we are to allow such a divergence, surely we should insist on a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Also conspicuous by its absence in the majority opinion is any reference to the history of art. 14. It is well-established that the Fourth Amendment derives from our own art. 14. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>331 U.S. 145, 161 (1947) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); N.B. Lasson, The History and Development of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution 82 (1937). It is also well-established that Massachusetts adopted art. 14, as a result of the colonists\u2019 experiences with British officials, to protect the public from public officials. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass. 61, 71 (1987). It is doubly ironic, therefore, that the majority today reaches a conclusion which not only is at odds with the Fourth Amendment but also undermines an effort by the public to protect itself once again from the abuses of public authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Even if it were expedient for this court to ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Fourth Amendment and decide this case purely on art. 14 grounds, the majority\u2019s reasoning is unpersuasive. In assessing the reasonableness of any search or seizure, \u201cwe must balance the public interest against \u2018the individual\u2019s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, </em>396 Mass. 81, 86 (1985), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 878 (1975). In performing this balancing test, it is implicit that each situation should be judged on its own merits, and that there are instances in which a reasonable expectation of privacy, which would normally outweigh the public interest, has less weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">That is the case in the present action where it is without question that police officers, as police officers, have an expectation of privacy that is less than that of private citizens. Our General Laws contain numerous provisions that reflect the unique status of police officers within our Commonwealth. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 58 (age and height requirements); c. 41, \u00a7 96 (appointment of police officers); c. 41, \u00a7 108L (career incentive pay program); c. 41 \u00a7 111F (leave without loss of pay); c. 147, \u00a7\u00a7 14-17G (days off for police officers); St. 1987, c. 589 (collective bargaining binding arbitration for police). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has recognized a lessened expectation of privacy for police officers. See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>DiGrazia, </em>544 F.2d 543, 546 (1st Cir. 1976) (public interest in honest police force outweighs Boston police officers\u2019 privacy expectations concerning their financial affairs and the financial affairs of their households), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 914 (1977). This court, too, has recognized a limitation on police officers\u2019 privacy expectations. See <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>368 Mass. 33, 42 (1975), quoting <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Broderick, </em>392 U.S. 273, 277-278 (1968) (\u201cpolice officer \u2018is directly, immediately, and entirely responsible to the city or State which is his employer. ... He is the trustee of the public interest, bearing the burden of great and total responsibility to his public employer\u2019 \u201d), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1048 (1976). The majority opinion, while recognizing that the police cadet in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>408 Mass. 324 (1990), had little or no reasonable expectation of privacy, fails to examine or consider any limitation on the expectation of privacy of the police officers in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">What is reasonable in terms of an expectation of privacy may also change over time. Not so long ago, many people might have been appalled, as is the majority, by the specter of drug testing, but the times have changed. It is now estimated that sixty percent of our country\u2019s largest private employers have drug testing programs. Comment, \u201cReasonable Searches Absent Individualized Suspicion: Is There a Drug-Testing Exception to the Fourth Amendment Warrant Requirement After <em>Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives\u2019 As</em>sociation? 12 U. Haw. L. Rev. 345, 349 (1990). \u201c[W]hat is occurring generally outside government is some indication of what expectations of privacy \u2018society is prepared to accept as reasonable\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Willner </em>v. <em>Thornburgh, </em>928 F.2d 1185, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>1192 (D.C.

Additionally, I have found no court decision since decisions of the Supreme Court on drug testing, <em>National Treasury Employees Union </em>v. <em>Von Raab, </em>489 U.S. 656 (1989), <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>489 U.S. 602 (1989), that supports the majority opinion. See <em>McCloskey </em>v. <em>Honolulu Police Dep\u2019t, 71 </em>Haw. 568, n.l (1990), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The majority opinion apparently considers only the other side of the balancing test, the alleged lack of facts within the record to support a compelling governmental interest. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, </em>396 Mass. 81 (1985), however, we recognized that this court can take notice of \u201ca strong public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86. In <em>Trumble, </em>that public interest was \u201creducing the \u2018carnage caused by drunk drivers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86-87, quoting <em>South Dakota </em>v. <em>Neville, </em>459 U.S. 553, 558 (1983). This court has also recently taken notice of the public interest in stemming drug use by police: \u201c[Djrug use by police officers has the obvious potential, inimical to public safety, and the safety of fellow officers, to impair the perception, judgment, physical fitness, and integrity of the users. Furthermore, the unlawful obtaining, possession, and use of drugs cannot be reconciled with respect for the law. Surely, the public interest requires that those charged with responsibility to enforce the law respect it. Surely, too, public confidence in the police is a social necessity and is enhanced by procedures that deter drug use. . . .\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>408 Mass. 324, 328-329 (1990). It is nearly impossible to reconcile the reasoning in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>with today\u2019s majority\u2019s opinion. The majority now appears to accept the conclusion of the concurring opinion in <em>O\u2019Connor, id. </em>at 332 (Greaney, J., concurring), that it was the consent of the police cadet that made that drug test reasonable. The majority, apparently, would limit drug testing by the State to situations in which the individual consents to the test, and would restrain the State from protecting the public from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>dangers of drug abuse by police officers until the damage is done, until the public is harmed, and until it is too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">For all these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-10\"> In making his argument on this point, it is noteworthy that the plaintiff argued in these terms: \u201c[Sjociety is no more willing now, than it was when the Fourth Amendment and Article 14 were written and adopted,\u201d to accept random drug testing of police officers.

I agree with Justice O\u2019Connor, <em>post, </em>that today\u2019s decision overrules <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra, </em>and write separately only to reiterate my views concerning the application of the balancing test the court formulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>402 Mass. 162 (1988), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, </em>396 Mass. 81 (1985). Simmered down to its essence, the court\u2019s decision stands for the proposition that police officers who carry guns and are employed in an extremely stressful environment are entitled to a greater protection of their privacy than are the average law abiding citizens of the Commonwealth, who happen to engage in their peaceful pursuits on our public highways. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, supra. </em>To paraphrase what I said in <em>Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent and Protective Ass\u2019n, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>403 Mass. 692, 710 (1989) (Lynch, J., dissenting), I would willingly sacrifice the drug testing of police officers for the right of citizens to be free from warrantless seizure absent probable cause or reasonable suspicion. Since I do not have that option, the illusive standards of the court\u2019s balancing test lead me to a contrary result.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b357-9\">O\u2019Connor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap0\">(dissenting). By today\u2019s decision, the court effectively and unwisely overrules <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>408 Mass. 324 (1990). In the process, the court not only displays ambivalence about whether a balancing of interests test is ever an appropriate standard for protecting art. 14 rights, <em>ante </em>at 333-334, contrary to the court\u2019s approach in <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>but also retreats from its assessment in that case of the significance of the public interest in discovering and deterring drug use by police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>In <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>the issue on appeal was whether suspicionless urinalysis testing of police cadets was unreasonable in the art. 14 sense. The issue in the present case is the same except that the present case relates not to police cadets but to police officers. In <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>four members of the court reasoned that resolution of the question of reasonableness required the court to balance the government\u2019s need for the search and seizure against the procedure\u2019s intrusiveness into the plaintiff\u2019s reasonably expected privacy. In adopting that approach, which requires analysis of \u201call of the circumstances surrounding the search or seizure and the nature of the search or seizure itself,\u201d <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>489 U.S. 602, 619 (1989), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Montoya de Hernandez, </em>473 U.S. 531, 537 (1985), the four Justices expressly followed the lead taken by the United States Supreme Court in <em>National Treasury Employees Union </em>v. <em>Von Raab, </em>489 U.S. 656, 665 (1989), and by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent &amp; Protective Ass\u2019n, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>403 U.S. 692, 704 (1989), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>402 Mass. 162, 164 (1988), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, </em>396 Mass. 81, 88-90 (1985). <em>O\u2019Connor, supra </em>at 327-328. Indeed, the four Justices made the point that, \u201cdespite their disclaimer,\u201d the three concurring Justices also \u201cengaged in a balancing of the cadets\u2019 interest against that of the public employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329. I continue to believe that any determination of whether a search or seizure is constitutionally unreasonable necessarily depends on a balancing of the competing public and private interests in all the relevant circumstances. The court cites no case from any jurisdiction holding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The court would distinguish <em>O\u2019Connor </em>from this case on the ground that \u201cin the <em>O\u2019Connor </em>case ... the police cadet had consented to the search, and therefore, he had little or no reasonable expectation of privacy,\u201d while, under Boston Police Department Rule 111, no consent is contemplated. <em>Ante </em>at 331. By that observation, the court implies, if it does not expressly state, that, regardless of the reasonableness of requiring a cadet to consent to urinalysis testing as a condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>tion of eligibility for the cadet training program, such \u201cconsent\u201d results in the cadet\u2019s having little or no interest protect-able by art. 14. Therefore, there is no private interest against which the public interest would have to be balanced. The suggestion is that, in <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>the nonexistence of any significant protectable interest of the plaintiff cadet made unnecessary any genuine consideration of the public interest in the discovery and deterrence of drug use by police cadets. Therefore, the court suggests, <em>O\u2019Connor </em>should not be read as expressing the court\u2019s reasoned conclusion that the public has such an interest. The court then purports to balance the competing public and private interests in this case, in which pre-employment consent was not required, as though the court were operating on a clean slate.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The court is not operating on a clean slate. The court is wrong when it implies that the critical factor in the <em>O\u2019Connor </em>decision was the cadet\u2019s pre-employment consent and not the court\u2019s reasoned conclusion that the public has a very substantial interest in drug-free police cadets. The court is wrong because \u201cpublic employment may not be \u2018conditioned upon the surrender of constitutional rights which could not be abridged by direct government action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>368 Mass. 33, 37 (1975), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>DiGrazia, </em>423 U.S. 1048 (1976), quoting <em>Keyishian </em>v. <em>Regents of the Univ. of the State of N.Y., </em>385 U.S. 589, 605 (1967). In recognition of that principle, the court was careful to say in <em>O\u2019Connor, supra </em>at 329, that \u201c[sjurely, the plaintiff would not be barred from relief if his consent to be the subject of a search and seizure were unreasonably required as a condition of employment.\u201d Thus, the cadet\u2019s required pre-employment consent in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>had little impact on that decision. The consent was virtually meaningless unless the consent requirement was \u201creasonable.\u201d Whether the consent requirement was reasonable in turn depended on balancing the public need for the testing procedure against the cadet\u2019s privacy interest \u2014 the same type of art. 14 analysis that would have been required without the consent. The fact is that, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the cadet\u2019s consent was \u201ca factor that diminishe[d] the degree of iritrusiveness,\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor, supra </em>at 328, primarily because it put him on notice, the cadet\u2019s \u201cconsent,\u201d which was exacted as a condition of employment, was not the critical factor in <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>the public interest was.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In a very real sense, the intrusion wrought by Rule 111 is far less serious than the intrusion considered acceptable by the court in the <em>O\u2019Connor </em>case. In <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>the testing procedure called for the cadets to be visually observed by department officers while urinating, a procedure that is surely highly intrusive. Monitoring is not called for by Rule 111. As United States District Court Judge Keeton noted: \u201cThe amendment of Section 9 of Rule 111 was aimed at protecting privacy, and it is undisputed that it rendered moot those arguments previously advanced on grounds of invasion of privacy because of requirements (which appeared in the rule before amendment) that the police officer be observed during urination.\u201d <em>Guiney </em>v. <em>Roache, </em>654 F. Supp. 1287, 1294 (D. Mass. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Furthermore, \u201cit is plain that certain forms of public employment may diminish privacy expectations even with respect to such personal searches\u201d as urinalysis tests. <em>National Treasury Employees Union </em>v. <em>Von Raab, supra </em>at 671. As the Supreme Court said in that case with respect to Customs employees, \u201c[w]e think Customs employees who are directly involved in the interdiction of illegal drugs or who are required to carry firearms in the line of duty . . . have a diminished expectation of privacy in respect to the intrusions occasioned by a urine test. Unlike most private citizens or government employees in general, employees involved in drug interdiction reasonably should expect effective inquiry into their fitness and probity. Much the same is true of employees who are required to carry firearms. Because successful performance of their duties depends uniquely on their judgment and dexterity, these employees cannot reasonably expect to keep from the Service personal information that bears directly on their fitness. . . . While reasonable tests designed to elicit this information doubtless infringe some privacy expec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>tations, we do not believe these expectations outweigh the Government\u2019s compelling interests in safety . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 672. The Court\u2019s observations apply with equal force to police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Finally, the court\u2019s statement in <em>O\u2019Connor, supra </em>at 328-329, concerning the public interest in discovering and deterring drug use by police cadets, was correct when it was made, is correct now, and fits the present case: \u201cDrug use is often difficult to discern. Yet, drug use by police officers has the obvious potential, inimical to public safety and the safety of fellow officers, to impair the perception, judgment, physical fitness, and integrity of the users. Furthermore, the unlawful obtaining, possession, and use of drugs cannot be reconciled with respect for the law. Surely, the public interest requires that those charged with responsibility to enforce the law respect it. Surely, too, public confidence in the police is a social necessity and is enhanced by procedures that deter drug use by police cadets.\u201d Furthermore, there should be no doubt \u201cthat drug abuse is one of the most serious problems confronting our society today. There is little reason to believe that American workplaces [including police departments] are immune from this pervasive social problem.\u201d <em>National Treasury Employees Union </em>v. <em>Von Raab, supra </em>at 674. No further proof of public necessity ought to be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">If, as the court held in <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>the public interest in discovering and deterring drug use by police cadets made the requirement of a cadet\u2019s consent to urinalysis testing reasonable, and made the subsequent urinalysis testing reasonable as well, even though intrusive monitoring was involved in that procedure, a requirement that permanent police officers submit to unmonitored urinalysis testing is also reasonable. It is strange indeed that, in the <em>O\u2019Connor </em>case, the court recognized the public interest in discovering and deterring drug use by cadets, but now it fails to recognize the same public interest or a greater one in discovering and deterring drug use by permanent police officers whose conduct has impact on public safety, police safety, law enforcement, and public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>confidence much more than does the conduct of cadets. I would affirm the judgment below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
