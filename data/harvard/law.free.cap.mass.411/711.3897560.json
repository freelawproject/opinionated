Hunnewell, commenced this action in the Superior Court in Norfolk County. In May, 1990, Desjardins Ducharme and Hunnewell filed cross-motions for summary judgment. A Superior Court judge granted Desjardins Ducharme\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Hunnewell\u2019s summary judgment motion, and then entered judgment against Hunnewell for the full amount of the Canadian judgments equaling, in United States dollars, $45,355.16, plus interest from the date of the Canadian judgments. Hunnewell filed a notice of appeal to the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case to this court on our own initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Hunnewell makes three arguments on appeal: the Superior Court judge erred (1) in concluding that the costs that the Canadian courts assessed against him were enforceable foreign judgments within the meaning of G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 23A (1990 ed.), (2) in determining that a Quebec court official applied the correct assessment of costs against Hunnewell pursuant to the Quebec Superior Court\u2019s decision to quash a writ of seizure by garnishment, and (3) in holding that Hunnewell is jointly and severally liable on the judgments. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The undisputed facts of this case are as follows. In July, 1981, Hunnewell, together with three other parties (the Quebec plaintiffs),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> commenced an action in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, District of Montreal, against Binladen Telecommunications Company, Ltd. (Binladen), a Saudi Arabian company, and Bell Canada, a Canadian company, for breach of a financial services contract. The Quebec plaintiffs claimed damages in excess of $6,000,000 (Canadian), and they obtained a writ of seizure by garnishment before judgment against Bell Canada.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, the National Commercial Bank of Jeddah (NCB), a Saudi Arabian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>bank, intervened in the litigation, claiming that the funds seized by the Quebec plaintiffs had previously been assigned to NCB as security for its loan to Bell Canada. Desjardins Ducharme was the law firm representing NCB in the intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">On June 3, 1987, the Quebec Superior Court found for NCB, quashed the seizure, and awarded costs to Desjardins Ducharme. The Quebec plaintiffs thereafter appealed to the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec, but the Court of Appeal dismissed their appeal, with costs for their failure to furnish security to the court. The Quebec plaintiffs did not appeal this decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the time for filing such an appeal has passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">On December 9, 1987, the clerk of the Court of Appeal of Quebec fixed the costs awarded Desjardins Ducharme by that court at $695 (Canadian), with interest from November 20, 1987, and on December 10, 1987, the Quebec Superior Court fixed the costs awarded to Desjardins Ducharme at $60,065 (Canadian), with interest from June 3, 1987.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The underlying litigation among the Quebec plaintiffs, Binladen, and Bell Canada was still pending in the Canadian courts when this action was argued before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">1. <em>Enforcement of the judgments. </em>By Massachusetts statute, \u201cany foreign judgment that is final and conclusive and enforceable where rendered . . . shall be conclusive between the parties to the extent that it grants or denies recovery of a sum of money.\u201d G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 23A. A foreign judgment is \u201cany judgment of a foreign state granting or denying recovery of a sum of money, other than a judgment for taxes, a fine or other penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hunnewell asserts that the Quebec <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>judgments are not covered by the Massachusetts statute and cannot be enforced by the courts of the Commonwealth because the Quebec judgments are judgments in the nature of \u201ca fine or other penalty,\u201d and thus excluded from the statutory definition of a \u201cforeign judgment,\u201d and also because the judgments are not \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d since the litigation among the principal parties in Quebec is ongoing..</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">General Laws c. 235, \u00a7 23A, does not define what \u201ca fine or other penalty\u201d is, and the appellate courts of this Commonwealth have had no occasion to interpret this statute. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, however, has confronted the definition of \u201ca fine or other penalty\u201d under \u00a7 23A, in <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>665 F. Supp. 73 (D. Mass. 1987), and we agree with the District Court\u2019s interpretation. That court concluded that whether a judgment is \u201ca fine or other penalty\u201d depends on whether its purpose is remedial in nature, affording a private remedy to an injured person, or penal in nature, punishing an offense against the public justice. <em>Id. </em>at 75-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The District Court\u2019s reasoning is consistent with the common law principle that \u201c[t]he Courts of no country execute the penal laws of another . . . .\u201d <em>The Antelope, </em>23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 66, 123 (1825). See Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 89, 120 and comment d (1971). The decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Attrill, </em>146 U.S. 657 (1892), concerning the enforceability in Maryland of a judgment rendered in New York, also supports the District Court\u2019s <em>Hoffman </em>decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <em>Hoffman </em>decision is also consistent with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Hus</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number><em>tis, </em>237 Mass. 441 (1921), in which this court stated that \u201ca private action for recovery of damages for the pecuniary benefit of the family of the deceased, not inuring in any particular to the benefit of the State, is not criminal but has important remedial features. It has been held in numerous decisions that such a statute is not criminal or penal in an international sense, but that civil rights founded on it may be enforced in the courts of another jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In applying this standard, the Superior Court judge correctly held that the Quebec judgments were remedial and not a penalty. The judge relied on Canadian legal authority cited in an affidavit in support of Desjardins Ducharme\u2019s motion for summary judgment to find that the sole purpose of the costs assessed by the Quebec courts against Hunnewell was \u201cto compensate his adversary for the damage inflicted on him in compelling him to incur expenses in support of a just claim.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is clear that the costs were remedial in nature rather than penal under Canadian law.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Hunnewell contends, however, that the question whether the award of costs is remedial or penal is governed not by the law of Canada but by the law of this Commonwealth.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hunnewell argues that, because the Quebec Superior Court\u2019s award of costs was based on a percentage of the amount in issue and has little to do with the actual costs incurred by NCB in its intervention, the judgment, under the law of the Commonwealth, is penal rather than remedial. There is no real difference, however, between the judgment of the Que-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>bee Superior Court and our own contingency fee agreements which are recognized as valid measures of legal services rendered. See S.J.C. Rule 3:05, 382 Mass. 762 (1981). Consequently, we conclude that the Quebec judgments, under either the law of Canada or the law of the Commonwealth, are remedial and, therefore, not in the nature of \u201ca fine or other penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Hunnewell also argues that the judgment is not \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d because the main litigation among the Quebec plaintiffs, Binladen, and Bell Canada is ongoing. The Superior Court judge, however, correctly held that the intervention action by Desjardins Ducharme\u2019s client, NCB, against the Quebec plaintiffs has reached final and conclusive judgment. Article 210 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec' (1980), states that \u201c[ajggressive intervention constitutes a separate suit, even when it is joined to the original action.\u201d NCB was an aggressive intervener in the initial proceedings and its intervention, therefore, constituted a separate suit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Quebec plaintiffs appealed the Quebec Superior Court judgment to the Quebec Court of Appeal, which dismissed the appeal and awarded costs to Desjardins Ducharme, and the Quebec plaintiffs did not, and cannot now, appeal further to the Supreme Court of Canada. Desjardins Ducharme\u2019s client, NCB, has no further connection to the ongoing litigation in Canada and those proceedings will have no effect on the judgment in this case which is, therefore, final and conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">2. <em>The merits of the Quebec judgments. </em>Hunnewell\u2019s next argument concerns the merits of the Quebec Superior Court\u2019s calculation of fees. We note that Hunnewell never articulated any objection in Canada to the Quebec court\u2019s calculation of fees although he had ample opportunity to do so. We assume, without deciding, that he is able to raise this issue here because Canadian law permits parties to raise sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>stantive defenses to the enforcement of judgments rendered outside Canada,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the principle of reciprocity embodied within G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 23A, therefore requires that Hunnewell be permitted to raise substantive defenses to the enforcement of the Canadian judgments in Massachusetts courts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Hunnewell contends that the judgment of the Quebec Superior Court is in error because a Quebec court official incorrectly applied the Tariff of Judicial Fees of Advocates (Tariff) in effect at the time of the award. Hunnewell argues that it would have been proper for the Quebec court official to apply \u00a7 26(2) of the Tariff, which concerns contested incidental proceedings that put an end to disputes, rather than \u00a7 25 of the Tariff, which concerns a judgment on the merits of a case in a contested action, and \u00a7 42, which concerns a suit in which the amount of the dispute is greater than $100,000 (Canadian). While \u00a7 26(2) would have resulted in an award of only $400 (Canadian), \u00a7\u00a725 and 42 resulted in an award of $60,000 (Canadian). As we have already noted, NCB\u2019s action was not a contested incidental proceeding, but rather an aggressive intervention which, according to art. 210 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec, \u201cconstitutes a separate suit, even when it is joined to the original action.\u201d It is clear, therefore, that the Quebec court official\u2019s use of \u00a7\u00a7 25 and 42 of the Tariff was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Moreover, the other arguments advanced by Hunnewell are also without merit. Contrary to Hunnewell\u2019s contention, <em>Poulin </em>v. <em>Vachon, </em>Quebec Superior Court No. 200-05-000552-765 (May 5, 1976), does not support his position. <em>Poulin </em>involves only an interlocutory motion to quash brought by a party to an ongoing litigation and not by an aggressive intervener such as NCB which has no other issues to litigate. Additionally, while it is true that the Quebec court official awarded an additional $50 (Canadian) to Desjardins Ducharme for the \u201ccontested incidental proceeding,\u201d the judge in the Superior Court in Norfolk County was justified in concluding, on the basis of the affidavit of Dean Morissette, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>that that fee was awarded for reception of NCB\u2019s intervention and is not necessarily inconsistent with the position that this intervention action is a separate suit and not an incidental proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">3. <em>Joint and several liability. </em>Hunnewell\u2019s final contention, that he is not liable for the entire amount of the costs assessed against the Quebec plaintiffs, is also without merit. Hunnewell relies upon art. 478.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec, which states that \u201c[t]he costs of joint actions are shared equally by the parties, unless they have agreed to the contrary or the court, by judgment giving reasons, orders otherwise.\u201d Hunnewell, however, ignores art. 67 of the Code which states that \u201c[ujnless the court orders otherwise, unsuccessful coplaintiffs are jointly and severally liable for the costs.\u201d There is no contradiction between these two articles of the Code. Article 478.1 allows coplaintiffs to apportion liability for their own costs among themselves, while art. 67 concerns liability among unsuccessful coplaintiffs to a defendant. We note that, while Hunnewell himself is liable for the entire amount owed to Desjardins Ducharme, he remains free to seek contribution from his coplaintiffs in Quebec.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">For all the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\"> Lansdowne Financial Services Ltd., Michael Pochna, and John E. Bailey were Hunnewell\u2019s coplaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\"> The seizure that the Quebec plaintiffs obtained is the procedural equivalent of a writ of attachment or trustee process which may be issued as prejudgment security devices in Massachusetts. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 4.1, 4.2, 365 Mass. 737, 740 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\"> The corresponding values in American dollars are $530.53 for the Court of Appeal judgment and $44,824.63 for the Superior Court judgment. Article 477 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec requires the losing party to pay all costs, and art. 479 makes it clear that costs are awarded in favor of the prevailing party\u2019s attorney. The amount of costs awarded to Desjardins Ducharme by the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal was determined according to the Tariff of Judicial Fees of Advocates, a statutorily-prescribed schedule of fees to which attorneys are entitled when awarded such costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\"> The Supreme Court stated that, \u201cwhether a statute of one State, which in some aspects may be called penal, is a penal law in the international sense, so that it cannot be enforced in the courts of another State, depends upon the question whether its purpose is to punish an offence against the public justice of the State, or to afford a private remedy to a person injured by the wrongful act.\u201d <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Attrill, </em>146 U.S. 657, 673-674 (1892). The Supreme Court\u2019s decision concerned the full faith and credit clause of art. 4 of the United States Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 666. General Laws c. 235, \u00a7 23A, states that \u201c[t]he foreign judgment shall be enforcea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>ble in the same manner as the judgment of a sister state which is entitled to full faith and credit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\"> Under Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), the motion judge was entitled to rely on the affidavit of Dean Yves-Marie Morissette of McGill University School of Law in Montreal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b733-9\"> Hunnewell appropriately relies on <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Attrill, supra, </em>for this proposition. It is important to note, however, that the Supreme Court also recognized in that decision that, although the decisions of the foreign court should not have conclusive effect in the forum State court, those decisions \u201care entitled to great consideration, because made by a court of high authority, construing the terms of a statute with which it was peculiarly familiar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\"> \u201cVoluntary intervention is termed aggressive when the third party asks that he be acknowledged as having, against the parties or one of them, a right which is in dispute . . . .\u201d Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec art. 209 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\"> See art. 178 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec (\u201cAny defence which was or might have been set up to the original action may be pleaded to an action brought upon a judgment rendered out of Canada\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b735-9\"> The Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act (Uniform Act), after which G.

See also <em>Ingersoll Milling Mach. Co. </em>v. Granger, 631 F. Supp. 314, 319 (N.D. Ill. 1986) (Uniform Act rejected reciprocity doctrine), aff'd, 833 F.2d 680 (7th Cir. 1987). Unlike the Uniform Act, however, G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 23A, provides that \u201c[a] foreign judgment shall not be recognized if . . .
