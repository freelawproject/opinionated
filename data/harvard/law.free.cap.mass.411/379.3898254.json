L. c. 152 (1990 ed.), the workers\u2019 compensation law. For the reasons that follow, we hold that such value shall <em>not </em>be included.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">The reviewing board of the Department of Industrial Accidents denied the claim of Richard Borofsky (employee) to include the value of his employer-paid health insurance benefits in the calculation of his average weekly wage. He ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>pealed to the Appeals Court. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2). We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">We do not have the benefit of any jurisprudence in the Commonwealth on this precise issue. However, the statutory language and its history lead us to the conclusion that the value of employer-paid health insurance should not be considered in calculating the employee\u2019s average weekly wage. Three statutes are implicated in this case, and none of them contains any language which would permit a conclusion that average weekly wage includes the value of employer-paid health insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 1 (1), defines \u201cthe earnings of the injured employee,\u201d but does not detail the categories of benefits factored into the determination of such \u201cearnings.\u201d In \u00a7 1 (9), which purports to define \u201c[a]verage weekly wage in the commonwealth,\u201d one is directed to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 29 (a) (1990 ed.). Section 29 <em>{a) </em>falls far short of sustaining the employee\u2019s position. That section deals exclusively with the method of computing the average weekly benefits and does not identify the variables considered when computing that average.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Moreover, it is of no minor significance that the definition of \u201cwages,\u201d prior to 1941, included \u201cevery form of remuneration ... for employment by an employer . . . including . . . reasonable value of board, rent, housing, lodging, payments in kind and <em>similar </em>advantages\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 1 (\u00ab), as appearing in St. 1937, c. 421, \u00a7 1. The Legislature in 1941 deleted the phrase \u201csimilar advantages.\u201d St. 1941, c. 685, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Earlier cases in Massachusetts which decided that wages include sales commissions <em>(Perkins\u2019s </em>Case, 278 Mass. 294, 301-302 [1932]), the value of tips earned by a waitress <em>(Powers\u2019s Case, </em>275 Mass. 515, 518-520 [1931]), and board and room <em>(Palomba\u2019s Case, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 881 [1980]), are facially distinguishable because they \u201cbear a close analogy to wages paid by [the employer],\u201d <em>Powers\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 519, unlike the value of health insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Cases from other jurisdictions which tend to favor the employee are not helpful because they have been decided under statutes which are dissimilar to ours. See, e.g., <em>State Compensation Ins. Auth. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>768 P.2d 1256, 1258 (Colo. Ct. App. 1988) (statutory definition of \u201cwages\u201d which includes monetary compensation and <em>similar advantages </em>construed to encompass value of health insurance benefits). Notably, in <em>Morrison-Knudsen Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>461 U.S. 624 (1983), discussed by the parties, the United States Supreme Court held that the term \u201cwages\u201d under \u00a7 2(13) of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 44 Stat. (part 2) 1425, codified at 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(13) (1982), did <em>not </em>include the employer contribution to union trust funds for health and welfare, pensions and training despite the fact that the Federal statute included the phrase \u201csimilar advantage,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 629-630, the phrase which the Massachusetts Legislature deleted from G. L. c. 151A in 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">There are policy considerations which favor both sides of this question, but they are more properly addressed to the Legislature which to date has left the definition of \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d unchanged despite a comprehensive revision of G. L. c. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Accordingly, the decision of the reviewing board of the Department of Industrial Accidents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
