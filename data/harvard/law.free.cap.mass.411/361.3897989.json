In the complaint, the city sought a declaration pursuant to G. L. c. 231A (1990 ed.) that it could deduct, pursuant to G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 16, as amended by St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 37, ten per cent of the monthly premium cost for health maintenance organization (HMO) coverage furnished to union members without violating its collective bargaining agreement with the union. When the city\u2019s Superior Court action was brought, there was pending before the State Labor Relations Commission (commission), a complaint concerning the city\u2019s unilateral application of St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 37, to union employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement. A judge of the Superior Court allowed the union\u2019s motion to dismiss the city\u2019s complaint filed pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12, 365 Mass. 755 (1974), and ordered the city and the union \u201cto proceed to litigate the underlying dispute at the Labor Relations Commission.\u201d The city appealed, and we allowed its application for direct appellate review. We now affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">General Laws c. 32B, \u00a7 3, authorizes a governmental unit to offer health insurance to its employees, and G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 16, inserted by St. 1971, c. 946, \u00a7 5, permits a governmental unit to offer HMO membership as an alternative to group-indemnity health insurance coverage. Prior to July 1, 1990, \u00a7 16 provided, in substance, that a governmental unit\u2019s contributions towards the premium costs for HMOs were to be the same amount as the unit\u2019s contributions for group-indemnity health insurance programs (such as, for example, \" Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For several years prior to July 1, 1990, the city\u2019s total cost of HMO coverage was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>less than the city\u2019s contribution to Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Because of this, union employees who chose HMO coverage were not required to contribute to the cost of the premiums for their coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">General Laws c. 32B, \u00a7 16, was amended by St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 37, to require that an employee choosing HMO coverage pay a \u201cminimum of ten per cent of the total monthly premium cost\u201d for his or her coverage. However, under St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 218, where the amount of an employee\u2019s contribution for health care benefits is determined by a collective bargaining agreement, the amount of the contribution is not to be changed until the expiration date of the agreement unless the parties to the agreement agree otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The city and the union have been parties to successive collective bargaining agreements since about 1974. Article 14.1 of the pertinent collective bargaining agreement provides that the city will maintain in effect for the duration of the agreement the following programs of insurance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201cBlue Cross/Blue Shield Municipal Master Medical Plan in effect on July 1, 1974 or its equivalent. If greater benefits are adopted for other City employees, such increased benefits shall be granted to employees under this Agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Article 14.1 also provides that \u201c[t]he contribution of the employee to the premiums for [health and other] insurance programs shall be fixed as of July 1, 1974 and all increases thereafter shall be borne by the City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">In a memorandum dated May 14, 1990, the city announced that, on July 1, 1990, the effective date of St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 37, all bargaining unit employees covered by a HMO would be required to contribute a minimum of ten per cent toward the monthly premium costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 14, 1990, the union filed a charge with the commission alleging that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the city had engaged in a prohibited practice by \u201cunilaterally deducting ten per cent of the HMO cost in direct violation of its duty to bargain under \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(5) of G. L. c. 150E.\u201d The union also alleged that the city had violated G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(5) (1991 ed.), by repudiating the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement pertaining to the city\u2019s obligations to pay premiums for health care benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">On July 20, 1990, the commission issued a formal complaint, alleging that the city, among other things, had committed prohibited practices by refusing to bargain over the ten per cent contribution and by repudiating art. 14.1 of the collective bargaining agreement. The commission set a date of February 1, 1991, for a formal hearing on the complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The city thereafter commenced its action in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The city\u2019s complaint alleges that, since at least 1974, it has offered its employees under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 16, a choice between Blue/Cross Blue Shield and health care benefits provided by various HMOs, and that, before the amendment to \u00a7 16 adopted in St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 37, employees who elected coverage with a designated HMO were able to do so without cost. The complaint asserts that St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 37, requires the city to assess and charge its employees ten per cent of any premium for HMO coverage. The complaint also points out that the union relies upon the grandfather provision contained in St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 218, to claim that the ten per cent charge cannot be imposed under art. 14.1 and other provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, at least until the expiration of that agreement (June 30, 1991). The city\u2019s complaint goes on to assert that because of the union\u2019s position \u201c[t]here is a possible conflict between []\u00a7 37 and []\u00a7 218 of [c.] 653 of the Acts of 1989,\u201d which has created a controversy between the parties that requires, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>among other things, \u201ca determination of the construction or interpretation of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement as that agreement applies to G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 16 as most recently amended.\u201d The complaint then requests declaratory and other relief to the effect that art. 14.1, and other pertinent provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, cannot be relied upon to postpone collection from the union\u2019s employees of the ten per cent premium charge for HMO benefits because art. 14.1 is silent as to HMO coverage or contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">It is apparent from the facts set forth in the city\u2019s complaint that a declaration of the meaning of \u00a7 16, as amended by St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 37, is probably unnecessary to resolve the controversy. That statute unambiguously provides that employees of a governmental unit who have HMO coverage shall pay a minimum of ten per cent of the total monthly premium cost or rate for such coverage with the governmental unit responsible for paying the remainder of the monthly cost.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The dispute between the parties also does not appear directly to concern the meaning of the grandfather provision contained in St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7 218. That statute is likewise unambiguous in providing protection from the effect of \u00a7 37 to employees whose health care contributions are determined by an existing collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The precise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>dispute between the parties concerns the meaning of art. 14.1 of the collective bargaining agreement in light of \u00a7 218 \u2014 do the words in art. 14.1 \u201cor its equivalent,\u201d when used in conjunction with, and after reference to, the city\u2019s \u201cBlue Cross/ ' Blue Shield Municipal Master Medical Plan in effect on July 1, 1974,\u201d include an HMO, so as to make the collective bargaining agreement subject to the protection of \u00a7 218?</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In enacting St. 1989, c. 653, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 218, the Legislature was undoubtedly aware of the following: (a) that there was no prior legislative authorization mandating contribution from employees for the cost of HMO premiums; (b) that existing collective bargaining agreements were likely to contain provisions which required governmental units to contribute on an equal dollars basis, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>to the payment of premium costs for both group indemnity and HMO plans; (c) that some protection for these provisions was necessary to avoid a claim that the new assessment authorized by \u00a7 37 unlawfully impaired rights protected by existing collective bargaining agreements; and (d) that there could be myriad variations in existing collective bargaining agreements concerning employee health care benefits and payment of the premiums therefor which could require interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In light of these considerations, it would be unreasonable to expect the courts to resolve all of the potentially large number of disputes over the scope and meaning of particular provisions in G. L. c. 150E collective bargaining agreements pertaining to HMO coverage, particularly where such disputes could, in many cases, be more practically adjusted by alternative procedures such as negotiations between the parties, resort to the dispute resolution mechanisms contained in the agreements, or application to the commission for a remedy within the commission\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Here, the union appears properly to have sought the commission\u2019s intervention to decide whether the city had prematurely implemented \u00a7 37 of c. 653 of St. 1989, in light of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement and the protections afforded by \u00a7 218 of the same statute. The proceeding before the commission, already far advanced, will likely resolve that dispute. In view of the pendency of that proceeding, the union argues that the requirement that aggrieved parties exhaust their administrative remedies before resorting to litigation applies and justifies the trial court\u2019s refusal to issue a declaration. See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admin., </em>377 Mass. 217, 220 (1979); <em>Barksdale </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>397 Mass. 49, 52 (1986). Because the city, as the party seeking a declaratory judgment, is not a party \u201cto whom an administrative remedy is available,\u201d <em>id., </em>the case is not one strictly governed by the exhaustion doctrine. Nevertheless, we think the policy considerations underlying that doctrine support the denial of declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 450-451 (1973), we stated that \u201c[wjhile [G. L.] c. 231A was intended as remedial legislation, giving a party a new and additional procedure for resolving controversies . . . there is no indication that it was intended as an automatic substitute for administrative proceedings\u201d (citation omitted). In <em>East Chop, </em>declaratory relief was ruled to be inappropriate where the Legislature had given an administrative agency broad powers to receive, investigate and act on certain complaints, and proceedings involving the party bringing the declaratory action were already pending before the agency. In such circumstances, we held that it would be inappropriate to \u201cpermit [] the court\u2019s judgment to be substituted for the commission\u2019s on issues that lie within the latter\u2019s designated field.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450. This rationale has application here. In G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11,. the Legislature gave the commission broad powers to investigate and act on complaints such as the one now before it, and an inquiry has already begun. The issues framed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the commission\u2019s investigation and complaint will likely call upon the commission to interpret art. 14.1, and other provisions, of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. This issue of interpretation is clearly at the core of the city\u2019s complaint in the Superior Court, and its resolution appears suitable for administrative fact finding by the commission on such matters as the parties\u2019 intent when they bargained the agreement and prior practices for HMO coverage. The commission is thus being called upon to fulfil a traditional role, as to which it possesses special expertise.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Moreover, factors traditionally cited in favor of suspending the exhaustion requirement are inapplicable to this case. The administrative remedy available here is not inadequate, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Anthony Grace &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>384 U.S. 424, 429-430 (1966). Indeed, a decision by the commission may well terminate the entire controversy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The facts of this case do not \u201craise important public questions whose resolution concerns or will affect more persons than the parties to the case.\u201d <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 450. No irreparable injury to either party will result from pursuing the administrative remedy. There is no question of law peculiarly within judicial competence; nor will the administrative proceeding be expensive or awkward as compared to a judicial disposition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>case. See 4 K.C. Davis, Administrative Law 414-415 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Although G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 9 (1990 ed.), provides that the declaratory relief statute must be broadly construed and administered, under \u00a7 3 of that statute a judge has discretion to decline to grant declaratory relief if persuaded that it will not serve a useful purpose. \u201c[T]he court will refuse a declaration where another court has jurisdiction of the issue, where a proceeding involving identical issues is already pending in another tribunal ... or where another remedy will be more effective or appropriate under the circumstances. In these cases it is neither useful nor proper to issue the declaration.\u201d Borchard, Declaratory Judgments 302 (1941). On the facts of this case, we conclude that the judge had \u201csufficient reason,\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 3, and did not abuse his discretion in refusing to enter a declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Based on the pending proceedings before the commission, and in the interests of avoiding possibly conflicting results and promoting judicial economy, the judge properly could decline to involve the court under G. L. c. 231A in a dispute better left to resolution by an agency with expertise in the area.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The judgment dismissing the city\u2019s complaint and instructing the parties to proceed to litigate before the Labor Relations Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b380-6\"> In <em>Hemman </em>v. <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, Inc., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 70, 72-73 (1984), it was held that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16, as amended by St. 1976, c. 454, \u00a7 2, required a governmental unit to contribute toward the premium charged by an HMO the same <em>dollar </em>amount as the unit contributed to the premium for group-indemnity coverage, rather than an equal <em>percentage </em>of the premium charged by the group-indemnity plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b381-10\">The city\u2019s complaint in the Superior Court indicates that the city has been collecting the ten per cent from employees covered by HMOs since July 1, 1990.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\"> According to the union, the hearing before the commission went ahead as scheduled and testimony and documentary evidence were received. The commission is currently considering the issues before it and has decided to issue its decision directly rather than by a hearing officer so that the decision will be immediately reviewable under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11 (1990 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b383-5\"> The statute goes on to provide that the parties to a collective bargaining agreement under G.

L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11 (1990 ed.), to order a party, found after hearing to have violated the law, to cease and desist and to take such affirmative action as will comply with the law. This provision has been broadly construed to permit the commission to \u201crestore the situation as nearly as possible to that which would have existed but for the unfair labor practice.\u201d <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 826, 831 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\"> General Laws c. 231 A, \u00a7 3 (1990 ed.), provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe court may refuse to render or enter a declaratory judgment or decree where such judgment or decree, if rendered or entered, would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceedings or for other sufficient reasons. The reasons for such refusal shall be stated in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">A motion to dismiss is proper where the court refuses to enter a declaratory judgment for a reason set forth in G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 3. See <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 399, 401 (1988).

In <em>Uniformed Firefighters of Ludlow, Local 1840 </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Ludlow, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 903 (1990), the Appeals Court noted that, while there was a prohibited practice complaint pending before the commission, the declaratory judgment case before the Superior Court involved \u201c[ojnly questions of law . . . [and] no issue relating to the conduct of labor relations or the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>which might be appropriate for exercise in the first instance of the commission\u2019s expertise.\u201d Similarly, the issue in <em>Ludlow Educ.
