Perrotta (victim) in his cell at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>378 Mass. 680 (1979). After that date, but before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307 (1985), the defendant on three occasions unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief by way of motions for a new trial and unsuccessfully sought habeas corpus relief in the Federal courts. See <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Fair, </em>838 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 847 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">We deal here with the defendant\u2019s fourth motion for a new trial. A judge of the Superior Court denied that motion on the ground that \u201c[t]he issues being presently raised by the defendant have been hashed and re-hashed by state and federal trial courts and appellate courts over a period of some thirteen years.\u201d He denied the motion for a new trial because \u201cit presents no issue which has not already been adjudicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">A single justice of this court, acting under the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d provision of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1990 ed.), allowed the defendant to appeal to this court from the rejection of his contention that the jury charge contained constitutionally infirm language concerning presumptions of malice and intent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>We conclude that the defendant has not waived or otherwise lost his right to a determination on the merits of his challenge to the jury instructions, but that he is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The evidence justifying the defendant\u2019s conviction is set forth in our opinion on the defendant\u2019s appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, supra </em>at 682-685. To make the issues now before us understandable, we need only summarize the general circumstances of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. The Commonwealth sought to prove, based primarily on the testimony of an inmate named Thomas Carden, that the defendants Campbell and Keigney killed the victim in his cell by strangulation, after tearing his penis from his body. This court characterized the evidence against these two defendants as \u201csomewhat thin\u201d but sufficient to warrant submitting the case to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 688. The case against the defendant, called \u201ca somewhat closer question,\u201d was based on the theory that the defendant had acted as a lookout for Campbell and Keigney. <em>Id. </em>at 688-689. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">1. We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s claim, accepted by the motion judge, that the defendant has already had appellate review of his challenge to the jury instructions. We also reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the defendant has waived his right to such a review. The defendant relies on principles expressed in <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>(1979), decided on June 18, 1979, after oral argument of his appeal but before it was decided on August 7, 1979. This court\u2019s opinion on the defendant\u2019s appeal did not discuss the jury instructions in light of the <em>Sandstrom </em>opinion. The significant force of the defendant\u2019s argument arises not from the <em>Sandstrom </em>case itself, however, but from the standard for testing the consequences of a <em>Sandstrom </em>violation that was first expressed in <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307 (1985). In deciding what a reasonable juror could have understood, a constitutionally infirm jury instruction containing impermissible burden-shifting language is not cured by \u201c[1 language that merely contradicts and does not explain [the] constitutionally infirm instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The importance of <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>to the defendant\u2019s argument is pointed up significantly in this Commonwealth by the differing results in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Repoza, </em>382 Mass. 119 (1980) <em>(Repoza I), </em>and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Repoza, </em>400 Mass. 516 (1987) <em>(Repoza II). </em>In <em>Repoza I, </em>on our own motion, we reviewed the jury instructions under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and concluded that the instruction that the intentional use of a deadly weapon created a presumption of malice violated <em>Sandstrom </em>principles. <em>Repoza I, supra </em>at 132-133. We concluded, however, that the judge\u2019s error was-\u201cvitiated by his repeated and careful instructions reinforcing the principle that the burden of proof on every essential element of the crime invariably remains with the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134. After the Supreme Court decided <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>we considered the <em>Sandstrom </em>issue again in Repoza\u2019s challenge to the denial of his postappeal motion for a new trial. We ordered a new trial <em>(Repoza II, supra </em>at 522), concluding that the \u201csaving\u201d language of the charge, which we had identified in <em>Repoza I, </em>did not meet the standard of <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin. </em>It \u201cdid not cure the possibility that, \u2018[i]n light of the instructions on intent given in this case, a reasonable juror could thus have thought that, although intent must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, proof of [stabbing the victim] and its ordinary consequences constituted proof of intent beyond a reasonable doubt unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the defendant persuaded the jury otherwise.\u2019 <em>Francis, supra </em>at 319. Clearly, the instructions at trial do not meet the requirements of Francis.\u201d <em>Repoza II, supra </em>at 521-522. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>405 Mass. 598, 600-601 (1989), applying <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>to a charge given prior to the <em>Sandstrom </em>opinion and ordering a new trial, years after an unsuccessful appeal of a conviction of murder in the first degree in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>370 Mass. 541 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"AaY\">The defendant argues that his situation is substantially the same as that of Repoza. Repoza was not denied postappeal relief on the ground that he should have raised the point earlier, even though this court had identified and discussed a <em>Sandstrom </em>error on Repoza\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although there are differences, as we shall see, between Repoza\u2019s case and this one in the nature and significance of the alleged errors in the jury instructions, <em>Repoza II </em>demonstrates the significance of <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>and shows why we must conclude that the defendant has not waived his right to argue the alleged <em>Sandstrom </em>error as reinforced by the principles expressed in Francis v. <em>Franklin, </em>unless for some reason he has waived that right by inaction after <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"A1l\">The defendant\u2019s March, 1989, motion for a new trial for the first time raised the <em>Sandstrom </em>issue in the context of <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin. </em>The Commonwealth does not argue that the delay in filing that motion following the decision in <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>warrants a ruling that the defendant waived his right to advance the argument when he did. No case of this court has held that a delay of that sort results in the loss of rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burkett, </em>396 Mass. 509, 512 (1986). We must, therefore, consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s objections to the jury charge.</p>\n<p id=\"Aad\">2. We start with the language contained in the following paragraph, with the assertedly improper language appearing in italics:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u201cOur Supreme Judicial Court has said that every unlawful motive may be inferred from an unlawful killing and <em>if there are no circumstances tending to show justification or excuse, there is nothing to rebut the natural presumption of malice. </em>And they go on to say that malice does not necessarily imply ill will towards the person killed but it has a more comprehensive meaning, including any intent to inflict injury upon another without legal excuse. <em>So if a defendant or defendants in this case intentionally, unlawfully killed the deceased, malice is presumed in this case.\u2019\u2019'\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The question is whether a reasonable juror could have understood the challenged language to direct him or her in the circumstances of this case to accept or presume conclusively the existence of malice solely from the fact that there was a killing. See <em>Francis </em>v. Franklin, <em>supra </em>at 325. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The trial judge summed up his statements in the last sentence of the quoted paragraph, explaining his earlier ones. He says that, if the killing was done intentionally and unlawfully, \u201cmalice is presumed in this case.\u201d Because there was no evidence warranting a manslaughter verdict, the judge\u2019s conclusional statement was correct in this case. In other words, because there was no basis for a manslaughter verdict, if the jury were to find that the killing was intentional and unlawful, the killing was committed with malice as a matter of law. \u201cThe jury in this case reasonably could not have understood from the judge\u2019s instructions that, if they found that the defendant killed the victim, and if there was no evidence of justification or excuse, either malice had been established conclusively or the defendant had the burden to prove lack of malice. The jury reasonably could have understood the statement in question only to refer to an intentional killing. An intentional killing without justification or excuse is indeed an unlawful killing with malice aforethought, and is murder.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adrey, </em>397 Mass. 751, 755 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The word \u201cpresumed\u201d in the charge does not have an unconstitutional quality in a <em>Sandstrom </em>sense because, where there is no evidence warranting a finding of manslaughter and self-defense is not an issue, there is malice in all situations where a killing is intentional. Indeed, the reference to \u201can unlawful killing\u201d in the first sentence of the allegedly offending paragraph seems reasonably to say correctly, on these facts, that \u201cthe natural presumption of malice\u201d arises when (a) there is no justification or excuse and (b) the killing is unlawful.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">This challenged language may be artless. It may be unclear. It might well be bad in the <em>Sandstrom </em>sense if used in other cases, such as those in which a finding of guilt of manslaughter is a possible verdict. Where, however, there was no evidence justifying a finding of involuntary manslaughter or raising a reasonable doubt whether the killing was excused or justified, a presumption of (or, stated in better language, a finding of) malice (and murder) is required if the killing was unlawful or if it was intentional. Consequently, we find no <em>Sandstrom </em>error in the challenged language in the paragraph quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">3. The defendant\u2019s second objection to the judge\u2019s instructions presents a more difficult issue. The portion of the charge to which the defendant objects, with the specifically challenged language in italics, reads as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The statement that \u201cwe are presumed to intend to do what we do do\u201d could be understood in context to say that a person is presumed to have intended to kill if that is the result of what he did do. The words have the potential of being understood to create a presumption, probably a rebuttable one, that runs afoul of <em>Sandstrom </em>principles. See <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, supra </em>at 519. As to all the defendants, but particularly as to the two coventurers, Campbell and Keigney, the faulty language, if considered in isolation, might be perceived, because of the fact of the killing alone, as relieving the Commonwealth of its burden of proving malice beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u201cSo how do you determine what is in someone\u2019s mind? Naturally, that is extremely difficult and so the law allows you to work backwards by taking the effect or killing, if you will, determining the killing, and inferring from that killing and from the acts of the participants what their intent was. <em>We are presumed to intend to do what we do do. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The malice of the principals was not, however, a disputed issue at the trial. The strangulation of the victim with two bathrobe cords and the dismemberment of his penis demonstrated conclusively that whoever committed these acts did so intentionally. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>378 Mass. 680, 684-685 (1979). By contrast, <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>involved a case in which the \u201cfacts did not overwhelmingly preclude\u201d the absence of an intent to kill. <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra </em>at 325-326. See <em>Repoza II, </em>characterizing <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>as a case that \u201cspecifically concerns the limited category of criminal prosecutions in which intent is the pivotal element of the crime charged and the only contested issue at trial.\u201d <em>Repoza II, supra </em>at 519.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the matter of the principals\u2019 intent was not in dispute, unlike the situation in Repoza\u2019s case. See <em>Repoza II, supra </em>at 522 n.7 (\u201cintent was a live issue and the error cannot be considered to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). The contested issues were whether either Campbell or Keigney, or both, committed the acts that caused the victim\u2019s death and whether the defendant was a coventurer with one or both of them, sharing the same intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The question whether any <em>Sandstrom </em>error in this charge concerning intent was harmless error is a Federal constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>tional one. We shall consider whether the Supreme Court of the United States would apply a harmless error rule in the circumstances to excuse the arguably flawed instruction. It is established that \u201cthe harmless error standard of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18 (1967), applies to jury instructions that violate the principles of <em>[Sandstrom] </em>and <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin.\" Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 572 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The Supreme Court has very recently spelled out the standard for determining whether an instruction to apply an unconstitutional presumption did not contribute to the verdict and hence was harmless error. <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, </em>111 S. Ct. 1884, 1893-1894 (1991). \u201cTo say that an error did not contribute to the verdict is, rather, to find that error unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question, as revealed in the record. Thus, to say that an instruction to apply an unconstitutional presumption did not contribute to the verdict is to make a judgment about the significance of the presumption to reasonable jurors, when measured against the other evidence considered by those jurors independently of the presumption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1893.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The Court said that appropriate judicial analysis requires (1) a determination of what evidence the jury were warranted in considering in reaching their verdict based on the instructions the jury received (\u201cDid the jury look at only the predicate facts, or did it consider other evidence bearing on the fact subject to the presumption?\u201d) and (2) a weighing of the probative force of that evidence against the probative force of the presumption standing alone to determine \u201cwhether the jury actually rested its verdict on evidence establishing the presumed fact beyond a reasonable doubt, independently of the presumption.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The trial judge defined malice in his charge and, as we have already stated, the fact of the strangulation of the victim with two bathrobe cords provides powerful proof of malice in the killing. Any statement in the second quoted portion of the charge that malice is presumed from the killing was beyond any reasonable doubt inconsequential to the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>verdict. Malice in the killing by strangulation was not contested by any defendant at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">We turn to a consideration of the instruction \u2014 that a person is presumed to intend to do what he does do \u2014 as specifically applied to the case against the defendant. When we do so, any <em>Sandstrom </em>error as to the defendant appears immaterial and harmless in all respects. The Commonwealth never claimed that the defendant committed the killing. He never did anything, to the victim or otherwise, that could have caused a reasonable juror, hearing the challenged charge, to presume any contested fact of the Commonwealth\u2019s case against the defendant. The question whether the defendant shared the intent of Campbell and Keigney was a very live, important, and seemingly close question for the jury. The challenged instructions, however, had nothing to do with the jury\u2019s consideration of that issue as the judge gave that issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">When the defendant prevented Carden from moving along the catwalk to the victim\u2019s cell about two and one-half hours before the killing and when the defendant leaned over the rail in front of the victim\u2019s cell shortly before Keigney and Campbell left the victim\u2019s cell at a fast pace and Carden found the victim\u2019s body, the defendant intended to do what he did on each occasion, as the challenged charge indicates. The question whether the defendant intended to have happen what Campbell and Keigney did to the victim is a separate question, on which the jury were separately instructed unaffected by any <em>Sandstrom </em>and <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">4. The teaching of <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>may not permit us to weigh the charge as a whole (except to the extent that a constitutional error is explained away by other language). We have, therefore, not done so. On the other hand, based on the charge in this case, a reasonable juror would not have been likely to have presumed any contested fact against the defendant. To conclude that a reasonable juror <em>could </em>have done so, the <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>standard, by an analysis of ambiguous language (\u201cintend to do what we do do\u201d) heard once in the judge\u2019s charge would be an extreme position. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Lawyers and judges parse challenged jury instructions, with days to reflect on language that appears before them in writing, to satisfy themselves whether an instruction is or is not constitutionally correct. Lay people hear the judge\u2019s words, untuned by training to the implication of the words and unaided by having them in writing. In such situations, the reasonable impression that a jury would have from the judge\u2019s instructions as to their fact-finding obligations should be an important factor in deciding the merits of a claim that ambiguous language in a charge creates an impermissible presumption requiring reversal of the conviction. This seems to be what the Supreme Court is saying in <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-16\">The judge told the jury that, if they become convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that one of the defendants killed the victim, the jury would have to consider the question of joint enterprise. He told them that the defendant could be guilty of murder only if he intended grievous harm to the victim. \u201c[Y]ou must have made a determination beyond a reasonable doubt that this design and purpose existed in the minds of each of these men.\u201d Later the judge said, \u201c[A]s to the defendant Doherty, ... to be included in the joint enterprise, you must find that he must have shared the common intent.\u201d No reasonable juror should have been or, we submit, could have been misled by the challenged instructions to presume any contested fact against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-29\">The judge did not instruct the jury that Doherty is presumed to intend to do what Campbell and Keigney did do. The arguably defective presumption language can only be read reasonably to apply to what Doherty did do himself. The challenged instruction, therefore, had no bearing on the question whether Doherty shared Campbell\u2019s and Keigney\u2019s intent. We simply disagree with the assertion to the contrary in the dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-37\">5. The order denying the defendant\u2019s 1989 motion for a new trial is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AnT\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-11\"> In doing so, the single justice implicitly ruled that the issues as to which the defendant sought leave to appeal were new and substantial. That ruling does not, however, foreclose this court from considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>whether the defendant has waived his right to present the issues that are before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">We do not consider other issues that the defendant argues in his pro se brief as to which no leave to appeal has been granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-9\"> We said, \u201cCarden testified that Doherty obstructed his passage to Perrotta\u2019s cell shortly before 5 P.M. by placing a hand on his shoulder and engaging in loud conversation. He further testified that Doherty abruptly ceased these activities when Keigney and Campbell emerged from Perrotta\u2019s cell. Carden also testified to seeing Doherty leaning over the rail in front of Perrotta\u2019s cell just before the body was discovered. The jury might reasonably infer that Doherty was acting as a lookout on both occasions. If they so found, they would be justified in concluding that at the time Keigney and Campbell were murdering Perrotta, Doherty was present near the scene, purposefully aiding and abetting them in the commission of the crime, and that by reason thereof he was guilty as a principal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AMU\"> This court\u2019s opinion on the appeal of the defendant now before us did not discuss the jury charge in relation to the <em>Sandstrom </em>case.

As the court notes, <em>ante </em>at 97, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>378 Mass. 680, 688-689 (1979), the court characterized the case against Doherty\u2019s codefendants as \u201csomewhat thin,\u201d and, by comparison, the case against Doherty as presenting \u201ca somewhat closer question.\u201d The case against Doherty was based on the theory that, at the time Keigney and Campbell were murdering Perrotta, Doherty was acting as a lookout, \u201cpurposefully aiding and abetting them in the commission of the crime, and that by reason thereof he was guilty as a principal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689. Therefore, as the court properly recognizes, \u201c[t]he question whether the defendant [Doherty] shared the intent of Campbell and Keigney was a very live, important, and seemingly close question for the jury.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">With respect to that very- live, important, and close question, the judge instructed the jury that \u201c[w]e are presumed to intend to do what we do do. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d That instruction, the court acknowledges, \u201ccould be understood in context to say that a person is presumed to have intended to kill if that is the result of what he did do. The words have the potential of being understood to create a presumption, probably a rebuttable one, that runs afoul of <em>Sandstrom </em>principles.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 101-102. Nevertheless, in spite of its conclusion that the jury was given a constitutionally incorrect instruction with respect to the pivotal issue in the Commonwealth\u2019s case against Doherty, the court characterizes the error as harmless, and affirms the order denying Doherty\u2019s 1989 motion for a new trial. The court reasons that the presumption instruction was harmless because a reasonable juror would have understood that instruction to mean only that, \u201c[w]hen [Doherty] prevented Carden from moving along the catwalk . . . and when [he] leaned over the rail in front of the victim\u2019s cell,\u201d Doherty intended to prevent Carden from moving along the catwalk and Doherty intended to lean over the rail. <em>Ante </em>at 104. Those are matters about which there could have been no reasonable dispute. According to the court, the faulty instruction would not have gone further. That is, the court says, the instruction would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>not have suggested to a reasonable juror that when Doherty, by acting as a lookout, helped Keigney and Campbell to murder Perrotta, he is presumed to have shared their murderous intent. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">If Doherty\u2019s conduct created a presumption that he intended to do what he did, why would not Doherty\u2019s aiding and abetting a murder, which the jury would have been entirely justified in finding he did, create a presumption that he intended to do so? In my view, a reasonable juror could well have understood the instruction that \u201c[w]e are presumed to intend to do what we do do\u201d to mean that, if Doherty\u2019s conduct aided and abetted a murder, he is presumed to have intended that his conduct would aid and abet a murder. Furthermore, in the absence of such a presumption, the evidence was weak not only with respect to when Keigney and Campbell formed their murderous intention (perhaps it was after they reached Perrotta\u2019s cell), but also with respect to what Doherty knew of their intention when he undertook to function as a lookout. The mere fact that Doherty knew that Keigney and Campbell wanted their meeting with Perrotta to be undetected by prison personnel says little, and perhaps not enough to have satisfied the jury, had they been properly instructed, about whether Doherty intended to help Keigney and Campbell do what they ultimately did, that is, murder Perrotta. The error was far from harmless. I would reverse the order denying Doherty a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
