After hearing, the judge made careful, detailed written findings and concluded that the woman, Jane Doe (a pseudonym), would choose to do so. Doe\u2019s parents agree with the judge\u2019s determination. Doe\u2019s permanent guardian (guardian), the guardian ad litem (GAL), and Doe\u2019s physicians agree with the judge\u2019s determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Department of Mental Retardation (department), the agency responsible for Doe\u2019s care, also supports the judge\u2019s determination. Counsel for Doe, however, argues that we should vacate the judge\u2019s order because the judge applied an incorrect standard of proof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We-affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">I. <em>Prior proceedings. </em>In September, 1989, the department petitioned the Probate and Family Court Department to appoint a guardian to make medical decisions for Doe. Doe\u2019s parents declined to be appointed guardians, and opposed a proposal to replace her nasoduodenal feeding and hydration tube with a surgically-implanted percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge appointed a GAL and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>counsel for Doe. Thereafter, the judge appointed a temporary guardian, and later the temporary guardian became Doe\u2019s permanent guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In May, 1990, Doe\u2019s guardian filed a petition requesting the judge to authorize the \u201cwithdrawal of the nasoduodenal tube through which [Doe] is presently receiving hydration and nutrition.\u201d On the same day, the GAL filed his third and final report with the court. In it, the GAL stated that \u201c[t]here is no hope of either arresting or reversing [Doe\u2019s] degenerative neurological disease. If the ultimate question is to only prolong the dying process of a persistent vegetative patient with no hope of regaining cognitive functioning, then . . . [Doe] would consent to the withholding of treatment including nutrition and hydration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The petition filed by Doe\u2019s guardian asked the judge \u201cto determine whether [Doe] is capable of making informed decisions regarding the continuation of her medical treatment including, but not limited to, the provision of hydration and nutrition by nasoduodenal tube.\u201d The petition further requested the court, if it were to find that Doe was incompetent, to grant authority for \u201c(1) [t]he withholding of invasive medical and surgical procedures; (2) [t]he withholding of life support medications and treatments, including, but not limited to, antibiotics; [and] (3) [t]he withdrawal of the nasoduodenal tube through which [Doe] is presently receiving hydration and nutrition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The judge held a hearing on June 8, 1990, to consider the guardian\u2019s general petition. At the hearing, both the guardian and counsel for Doe agreed that Doe was incompetent, that she existed in a persistent vegetative state, and that there was no hope for improvement in her condition. The guardian also stated that Doe\u2019s parents supported the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge allowed the petition and ordered termination of nasoduodenal feeding and hydration. Counsel for Doe appealed. We allowed his application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">II. <em>The medical facts. </em>The medical facts are not in dispute and are as follows. Jane Doe is a thirty-three year old, profoundly retarded woman, who exists in a \u201cpersistent vegetative state.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Doe has been mentally retarded since infancy. Doe suffers from Canavan\u2019s disease,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which causes a progressive destruction of the central nervous system.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no possibility that her condition will improve. In 1988, Doe\u2019s doctors confirmed the diagnosis of Canavan\u2019s disease by a biochemical test first used in 1986. Verification of the diagnosis is significant in that it establishes that there is no hope for a reversal of Doe\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Doe spent the first five years of her life at home with her parents and older brother. During the years Doe was at home, she was hospitalized repeatedly for a variety of ail-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>merits. In 1963, when Doe\u2019s mother became pregnant with her third child,* <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Doe was admitted to the Wrentham State School (Wrentham).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In 1982, Doe had severe difficulty swallowing and repeatedly aspirated food fed to her by conventional means. Doe\u2019s physicians moved her to the Wrentham State School Medical Center (infirmary) and employed a nasoduodenal tube for feeding and hydration. Neither Doe nor her parents \u2014 nor, indeed, anyone \u2014 consented to the placement of the tube. Since 1982, Doe has received all her nutrition and hydration through the nasoduodenal tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Doe is dependent on die staff at Wrentham for all aspects of her care.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Doe\u2019s limbs are rigidly flexed, her joints contracted, her muscles atrophied and her bones extremely brittle. Doe breathes through a permanent tracheostomy necessitated by the tendency of her tongue to swell and block her. airway. Doe is incontinent of both bladder and bowel and requires regular catheterizations and enemas.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Doe displays no awareness of herself or her surroundings. Doe \u201ccarries out no volitional activity, nor does she show any cognitive response to any type of sensory stimulus\u201d \u2014 including stimuli calculated to cause intense pain in a conscious individual.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> She exhibits no facial expressions and does not speak. She suffers from both cortical blindness and deafness, and she cannot feel or smell. Doe does not experience hunger or thirst; she is without emotion of any sort. Though her functioning brainstem allows Doe to breathe on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>her own by means of a tracheostomy, she suffers from \u201ca total loss of cerebral functioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">III. <em>The right to refuse </em>treatment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Competent individuals have the right to refuse medical treatment. <em>Norwood Hosp. </em>v. Munoz, 409 Mass. 116, 122 (1991). They have a concomitant right to discontinue medical treatment. <em>Brophy </em>v. <em>New England Sinai Hosp., Inc., </em>398 Mass. 417, 438 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The right to refuse treatment or to discontinue treatment is based on a person\u2019s strong interest in being free from non-consensual invasions of the person\u2019s bodily integrity. See <em>Munoz, supra </em>at 122-123; <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 430; <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Center, </em>387 Mass. 152, 154 (1982); <em>Matter of Spring, </em>380 Mass. 629, 634 (1980); <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>379 Mass. 255, 261 (1979); <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 738-739 (1977). See <em>Cruzan, </em>110 S. Ct. 2841, 2846-2847 (1990). <em>In re Storar, </em>52 N.Y.2d 363, 376-377, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 858 (1981); <em>In re Quinlan, </em>70 N.J. 10, 38-42, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Garger </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>429 U.S. 922 (1976). Because \u201cthe value of human dignity extends to both [competent and incompetent] individuals,\u201d <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 745, incompetent individuals have the same rights as competent individuals to refuse and termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>nate medical treatment. <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 3), </em>378 Mass. 732, 745 (1979). <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 736. The fact that a person is incompetent should not result in the denial of that person\u2019s right to be free from nonconsensual invasions of bodily integrity. See <em>Matter of Moe, </em>385 Mass. 555, 566 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The doctrine of substituted judgment is the means by which incompetents may exercise their right to refuse or terminate treatment. We have explained the doctrine in the following way. The judge, after hearing, must try to identify the choice \u201cwhich would be made by the incompetent person, if that person were competent, taking into account the present and future incompetency of the individual as one of the factors which would necessarily enter into the decision-making process of the competent person.\u201d <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 752-753.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Lack of a prior expressed intention regarding medical treatment does not bar use of the doctrine of substituted judgment. See <em>Moe, supra </em>at 566; <em>Matter of Spring, supra </em>at 640. Accord <em>Foody </em>v. <em>Manchester Memorial Hosp., </em>40 Conn. Supp. 127 (1984); <em>Guardianship of Barry, </em>445 So. 2d 365, 371 (Fla. App. 1984); <em>Estate of Longeway, </em>133 Ill. 2d 33, 50 (1989). Cf. <em>Guardianship of Weedon, </em>409 Mass. 196 (1991). We recognize that in situations in which there is an attempt to use substituted judgment for a never-competent person, it is a legal fiction. It is the legal mechanism by which society (at least in Massachusetts) attempts to vindicate liberty interests, albeit through a legal fiction. We are also aware that therefore \u201cthe substituted judgment [doctrine] is . . . difficult to apply.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Roe, </em>383 Mass. 415, 444 n.16 (1981). That difficulty, however, \u201cprovides inadequate justification for denying its benefits. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhile it may ... be necessary to rely to a greater degree on objective criteria [in the case of a never-competent person] ... the effort to bring the substituted judgment into step with the values and desires of the affected individual must not, and need not, be abandoned.\u201d <em>Saike</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>wicz, supra </em>at 751.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">IV. <em>Findings as to substituted judgment. </em>After a determination of incompetency has been made,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> there are five factors that judges must consider in substituting their judgment for that of incompetent people. They are: the patient\u2019s expressed preferences; the patient\u2019s religious convictions and their relation to refusal of treatment; the impact on the. patient\u2019s family; the probability of adverse side effects; and the prognosis with and without treatment. See <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 427; <em>Roe, supra </em>at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">a. <em>Patient\u2019s preferences. </em>In its effort to ascertain what Doe would choose for herself were she competent, the court below made a thorough inquiry into the nasoduodenal feeding and hydration treatment she receives. The judge found that a nasoduodenal tube is \u201cintrusive\u201d and that \u201c[ejxtensive handling and manipulation of [Doe\u2019s] body are themselves pervasive bodily intrusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Because Doe \u201chas never been in a position to make an informed decision for or against any kind of medical treatment,\u201d the judge determined that the views of Doe\u2019s parents were \u201cthe best mirror of [Doe\u2019s] wishes,\u201d had she ever been competent to form a preference.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>b. <em>Impact on family. </em>Doe\u2019s parents are completely in accord with the guardian\u2019s proposal to terminate treatment and the judge\u2019s finding as to their daughter\u2019s substituted judgment. The judge found that Doe\u2019s parents were acting in \u201cgood faith\u201d in asking for termination of medical treatment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See note 4, <em>supra. </em>The judge noted that Doe\u2019s mother cared for her daily until the mother was beaten down by exhaustion with the birth of her third, also retarded, child. The judge noted that Doe\u2019s mother always acted with \u201cintelligence and compassion for her daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">c. <em>Religious beliefs. </em>The judge noted <em>that </em>Doe has \u201cnever been in a position to acquire any religious beliefs\u201d and, therefore, that she holds \u201c[no] religious beliefs . . . that would\u201d oppose the termination of nasoduodenal feeding and hydration. The judge also remarked that no one \u2014 including counsel for Doe \u2014 has identified any religious belief of either Doe or her family that would compel the continuation of tube feeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">d. <em>Prognosis and side effects. </em>If her nasoduodenal tube is not removed, the judge found, the prognosis is an indefinite continuation of Doe\u2019s persistent vegetative state. \u201cIf the hydration and nutrition treatment by tube is withdrawn,\u201d the court explained, \u201cthen [Doe] would likely die of dehydration in a matter of days.\u201d The medical evidence indicates that, because of Doe\u2019s persistent vegetative state, she will not suffer the effects of dehydration. For the same reason, side ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>fects of withdrawing treatment will cause Doe neither physical nor psychological discomfort.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">V. <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s interests. </em>In granting the guardian\u2019s petition, the judge recognized that a ward\u2019s right to refuse treatment through the exercise of substituted judgment is not absolute. See <em>Munoz, supra </em>at 125; <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 432, citing, inter alia, <em>Myers, supra </em>at 261-262; <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 740-741. Rather, it may be constrained by at least four important State interests: (1) the preservation of life; (2) the protection of innocent third parties; (3) the prevention of suicide; and (4) the maintenance of the ethical integrity of the medical profession. See <em>Munoz, supra </em>at 125; <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 432; <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 741; <em>Matter of Spring, supra </em>at 641; <em>Matter of Hier, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 210 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">a. <em>Preservation of life. </em>The judge emphasized that the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in preserving life is of vital importance. \u201cThe utmost caution,\u201d the judge admonished, \u201cwill be required to insure that overriding State interests are appropriately addressed.\u201d He nevertheless concluded that the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in preserving life was not sufficient in this case to override Doe\u2019s substituted judgment to refuse treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The Commonwealth\u2019s interest in preserving life is strongest when it is attempting to protect its citizens from abuse or infringement of their rights. Where, however, as here, the appellees are striving to vindicate Doe\u2019s right to refuse invasive treatment, Doe\u2019s \u201cright to self determination must prevail over the State\u2019s interest in preserving life for all.\u201d <em>Gray by Gray </em>v. <em>Romeo, </em>697 F. Supp. 580, 589 (D.R.I. 1988), citing <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 438-439. <em>In re Gardner, </em>534 A.2d 947, 955 (Me. 1987). Because the judge found that, were she competent, Doe would refuse nasoduodenal feeding, the maintenance of the tube against Doe\u2019s wishes \u201crobs her of the right to determine her course of care.\u201d <em>Gray, supra </em>at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The judge noted that had he been confronted with a petition to initiate nasoduodenal feeding and hydration, he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>have applied Doe\u2019s substituted judgment to refuse such treatment. The judge reflected that, if the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in preserving life could block removal of the tube in cases like this one, then physicians might refrain from using tubes initially in all but the clearest of cases. The judge concluded that this is a \u201cmedically undesirable\u201d result. See <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 438, quoting <em>Matter of Conroy, supra </em>at 346-347 (\u201cSuch a rule could discourage families and doctors from even attempting certain types of care and could thereby force them into hasty and premature decisions to allow a patient to die\u201d). See also 2 President\u2019s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, Making Health Care Decisions 75 (1982) (\u201cAn even more troubling wrong occurs when a treatment that might save or improve health is not started because the health care personnel are afraid that they will find it difficult to stop the treatment if, as is fairly likely, it proves to be of little benefit and greatly burdens the patient\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">b. <em>Prevention of suicide. </em>Because Doe will commit no act, the court found that the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in preventing suicide is not a consideration. It is well settled that withdrawing or refusing life-sustaining medical treatment is not equivalent to attempting suicide. See <em>Munoz, supra </em>at 125, citing <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 743 n.11; <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 439. Accord <em>Conroy, supra </em>at 350-351. Absent an intent to die, there can be no suicide. As we have previously held, a \u201cdeath which occurs after the removal of life sustaining systems is from natural causes, neither set in motion nor intended by the patient.\u201d <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 439, citing <em>Rasmussen </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>154 Ariz. 200, 204 (1986), quoting <em>Welfare of Colyer, 99 </em>Wash. 2d 114, 123 (1983). As the. judge noted, Doe has no ability to commit a volitional act.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The judge determined that Canavan\u2019s disease, not the removal of the feeding and hydration tube, would be the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>producing agent if the tube is removed. See <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 439. The judge in his findings stated that there is \u201c[no] suggestion in any of the evidence that [Doe], her family, the Guardian, the [GAL] or staff at Wrentham would wish to commit or be involved in a suicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">c. <em>Medical ethics. </em>Finally, the judge noted that \u201c[t]here appears to be no disagreement that the proposed course of action by the guardian does not undermine the integrity of the medical profession.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Medical ethics do not require health care professionals to preserve life in every circumstance. See <em>Munoz, supra </em>at 127; <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 439-440; <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 743-44. In reaching his decision, the judge relied on two neurological consultations, three reports of the GAL, and a review of the case by a Wrentham ethics committee. None of these evaluations contests the recommendation that nasoduodenal feeding and hydration be discontinued. Medical ethics therefore are in no way compromised by termination of this treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">VI. <em>The judge\u2019s determination. </em>After carefully reviewing all the available evidence, and after visiting Doe personally, the judge determined that Doe\u2019s \u201csubjective judgment would be to request withdrawal or withholding of treatment\u201d including nasoduodenal feeding and hydration.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">In his analysis of the legal issues, the judge concluded that the legal standard to be used as a guide in making his decision was \u201ca \u2018preponderance of the evidence\u2019 with an \u2018extra measure of evidentiary protection\u2019 [by reason of] specific findings of fact after a \u2018careful review of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d Doe\u2019s counsel asserts that the judge erred in using this standard. We do not agree. We are firmly convinced that the seriousness of the decision will be more forcefully impressed on judges if they are required to set forth their findings in \u201cme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>ticulous detail\u201d than if they merely label their findings as meeting a particular standard. <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 3), supra </em>at 745. See <em>Matter of Moe, supra </em>at 572; <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>385 Mass. at 713; <em>Roe, supra </em>at 425; <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>377 Mass. 876, 886 (1979). \u201c[A]s every judge knows, to set down in precise words the facts as he finds them is the best way to avoid carelessness in the discharge of [one\u2019s] duty: Often a strong impression that, on the basis of the evidence, the facts are thus-and-so gives way when it comes to expressing that impression on paper.\u201d <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>377 Mass. at 886, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Forness, </em>125 F.2d 928, 942 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Salamanca </em>v. <em>United States, </em>316 U.S. 694 (1942). See <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>623 F.2d 1047 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In <em>Guardianship of Roe, </em>383 Mass. 405, 425 (1981), we said that, in cases involving important personal rights, \u201cwe have refused to apply either the \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 standard or the \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 standard.\u201d Rather, we have determined that \u201cfact-finding is enhanced by requiring that it be done in writing and in meticulous detail.\u201d This rationale clearly applies to substituted judgment determinations. We are confident that judges, mindful of the serious consequences following entry of substituted judgment orders, will enter such orders only after carefully considering the evidence and entering specific findings on each factor and then balancing the various interests. <em>Id. </em>What we require is careful work and reflection on the part of the judge before entering a substituted judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">On appeal, counsel for Doe relies on cases that he claims require that the standard be clear and convincing evidence: <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>390 Mass. 489 (1983) (administration of psychotropic medication to inpatient); <em>Roe, supra </em>(administration of antipsychotic medication to noninstitutionalized ward); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>377 Mass. 272 (1979) (civil commitment); <em>Superintendent of Worcester State Hosp. </em>v. <em>Hagberg, </em>374 Mass. 271 (1978) (civil commitment); <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745 (1982) (termination of parental rights); <em>Addington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>441 U.S. 418 (1979) (civil commitment); <em>Woodby </em>v. <em>INS, </em>385 U.S. 276 (1966) (deportation).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In each of these cases, however, the government sought to infringe on a citizen\u2019s liberty interests. Here, by contrast, Doe\u2019s guardian (as well as her parents) is attempting to determine Doe\u2019s preference in order to vindicate Doe\u2019s rights to bodily integrity and privacy. See <em>Moe, supra </em>at 572. We therefore conclude that the judge was correct in his ruling on the appropriate standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In this case, the judge\u2019s findings \u201cmake it manifest that the utmost care was devoted to the determination of [substituted judgment].\u201d <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>377 Mass, at 886. After finding the facts and analyzing all the factors, the judge concluded that Doe\u2019s \u201csubjective judgment would be to request withdrawal or withholding of treatment.\u201d The judge determined that, were Doe competent, she would wish to \u201cgo in peace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The judge\u2019s decision and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\"> The judge appointed three attorneys to look out for Doe\u2019s interests: a guardian ad litem, a permanent guardian, and counsel to represent her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b531-9\"> Doe\u2019s counsel failed to raise this issue at trial and it is, therefore, not properly before us.

The majority\u2019s insinuation that the decision to terminate her food and water will give effect to her wish is both morally offensive and intellectually curious, to say the least.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">There is absolutely no basis on which to conclude that Doe would choose to die by starvation and dehydration if she were competent. The possibility that she wishes to terminate the provision of food and water is no more likely than the possibility that she fears this action and hopes, in her help-' less state, that society will continue to meet her basic needs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Given this reality, where lies the logical, moral, and ethical justification for depriving her of food and water? Without addressing this threshold dilemma, the majority determines that Ms. Doe would prefer death over life and concludes that we should assist her in meeting that end, under the guise of a heroic vindication of her liberty interests. There is no glory in this last hurrah.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">As an initial matter, the substituted judgment doctrine, which even the majority opinion recognizes as a \u201clegal fiction,\u201d is a completely inappropriate device in cases involving the medical treatment of incompetents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if the substi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>tuted judgment doctrine were a proper approach for cases involving the medical treatment of incompetents, the majority opinion completely ignores the evidentiary constraints that are part and parcel of the doctrine. When this court initially adopted the substituted judgment doctrine, it relied upon an early Nineteenth Century British case, <em>Ex parte Whitbread in re Hinde, a Lunatic, </em>35 Eng. Rep. 878 (1816), which involved the administration of the estate of an incompetent person. <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 751 (1977). As the <em>Saikewicz </em>court recognized, the substituted judgment doctrine was used in <em>Whitbread </em>to authorize a gift from the estate of an incompetent to a person to whom the incompetent owed no duty of support. <em>Id. </em>at 751-752. As Professor Louise Harmon pointed out in her critique of the substituted judgment doctrine, Harmon, Falling Off the Vine: Legal Fictions and the Doctrine of Substituted Judgment, 100 Yale L.J. 1 (1990), there are serious ramifications that result from applying what is, in essence, property law to determine the rights of incompetent patients to medical treatment. See <em>id. </em>at 65-67 (discussing irresponsibility of applying property law to rights of incompetent patients).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Even if one were to overlook the basic inappropriateness of using a property law concept in this situation, the substituted judgment doctrine itself, as it developed in property law, bears little resemblance to its use in the area of medical treatment for incompetents. In the first place, the English common law differentiated two types of incompetents: the lunatic, who once possessed a sound mind and was expected to recover, and the idiot, who never possessed a sound mind. <em>Id. </em>at 16. The substituted judgment doctrine in property law applied only to lunatics, for whom there was evidence of their former intentional states, and it was not applied to an incompetent such as the patient in this case for whom there was no evidence of her former intentional state. See <em>id. </em>at 63-64 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>(substituted judgment doctrine appropriate only for lunatics, not idiots).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Even the <em>Whitbread </em>decision, which only concerned a lunatic, generated judicial distrust, and later decisions imposed strict evidentiary constraints upon its use. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25. Chief among these constraints was evidence of the lunatic\u2019s former intentional state. <em>Id. </em>at 25. \u201cSubsequent Chancellors looked for a degree of consanguinity, a history of prior warmth and affection, perhaps statements made by the lunatic of his intent to make gifts to the petitioner, or even evidence of past gift-giving on which to hang a moral obligation. He was no longer a generic, reasonable lunatic prone to giving his money away. [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] Instead, he was a specific individual with a past that had to be consulted.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">When the substituted judgment doctrine in property law was transported to America, the evidentiary constraints were even stricter than those in England. Harmon, <em>supra </em>at 27. Indeed, a presidential commission stated: \u201cThe substituted judgment standard can be used only if a patient was once capable of developing views relevant to the matter at hand; further, there must be reliable evidence of these views.\u201d President\u2019s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, Deciding to Forego Life Sustaining Treatment at 133 (1983). How ironic that a property law concept not only has been transformed to our jurisprudence on the rights of incompetents to medical treatment but also has been applied more liberally in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The majority opinion observes, <em>ante </em>at 521, that \u201c[t]he Commonwealth\u2019s interest in preserving life is strongest when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>it is attempting to protect its citizens from abuse or infringement of their rights,\u201d but then dismisses this potentially overriding interest by refocusing the issue in this case as the championing of Ms. Doe\u2019s fundamental rights to bodily integrity. This clever approach omits to explain why the State\u2019s strong interest in protecting its citizen\u2019s right to receive nutrition from being abused or infringed upon is not so worthy of defense as the citizen\u2019s right to self-determination, especially where there is no genuine expression of the citizen\u2019s preference. Moreover, there is no recognition of the State\u2019s duty to provide adequate food and medical care to its citizen, who has a protected liberty interest in the same. <em>Youngberg </em>v. <em>Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 307, 324 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The court ostensibly involves itself in this matter to protect the interests of the vulnerable and then takes advantage of Ms. Doe\u2019s vulnerability to fashion an argument that she is a social, medical and familial burden and that her simple, fundamental needs should no longer be met. Ms. Doe cannot speak, so the court utters fatal words on her behalf. The court should not guess as to what she would say, if she had the ability to do so. On balance, the only choice which truly respects the value of Ms. Doe\u2019s life \u2014 indeed, human life \u2014 is the recognition and acceptance of our duty to feed and hydrate this dependent member of our society, until her inevitable demise.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u201cThe feeding of the hungry, whether because they are poor or because they are physically unable to feed themselves, is the most fundamental of all human relationships. ... It is a most dangerous business to tamper with, or adulterate, so enduring and central a moral emotion.\u201d Callahan, On Feeding the Dying, 13 Hastings Center Rep. at 22 (Oct. 1983). Widespread acceptance of this social sentiment is reflected in the fact that, out of thirty-nine living will statutes, twenty explicitly provide that \u201cmedically administered nutrition and hydration are not life-sustaining treatments which can be withdrawn pursuant to a directive.\u201d Zinberg, Decisions For The Dying: An Empirical Study of Physicians\u2019 Responses To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Advance Directives, 13 Vt. L. Rev. 400, 458-459 &amp; n.45 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The characterization of the provision of food and water as a medical treatment or a basic entitlement requires a determination of what life means \u2014 a task of no small magnitude. Yet, the conclusion easily reached today regrettably answers that profound question, stating, in effect, that those persons who depend on the care of others and technological advances for their comfort and survival do not have \u201clife,\u201d or at least do not have a protected interest in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-6\"> would seem that a person who never has been physically or mentally competent, one who never has known or enjoyed the full panoply of life\u2019s offerings, would be less expecting in terms of the quality of his or her life. The person may find whatever satisfaction he or she derives from his or her existence to be valuable and sacred. It is wrong, therefore, to discuss this matter in terms of what Ms. Doe would decide if she were competent, since that standard attributes knowledge of the loss of quality of life to the incompetent and presumes that the person\u2019s decision would involve a comparison of his or her objectively poor situation in relation to healthy, competent persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b544-7\"> An ever-increasing number of commentators is reaching the same conclusion. See, e.g., Buchanan, The Limits of Proxy Decisionmaking for Incompetents, 29 UCLA L.

The judge determined, and the court affirms, that, \u201cwere Doe competent, she would wish to \u2018go in peace.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 525. As I did in <em>Brophy </em>v. <em>New England Sinai Hosp., Inc., </em>398 Mass. 417, 448-453 (1986), and <em>Norwood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>409 Mass. 116, 131-133 (1991), I protest the court\u2019s legal embrace of suicide \u2014 and beyond. As recently as 1980, the court stated that, \u201ca competent person has a general right to refuse medical treatment <em>in appropriate circumstances, </em>to be determined by balancing the individual interest against countervailing State interests, particularly the State interest in the preservation of life\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Matter of Spring, </em>380 Mass. 629, 634 (1980). See also <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 745 (1977). More recently, however, and ominously, the limiting references to appropriate circumstances and State interests have disappeared from the court\u2019s definition of the right to refuse life-sustaining treatment. In the present case, the court describes the right this way: \u201cCompetent individuals have the right to refuse medical treatment. <em>Norwood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>409 Mass. 116, 122 (1991). They have a concomitant right to discontinue medical treatment. <em>Brophy [, supra </em>at] 438.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 517. Then, in order to make clear that the new formulation of the rule is indeed designed to grant competent individuals an unqualified and absolute right of self <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>determination, the court states in a conclusory fashion: \u201cThe Commonwealth\u2019s interest in preserving life is strongest when it is attempting to protect its citizens from abuse or infringement of their rights. Where, however, as here, the appellees are striving to vindicate Doe\u2019s right to refuse invasive treatment, Doe\u2019s \u2018right to self determination must prevail over the State\u2019s interest in preserving life for all.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 521. The court\u2019s position is clear: Although the State may have a legitimate interest in supporting a competent individual\u2019s election to live, it has no legitimate interest in opposing or frustrating anyone\u2019s choice to die. The court reaffirms what it declared in <em>Brophy, </em>supra, and <em>Munoz, supra, </em>despite its disclaimer in those cases, that a competent individual has a legal right in this Commonwealth to commit suicide, and that others have a right to assist him or her in that effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Suicide, the purposeful termination of one\u2019s own life, is no less suicide when death is accomplished by inaction than when an affirmative act is employed as the agent of death. As Justice Scalia wrote in <em>Cruzan </em>v. <em>Director, Mo. Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>110 S. Ct. 2841, 2861 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring), \u201c [i]t would not make much sense to say that one may not kill oneself by walking into the sea, but may sit on the beach until submerged by the incoming tide. . . . Starving oneself to death is no different from putting a gun to one\u2019s temple as far as the common-law definition of suicide is concerned; the cause of death in both cases is the suicide\u2019s conscious decision to \u2018put an end to his own existence.\u2019 4 Blackstone, [Commentaries] at *189.\u201d Similarly^ there is no valid moral or legal distinction between active and passive euthanasia.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">I would agree that the law should recognize a competent person\u2019s right to refuse or withdraw medical treatment when that choice is not motivated by a desire to die but, instead, is reasonably motivated by a desire to avoid procedures that are in themselves, and not simply because they prolong life, physically or emotionally painful. Suicide, however, is a different matter. Society\u2019s respect for the value of every human life without reference to its condition, the cornerstone of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>American law, is inconsistent with a State\u2019s recognition of a legal right to commit suicide, assist suicide, or engage in voluntary euthanasia (mercy killing in accordance with the wishes of the suffering person). \u201cThe life of those to whom life has become a burden \u2014 of those who are hopelessly diseased or fatally wounded \u2014 nay, even the lives of criminals condemned to death, are under the protection of the law, equally as the lives of those who are in the full tide of life\u2019s enjoyment, and anxious to continue to live.\u201d <em>Cruzan, supra </em>at 2860 (Scalia, J., concurring), quoting <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>State, </em>23 Ohio St. 146, 163 (1873). Recognition of the dignity of human life demands resistance, rather than concession, to the real or imaginary death wishes of those who are afflicted with pain, depression, a sense of personal worthlessness, or a sense of burdensomeness to others A humane society provides support of every kind, including moral support, to those who are burdened in order that they may <em>live, </em>not \u201cgo,\u201d as the Probate Court judge, with this court\u2019s approval, would have it, <em>ante </em>at 525, in \u201cpeace.\u201d No \u201clegal system\u201d is worthy of that appellation unless its primary function is to protect the most vulnerable members of society. It follows that, in the absence of otherwise compelling legislation, no court should recognize a legal right to commit suicide, whether by action (e.g., lethal injection) or by inaction (e.g., withdrawal of nutrition and hydration, or withdrawal of antibiotic medication to treat pneumonia). Nor should any court recognize a corresponding right to assist in suicide or to engage in the closely related practice of voluntary euthanasia.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Can it reasonably be doubted that legal acceptance of suicide, assisted suicide, and voluntary euthanasia presents a serious risk that acceptance of involuntary euthanasia (mercy killing not chosen by the affected individual) is soon to follow? Today\u2019s decision is most instructive. Indeed, it is a case in point. By a process of substituted judgment, a Probate and Family Court judge, affirmed by this court, attributed to Jane Doe, a woman who has been profoundly retarded since infancy and exists in a persistent vegetative state, a choice to discontinue the tube-feeding and hydration necessary to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>survival. This attribution of choice was made and affirmed although Doe, never having had an ability to commit volitional acts, and showing no response to stimuli calculated to cause pain in a conscious individual, could not possibly have sought to be free from physically or emotionally painful treatment. Nevertheless, the choice made for, and attributed to, Doe is said to have been predicated on the judge\u2019s decision, based on the preponderance of the evidence, that Jane Doe, were she competent, would have preferred death over life as she was living it, and would have requested that her choice to end her life be honored. On the basis of an assessment of the quality of life accessible to Doe, the judge authorized the withholding of food and water in order that Doe, who actually had no say in the matter, might \u201cgo in peace.\u201d If this is not involuntary euthanasia, or worse, it is hard to know what is.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The court states: \u201cWe recognize that in situations in which there is an attempt to use substituted judgment for a never-competent person, it is a legal fiction.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 518. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 894 (6th ed. 1990), defines \u201clegal fiction\u201d this way: \u201cAssumption of fact made by court as basis for deciding a legal question. A situation contrived by the law to permit a court to dispose of a matter, though it need not be created improperly; e.g. fiction of lost grant as basis for title by adverse possession.\u201d Doe\u2019s choice to discontinue nourishment and hydration is indeed a contrivance. By the nature of her illness, she is without pain; \u201cshe is without emotion of any sort.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 516. Therefore, nothing related to her own best interests would suggest to her, were she competent, that it is time for her to go in peace. And even if she were hurting, how can anyone say, applying even the minimal preponderance of the evidence standard of proof, that it has been established that Doe, if she were competent, would choose death over life? Almost everyone has known someone who has tenaciously clung to life against all odds despite immense anguish and pain. There are many possible explanations for that in addition to mankind\u2019s innate instinct to survive. For example, were she competent, Jane Doe might consider her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>life a precious gift from God to be nourished, not rejected. If, indeed, the court\u2019s goal is to protect Jane Doe\u2019s liberty interest in individual choice, the court should recognize that \u201c[individual choice is determined not by the vote of the majority but by the complexities of the singular situation viewed from the unique perspective of the person called on to make the decision.\u201d <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 747. It obviously is impossible to know what never-competent Jane Doe\u2019s unique perspective would have been or what life and death choice she would have made had she been competent. Perhaps she would have exercised the most fundamental right anyone has \u2014 the foremost right protected by the Federal and State Constitutions \u2014 the right to life. By imposing a death, rather than life, choice on Jane Doe, it is arguable that the court violates that right. Surely, by imposing a judicial choice, the court violates the very value it professes to espouse: the dignity of incompetent persons and their concomitant right to self determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The court\u2019s attempt to use substituted judgment for a never-competent person is not the only fiction to be found in its opinion. There are several others, but I shall focus on only three. The first of these is that the court\u2019s approval of the withdrawal of Jane Doe\u2019s nutrition and hydration is given for Jane Doe\u2019s benefit. That leads me to ask how she benefits from an early death. She is not burdened by life. She need not \u201cgo\u201d to be in peace. For all that appears, with food and drink and care she can \u201cstay\u201d in peace. Any benefit derived from terminating Jane Doe\u2019s life is derived by someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The second fiction I wish to address concerns causation. Quoting <em>Brophy, supra </em>at 439, the court claims that \u201cdeath which occurs after the removal of life sustaining systems is from natural causes, neither set in motion nor intended by the patient.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 522. The court states, with obvious approval, that \u201c[t] he judge determined that Canavan\u2019s disease, not the removal of the feeding and hydration tube, would be the death producing agent if the tube is removed.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 522-523. That surely is \u201c[a] situation contrived by the law to permit a court to dispose of a matter.\u201d The court employs a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>device, a pretense, contrived for the purpose of authorizing the termination of Jane Doe\u2019s life. It is clear that, but for removal or non-use of the nasoduodenal tube, Jane Doe will live for the indefinite, perhaps considerable, future. Without it she will promptly die. That is proximate causation according to any recognized definition of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The fiction as to causation is especially disturbing because its apparent purpose is to give support to the further fiction, expressed elsewhere in the court\u2019s opinion, that the feeding and hydration of Jane Doe may be discontinued without anyone being responsible for her death. Doe will not be responsible, says the court, because she is incapable of choice (\u201cDoe has no ability to commit a volitional act.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 522). Others will not be responsible because they are only vindicating Jane Doe\u2019s choice, not exercising their own. <em>Ante </em>at 522. In any event, the court says, Doe\u2019s death will result only from natural causes and not from starvation due to withdrawal of the nasoduodenal tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">I am not insensitive to the immense burden carried by Jane Doe\u2019s family for a long time. Furthermore, I do not underestimate either the complexity of questions that may arise as a result of scientific advancements enabling the prolongation of life, nor am I unaware of associated anguish and stress. Lastly, I do not intend by the expression of my views in this opinion to demonstrate disrespect for those with whom I disagree. However, I must make very clear that I view the court\u2019s decision and its reasoning today as seriously wrong. The implications of this decision are frightening, not only for Jane Doe but for others similarly situated, such as the institutionalized, the elderly, and children with \u201cdefects\u201d who are too young to make decisions for themselves. I would reverse the judge\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
