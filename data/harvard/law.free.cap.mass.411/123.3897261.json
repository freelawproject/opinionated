The plaintiffs, registered voters of the city of Worcester, brought a complaint in the Superior Court against the defendants (hereinafter referred to collectively as the school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>committee) alleging violations of the open meeting law, G. L. c. 39, \u00a7\u00a7 23A-23C (1990 ed.). The judge allowed the school committee\u2019s motion to dismiss or for summary judgment as to both counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. The plaintiffs appealed from the dismissal of their complaint, which alleges that the school committee violated G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B, by excluding Grocki and his counsel from its deliberations regarding his dismissal. We transferred the case from the Appeals Court to this court on our own motion. We now affirm the judgment entered below.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">There is essentially no dispute of facts. Grocki had been a tenured teacher employed by the Worcester public school system since September, 1966. In February, 1990, the school committee notified Grocki that a meeting would be held pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 42, 42D (1990 ed.), to determine whether to dismiss, suspend, or discipline him. On March 29, 1990, the school committee held a public hearing on the matter. At the request of Grocki, the dismissal hearing was held in executive session pursuant to G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">During the hearing, Grocki was permitted to be represented by counsel, who presented evidence, cross-examined witnesses, and made a closing statement. The school administration was also given the opportunity to present its side of the case. At the close of the presentations, the superintendent of the Worcester public schools gave his recommendation that Grocki be dismissed as a teacher effective March 30; 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The school committee adjourned to discuss the facts of the case outside of the presence of Grocki, his counsel, the superintendent, the school administration\u2019s counsel, and all of the witnesses. Grocki\u2019s objection to the exclusion of himself and counsel during the school committee\u2019s deliberations was noted on the record. Almost one hour later, the school committee reconvened in executive session in the presence of those who previously had been in attendance, including Grocki and his counsel. At this time, the school committee voted to dismiss Grocki for an abuse of sick leave, insubordination, and misrepresentation. Shortly thereafter, in an open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>session, the school committee recorded its votes on the motions it considered while in executive session.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Meetings of municipal governmental bodies are governed by G. L. c. 39, \u00a7\u00a7 23A-23C, the so-called \u201copen meeting law.\u201d General Laws c. 39, \u00a7 23B, states that \u201c[a] 11 meetings of a governmental body shall be open to the public and any person shall be permitted to attend any meeting except as otherwise provided by this section.\u201d The school committee of Worcester is concededly a \u201c[governmental body.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the statute, the term \u201c[m]eeting\u201d includes \u201cdeliberations.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The open meeting law makes provisions for a governmental body to hold \u201cexecutive sessions\u201d from which certain persons may be barred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> General Laws c. 39, \u00a7 23B, states that executive sessions may be held only for certain enumerated purposes. One of these purposes, set forth in G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B (2), is \u201c[t]o consider the . . . dismissal of . . . a[n] . . . employee . . . .\u201d Subsection <em>(a) </em>of \u00a7 23B (2) provides that, if such an executive session is held, the affected individual has the right \u201cto be present at such executive session during discussions or considerations which involve that individual.\u201d The deliberations at issue in this case clearly were \u201cdiscussions or considerations\u201d involving the teacher. The teacher was not allowed to be present at those deliberations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The plaintiffs contend, therefore, that the committee violated the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The school committee counters that \u00a7 23B (2) <em>(a) </em>is inapplicable to this case because of a contrary provision contained in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, the statute governing dismissal of public school teachers. That statute provides, in part, that no tenured teacher may be dismissed \u201cunless, if he so requests, he has been given a hearing before the school committee which may be either public or <em>private </em>at the discretion of the school committee and at which he may be represented by counsel, present evidence and call witnesses to testify in his behalf and examine them\u201d (emphasis supplied). The school committee asserts that this statute, by authorizing \u201cprivate\u201d hearings, grants it the authority to conduct deliberations without the teacher present.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">The application of the open meeting law, particularly \u00a7 23B (2) <em>(a), </em>to other statutes is governed by G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 24, which states, \u201cThe provisions of this chapter shall be in force only so far as they are not inconsistent with the express provisions of any general or special law . . . .\u201d Therefore, if \u00a7 23A is inconsistent with the express provisions of \u00a7 42, the latter statute would control.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-17\">In <em>Kurlander </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Williamstown, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 350, 359-361 (1983), the Appeals Court was faced with a closely analogous problem. That court held that \u00a7 42\u2019s language concerning a private hearing encompassed a private deliberation, and that, therefore, the open meeting law was inconsistent with the express provisions of \u00a7 42. We agree with the reasoning in <em>Kurlander, </em>and hold that, because \u00a7 42 authorizes private deliberations in regard to dismissal of tenured public school teachers, the contrary provisions of the open meeting law are inapplicable. The school board, consequently, did not violate G. L. c. 39, \u00a7\u00a7 23A-23C, by excluding Grocki from their deliberations concerning his termination. The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-30\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\"> General Laws c. 39, \u00a7 23A, defines \u201c[governmental body\u201d as \u201cevery board, commission, committee or subcommittee of any district, city, region or town, however elected, appointed or otherwise constituted, and the governing board of a local housing, redevelopment or similar authority; provided, however, that this definition shall not include a town meeting.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\"> General Laws c. 39, \u00a7 23A, defines \u201c[m]eeting\u201d as \u201cany corporal convening and <em>deliberation </em>of a governmental body for which a quorum is required in order to make a decision at which any public business or public policy matter over which the governmental body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power is discussed or considered; but shall not include any on-site inspection of any project or program\u201d (emphasis added). The same section defines \u201c [deliberation\u201d as \u201ca verbal exchange between a quorum of members of a governmental body attempting to arrive at a decision on <em>any </em>public business within its jurisdiction\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b143-10\"> General Laws c. 39, \u00a7 23A, defines \u201c[ejxecutive session\u201d as \u201cany meeting of a governmental body which is closed to certain persons for deliberation on certain matters.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>O\u2019Connor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS6\">(dissenting). General Laws c. 39, \u00a7 23B (1990 ed.), provides that governmental bodies including school committees may hold executive sessions only for limited purposes, one of those purposes being, as here, to consider the discipline or dismissal of a public employee such as a teacher. Section 23B (2) also provides, however, that \u201c[a] governmental body shall hold an open meeting if the individual involved requests that the meeting be open,\u201d and that \u201c[i]f an executive session is held, [as it was here,] such individual shall have the following rights: <em>(a) </em>to be present at such executive session during discussions or considerations which involve that individual[,] (6) to have counsel or a representative of his own choosing present and attending for the purpose of advising said individual and not for the purpose of active participation[, and] (c) to speak in his own behalf.\u201d Clearly, the school committee violated c. 39, \u00a7 23B, by refusing the tenured teacher Grocki\u2019s request that he and his counsel be present at the committee\u2019s deliberations, held in executive session, regarding his dismissal. The only issue, then, is whether \u00a7 23B for some reason is inapplicable to this case. I say \u00a7 23B applies, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The court says that \u00a7 23B does not apply because c. 39, \u00a7 24, provides that \u201cthe provisions of [c. 39] shall be in force only so far as they are not inconsistent with the express provisions of any general or special law,\u201d and c. 39, \u00a7 23B, is inconsistent with the express provisions of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42 (1990 ed.). I have read \u00a7 42 carefully. I have been unable to find an express provision in that section that is inconsistent with the requirement in c. 39, \u00a7 23B, that, when a school committee deliberates in executive session considering the dismissal of a tenured teacher-, the teacher is entitled to be present, to have counsel present, and to speak.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The court, purporting to follow the Appeals Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kurlander </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Williamstown, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 350 (1983), concludes that \u201cbecause \u00a7 42 authorizes private deliberations in regard to dismissal of tenured public school teachers, the contrary provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>open meeting law are inapplicable.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 126. But the court misses the point. Even if c. 71, \u00a7 42, and c. 39, \u00a7 23B, are inconsistent with respect to whether private deliberations are authorized in the circumstances of this case, as the Appeals Court held in <em>Kurlander </em>(a proposition with which I do not agree \u2014 but resolution of that issue is unnecessary for this case), the plaintiffs do not complain about the deliberations being private rather than public. Instead, they complain that Grocki was entitled to be present with his counsel at the private deliberations and to speak, and his requests in that regard were refused. The only question in this case is whether any provision in c. 71, \u00a7 42, is inconsistent with the requirement in c. 39, \u00a7 23B, that requests such as Grocki\u2019s be honored. My answer is that there is no such provision in \u00a7 42, and I note that the court makes no attempt to point to one.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Chapter 71, \u00a7 42, states in relevant part as follows: \u201cThe school committee may dismiss any teacher .... [A tenured teacher] . . . shall not be dismissed . . . unless, if he so requests, he has been given a hearing before the school committee which may be either public or private at the discretion of the school committee and at which he may be represented by counsel, present evidence and call witnesses to testify in his behalf and examine them.\u201d Thus, even if the school committee\u2019s deliberations after a hearing are controlled by c. 71, \u00a7 42, so that the deliberations may be private, \u00a7 42 clearly provides that whenever the school committee chooses to deliberate privately rather than publicly the teacher whose dismissal is being considered is entitled to be present, to have counsel present, and to speak. This is all that Grocki requested, and he was entitled both by c. 39, \u00a7 23B, and c. 71, \u00a7 42, to the honoring of that request. In that regard the two statutes are not expressly inconsistent. Indeed, they are virtually identical. Both statutes make clear the intent of the Legislature to protect tenured teachers \u2014 and the public \u2014 from a school committee\u2019s dismissing a tenured teacher without adequate basis and without the teacher\u2019s having an op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>portunity .to observe the deliberations culminating in his or her being fired.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">I would reverse the judgment of the Superior Court, and I would order reinstatement of the tenured teacher without loss of compensation, seniority, tenure, or other benefits. Reinstatement is necessary, it seems to me, to provide proper enforcement of both the open meeting law and G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\"> I make no suggestion with respect to whether the dismissal in this case was warranted or unwarranted. I merely assert that the procedure mandated by the applicable statutes was not followed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
