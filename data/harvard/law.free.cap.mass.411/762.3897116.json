L. c. 209A (1990 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appeals Court reversed, and we granted further appellate review. We affirm the convictions entered in the Superior Court. In reversing the defendant\u2019s convictions the Appeals Court reasoned that the judge impermissibly invaded the jury\u2019s deliberations. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 588 (1991). The Appeals Court did not reach the defendant\u2019s other argument of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">1. <em>Intrusion upon the jury\u2019s prerogative. </em>The rules of criminal procedure allow a trial judge to require the jury to return a verdict or verdicts with respect to any charges on which they have reached a verdict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issue in this case is whether the trial judge lost that discretion because of the way he presented the case to the jury. In his charge to the jury the judge included the following remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\">\u201cYou will have what\u2019s called a verdict slip, you\u2019ll have four of them . . . one for each [offense charged. On each of them circle either guilty or not guilty] .... Your foreperson should sign. Your foreperson should date. Don\u2019t make any other marks on the slip. If you have occasion to take more than one vote and need to tally the votes, do it on some other piece of paper .... I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>suggest . . . that when you go out to the jury room . . . you allow each of you to speak first before taking any votes, but that\u2019s just a suggestion and you can do whatever you want. It\u2019s entirely up to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\">\u201c[L]et me say also [that] there is no Guiness Book of World Record\u2019s entry for the jury that took the longest to deliberate and there is no NC2A indoor record for the jury that came in with a verdict the fastest. You take whatever time, long or short, is necessary for deciding this case. You may, if you wish, but you need not, report a verdict as you reach each verdict. You may decide that you want to wait and announce all of them at once. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">On the second day of its deliberations the jury sent a question to the judge who, after responding, engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">The Court: \u201c . . . Now, Mr. Foreman, if you would please just answer this question \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d ... Do you have a verdict as to any indictment or any count of any indictment?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">Foreman Juror: \u201cYes, we do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-8\">The Court: \u201cVery well. I will ask you to return a verdict on. that indictment or indictments, that count or counts. What you should do is .to take the notebook \u2014 Do you have the jury book with you? All right. If you\u2019ll return to the jury room and take, bring with you into the courtroom those, any indictment or indictments or parts of an indictment <em>as to which you have a unanimous verdict </em>and then you will come into the courtroom, please, and we\u2019ll take the return of so much as you have reached <em>a unanimous verdict </em>and if you require a short amount of time now to complete your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>work on all of the indictments, you may at your discretion do that, but if you feel that you are going to have additional discussion, <em>I want you to feel free to have additional discussion, </em>but I merely wish you to bring back <em>whatever indictments you have completed. Am I clear?\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-5\">Foreman Juror: \u201cYou are clear and may I ask the Court a question?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">The Court: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">Foreman Juror: \u201cThe Court indicated when it charged the jury that the jury had the choice of returning one as they occurred or waiting until all four were complete, the foreperson asked the jury at the outset of deliberations what their collective decision was. Their collective decision was all four. Am I permitted to ask them or, in other words, the Court is simply ordering us to do that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-8\">The Court: \u201cI don\u2019t like using the word ordered, but I do wish you to return whatever verdicts you have now. All right. You may return to the jury room.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">After a brief recess the jury returned the guilty verdicts which are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">The defendant argues and the Appeals Court agreed that the judge\u2019s reversal of his instruction on the manner in which the jury verdicts be returned may have affected the jury\u2019s \u25a0deliberations and encroached on the jury\u2019s authority. It is, of course, true that whatever impairs the essentials of the right to jury trial must be struck down, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bellino, </em>320 Mass. 635, 639, cert. denied, 330 U.S. 832 (1947), and that trial courts must be careful to avoid invading the province of the jury or any conduct which has a tendency toward jury coercion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. 838, 844 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>364 Mass. 87, 99 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>(1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>354 Mass. 630, 638 (1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cote, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 365, 370 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">It is also true, however, that members of a jury are presumed to obey the instructions of the judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 232 (1989); <em>DeWitt </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>294 Mass. 65, 66 (1936); <em>Stricker </em>v. Scott, 283 Mass. 12, 14 (1933); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>212 Mass. 191, 194 (1912); <em>Rudberg v. Bowden Felting Co., </em>188 Mass. 365, 366 (1905). See also <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>442 U.S. 62, 73 (1979). Here, the judge\u2019s additional instructions explicitly required the jury to return only those verdicts which were unanimous and complete. He took pains to make sure the foreman understood his directive. To conclude that the jury could have felt pressure to convert provisional verdicts against the defendant into final ones and to abandon all doubts that they may have privately entertained runs counter to the clear instructions of the judge and amounts to mere speculation without any support in the record. We conclude that, on the facts in this case, the judge did not impermissibly invade the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">2. <em>Prosecutorial misconduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Before trial, the judge stated that during the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief the parties should not explore the bases for the mutual restraining orders which had been issued against the defendant and the mother of the victim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>cross-examination of the mother, the defendant attempted to raise an inference of an ongoing social relationship between the defendant and the mother. On redirect the prosecutor asked the mother about the reasons for the restraining order. Eighteen questions later, the judge, sua sponte, stopped the prosecutor from pursuing this line of questioning. The judge, however, refused to strike the testimony elicited to that point. The defendant, indicating that he was \u201cjust going to object,\u201d moved for a mistrial. The judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The other instance of alleged misconduct occurred during cross-examinadon of the defendant. Defendant testified that he and the mother had no problems, and that they had a continuous intimate relationship. The prosecutor again inquired about the incident that lead to the issuance of the restraining order against the defendant. The defendant objected; the question was allowed but never answered. Later on the defendant again objected, arguing that the prosecutor was going into the background of the restraining order, and consequently moved for a mistrial. The judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">While it is true that a promise by the Commonwealth to the defendant must be kept, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>364 Mass. 236, 238 (1973), we conclude that no promise existed here to be broken. There was, of course, an order of the judge. A judge, however, has a right to vary his rulings any time prior to closing, as long as such variance does not cause harm to a party. <em>Catania </em>v. <em>Emerson Cleaners, Inc., </em>362 Mass. 388, 390 (1972). <em>Ferris </em>v. <em>Ray Taxi Serv. Co., </em>259 Mass. 401, 405 (1927). Here, in response to the dynamics of trial the judge\u2019s rulings modified his pretrial order. The relationship between the mother and the defendant was specifically put in issue by the defendant during his cross-examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>tion of the mother. The evidence elicited by the prosecutor was relevant and admissible to refute the inference of an ongoing social relationship sought to be established by the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chalifoux, </em>362 Mass. 811, 815-816 (1973). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>408 Mass. 811, 817-818 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Travis, </em>408 Mass. 1, 13 (1990). It was within the judge\u2019s discretion, therefore, to modify his original pretrial ruling to permit redirect examination on a subject raised by the defendant on cross-examination rather than limit the prosecutor to raising the matter in rebuttal as his original order had contemplated. The cross-examination of the defendant was outside the scope of the original order. Again the prosecutor\u2019s question was admissible in view of the direct examination of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Furthermore, the judge had already ruled that the restraining orders \"themselves were admissible. The testimony elicited as to the reason for the orders was, therefore, to a great extent cumulative and any adverse effect was dissipated by the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With this in mind no prejudice could have resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s questions to the defendant on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Finally, the defendant\u2019s objection during redirect was not timely and was therefore waived. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cadwell, </em>374 Mass. 308, 311 (1978). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baptiste, </em>372 Mass. 700, 706 (1977) (objection coming after a question was answered was not timely); <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Columbian Fire Proofing Co., </em>182 Mass. 93, 98-99 (1902) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>(failure to make timely objection is a waiver to both the question and the answer).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-6\"> The defendant was found not guilty on a charge of rape of a child under sixteen, and a second count of violating a restraining order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\"> Massachusetts Rule of Criminal Procedure 27 (b), 378 Mass. 897 (1979), provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-8\">\u201c(b) Several Offenses or Defendants. If there are two or more offenses or defendants tried together, the jury may with the consent of the judge at any time during its deliberations return <em>Or be required by the judge </em>to return a verdict or verdicts with respect to the defendants or charges as to which a verdict has been reached; and thereafter the jury may in the discretion of the judge resume deliberation. The judge may declare a mistrial as to any charges upon which the jury cannot agree upon a verdict; provided, however, that the judge may first require the jury to return verdicts on those charges upon which the jury can agree and direct that such verdicts be received and recorded.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b784-8\"> The exact language follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-9\">The Court: \u201cI tell you, Mr. [Prosecutor], I think it would be the \u25a0fairest to do it this way. During the Commonwealth\u2019s case in chief we will not hear any testimony about the bad blood, if that\u2019s what we can call it, colloquially speaking, there may have or may not have existed between the parties other than the fact that a restraining order was obtained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-10\">Prosecutor: \u201cYes, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-11\">The Court: \u201cAnd the two restraining orders, of course, will be Exhibits. Now, at the close of the defendant\u2019s evidence, if the defendant decides to put in any evidence, a matter which of course is entirely open to Mr. [Defense Counsel] even though he\u2019s given me a list of witnesses, if at that point when the defendant has rested it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>appears to me that I should favor an application from you to bring in by way of rebuttal some of the past history, then we can recall [the mother of the victim] and bring it in then. But I think the fairest thing to do is not to bring it in at this point, that is, during the Commonwealth\u2019s case in chief. So, you\u2019ll please instruct [the mother of the victim] as to that.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b786-7\"> \u201cNow, you\u2019ve heard a lot about this relationship that went on between [the mother of the victim] and the defendant and you\u2019ve heard a lot about years of history of a relationship between the two of them. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not here to try what happened five years ago between them. We are not here to go into who got a restraining order against whom and who was right and who was doing what to whom and who was going to the Probate Court. We\u2019re not here to talk about those issues. What we are here for is to decide what happened on two specific dates last summer of 1988, and there are three issues in this case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
