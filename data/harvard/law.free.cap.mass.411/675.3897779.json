The plaintiff, town of Southbridge (town), is a municipal corporation located in Worcester <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>County. The company, began furnishing water to the inhabitants of Southbridge in 1881<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and later to the inhabitants of Charlton and Sturbridge. Its real estate includes reservoirs in Southbridge, Sturbridge, and Woodstock, Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In 1972, a town water supply committee was authorized at a special town meeting to negotiate for the purchase of the company pursuant to \u00a7 7 of the charter which is set forth in full in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties were unable to agree as to the meaning of \u201cactual cost\u201d in \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">As a result, the town filed a petition for declaratory judgment against the company in the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk. A single justice transferred the matter to the Superior Court where a judge reported the case to the Appeals Court and we then granted a joint application for direct appellate review. The court responded by defining \u201cactual cost\u201d as used in \u00a7 7 as \u201coriginal cost of plant, less accrued depreciation.\u201d <em>Southbridge I, supra </em>at 216. The court adopted this meaning because such meaning has been \u201cemployed regularly by the Department of Public Utilities and approved by this court in determining the rate base of the company and of other regulated utilities in the Commonwealth for rate setting purposes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The company argues that .we should change the definition of \u201cactual cost\u201d in the light of our decision in <em>Oxford </em>v. <em>Oxford Water Co., </em>391 Mass. 581 (1984), which was decided eight years after <em>Southbridge I, </em>and which interpreted the term \u201cactual cost\u201d within the framework of the Oxford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Water Company charter and the record before the court in that case. We decline to do so, because <em>Oxford </em>did not overrule <em>Southbridge I </em>either expressly or impliedly. It distinguished <em>Southbridge I </em>with the following language: \u201cAlthough much of the holding in <em>Southbridge </em>is applicable to the record before us, we do not feel bound to accept here that case\u2019s definition of \u2018actual cost.\u2019 In <em>Southbridge, </em>the company contended that the \u2018actual cost\u2019 was \u2018the full cost of the creation of the present system in its present condition.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 215. This included, the company claimed, every single expenditure made by the company relative to \u2018the planning, acquisition, construction, erection, installation, preparation, creation and preservation of the present functioning system.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>Faced with the choice between such a complex and unworkable definition of \u2018actual cost\u2019 and the relatively straightforward calculation based on the company\u2019s rate base, the court understandably opted for the latter. In contrast, the record now before us presents two equally workable definitions of \u2018actual cost.\u2019 We, therefore, reconsider the definition of \u2018actual cost\u2019 in light of the facts and arguments applicable to this case.\u201d <em>Oxford, supra </em>at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We need not consider arguments of the parties in this case concerning the effect of <em>Southbridge I </em>on issue preclusion because this case in relationship to <em>Southbridge I </em>represents more than mere identity of parties and issues. For all practical purposes, it is the same case and we have not been persuaded to change the declaration which we made in <em>South-bridge I, supra </em>at 216, that \u201cactual cost\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7 of the charter means \u201coriginal cost . . . less accrued depreciation.\u201d Judgment is entered dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\"> Section 7 of St. 1880, c. 73, provides as follows: \u201cThe town of South-bridge and any fire district that may be established, shall have the right at any time during the continuance of the charter hereby granted, to purchase the corporate property and all the rights and privileges of said company <em>at the actual cost </em>of the same, or if mutually agreed upon between said corporation and said town or any fire district which may be hereafter established in said town, at a less price; and said corporation is hereby authorized to make sale of the same to said town or such fire district; but such authority to purchase said franchise and property is granted to said town upon the condition that the same is assented to by said town by a two-thirds vote of the voters present and voting thereon at any annual meeting or at a legal meeting called to act on that subject\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
