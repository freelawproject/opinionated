MMWEC also seeks to strike certain orders and findings contained in the decision. A single justice reserved and reported the case without decision to the full court. We conclude that the council cannot order MMWEC to submit individual member forecasts as part of its long-range forecast. We also conclude that the council\u2019s decision rejecting the supply plan portion of MMWEC\u2019s forecast is supported by substantial evidence.

On October 7, 1988, also in accordance with the council\u2019s order, MMWEC filed an individual supply plan for each member system. MMWEC reserved its right to contest the council\u2019s authority to require MMWEC to file individual member system demand forecasts and supply plans as part of the proceeding. After holding public hearings, the council issued its final decision which approved MMWEC\u2019s demand forecast and rejected its supply plan. The council made no specific findings regarding the individual member system demand forecasts and supply plans. The final decision required MMWEC in all future proceedings to submit individual member system demand forecasts and supply plans as part of its joint filing. In this regard the council issued fifteen orders.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P (1990 ed.), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5 (1990 ed.), MMWEC appealed from the council\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>MMWEC claims that (1) the council exceeded its statutory authority in ordering MMWEC to file individual member forecasts; (2) the council has no authority to order MMWEC to submit, as part of its next long-range forecast, certain specific data and analyses; (3) the council\u2019s finding that MMWEC\u2019s electricity price forecast methodology is inappropriate is not supported by substantial evidence; and (4) the council erred in rejecting MMWEC\u2019s supply plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">We address a preliminary matter before turning to these questions. The council argues that its orders are prospective and therefore they presently are not ripe for judicial review. We disagree. First, MMWEC has preserved its right to contest the council\u2019s authority to require MMWEC to file individual member forecasts in the <em>present </em>filing, which is the subject of this appeal. Second, the council\u2019s final decision contained fifteen orders that MMWEC challenges as having no basis in law. Third, we may set aside or modify the council\u2019s decision if it is in excess of statutory authority, based on an error of law, arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(b), </em>(e), and (g), (1990 ed.). Therefore, since the orders are part of the decision from which MMWEC is appealing, it is appropriate that we decide their validity at this time by determining the council\u2019s authority under its enabling legislation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">2. <em>Obligations of electric companies under \u00a7 691. </em>General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 691, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cEvery electric company shall, either individually or jointly with others, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>file with the council a long-range forecast with respect to the electric power needs and requirements of its market area</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">According to MMWEC, once it submits such a joint forecast as authorized, its statutory obligation is fulfilled and it cannot be required to file individual forecasts. Moreover, MMWEC claims that the council\u2019s own regulation, 980 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.01 (5) (c) (1986),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> accepts the concept of joint forecasts in lieu of individual forecasts. By contrast, the council seeks to make a distinction between filing and review. The council claims that companies participating in joint filings are subject to individual review and that, therefore, separate decisions may be made for each company.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Even if we concede for the purpose of argument that, under its regulation, the council may require individual forecasts, such a requirement would be contrary to the plain language of the statute. General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 691, clearly provides that an electric company can fulfil its statutory obligation by filing either an individual forecast or a joint forecast for \u201cits market area.\u201d Since the enabling statute clearly endorses the concept of joint forecasts, any attempt by the council to restrict or to eliminate joint forecasts exceeds the council\u2019s legislative mandate and is void. <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, </em>395 Mass. 238, 241 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The council attempts to distinguish between the filing of a forecast and the review of a forecast. The council urges us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>determine that its legislative mandate of \u201cimplementing the energy policies ... to provide a- necessary energy supply for the commonwealth with a minimum impact on the environment at the lowest possible cost,\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69H, requires the council to review individual forecasts as part of a joint forecast. This interpretation flies in the face of the plain language of the statute. The Legislature provided for the alternatives of individual or joint forecasts. It is difficult to postulate why the Legislature would allow electric companies the option of filing a joint forecast and still permit that they be required to file individual forecasts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">A joint forecast necessarily implies an overlapping and sharing of market areas, with perhaps different participants\u2019 demand needs being supplied by other participants\u2019 facilities while an individual forecast does not. We conclude that MMWEC fulfils its statutory obligation by filing a joint long-range forecast with the council on behalf of its members; that the MMWEC members fulfil their statutory obligation by participating with MMWEC in a jointly filed long-range forecast; and that neither MMWEC nor any of its members must separately state or file \u201chistorical sales and demand or sendout data and forecast levels.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 980 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.01 (5) (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The council\u2019s own regulation is not inconsistent with this interpretation of the statute. As provided in 980 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.01 (5) (c), \u201call historical sales and demand or sendout data and forecast levels must be <em>stated </em>separately for each company whose wholesale and retail sales exceed two percent (2%) of total retail sales in the Commonwealth. Any company whose wholesale and retail sales do not exceed two percent (2%) need not <em>file </em>such data separately if it participates in a joint forecast or supplement\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The council argues that this regulation merely states that certain data need not be filed separately but does not state that such data need not be filed at all. The council claims that, because this regulation allows the council to render separate decisions for different companies participating in a joint forecast, the regulation somehow permits the council to require the specified data separately. The council also interprets the regulation as only preventing the council from ordering MMWEC\u2019s members to file separate data in separate and distinct proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u201cWe interpret a regulation in the same manner as a statute, and according to traditional rules of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Warcewicz </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>410 Mass. 548, 550 (1991). \u201cWe ordinarily accord an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation considerable deference .... However, this principle is deference, not abdication, and courts will not hesitate to overrule agency interpretations when those interpretations are arbitrary, unreasonable, or inconsistent with the plain terms of the regulation itself.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The regulation states that' certain demand data need not be filed separately. While it does not state that such data need not be filed at all, that conclusion is inescapable, in the context of the statute\u2019s specific authorization to file individual <em>or </em>joint forecasts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">3. <em>The council\u2019s authority to promulgate orders. </em>The council\u2019s enabling legislation states: \u201cThere is hereby established the Energy Facilities Siting Council which shall be responsible for implementing the energy policies contained in sections sixty-nine H to sixty-nine R, inclusive, to provide a necessary energy supply for the commonwealth with a minimum impact on the environment at the lowest possible cost.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69H.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 691, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201cEvery electric company shall, either individually or jointly with others, file with the council a long-range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>forecast with respect to the electric power needs and requirements of its market area ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5B\">\u201cSaid forecasts shall include, in such <em>form </em>and <em>detail </em>as the council shall <em>prescribe, </em>the following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9B\">\u201c(1) A description of all then existing agreements with other electric or gas companies for joint planning or joint forecasting ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A58\">\u201c(2) A forecast of the electric power needs or gas requirements for its market area ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFH\">\u201c(3) A description of actions planned to be taken by the company which will affect capacity to meet such needs or requirements . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3g\">General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 69J, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiBG\">\u201cIf the council determines the standards set forth above have not been met, it shall within twelve months of the date of filing reject in whole or in part the long-range forecast setting forth in writing its reasons for such rejections, or approve the long-range forecast subject to stated conditions. In the event of rejection or conditioned approval, the applicant or individual company may within six months submit an amended forecast. A public hearing on the amended forecast shall be held on the same terms and conditions applicable to the original forecast.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnVh\">MMWEC contends that the council\u2019s sole function is as a reviewing agency, without the authority to issue orders.</p>\n<p id=\"A9T\">The council claims that it has express power to order electrie companies participating in a joint filing to file individual forecasts because the council can \u201cprescribe\u201d the \u201cform\u201d and \u201cdetail\u201d of the forecasts. The council also argues that its regulations<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> allow the council to require whatever information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>it needs to review a long-range forecast. Additionally, because MMWEC cannot force its members to accept its supply plan, the council contends that MMWEC\u2019s forecast does not reflect \u201cactions planned to be taken by the company.\u201d See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 691, second par. (3). Finally, the council argues that MMWEC members would evade review if they are not required to file individual forecasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u201cAn agency\u2019s powers are shaped by its organic statute taken as a whole and need not necessarily be traced to specific words.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, </em>373 Mass. 345, 354 (1977). \u201cPowers granted include those necessarily or reasonably implied.\u201d <em>Grocery Mfrs. of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 75 (1979). \u201cSpecific statutory authority to act in a particular respect does not bar consistent action under general statutory authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76. However, an administrative agency has no authority to promulgate rules or regulations that conflict with the statutes or exceed the authority conferred by the statutes by which the agency was created. <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, </em>395 Mass. 238, 241 (1985). <em>Bureau of Old Age Assistance of Natick </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>326 Mass. 121, 124 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The language of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 691, permitting the council to prescribe the form and detail of the information included in a forecast does not suggest to us that the council has authority to issue orders. Rather, the section empowers the council to issue guidelines specifying the manner and arrangement of the information (form) and specifying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>small or secondary parts of information (detail) that go to make up the whole. The substance or whole of the information is stated in \u00a7 691 itself which requires a description of agreements, a forecast of needs, and a description of actions planned. There is no provision granting the council power to issue orders. Cf. G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 9 (1990 ed.) (expressly grants Commissioner of Department of Environmental Protection power to issue orders); G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 4A (1990 ed.) (clearly shows Department of Public Safety can issue orders); G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5 (clearly indicates Department of Public Utilities can issue orders). Nor is there such power implied by the statute which enables the council merely to review and to approve or to reject the forecasts. See <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Comm\u2019n, </em>409 Mass. 813, 818 (1991); <em>Grocery Mfrs. of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The council, however, is not required merely to perform a passive review of whatever forecasts are submitted to it. The council can reject in whole or in part or conditionally approve a forecast. G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69J. Although the council cannot order MMWEC to act in a specific way, it can condition its approval on the receipt of additional information or inform MMWEC that it will not approve future filings unless furnished specific information. Assuming that the council\u2019s requests of this nature are not arbitrary or beyond the scope of the council\u2019s mandate, MMWEC would then be required to submit to the request or have its forecasts disapproved. Without council approval MMWEC cannot commence construction of any new facility to meet the electrical needs of its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">There is nothing in the rule-making power of \u00a7 69H to the contrary. That section gives the council the express authority \u201c[t]o adopt and publish rules and regulations <em>consistent with the purposes </em>of sections sixty-nine H to section sixty-nine Q\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69H, fifth par. (2). As we have said, the stated purpose of these sections, \u00a7\u00a7 69H-69Q, is to permit the council to review the companies\u2019 forecasts and to approve or to reject them.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The council\u2019s own regulations recognize this distinction: \u201cThe Council may in its discretion require at any time <em>during an adjudicatory hearing </em>. . . that a company or other party produce such additional information, data or evidence as the council <em>needs to render a </em>decision\u201d (emphasis added). 980 Code. Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.02 (8) (a). This regulation does not purport to authorize the council to require the submission of any additional information beyond the scope of the adjudicatory hearing in progress. We therefore conclude that the council could not issue prospective orders and we strike the fifteen orders as invalid. In reaching this conclusion, we do not determine that, if the orders in question here were issued in the context of an adjudicatory hearing, their issuance would be within the \u201cincidental authority required for the full and efficient exercise of the power conferred.\u201d <em>Scannell </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Comm\u2019n, </em>324 Mass. 494, 501 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The council\u2019s final argument is that, because MMWEC cannot compel its members to implement its joint supply plan, MMWEC\u2019s forecast does not reflect \u201cactions planned to be taken by the company.\u201d Therefore, the individual member systems would not be fulfilling all statutory obligations and would thereby evade review if they are not required to file individual forecasts. We find this reasoning unpersuasive for several reasons. First, the council cannot compel <em>any </em>electric company, let alone an MMWEC member, to implement a supply plan or to construct a municipal electric power facility, even if the company files an individual forecast and the council approves it. Second, no electric company can implement a supply plan or build an electric power facility without the council having first approved a forecast that proposes the supply plan or new facility. Third, the council\u2019s function is to review forecasts to determine the need, environmental impact, and cost of supply plans and proposed facilities. Finally, as already discussed, MMWEC members are authorized under \u00a7 691 to file joint forecasts. They therefore comply with the law and do not evade review. The council\u2019s inability to issue orders does not contravene or frustrate its legislative mandate of implementing the energy policies of the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>monwealth. The over-all purpose of the legislation is to establish the council as a reviewing agency to implement the State\u2019s energy policies. The council\u2019s reviewing power is espedaily significant concerning the approval of supply plans that contain proposals for new electric power facilities. Nonetheless, we do \u201cnot read into a general statement of legislative purpose [in \u00a7 69H] any grant of authority outside that clearly and specifically given by the statute.\u201d <em>Daley Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Randolph, </em>340 Mass. 149, 155 (1959). The council can accomplish its statutory purpose and discharge its official duty without the power to issue orders, a power we have determined that the council does not possess.</p>\n<p id=\"AK5\">4. <em>The council\u2019s decision regarding MMWEC\u2019s supply plan. </em>The council rejected MMWEC\u2019s 1988 long-range forecast in part, finding that the supply plan segment did not meet the requirements of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69H and 69 J. The supply plan segment of a forecast is a projection of the actions which a company plans to take in order to meet future electric power needs. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 691, second par. (3); 980 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.04 (1). A company\u2019s supply plan must meet two standards: adequacy<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and cost.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In its final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>decision, the council found that MMWEC\u2019s supply plan met the adequacy standard but did not meet the cost standard. The council attributed this failure to shortcomings in MMWEC\u2019s resource identification and resource evaluation processes. Specifically, the council found the following: (1) although MMWEC identified an array of generating and nongenerating resource options, MMWEC did not demonstrate that it applied noncost criteria to screen the generating resource options; and (2) that MMWEC did not evaluate the conservation and load management resource (C&amp;LM) options on an \u201cequal footing\u201d with power generation resource options.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">MMWEC contends that the council\u2019s decision to reject the supply plan is not supported by substantial evidence, is arbitrary or capricious, and is based on an error of law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> MMWEC also argues that the council applied a new standard of review in evaluating its supply plan and that the council departed from its approach in other cases.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>We may set aside the council\u2019s decision if it is not supported by substantial evidence. See <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>395 Mass. 836, 849 (1985). \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence\u2019 means such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6) (1990 ed.). In reviewing the record, we give \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge\u201d of the council. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). We also \u201cdefer to [the council\u2019s] fact-finding role, including its right to draw reasonable inferences from the facts found.\u201d <em>Smith College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>376 Mass. 221, 224 (1978). Here the burden is on MMWEC to show that the council\u2019s decision is invalid. G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5 (1990 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">MMWEC relied on the testimony of its manager of regulatory services and economic analysis (manager) to describe MMWEC\u2019s application of the noncost screening criteria to the generating resource options. The manager stated that \u201cyou go through somewhat of a screening process.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>manager\u2019s testimony was the only evidence MMWEC offered on this issue. His testimony was general and not supported by any specific information. On review, we believe that a reasonable mind would perceive this evidence as supporting the council\u2019s finding that MMWEC had not demonstrated that the noncost screening, criteria had been applied to the generating resource options. Furthermore, we do not view the council\u2019s rejection of MMWEC\u2019s supply plan based on this finding as holding MMWEC to a \u201crigid supertechnical standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">MMWEC also argues that the council abandoned its \u201cequal footing\u201d standard by reviewing MMWEC\u2019s resource evaluation process in terms of cost, risk, and diversity. Three objectives of MMWEC\u2019s supply plan were cost minimization, risk minimization, and diversity. The council used these objectives as the framework for reviewing MMWEC\u2019s resource evaluation process. The record shows MMWEC rejected certain C&amp;LM options as too costly while recommending generating options with similar cost characteristics. We therefore conclude that the council correctly determined that MMWEC did not treat C&amp;LM options on equal footing with generating options.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">MMWEC\u2019s final argument is that the council abused its discretion in finding that MMWEC did not give adequate consideration to C&amp;LM. MMWEC and its consultant, Synergic Resources Corporation (SRC), developed the C&amp;LM options by producing a demand side capacity assessment (DSCA). MMWEC presented the council with much evidence regarding its C&amp;LM options. For example, SRC stated that, although the cost analysis of C&amp;LM options was based on a single set of avoided costs, the economics of the C&amp;LM options were sensitive to costs. SRC therefore recommended that MMWEC evaluate C&amp;LM options with more than one set of avoided costs. The manager stated that MMWEC intends to evaluate C&amp;LM options with more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>than one set of avoided costs \u201csoon.\u201d The council concluded that MMWEC unduly limited the scope of its resource evaluation and questioned whether additional cost-effective C&amp;LM options were excluded. In addition, the DSCA was restricted to an evaluation of twenty C&amp;LM options. SRC indicated that some of the excluded C&amp;LM options may have represented significant C&amp;LM potential for MMWEC and its members. Based on this limited evidence, we determine that the council did not abuse its discretion in finding that MMWEC did not properly consider C&amp;LM options.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that the council has no authority under G.

We also conclude that the council\u2019s rejection of MMWEC\u2019s supply plan is supported by substantial evidence.

Allowing the members of MMWEC to file a joint forecast is consistent with MMWEC\u2019s function of conducting joint action and planning, and saves the individual members the extra expense of preparing and adjudicating separate reports, which become statistically less accurate when focused on smaller market areas. Requiring individual members to file individual long-range forecasts conflicts with this joint action and planning purpose, and deprives the members of the very benefits that membership in MMWEC affords.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\"> MMWEC\u2019s enabling legislation states that G.

Adequacy can be established for the short run or for the long run. To establish adequacy in the short run, a company must demonstrate that it has identified a secure and reliable set of energy supplies. If a company cannot establish it has adequate energy supplies in the short run, then it must propose an \u201caction plan\u201d which demonstrates the company has access to alternative supplies in the event of certain contingencies. To establish adequacy in the long run, a company must demonstrate that its planning processes identify and fully evaluate a reasonable range of resource options on a continuing basis that allows a company sufficient time to make appropriate supply decisions to ensure adequate, cost-effective energy and power resources over all forecast years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"AkE\"> In reviewing the cost of a supply plan, the council determines whether the plan minimizes the cost of power (he., ensures a least-cost supply) subject to trade-offs with adequacy, diversity, and the environmental impacts of construction and operation of facilities. To establish a least-cost supply, the company identifies resource (supply) options and evaluates the resource options. The company does this by compiling a comprehensive array <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>of generating and nongenerating (conservation and load management programs [C&amp;LM]) resource options and developing and applying appropriate cost and noncost criteria for screening those options. The company must evaluate the resource options on an \u201cequal footing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\"> The council considers both electric power generation facilities and C&amp;LMs as resources to be used in supply planning. G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69J. Electric power needs are met from the \u201csupply side\u201d (by use of electric power generation facilities) or from the \u201cdemand side\u201d (by a reduction of power demand through conservation and load management programs).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\"> MMWEC in its reply brief for the first time argues that adequacy and cost factors are not within the council\u2019s purview. MMWEC attempts to explain the council\u2019s mandate in \u00a7 69H \u201cto provide a necessary energy supply for the commonwealth with a minimum impact on the environment at the lowest possible cost.\u201d MMWEC claims that this language does not require the council to consider the cost of electricity. Rather, MMWEC contends it charges the council with minimizing the cost of environmental controls by ensuring those controls are at the lowest possible cost. Since MMWEC never raised this issue with the council, we decline to consider it. We only note that inasmuch as the cost of environmental protection and enhancement increases the cost of electricity, any reduction in cost associated with those features would reduce the cost of electricity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b216-9\"> MMWEC claims that the council\u2019s finding that MMWEC\u2019s electricity price forecast methodology is inappropriate is not supported by substantial evidence. Since this finding was based on an assumption that members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>would increase the prices they charge consumers in \u201clock step with resource additions,\u201d MMWEC argues that the council\u2019s assumption is not supported by substantial evidence. The council, however, approved the demand forecast portion of MMWEC\u2019s long-range forecast. The electricity price forecast is part of the demand forecast. The situation before us is not one in which the council has rejected the demand forecast based on its assumption. Because we see no harm caused by the council\u2019s assumption or finding, we need not consider this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\"> When the manager was asked to describe how MMWEC systemically applied its screening criteria to municipally owned generation projects, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">\u201cWell, we could talk about identification as just saying, okay, here\u2019s a resource that could in fact be done. There\u2019s a much broader issue. There are a variety of sources that are available. Industry literature is full of what different options are. You look at those generation options. It\u2019s a fairly large set; but in some ways it\u2019s much smaller, as you go through somewhat of a screening process. Some of them are not viable in some aspects, financing by MMWEC, because of the high risks that might be involved in a particular type of technology; or the size, that makes it workable. The ones that were identified here as a generation option in response to that question are those options that were utilized in the development of the base generation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>expansion plan; and they were somewhat a result of a screening, if you will, of a larger array of resource options that were identified.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
