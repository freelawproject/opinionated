L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A (1990 ed.), and one count of wilful and malicious destruction of personal property, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127 (1990 ed.). Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant claims error in the denial of his motion for a required finding of not guilty on the wilful and malicious destruction charge, and in the judge\u2019s questioning of him at trial. The defendant also raises certain procedural claims concerning the disposition of his case under the experimental one-trial system for District Court criminal cases now in effect in Essex and Hampden Counties. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We conclude that the defendant was entitled to the allowance of his motion for a required finding of not guilty on the wilful and malicious destruction charge and, consequently, reverse that judgment. We find no other basis of error and affirm the judgments on the assault and battery charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">1. At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel moved pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (a), 378 Mass. 896 (1979), for required findings of not guilty on the wilful and malicious destruction charge and on a charge of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. The judge denied the motion as to the wilful and malicious destruction charge, and the defendant now argues that it was error to do so. (The judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on the charge of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The evidence in the Commonwealth\u2019s case was as follows. At about 1:45 a.m. on June 24, 1989, the victims, David Rehe and Francis Bradley, were riding together at Salisbury Beach in Salisbury, in Rehe\u2019s Mazda automobile. On North End Boulevard, a Camaro automobile carrying four men<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pulled along the driver\u2019s side of Rehe\u2019s car, and its front seat passenger began to swear at Rehe. Rehe slowed down to let <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the Camaro pass and saw a beer can fly out of the Camaro and bounce across his windshield. Rehe passed the Camaro, and in turn the Camaro passed him, then stopped, forcing him to stop. Rehe yelled to the Camaro\u2019s driver to move, then froze when both doors of the Camaro opened and its four occupants ran back to his car, two coming to each side of the Mazda.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The driver and the defendant came to Rehe\u2019s door and began to punch him through the open window. They pulled Rehe from his car and struck him in the ribs, back, and face. Rehe\u2019s passenger, Francis Bradley, saw Tourvelle go around the car, lean into Rehe\u2019s car from the driver\u2019s side, and try to pull the keys from the ignition. Bradley tried to pull Tourvelle\u2019s hands away from the steering column, but was dragged out of the passenger side of Rehe\u2019s car. Bradley saw that, during the scuffle, Tourvelle had pulled a control arm from the steering column.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Bradley fought with Duchamel until the defendant came to the passenger side of the Mazda. The defendant punched Bradley in the face. When Bradley tried to retreat inside Rehe\u2019s car, Tourvelle (who was now on the passenger side of the Mazda) slammed the passenger door on Bradley\u2019s leg repeatedly and kicked Bradley in the face. At this point, the defendant, and the others from the Camaro, returned to their car and left Rehe and Bradley beaten and injured. The State trooper who responded to the scene confirmed that Rehe\u2019s keys had been taken, observed that a control arm on the steering column had been broken off, noted that the passenger door was bent, and spotted footprints across the hood of Rehe\u2019s car. Neither victim saw the defendant do any damage to the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">On review of the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding, we determine \u201cwhether the evidence offered by the Commonwealth, together with reasonable inferences therefrom, when viewed in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to persuade a rational jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of every element of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>378 Mass. 680, 686 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>(1979). \u201c[I]t is not enough for the appellate court to find that there was some record evidence, however slight, to support each essential element of the offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979). Nor may a conviction rest upon the piling of inference upon inference or conjecture and speculation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>384 Mass. 13, 18 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The Commonwealth proceeded on the theory that the defendant had participated with three others, Barry Longshaw, Craig Tourvelle, and Mark Duchamel, in committing all the crimes. To establish the defendant\u2019s guilt on the wilful and malicious destruction charge, the Commonwealth had to prove that the defendant, in addition to participation in the venture, had or shared the requisite mental state for that crime. Wilful and malicious destruction of property (G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127) is a specific intent crime. Wilfulness requires a showing that the defendant intended both the conduct and its harmful consequences, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schuchardt, </em>408 Mass. 347, 352 (1990); wilful conduct is \u201cintentional and by design in contrast to that which is thoughtless or accidental.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 443 (1983), quoting J.R. Nolan, Criminal Law \u00a7 427, at 259 (1976). Malice requires a showing that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cmotivated by \u2018cruelty, hostility or revenge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schuchardt, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, supra. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence must be sufficient to persuade the fact finder beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of both elements before a conviction of wilful and malicious destruction can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The evidence indicated that the damage to the control arm and the passenger side door of Rehe\u2019s Mazda was done by Tourvelle as he tried to remove the keys from the Mazda and later attempted to prevent Bradley from sheltering himself in the car. The defendant was not seen participating in the acts that caused this damage. The defendant\u2019s principal goal in the venture appears from the evidence to have been to assist his three companions in getting both victims out of the car so they could be beaten, and to beat them. It is speculative on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the evidence whether the defendant knew what Tourvelle was going to do before Tourvelle actually did it, and, as a result, equally speculative whether he shared any malicious intent that Tourvelle may have had. There was, to be sure, among the members of the defendant\u2019s group an intent to attack the two victims and, if need be, to remove the victims forcibly from the car in order to effect the assaults. But, as has been indicated, the charge of wilful and malicious destruction requires proof of specific intent in terms of both wilful and malicious action. We do not think that the evidence pertaining to the defendant satisfactorily demonstrated both elements. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence tended more to show the defendant\u2019s participation in wanton destruction of property under the part of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127, that punishes that type of conduct. Wanton destruction differs substantially from wilful and malicious destruction in that wanton destruction requires only a showing that the actor\u2019s conduct was indifferent to, or in disregard of, probable consequences. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schuchardt, supra </em>at 351. This offense, however, was not charged. The defendant is entitled to a required finding of not guilty on the charge of wilful and malicious destruction of personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">2. The defendant testified at trial. At the conclusion of his testimony, the judge questioned the defendant about his role in the incident. The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s questioning of him was prejudicial. No objection to the questioning was made by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel. We reject the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The judge\u2019s examination of the defendant in this case was an attempt by the judge to clarify some details of the altercation. Our review of the questioning shows it to be neither unduly extensive nor prejudicial. In view of the failure of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel to object to the judge\u2019s questioning, or to conduct any further examination of the defendant when the judge had finished, and the failure of the defendant\u2019s appellate counsel to point out in any concrete way how the questioning might have harmed the defendant, we discern no infringement on the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>3. The defendant\u2019s remaining claims concern the disposition of his case under the provisions of St. 1986, c. 537, \u201cAn Act establishing a one trial system for criminal cases in Essex and Hampden Counties,\u201d and the special and the supplemental District Court rules of criminal procedure that implement this system.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">(a) The defendant\u2019s first issue concerns the propriety of his jury waiver. The defendant was arraigned on September 12, 1989, on four charges: assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, two counts of assault and battery, and wilful and malicious destruction of property. Pretrial conferences were held on October 4, 1989, and November 20, 1989. On December 13, 1989, the defendant filed a written waiver of his right to trial by jury on a prepared District Court form which stated that it was \u201c[f]or use in cases governed by the one-trial procedure. St. 1986, c. 537.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant was represented by counsel when he executed the waiver. The case was then scheduled for trial without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">On January 22, 1990, the day of trial, the defendant and the prosecutor agreed upon a joint recommendation for disposition and sentence by which the defendant would plead guilty to two assault and battery counts and would make restitution in the amount of $218. In exchange, he would receive suspended sentences for the two assault and battery convictions and the other charges would be dismissed. After reviewing the police report of the incident and the defendant\u2019s criminal record, the judge stated that he would not ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>cept the joint recommendation, and he indicated that the trial would take place immediately. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel neither moved to revoke the defendant\u2019s jury waiver nor objected to the case going to immediate trial. The trial proceeded before the same judge, where, as has been noted above, the defendant was found guilty of two counts of assault and battery and the count of wilful and malicious destruction of property. The judge imposed sentences of six months in a house of correction on each conviction, the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The defendant filed a posttrial motion to \u201crevoke filing of jury waiver and request trial by jury\u201d dated January 29, 1990. On February 6, 1990, he filed a notice of appeal from the judgments of conviction and a motion to stay execution. At a hearing on the motions held on February 12, 1990, the judge allowed the motion to stay execution, but he denied the motion to revoke the jury waiver.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The defendant now argues that, at the time the judge refused to accept the agreed disposition and sentence recommendation, he was required to afford the defendant an opportunity to revoke his jury waiver. In support of his argument, the defendant refers to Rule 3 (d) of the Special Rules of Criminal Procedure for District Court Criminal Cases in Essex and Hampden Counties (1991) (Special Rules), which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[i]f a defendant withdraws a plea of guilty . . . the case may be advanced for defendant\u2019s determination on whether to waive jury trial.\u201d The judge, according to the defendant, erred in not extending this option at the time of trial, and also in denying the defendant\u2019s posttrial motion to revoke his waiver. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Unlike the procedure in other District Courts, where a defendant may receive both a bench trial and a de novo trial in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>a jury session, in the District Courts in Essex and Hampden Counties, a defendant receives one trial, which \u201cshall be by a jury of six, unless the defendant files a written waiver and consent to be tried by the court without a jury.\u201d St. 1986, c. 537, \u00a7 8. Under the statute regulating this one-trial-system, a defendant has a right to delay the decision on a jury waiver.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 8 of c. 537 provides that no decision on waiver of a jury may be required until completion of the pretrial conference and compliance with any discovery motions. Section 11 provides that the defendant may, as of right, waive a jury trial at any time before the case is transferred for jury trial, and may still waive a jury trial, with consent of the court, so long as a jury have not . yet been empanelled. See Special Rule 7 (1991). In addition to these statutory rights, Supplemental Rule 10 (b) allows a defendant to delay the decision on waiver until \u201cafter completion of the guilty plea or admission procedure, if any, and withdrawal of the plea or admission, if any.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The upshot of the provisions set forth above is that a defendant in a District Court in Essex and Hampden Counties who is engaging in discussions about a disposition of the case short of trial may choose to defer his decision to waive a jury trial until such time as a judge refuses to accept any agreed on recommendation for disposition. There is nothing, however, either in the statute or the implementing rules, which prevents a defendant from choosing prior to the time of a judge\u2019s action on a proposed disposition to waive his right to a jury trial so long as his waiver is otherwise knowing and voluntary. There is also no requirement in Special Rule 3 (d) that the judge who refuses to accept an agreed-upon recommendation for disposition must afford a defendant who has already waived a jury trial the opportunity to in effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201cwaive\u201d the waiver.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As has been indicated, there is nothing in this record to show that the defendant\u2019s jury waiver was substantively invalid. Had the defendant wished to retain his right to a jury trial, he only had to decline to waive that right until he was compelled to make a choice after the judge\u2019s rejection of the proposed disposition. While we expect most cases involving agreed-upon dispositions under the Essex and Hampden Counties procedures will proceed without an early waiver, and more precisely in accord with the provisions of the statute and rules stated above, there is no reason to set aside the waiver in this case. It follows from what has been said that the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s posttrial motion to revoke his jury waiver has also not been shown to involve error.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">(b) The defendant maintains that he was denied a fair trial because, prior to trial, in connection with the judge\u2019s rejection of the agreed-upon recommendation as to disposition, the judge had read the police report of the incident and looked at the defendant\u2019s criminal record. The defendant argues that the judge was required to recuse himself sua sponte. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Neither the police report nor the defendant\u2019s criminal record has been made a part of the record on appeal. There is, therefore, no basis to evaluate the defendant\u2019s claim that he was prejudiced by reason of the judge\u2019s receiving extraneous information outside of the evidence at trial. Further, there was no objection by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel to the judge\u2019s hearing the case, and the defendant did not avail himself of the option afforded to a defendant by St. 1986, c. 537, \u00a7 8, to be tried before a judge who had not considered and rejected the plea agreement. As a consequence, no rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>son for recusal has been demonstrated. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 273-274 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coyne, </em>372 Mass. 599, 601-604 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The judgment on the defendant\u2019s conviction of wilful and malicious destruction of personal property is reversed and the finding is set aside. On that charge judgment is to enter for the defendant. The judgments on the defendant\u2019s convictions of assault and battery are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\"> The Camaro was driven by Barry Longshaw, and the defendant was in the rear passenger seat behind Longshaw. Two other young men (Craig Tourvelle and Mark Duchamel) were also in the Camaro.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\"> The waiver stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">\u201cI, the above-named defendant, have been given notice of my right to have a jury trial. I understand this notice. I hereby waive my right to a jury trial on the complaint specified above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">The record does not indicate that, in connection with acceptance of the waiver, there was compliance with Rule 10 of the District Court Department Supplemental Rules of Criminal Procedure (1991) (Supplemental Rules) pertaining to the receipt of assurances that the waiver was voluntarily and knowingly made (special procedures for criminal cases in Essex and Hampden Counties). The defendant, however, makes no contention that his jury waiver was uninformed or involuntary.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\"> The judge appears to have treated his order denying the motion to revoke as encompassing an objection by the defendant to the order and a claim of appeal. We assume that the issue of the propriety of the denial of motion is properly before us notwithstanding the lack of a clear notice of appeal by the defendant from its denial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\"> In contrast, under the de novo system, a defendant must decide at arraignment whether to seek a jury trial in the first instance, unless the judge allows further time. If the defendant does not seek a first instance jury trial, the defendant receives a trial before a judge, and if not satisfied with the results of that trial, the right to appeal and obtain a new trial before a jury. See Supplemental Rule 2 (A) (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\"> The defendant also argues that the judge violated Special Rule 3 (c) (6) (1991), which requires a judge, upon a determination that he will impose a sentence that will exceed an agreed recommendation, to afford the defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea or admission. The defendant did not explicitly withdraw his offer to plead, but, in the absence of an objection from the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, the judge\u2019s action in setting the case for immediate trial had the effect of withdrawing the plea offer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
