The court violated appellant\u2019s right to a public trial by (a) closing the courtroom, both to the general public and to appellant\u2019s wife and children, based upon the undercover officer\u2019s generalized area of operation and generalized concern for his safety and (b) failing to consider reasonable alternatives to the courtroom closure. <em>(Waller v Georgia, </em>467 US 39; <em>Press-Enterprise Co. v Superior Ct., </em>478 US 1; <em>People v Martinez, </em>82 NY2d 436; <em>People v Kin Kan, </em>78 NY2d 54; <em>People v Jelke, </em>308 NY 56; <em>People v Hinton, </em>31 NY2d 71, 410 US 911; <em>Matter of Oliver v Postel, </em>30 NY2d 171; <em>People v Jones, </em>47 NY2d 409; <em>Vidal v Williams, </em>31 F3d 67; <em>People v Alvarado, </em>223 AD2d 712.) II. Appellant\u2019s exclusion from a side-bar colloquy during jury selection, where the court questioned a potential juror about her familiarity with the crime scene, violated his right to be present at a material stage of the trial. <em>(People v Sloan, </em>79 NY2d 386; <em>People v Antommarchi, 80 </em>NY2d 247; <em>People v Mitchell, 80 </em>NY2d 519; <em>People v Maher, </em>89 NY2d 318; <em>People v Feliciano, </em>88 NY2d 18; <em>People v Vargas, </em>88 NY2d 363; <em>People v Morris, </em>217 AD2d 561; <em>People v Foster, </em>217 AD2d 558; <em>People v Sprowal, </em>84 NY2d 113.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-8\"><em>Robert M.

The trial court properly closed the courtroom to the general public, including defendant\u2019s family, during the testimony of an undercover detective, who was then actively engaged in undercover operations in the same location as defendant\u2019s arrest and near where defendant\u2019s family resided. That is true, under this Court\u2019s settled precedent, even though the trial court did not, <em>sua sponte, </em>expressly consider the alternatives to closure which defendant proposes for the first time before this Court. <em>(People v Martinez, </em>82 NY2d 436; <em>Ayala v Speckard, </em>102 F3d 649; <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 US 257; <em>People v Hinton, </em>31 NY2d 71, 410 US 911; <em>People v Jelke, </em>308 NY 56; <em>People v Kin Kan, </em>78 NY2d 54; <em>People v Jones, </em>47 NY2d 409, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>444 US 946; <em>Waller v Georgia, </em>467 US 39; <em>Press-Enterprise Co. v Superior Ct. of Cal., </em>464 US 501; <em>People v Richards, </em>77 NY2d 969.) II. Defendant\u2019s absence from a side-bar conference with one prospective juror provides no basis for a reversal of his conviction since jury selection in this case occurred before this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Antommarchi </em>(80 NY2d 247 [1992]) and the prospective juror was, in any event, excused for cause. <em>(People v Sloan, </em>79 NY2d 386; <em>People v Ward, </em>227 AD2d 508, 88 NY2d 970; <em>People v Mitchell, </em>80 NY2d 519; <em>People v Pepper, </em>53 NY2d 213; <em>People v Camacho, </em>209 AD2d 166, 84 NY2d 1029; <em>People v Lawrence, </em>209 AD2d 165, 84 NY2d 1034; <em>People v Sprowal, </em>84 NY2d 113; <em>People v Morales, </em>80 NY2d 450; <em>People v Roman, </em>88 NY2d 18.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b502-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b502-6\">Chief Judge Kaye.</author>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In an appeal centering on the issue of courtroom closure during an undercover officer\u2019s testimony in a \"buy-and-bust\u201d case, we conclude that the record was insufficient to establish a substantial probability that the officer\u2019s safety would be jeopardized by allowing defendant\u2019s wife and children to remain in the courtroom. Their exclusion therefore violated defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial, requiring reversal of the Appellate Division\u2019s order and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Defendant was arrested for allegedly selling two glassine envelopes of heroin to an undercover officer for $26 at 166th Street between Amsterdam and Edgecomb Avenues in Manhattan. Over objection, the prosecutor moved to close the courtroom during the testimony of the undercover officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">The officer testified at the ensuing <em>Hinton </em>hearing <em>(People v Hinton, </em>31 NY2d 71, <em>cert denied </em>410 US 911) that he presently conducted undercover buy-and-bust operations three to four times a week in the Manhattan area between 155th to 180th Streets, specifically in the location of 166th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, and that he feared for his safety should his identity be revealed. He related a story he had heard three years earlier about another undercover officer who was shot after being recognized in this neighborhood. The officer further testified that he did not work in the area of the courthouse and that he had never encountered former \"buy\u201d subjects while there to testify. He also used the regular courthouse elevator when testifying. The officer expressed no concern about defendant\u2019s family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">The court closed the courtroom during the undercover\u2019s testimony, specifically excluding defendant\u2019s wife and children. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>In response to the People\u2019s argument that defendant\u2019s wife posed a particular danger to the officer, the court noted that there was no indication that she was involved in any way with drugs or drug dealers and that \"it\u2019s somewhat of a large leap * * * that she would of course take note of this particular officer independently[ ] and spread it around the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The court nevertheless excluded defendant\u2019s wife, based on the prosecutor\u2019s earlier report that a court reporter claimed to have seen her speaking to a prospective juror during voir dire. Defense counsel had previously explained that the juror had already been excused, and that defendant\u2019s wife had merely responded to a request for the time. The court did not make any inquiry of defendant\u2019s wife, the juror or the court reporter. As for defendant\u2019s children, the trial court concluded that they should be excluded from the courtroom \"simply because they are children, and don\u2019t understand the concept of confidentiality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Defendant was convicted of criminal possession and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degrees, and the Appellate Division affirmed. In upholding the exclusion of defendant\u2019s family, the court noted that the site of defendant\u2019s arrest was 12 blocks from his residence, and because defendant\u2019s relatives resided in the very neighborhood where the officer worked undercover, it was proper to bar them from the courtroom. The court further concluded that defendant\u2019s wife had \"demonstrated both a lack of good judgment and a willingness to disobey judicial directives.\u201d (232 AD2d 305, 306.) We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">While a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial may give way to other rights or interests, the Supreme Court of the United States and this Court have repeatedly cautioned that trial courts should exercise their discretionary power to exclude members of the public sparingly and only after balancing the competing interests \"with special care\u201d <em>(Waller v Georgia, </em>467 US 39, 45; <em>People v Kin Kan, </em>78 NY2d 54, 57, <em>rearg denied 78 </em>NY2d 1008; <em>see also, People v Ramos, </em>90 NY2d 490 [decided today]). Before a courtroom may be closed, the party seeking closure must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the courtroom and it must make findings adequate to support the closure <em>(Waller v Georgia, </em>467 US at 48, <em>supra; People v Martinez, </em>82 NY2d 436, 442).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>In <em>People v Martinez </em>(82 NY2d at 444, <em>supra), </em>also a buy-and-bust case, we held that the trial court, before closing the courtroom, was not obligated to ask a defendant to identify any family members who would like to attend the trial <em>(see also, People v Ramos, </em>90 NY2d 490, <em>supra </em>[trial court not obligated <em>sua sponte </em>to suggest reasonable alternatives to closure]). We noted there, however, that \"[t]here had been no unidentified spectators in the courtroom from the time the trial started, and defendant made no mention of particular friends or family he wished to have in attendance\u201d <em>(People v Martinez, supra, </em>at 444). Where, by contrast, the trial court is aware that the defendant\u2019s relatives have been attending the proceedings or that the defendant would like to have certain family members present, exclusion of those individuals must be necessary to protect the interest advanced by the People in support of closure <em>(see, Vidal v Williams, </em>31 F3d 67, 69 [2d Cir 1994], <em>cert denied </em>513 US 1102; <em>People v Gutierez, </em>86 NY2d 817; <em>People v Kin Kan, </em>78 NY2d 54, supra; <em>see also, In re Oliver, </em>333 US 257, 271-272 [acknowledging a special concern for guaranteeing the attendance of the accused\u2019s family members]). Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s reasons for excluding the defendant\u2019s family must be \"demonstrated and documented\u201d in the record <em>(People v Kin Kan, </em>78 NY2d at 57).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In <em>People v Gutierez </em>(86 NY2d at 818, <em>supra), </em>for example, the undercover officer testified that he feared that his life and ongoing buy-and-bust investigations would be jeopardized by open-court testimony. This Court nevertheless held that it was error for the Trial Judge to exclude the defendant\u2019s family members from the courtroom during the officer\u2019s testimony, since he \"never claimed to hold those fears with respect to defendant\u2019s wife and children and did not otherwise advance any valid ground for excluding defendant\u2019s family\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Under the circumstances, the closure order was broader than necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">While the trial court may have been justified in excluding the general public from the courtroom during the officer\u2019s testimony <em>(see, People v Ramos, </em>90 NY2d 490, supra; <em>People v Martinez, </em>82 NY2d 436, <em>supra), </em>it was error to exclude defendant\u2019s family members. As in <em>Gutierez, </em>the undercover officer here expressed no trepidation about testifying before defendant\u2019s wife and children. Indeed, the officer never even mentioned defendant\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Nor does the record contain any other valid ground for their exclusion. The mere allegation that defendant\u2019s wife had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>brief conversation with a prospective juror certainly did not establish that she was inclined to harm a police officer. To the contrary, the trial court itself found no suggestion that defendant\u2019s wife was involved in the sale of drugs and, furthermore, that the likelihood that she would reveal the officer\u2019s true identity was remote. The trial court, moreover, made no attempt to determine the substance of the purported conversation or whether, as counsel claimed, the juror had already been excused. The record therefore does not support the Appellate Division\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s wife had demonstrated a willingness to disobey judicial directives.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Based on its own conclusory generalizations about the inability of children to maintain confidentiality, the trial court also excluded defendant\u2019s children from the courtroom. It did so, however, without adducing any facts as to the ability of the children to preserve the witness\u2019 identity. No inquiry was made of either the children or their parents. Indeed, the record does not even reveal whether they were toddlers or teenagers.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Because the record here was insufficient to establish a \"substantial probability\u201d that the officer\u2019s safety would be jeopardized by the presence of defendant\u2019s wife and children during his testimony <em>(see, Press-Enterprise Co. v Superior Ct., </em>478 US 1, 14; <em>People v Ramos, </em>90 NY2d 490, <em>supra), </em>the closure order was broader than necessary to protect the People\u2019s interest. We note in this regard that the area of defendant\u2019s residence was not discussed at the <em>Hinton </em>hearing and did not form any part of the trial court\u2019s decision to order closure. Therefore, the Appellate Division\u2019s reliance on the fact that defendant\u2019s family lived within 12 blocks of the officer\u2019s area of operations to justify exclusion retroactively was improper <em>(see, Waller v Georgia, </em>467 US at 48, <em>supra </em>[trial court must make factual findings adequate to support the closure]; <em>see also, People v Kin Kan, </em>78 NY2d at 59, <em>supra).</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Because reversal is mandated on this ground alone, we do not address defendant\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Judges Titone, Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-9\"> The Appellate Division also deemed defendant\u2019s claim as to the exclusion of his children, in particular, unpreserved for appellate review. After defendant objected to the People\u2019s application to close the courtroom, however, the trial court expressly considered allowing the children to remain present and specifically rejected that possibility. The court was thus unquestionably apprised of defendant\u2019s wish to have his children attend the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
