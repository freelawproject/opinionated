The trial court erred when it delegated to court officers its authority to screen prospective jurors who had <em>Antommarchi </em>concerns, and denied appellant his right to be present during, a material stage of the trial by questioning prospective jurors, in his absence, about their ability to be fair and impartial. <em>(People v Antommarchi, </em>80 NY2d 247; <em>People v Maher, </em>89 NY2d 318; <em>People v Velasco, </em>77 NY2d 469; <em>People v Ahmed, </em>66 NY2d 307; <em>People v Roman, </em>88 NY2d 18; <em>People v Morris, </em>217 AD2d 561; <em>People v Davis, </em>216 AD2d 314; <em>People v Mota, </em>211 AD2d 489; <em>People v Madera, </em>216 AD2d 89.)

The <em>Antommarchi </em>procedure employed by the trial court was consented to by defendant and his counsel, and in any event was entirely proper because it ensured that defendant was present for all of the substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>questioning of the prospective jurors. <em>(People v Antommarchi, </em>80 NY2d 247; <em>People v Ciaccio, </em>47 NY2d 431; <em>People v Bartlett, </em>160 AD2d 245; <em>People v Lester, </em>174 AD2d 507; <em>People v Van, </em>161 AD2d 326; <em>People v Sloan, </em>79 NY2d 386; <em>People v Velasco, </em>77 NY2d 469; <em>People v West, </em>210 AD2d 147; <em>People v Kirkland, </em>199 AD2d 54; <em>People v Starks, </em>88 NY2d 18.)

The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed, finding defendant\u2019s tendered claims relating to the protocols used in the jury selection process unpreserved or, in any event, unpersuasive on the merits (230 AD2d 604). A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal. We agree essentially with the Appellate Division\u2019s assessment and disposition of this case and its issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Defendant\u2019s unpreserved contentions regarding the trial court\u2019s actions as to (1) an unobjected-to large number of seated prospective jurors <em>(see, </em>CPL 270.15) and (2) a claimed delegation of responsibility to nonjudicial court personnel merit no consideration on the state of this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">As to defendant\u2019s assertion on appeal of a violation under <em>People v Antommarchi </em>(80 NY2d 247), we rely essentially on the particulars reflected in this record. This Court has held that trial courts may not \"explore prospective jurors\u2019 backgrounds and their ability to weigh the evidence objectively unless defendant is present\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 250). Defendant has the burden of establishing the right to be present <em>(see, People v Maher, </em>89 NY2d 318, 325; <em>see also, People v Mitchell, </em>80 NY2d 519, 524-525). We conclude that defendant failed to meet his threshold obligation. Notably, the People do not contest any of the standard protocols and protections that continue to surround <em>Antommarchi </em>compliance <em>(see, People v Feliciano, </em>88 NY2d 18; <em>see also, People v Maher, </em>89 NY2d 318, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>In conforming to the <em>Antommarchi </em>rubrics, the trial court unequivocally declared at the beginning of the jury selection process that defendant had the right to be present at the questioning of prospective jurors regarding their abilities to be fair. The court further thoroughly explained directly to defendant that he could waive this right. In the event that defendant declined to waive his <em>Antommarchi </em>rights, the court alternatively proposed to utilize a preliminary screening process. Defendant refused to waive the personal presence right. Defendant\u2019s counsel also responded, in open court and in the presence of defendant, by affirmatively stipulating, \"Your Honor, at this time we will adopt the [preliminary screening] procedure that you have indicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Based on the stipulated proposal, the trial court initially screened prospective jurors at the Bench, in the presence of both counsel. Some jurors were excused, but those who expressed some doubts concerning, or reason to question, their impartiality, were retained on an <em>\"Antommarchi </em>list.\u201d That list was then used for individual, recorded questioning of such potential jurors in Chambers, <em>in the presence of defendant, </em>by his counsel and the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">On a fair and contextual appraisal of this record as it unfolded at nisi prius, the procedure announced, \"adopted\u201d and actually employed cannot be said as a matter of law to have violated the <em>Antommarchi </em>protocols. To the extent that the discussion at the Bench concerned some personal disqualification or disability of the juror, the defendant had no <em>Antommarchi </em>right to be present <em>(see, People v Vargas, </em>88 NY2d 363, 375; <em>People v Roman, </em>88 NY2d 18, 27; <em>People v Velasco, </em>77 NY2d 469, 473). The absence of the defendant from a discussion at the Bench with the attorneys and a juror concerning whether that juror was subject to being excused for cause, at which the juror was ultimately excused on that basis, also does not per se violate <em>Antommarchi (see, People v Maher, </em>89 NY2d 318, 325, <em>supra; People v Roman, supra, </em>88 NY2d, at 28).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">These conclusions are practically and theoretically sound. The fact that the defense counsel was present at the implementing Bench conferences adds a reference-context feature to the distinctive stipulation nature of this case. Notably in that regard, in two instances defendant\u2019s attorney noted that jurors were improperly excused for reasons that required defendant\u2019s presence, whereupon the court corrected the apparent misunderstanding by recalling the two jurors for an <em>Antommarchi </em>Chambers inquiry <em>in the presence of the defendant. </em>Given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>formal adoption of a stipulated procedure that facially complies with <em>Antommarchi </em>and the particularized and adjusted implementations in accordance with the understanding of the court and both counsel, the record fails to establish that any other jurors were excused at the Bench screening stage for reasons or under circumstances that required defendant\u2019s presence on some new per se basis <em>(see, People v Maher, </em>89 NY2d 318, <em>supra). </em>This is precisely the inference made by the Appellate Division in finding that, under the trial court\u2019s preliminary screening format, \"defendant did not have the right to be present at the initial screening\u201d (230 AD2d 604, 605, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In essence, therefore, the defendant has not provided a record basis under these circumstances for any asserted <em>Antommarchi </em>violation <em>(see, People v Maher, supra, </em>89 NY2d, at 325; <em>People v Kinchen, </em>60 NY2d 772). That feature demonstrates the insufficient ground in this particular set of circumstances and developments that would warrant this defendant acquiring an appellate edge on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Defendant persists on his appeals to the Appellate Division and before this Court, nevertheless, that the trial court may have partially tripped up in its implementation of the plan to prescreen prospective jurors to determine whether any of them required particularized examination regarding bias or hostility. Defendant claims, with surgical splicing of the record, that the trial court thus violated his plenary <em>Antommarchi </em>right to be present. The dissent goes even a step further to argue, in effect, that <em>Antommarchi </em>protocols and protections were automatically triggered by the court\u2019s announced procedure, regardless of subsequent compliance by questioning in the presence of defendant. We disagree with the contentions and record interpretations proposed by both defendant and the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Neither initially nor at the implementation phase was there any <em>Antommarchi </em>violation emanating from the absence of the defendant during the preliminary Bench screenings of jurors, who were not excused for cause, but who were put on the court\u2019s <em>\"Antommarchi </em>list\u201d for further inquiry in Chambers concerning possible partiality. As to these jurors, the court followed the announced, agreed-upon step by substantially conducting proper, de novo <em>Antommarchi </em>inquiries, <em>with the defendant present. </em>We are satisfied on the state of this record that defendant was given a \"full and fair opportunity to give meaningful input regarding the discretionary decision to challenge [the juror] peremptorily including the option to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>extensive additional voir dire where [the juror\u2019s] responses to questions could be observed and heard\u201d <em>(People v Roman, supra, </em>88 NY2d, at 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Quite cogently, this case is distinguished, upon careful analysis, by the fact that the trial court here expressly articulated its intent to comply with <em>Antommarchi, </em>proposed a procedure which facially adhered to the <em>Antommarchi </em>standard, and then carried it out reasonably and substantially with all counsel agreeing and particularly participating <em>(compare, People v Maher, </em>89 NY2d, at 325, <em>supra, </em>and <em>People v Roman, </em>88 NY2d, \u00e1t 28, <em>supra). </em>Appellant\u2019s argument and the dissent\u2019s acceptance of it thus fail to persuade because the state of this record does not support the very premises of its construct. Rather, the record pointedly refutes the theoretical underpinnings of defendant\u2019s claim of error. Moreover, the dissent\u2019s implication that we \"overlook\u201d the personal presence touchstone of these cases (dissenting opn, at 567) fails to take note of our careful and integrated analysis, attention and application of all the relevant principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Defendant, it must be noted, points to the absence of a transcript of the preliminary screening \u2014 the <em>pre-Antommarchi </em>sidebar discussions, conducted by the trial court with both counsel present, expressly preserving the <em>Antommarchi </em>inquiries for later when the defendant would be, and was, personally present. We are not convinced, as we have shown, that the claimed lapse even occurred or that it, in any event, measured up to a legally documentable or cognizable <em>Antommarchi </em>error. The gossamer thread of appellant\u2019s theory and argument just does not hold together under this Court\u2019s precisely delineated line of realistically evolving precedents, as applied to the case proceedings in the well of this trial court. What happened here does not measure up to a justifiable basis for reversing, because defendant, in any event, did not make a proper record and even contributed to the lack of availability of a fuller record by the stipulation and particularized implementation actions. Defendant\u2019s carefully peeled and examined contention, adopted by the dissent, proposes to expand the scope and reach of the <em>Antommarchi </em>protection and rubric beyond the theoretical premises and practical, realistic necessities of the rule itself and its actual implementation in this case. If defendant\u2019s theory were accepted, as the dissent proposes to do, it would also unwisely limit appropriate methodological flexibility, which trial courts ought to be entrusted with and ought to possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b638-4\">Titone, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aza2\">(dissenting). The Trial Judge in this case elected to experiment with the jury selection process by first gathering a large complement of prospective jurors \u2014 48 instead of the usual 12 <em>(see, </em>CPL 270.15) \u2014 and then devising a system for conducting the voir dire in order to resolve the logistical problems that were created by the use of such a large venire panel.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In the process, both the letter and the spirit of our holding in <em>People v Antommarchi </em>(80 NY2d 247) were transgressed. Because the defendant\u2019s right to be present during the particularized substantive questioning of jurors was not respected and because defendant did not effectively waive that personal right, we conclude that the judgment of conviction should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Initially, we note that the majority\u2019s rationale for affirmance does not withstand scrutiny. At one point, the majority states that the judgment should be affirmed because the record is insufficient to support defendant\u2019s claims (majority opn, at 562). At another point, the majority concludes that the record reveals a facially appropriate \"preliminary screening\u201d procedure that was first \"expressly articulated\u201d by the Trial Judge and was \"then carried * * * out reasonably and substantially\u201d (majority opn, at 563). Ironically, however, it is the trial court\u2019s own description of her plan and the plan\u2019s recorded implementation that belie the conclusion the majority has reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">At the outset of the jury selection process, the Trial Judge told defense counsel that if defendant did not consent to waive his <em>Antommarchi </em>rights, she would use her own accustomed procedure. Under that procedure, a preliminary \"screening\u201d would be conducted at the Bench, \"and then,\u201d according to the court, \"anybody who has an issue which is an <em>Antommarchi </em>issue\u201d would be identified and subjected to further questioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>in defendant\u2019s presence. In other words, the \"screening\u201d discussions at the Bench would consist of questions aimed at discovering the existence of relationships, prior experiences or attitudes that might affect the jurors\u2019 ability to be objective. Manifestly, those are precisely the areas that must be reserved for exploration in the defendant\u2019s presence under <em>Antommarchi (see, People v Antommarchi, supra, </em>at 250; <em>People v Sprowal, </em>84 NY2d 113, 117; <em>People v Sloan, </em>79 NY2d 386; <em>cf., People v Velasco, </em>77 NY2d 469).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">With respect to the implementation of the Trial Judge\u2019s plan, any remaining doubt about what was actually discussed in the private Bench conferences is dispelled by the Trial Judge\u2019s own statements to the prospective jurors after they were brought into the courtroom and seated. The jurors were told that they would be asked to approach the Bench and \"share\u201d their personal information with the court if \"any of you\u201d \"has ever been arrested or convicted of a crime,\u201d \"[been] involved in [the] criminal justice system in any way,\u201d \"had any kind of a drug problem,\u201d or \"[has] anything in your background which makes you feel that you could not be fair.\u201d Having thus described the relevant concerns, the court went on to tell the jurors that \"the court officers will talk to you row by row and see if any of you need to see me individually.\u201d At no point in this instruction did the Trial Judge mention any \"personal disqualification or disability\u201d (majority opn, at 561) such as a physical incapacity or a scheduling problem as an alternative reason for alerting the court officer and approaching the Bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The only rational inference that can be drawn from this record is that the ensuing private Bench conferences concerned the topics on which the court had explicitly solicited discussion. Indeed, in order to draw the contrary inference or to suggest, as the majority has, that the Bench conferences concerned some personal disqualification or disability, one would have to assume that both the court officers and the jurors had failed to understand what the Judge was looking for \u2014 a highly unlikely occurrence, particularly in view of the fact that the \"screening\u201d system was apparently part of this Judge\u2019s regular practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">In sum, it is clear beyond peradventure that the disputed Bench conferences concerned matters that required defendant\u2019s presence under <em>Antommarchi </em>and that, accordingly, defendant\u2019s \"burden\u201d under <em>People v Maher </em>(89 NY2d 318, 325) is satisfied by this appellate record. Moreover, even if that were not the case, the majority\u2019s assertion that the court\u2019s an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>nounced plan was valid on its face is misplaced, since that plan expressly called for private discussions about matters affecting objectivity and fairness \u2014 discussions requiring the defendant\u2019s presence under <em>Antommarchi. </em>Surely, there can be no argument that an otherwise forbidden private sidebar can be validated by labeling it a \"preliminary\u201d or \"screening\u201d procedure. Similarly, the fact that no jurors other than the two who were recalled \"were excused at the Bench screening stage\u201d (majority opn, at 562) does not cleanse the procedure of error, since, regardless of the Bench conference\u2019s outcome, the \"impressions [defendant would have] gained from seeing and hearing the juror\u2019s responses\u201d might \" 'have been useful in ensuring a more reliable determination\u2019 \u201d or in providing fodder from defendant\u2019s meaningful input into his counsel\u2019s choices <em>(see, People v Roman, </em>88 NY2d 18, 26, quoting <em>People v Morales, </em>80 NY2d 450, 454). Once it is determined that, as here, the accused was excluded from a Bench conference concerning possible general or specific bias, the only salient question for consideration is whether, as discussed in <em>People v Maher (supra, </em>at 325) and <em>People v Feliciano </em>(88 NY2d 18, 28), \"the record 'negate[s] the possibility that [the defendant] could have provided valuable input.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We know from the record before us that at least eight unrecorded Bench conferences with prospective jurors were held. Some insight into the contents of these conversations may be had from the subsequent colloquies that were recorded. For example, when prompted to \"explain for the record\u201d what he had said in private, one juror stated that as a mathematician he felt he would have difficulty with the reasonable doubt standard of proof. Another expressed concern that the concepts of entrapment, encouragement and accomplice liability would \"cloud\u201d her judgment. A third prospective juror acknowledged that during her private sidebar she had alluded to the fact that she had many friends in law enforcement positions. Although each of these jurors was excused under circumstances that did not suggest an opportunity for meaningful input by defendant <em>(see, People v Roman, supra), </em>the same cannot be said for the facts surrounding the questioning of juror S. <em>(see, People v Roman, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">After having been examined in chambers without defendant\u2019s presence, juror S. was again questioned in defendant\u2019s presence. In response to questions by the court and defense counsel, juror S. stated that she was a recovering drug addict and alcoholic but that she felt she could be fair and could follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>the court\u2019s legal instructions. Although it may be inferred from the context that these facts had been elicited during the private Bench conference, there is no basis for assuming that the entire discussion from which defendant had been excluded was \"essentially replicated de novo in [defendant\u2019s] presence\u201d <em>(People v Starks, </em>88 NY2d 18, 29). To the contrary, despite having been given an opportunity to do so, the prosecutor expressly declined to repeat in defendant\u2019s presence the questions he had previously asked this juror in private.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Since juror S. was ultimately discharged peremptorily by the defense, it cannot be said that defendant\u2019s exclusion from her private Bench conference may be excused because there was no possibility that he could have made a meaningful contribution to his attorney\u2019s discretionary choice <em>(see, People v Davidson, </em>89 NY2d 881; <em>People v Roman, supra). </em>Thus, it is clear that defendant\u2019s rights under the <em>Antommarchi </em>principle were violated and that, accordingly, reversal of his conviction is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The fact that defense counsel may have consented to the court\u2019s experimental procedure <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 561-562) does not change the analysis, since defendant made it clear at the outset that <em>he </em>did not intend to waive his <em>Antommarchi </em>right. Similarly, to the extent that the majority relies on defense counsel\u2019s presence at the Bench conferences as a legally significant \"feature\u201d (majority opn, at 561), its analysis overlooks the fundamental principle that the CPL 260.20 right to be present is personal to the defendant and has never been deemed to have been satisfied by the presence of counsel <em>(see, People v Roman, supra, </em>at 25; <em>People v Sprowal, </em>84 NY2d 113, 117). Indeed, since the defendant\u2019s personal presence is required in part \"because of the potential input the defendant can give defense counsel\u201d <em>(People v Roman, supra, </em>at 26), it is circular to cite counsel\u2019s presence as a factor ameliorating the exclusion of the defendant himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">In closing, I would note that while experimentation is permissible and perhaps even desirable, care must always be taken to ensure that the procedures the court devises do not impair the fundamental rights of the accused. Furthermore, although the right recognized in <em>Antommarchi </em>may be controversial, it has repeatedly been reaffirmed by this Court and is not to be circumvented or treated as a technical inconvenience to which only lip service must be paid. Regardless of whether the colloquy is labeled an <em>\"Antommarchi </em>conference,\u201d a \"preliminary\u201d sidebar or a \"screening\u201d discussion, the rule remains that <em>any </em>discussion with prospective jurors as to \" 'bias, hostil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ity or predisposition to believe\u2019 certain witnesses over others\u201d must be conducted in the defendant\u2019s presence <em>(People v Vargas, </em>88 NY2d 363, 375, quoting <em>People v Sprowal, supra, </em>at 117). Since that rule was not followed here, I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to uphold the Appellate Division order affirming the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine and Wesley concur with Judge Bellacosa; Judge Titone dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judge Ciparick concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\"> As a matter of experience and personal principle, Judge Titone would also take issue with the Trial Judge\u2019s expansion of the \"jury box\u201d to encompass some 48 persons. Although the statute contemplates some small discretionary increases in the customary 12-person box <em>(see, </em>Mem of Off of Ct Admin, 1981 NY Legis Ann, at 168-169; Letter from Div Of Crim Justice Servs, Bill Jacket, L 1981, ch 301; Mem by T. Sullivan, Dist Atty, Richmond County, Bill Jacket, <em>op. cit.), </em>an expansion from the customary 12 to 48 prospective jurors could, in Judge Titone\u2019s view, readily be considered so inimical to the effective conduct of voir dire as to constitute an abuse of discretion as a matter of law. However, since defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the procedure, its propriety cannot be considered here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
