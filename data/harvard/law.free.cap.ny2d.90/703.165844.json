Even if the carrier is entitled to an offset, the Court erred in holding that the offset applies against both the mandatory portion (which in this case is $10,000) and the nonmandatory portion (which in this case is $290,000) of the uninsured motorists policy; it should apply solely to the mandatory portion. III. Even if the carrier is entitled to an offset, the Court erred in ruling that claimant was not entitled to an exception to the offset pursuant to Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1-a). <em>(Dietrick v Kemper Ins.

We conclude that, under this State\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, the carrier may only offset its future payments by amounts recovered in an action against a third-party tortfeasor, and thus that the credit is unavailable in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Claimant Charlotte Shutter was injured in a single car accident when the driver of the taxi she had hired to transport her to the airport for a business trip lost control of the vehicle. Because the taxi owner\u2019s insurer disclaimed coverage, and the driver was uninsured, claimant filed a claim under the uninsured motorist provisions of her own automobile insurance policy, which had a coverage limit of $300,000. Claimant recovered $124,697.95 under this clause from her insurer after arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Claimant also received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from her employer, Philips Display Components Company, based upon her permanent and partial disability. The employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier sought to offset claimant\u2019s future compensation payments by the amount she obtained under the uninsured motorist provisions of her policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Workers\u2019 Compensation Law Judge ruled that the carrier was not entitled to the offset because the uninsured motor vehicle coverage corresponded to \"first party coverage paid for by the claimant,\u201d which is not subject to offset under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board reversed. The Board concluded that the employer was entitled to the offset because claimant\u2019s insurance recovery \"did not represent payment (in lieu of first party benefits) for basic economic loss, but instead represented payment for non-economic loss made\u201d pursuant to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (1) and (2), and thus did not fall within the exemption created by Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1-a).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">The Appellate Division affirmed. The Court concluded that the lien and offset remedies authorized by Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 were not \"specifically limited to actions against third-party tortfeasors.\u201d (235 AD2d 904, 905.) Thus, the Court concluded that the carrier could offset its future workers\u2019 compensation benefit payments by the proceeds of claimant\u2019s uninsured motorist claim. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>The employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier seeks to offset its future compensation payments to claimant by the amount that claimant recovered in uninsured motorist benefits under her own insurance policy. The availability of the credit that the carrier seeks depends on our construction of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29. That statute provides that if an employee who is eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits is injured \"by the <em>negligence or wrong of another </em>not in the same employ, such injured employee * * * [may] pursue his remedy <em>against such other </em>subject to the provisions of this chapter\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 [1] [emphasis supplied]). The statute further allows that if the injured employee receives workers\u2019 compensation benefits \"and desire[s] to bring action <em>against such other </em>* * * the [workers\u2019 compensation carrier] * * * shall have a lien on the proceeds of any recovery <em>from such </em>other\u201d to the extent of the compensation provided <em>(id. </em>[emphasis supplied]). Similarly, the statute\u2019s \"offset provision\u201d states that if the injured employee \"proceed[s] against <em>such other, </em>[the workers\u2019 compensation carrier] * * * shall contribute only the deficiency, if any, between the amount of the <em>recovery against such other person </em>actually collected, and the compensation provided * * * by this chapter\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 [4] [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The statute protects the compensation carrier\u2019s subrogation rights by providing that if the injured employee takes compensation benefits, \"but has failed to [timely] commence action against such other, * * * such failure shall operate as an assignment of the cause of action against such other to the * * * [workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier]\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 [2]), provided that the carrier complies with certain requirements <em>(see, id.). </em>Additionally, the statute requires the carrier\u2019s consent or a court-issued compromise order for a claimant to settle a third-party action and continue to receive workers\u2019 compensation payments (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 [5]; <em>Matter of Johnson v Buffalo &amp; Erie County Private Indus. Council, </em>84 NY2d 13, 19).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Here, the workers\u2019 compensation carrier contends that the availability of the offset should not depend upon the pocket that finances the claimant\u2019s recovery, and that \"any\u201d recovery by the claimant based on the work-related automobile accident should reduce the carrier\u2019s payment obligation. We disagree with this expansive construction of the statute for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">As an initial matter, the workers\u2019 compensation system is the creature of a comprehensive statutory scheme <em>(Matter of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number><em>Granger v Urda, </em>44 NY2d 91, 97). Thus, the terms of its governing statutes, including the lien and offset provisions at issue here, should be strictly construed in light of their legislative purpose <em>(Matter of Jacob, </em>86 NY2d 651, 657).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Contrary to the carrier\u2019s position, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law does not broadly authorize liens and offsets to be applied against \"all\u201d or \"any\u201d recoveries from others without regard for their source. Rather, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (4) specifically authorizes application of the lien or offset only against a specific category of recoveries \u2014 i.e., those constituting the proceeds of an action against \"such other.\u201d The term \"such other\u201d relates back to the earlier mention in section 29 (1) of the person whose \"negligence or wrong\u201d causes the claimant\u2019s harm. Together, these terms indicate that the lien and offset tools may be applied only against recoveries from the third-party tortfeasors who are responsible for the claimant\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, under the statute\u2019s plain terms, the workers\u2019 compensation carrier is subrogated to the employee\u2019s rights against the third party, indicating a legislative decision that the loss be borne by the wrongdoer.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Here, the funds claimant recovered from her own insurance carrier tinder the uninsured motorist benefits endorsement were not recovered from the third-party tortfeasor. Thus, under a strict reading of the statute\u2019s terms, the carrier is not entitled to a credit based on those proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Our conclusion that the carrier may not enjoy a credit from uninsurance payments is buttressed by the fact that the statutory scheme requires vigilant preservation of the carrier\u2019s subrogation rights in an \"action\u201d against a \"third party\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 [2], [5]), but does not contemplate intervention by the carrier or mandate preservation of any similar subrogation right when the injured employee proceeds with a claim under her own insurance policy. Indeed, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 30 provides, with exceptions not relevant here, that \"[n]o benefits, savings or <em>insurance </em>of the injured employee, independent of the provisions of this chapter, shall be considered in determining the compensation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>benefits to be paid under this chapter\u201d (emphasis supplied). The carrier\u2019s construction of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 thus runs afoul of this prohibition without clear statutory authority or other satisfactory justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The carrier nonetheless contends that the injured employee\u2019s insurer steps into the shoes of the tortfeasor, such that recovery from the claimant\u2019s uninsurance coverage should be deemed the equivalent of recovery from the negligent actor. We disagree. Where the claim is made against the injured worker\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage, the recovery is predicated on that insurer\u2019s contractual obligation to assume the risk of loss associated with an uninsured motorist on the insured\u2019s behalf in exchange for the payment of premiums. Although liability will be measured by the damages caused by the tortfeasor, the insurer\u2019s obligation to pay is not derived from any relationship with or duty owed to the tortfeasor <em>(Commissioners of State Ins. Fund v Miller, </em>4 AD2d 481; <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v Glickman, </em>84 Misc 2d 33).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, the insurer\u2019s payments do not discharge the tortfeasor\u2019s liability. The fact that the insured is now obligated by statute to purchase $10,000 in underinsured motorist coverage does not require a different result, as the carrier contends, because it does not create a relationship between the tortfeasor and the injured worker\u2019s insurance carrier that would render one the \u201calter ego\u201d of the other <em>(see, Commissioners of State Ins. Fund v Miller, 4 </em>AD2d 481, 482-483, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The carrier also argues that because the insurance proceeds here do not fall within the exemption from the lien and offset created by Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1-a), it follows that the lien and offset remedies are not barred. This argument misses the mark, however, because it presumes that the lien or offset is available in the first instance, which the carrier has failed to establish.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">In any event, section 29 (1-a) has no relevance here. Section 29 (1-a) exempts from a workers\u2019 compensation lien \"the proceeds of any recovery received pursuant to [Insurance Law \u00a7 5104 (a)]\u201d which constitute compensation and/or medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>benefits paid in lieu of first-party benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In turn, Insurance Law \u00a7 5104 (a) governs the right of recovery in a serious personal injury action against another person who is \"covered\u201d within the meaning of the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Given that exemption provisions apply by their terms only to a limited class of recoveries in third-party actions, they have no application to the proceeds of claims made against an insured\u2019s own uninsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Finally, by definition, uninsured motorist coverage compensates for \"noneconomic\u201d loss<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and economic loss in excess of basic economic loss,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and shall not duplicate any element of basic economic loss (Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 [f] [1]). Workers\u2019 compensation benefits by definition are limited to reimbursement for basic economic loss (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 10 <em>et </em>seq.; <em>Matter of Granger v Urda, </em>44 NY2d 91, <em>supra), </em>and they do \"not provide an award for pain and suffering\u201d (Minkowitz, Supp Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 64, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29, 1997 Pocket Part, at 37, 38). Thus, the unavailability of the offset here does not give the injured employee a double recovery for the same elements of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to that Court, with directions to remand to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-9\">. The carrier did not attempt to assert a lien on the insurance proceeds pursuant to Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\">. Thus, this State\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation lien and offset provisions are distinguishable from the legislation that some States have chosen to enact which either specifically address the availability of carrier liens or credits against the proceeds of uninsured or underinsured motorist claims (see, <em>e.g., </em>Me Rev Stat Annot, tit 39-A, \u00a7 221 [3] [F]; NH Rev Stat Annot \u00a7 281-A: 13 [I]), or which fail to include language limiting the right of subrogation to tort recoveries (see, <em>e.g., </em>SD Codified Laws \u00a7 62-4-39).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\">. The carrier contends that <em>Glickman </em>and <em>Miller </em>are no longer valuable precedent, given that they predate the enactment of the No-Fault Law. However, the carrier fails to direct us to any provision of that law that would invalidate the holdings of either of these cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b784-9\">. First-party benefits are defined as \"payments to reimburse a person for basic economic loss on account of personal injury arising out of the use or operation of a motor vehicle, less\u201d certain deductions (Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 M).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b784-11\">. Section 29 (1-a) does not preclude placement of the lien on those recoveries received pursuant to Insurance Law \u00a7 5104 (b), which concerns \"action[s] by or on behalf of a covered person, against a non-covered person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b784-12\">. Noneconomic loss is defined as \"pain and suffering and similar non-monetary detriment\u201d (Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 [c]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b784-13\">. Basic economic loss generally refers to medical expenses, and lost earnings \"for not more than three years from the date of the accident causing the injury,\u201d up to a maximum statutory do.llar amount of $50,000 per person (Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 [a] [2]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
