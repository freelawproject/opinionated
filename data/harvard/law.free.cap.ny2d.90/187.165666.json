On CPL 440.10 motions made after direct appeal has been concluded, however, for vacatur of a conviction a defendant must demonstrate prejudice \u2014 meaning a reasonable pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>sibility that the prosecution\u2019s failure to make <em>Rosario </em>disclosure materially contributed to the verdict. This appeal raises yet another novel question in our <em>Rosario </em>jurisprudence: which of the two standards applies when a CPL 440.10 motion is made <em>before </em>a defendant\u2019s direct appeal has been exhausted \u2014 the \"per se\u201d rule, or a requirement of prejudice? We conclude that a uniform standard governs CPL 440.10 motions, and remit to the Appellate Division to determine whether defendant has been prejudiced by the <em>Rosario </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">On the morning of February 22, 1988, defendant, wielding a knife, seized his estranged wife, Lydia Machado, as she was leaving her mother\u2019s house in Brooklyn and threw her into his van. As defendant began to drive away, Machado\u2019s brother, Edwin Morales, grabbed hold of the driver\u2019s side window of the van. Morales was carried down the block until he apparently hit the pole of a street sign. Morales died a short time later as a result of internal injuries he sustained from the impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">For the next several hours, defendant drove through the triState area with Machado, forcing her onto the floor of the van, and punched and kicked her. At one point he stopped, bound her hands with a belt, gagged her and held a knife to her throat, drawing blood. Following a chase by helicopter and ground units, the police apprehended defendant in Brooklyn. Later that day, Machado spoke with the police, and at 11:00 p.m. gave an audiotaped statement to an Assistant District Attorney. Subsequently, at a hospital, she reported that her left eye and back were bruised and that she was suffering from pain in her left arm, but she was not treated for any injuries to her wrist or a knife wound on her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Defendant was charged with two counts of murder in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [2], [3]), one count of kidnapping in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 135.20) and two counts of assault in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 120.05 [2], [6]). A jury acquitted defendant of the murder and assault with a dangerous instrument counts, but found him guilty of the kidnapping and felony assault counts. On January 4, 1990, defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 81/3 to 25 years on the kidnapping count and 21/s to 7 years on the assault count. Twenty days later, defendant filed a notice of appeal from his judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">In August 1990, the People for the first time provided defendant with a copy of a report authored by Detective Michael <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Russell (the Russell Report), who had investigated Morales\u2019s death and had testified for the People at trial. The report form, entitled \"Brooklyn Detective Area Confidential Report,\u201d contained instructions on how to prepare the report and a one-paragraph summary of the events of February 22, 1988, concluding with the line: \"Mrs. Machado sustained minor injuries and refused Medical aid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Defendant perfected his appeal on February 2,1992, contending that the People\u2019s failure to deliver the Russell Report before trial constituted a <em>Rosario </em>violation. There was, however, no record before the court related to the claimed violation; on October 30, 1992 defendant\u2019s motion to enlarge the record to include the Russell Report was denied by the Appellate Division. While his direct appeal was pending, on November 13, 1992 defendant filed a CPL 440.10 motion \u2014 the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In his motion, defendant argued that because he had moved to vacate the judgment of conviction before exhaustion of his direct appeal, a \"per se error\u201d standard applied to the claimed <em>Rosario </em>violation. The People opposed the motion, contending that the Russell Report was not <em>Rosario </em>material and that, even if it was, defendant was required to show that he had been prejudiced by the People\u2019s failure to disclose the report. On January 15, 1993, Supreme Court conducted a hearing on defendant\u2019s CPL 440.10 motion, at which Russell and Machado testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Meanwhile, on December 28, 1992, the Appellate Division unanimously affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction (188 AD2d 665), noting that the Russell Report was not part of the appellate record and that defendant\u2019s <em>Rosario </em>claim would more appropriately be raised by a CPL 440.10 motion. On March 16, 1993, defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal to this Court was denied (81 NY2d 888).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Months later, Supreme Court denied defendant\u2019s CPL 440.10 motion (159 Misc 2d 94), concluding that the report was not <em>Rosario </em>material and that even if it was defendant failed to demonstrate a reasonable possibility that nondisclosure contributed to the verdict. On defendant\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Division reversed and vacated the conviction (228 AD2d 700). The court held that the Russell Report was <em>Rosario </em>material, and that, because defendant\u2019s CPL 440.10 motion was filed before exhaustion of his direct appeal, the violation itself required reversal. A Judge of this Court granted the People\u2019s leave application.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>In this Court, the People have abandoned their claim that the Russell Report was not <em>Rosario </em>material. Thus, the issue before us is the standard applicable to <em>Rosario </em>violations raised by CPL 440.10 motions before exhaustion of defendant\u2019s direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Motivated by the \"right sense of justice,\u201d this Court 36 years ago in <em>People v Rosario </em>(9 NY2d 286, 289, <em>cert denied </em>368 US 866) established a new rule regarding the disclosure of statements by prosecution witnesses. Before <em>Rosario, </em>a trial court determined which documents were relevant to the defense and ordered production accordingly; where discovery was erroneously denied the appellate court applied a harmless error test. <em>Rosario </em>changed the practice by requiring the People to turn over pretrial statements of prosecution witnesses, leaving it for the single-minded counsel for the accused rather than trial courts to determine the value of those statements to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">With harmless error still the standard, this equilibrium continued for 15 years, until <em>People v Consolazio </em>(40 NY2d 446, <em>cert denied </em>433 US 914). <em>Consolazio </em>articulated a rule of per se reversal, in order to assure the People\u2019s scrupulous adherence to their obligation to turn over <em>Rosario </em>material (40 NY2d at 454, supra; <em>see also, People v Jones, </em>70 NY2d 547, 551-553; <em>People v Perez, </em>65 NY2d 154, 159-160). The price for the People\u2019s failure to disclose prior statements of their own witnesses thus became automatic reversal of the conviction, a standard this Court has continued during the past two decades to apply to <em>Rosario </em>claims raised on direct appeal <em>(see, e.g., People v Banch, </em>80 NY2d 610; <em>People v Young, </em>79 NY2d 365; <em>People v Ranghelle, </em>69 NY2d 56).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">In formulating these principles, which balanced the various societal and individual interests involved, the Court was guided solely by its own precedents, as a matter of common law. Although the Legislature codified the <em>Rosario </em>rule (CPL 240.45 [1] [a]), it prescribed no other standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\"><em>People v Jackson </em>(78 NY2d 638), however, presented a different calculus. In <em>Jackson, </em>the Court was asked to decide whether the automatic reversal rule also should apply to <em>Rosario </em>claims raised in a CPL 440.10 motion, after defendant\u2019s direct appeal had been concluded \u2014 in that case a full three years after defendant\u2019s direct appeal had been exhausted. There, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>first time the Court was faced with the task of harmonizing the common-law <em>Rosario </em>rule with a statute, the enactment of a coequal branch of government: Noting that <em>Rosario </em>was not based on State or Federal constitutional principles, but rather on our own balancing of interests, we acknowledged in <em>Jackson </em>that CPL 440.10 involved new policy considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">As determined in <em>Jackson, </em>the controlling statute is CPL 440.10 (1) (f), which provides that a judgment may be vacated on the ground that the conduct at issue is \"improper and prejudicial.\u201d Thus, the Court observed, the statute explicitly affords a remedy only if the defendant can demonstrate prejudice. Moreover, just as the <em>Rosario </em>rule reflected the Court\u2019s balancing of interests, CPL 440.10 represented the Legislature\u2019s own weighing, and reflected the Legislature\u2019s overriding concern about society\u2019s interest in the finality of judgments. Agreeing with the Legislature that this finality interest was \"formidable,\u201d and concluding that fairness to defendants would not be unduly compromised by an inquiry into prejudice, we refused to \"eviscerate the language of CPL 440.10 (1) (f)\u201d and held that a prejudice standard \u2014 not a per se rule \u2014 was applicable to <em>Rosario </em>violations raised by postappeal CPL 440.10 motions <em>(People v Jackson, </em>78 NY2d, at 647, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The issue before us concededly presents yet another balance of factors, and neither party offers a wholly satisfactory answer as to where the line should be drawn. We are persuaded, however, that the better course is to apply <em>Jackson: Rosario </em>claims raised by way of CPL 440.10 motions made before direct appeal is exhausted should be rejected unless the violation prejudiced defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">As in <em>Jackson, </em>analysis centers on the relevant statute, and the requirement of prejudice in CPL 440.10 (1) (f). Courts, of course, cannot broaden the scope of the remedy afforded by CPL 440.10 beyond what the Legislature unambiguously specified (78 NY2d at 641, 647-648, <em>supra; </em>McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 73, at 149-150). To adopt defendant\u2019s argument, moreover, would give the word \"prejudicial\u201d in CPL 440.10 (1) (f) one meaning in a preappeal context and another in a postappeal context. Thus, \"fulfilling our duty as common-law Judges to interpret statutory language\u201d (78 NY2d at 647, <em>supra), </em>we conclude that the unambiguous terms of CPL 440.10 (1) (f) require that a defendant making a CPL 440.10 motion\u2014 preappeal or postappeal \u2014 seeking to vacate a judgment of conviction on <em>Rosario </em>grounds demonstrate prejudice resulting from the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>We recognize that society\u2019s interest in the finality of a judgment of conviction is different when defendant\u2019s direct appeal is pending from when defendant\u2019s appeal has been concluded. Of greater concern, however, is the language of the statute and the anomaly in its interpretation that would result were we to accept defendant\u2019s argument. Apart from the fact that defendant\u2019s interpretation would ascribe two different meanings to the very same statutory word, an anomaly would arise from variations in the amount of time it takes to resolve an appeal in the Appellate Divisions. Where the appellate backlog is greater a defendant would have an increased opportunity for per se reversal. Application of CPL 440.10 (1) (f) should be uniform, wherever defendant\u2019s appeal is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Additionally, we are satisfied that the test of prejudice in the <em>Rosario </em>context \u2014 a \"reasonable possibility\u201d that the nondisclosure materially contributed to the verdict \u2014 safeguards both the interest in fairness to defendants and the interest in assuring the People\u2019s careful discharge of their disclosure obligation. The \"reasonable possibility\u201d test is, after all, \"perhaps the most demanding test yet formulated\u201d for harmless error analysis <em>(see, People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230, 240-241). And we have recognized that the \"reasonable possibility\u201d test \"properly encourages compliance\u201d with the People\u2019s <em>Brady </em>obligations <em>(People v Vilardi, </em>76 NY2d 67, 77). That should be no less true with respect to the People\u2019s <em>Rosario </em>obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">As a final argument in favor of a per se standard defendant contends that <em>People v Novoa </em>(70 NY2d 490) \u2014 which preceded <em>Jackson </em>\u2014 is controlling. However, as is abundantly clear from the Court\u2019s opinion, in <em>Novoa </em>the Court was not asked to determine, nor did it, what standard of review should apply to CPL 440.10 motions. <em>Jackson </em>represented the next step in the progression of these cases, putting before us the question whether <em>Rosario </em>claims raised in a postappeal CPL 440.10 motion \u2014 like those raised on direct appeal \u2014 were subject to the per se error rule. While defendant points to language in <em>Jackson </em>describing <em>Novoa, </em>the fact remains that the issue we now confront simply was not before us in <em>Novoa </em>or in <em>Jackson. </em>Resolving for the first time the question of the legal standard applicable to CPL 440.10 motions made <em>before </em>defendant\u2019s appeal has been exhausted, we decide in favor of uniformity for CPL 440.10 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">It remains for us to apply that legal standard to the facts before us. Because the Appellate Division ruled that the People\u2019s failure to disclose the Russell Report warranted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>automatic vacatur of defendant\u2019s conviction, the court did not determine whether that failure, in fact, prejudiced defendant. The case must therefore be remitted to the Appellate Division for a determination of whether there was a reasonable possibility that failure to turn over the <em>Rosario </em>material contributed to the verdict against defendant <em>(People v Jackson, </em>78 NY2d at 650, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, and the case remitted to the Appellate Division, Second Department, for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Judges Titone, Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
