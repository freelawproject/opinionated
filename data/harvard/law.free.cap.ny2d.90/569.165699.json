III. The State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) review performed by the SRB was legally defective in that no Environmental Impact Statement, supplemental or otherwise, was prepared for this project despite the fact that the project would have a significant effect on the environment. <em>(Matter of Sun Beach Real Estate Dev.

The SEQRA review performed by the SRB was legally defective in that the SRB merely compared the LCS project to the unapproved Delco project. <em>(Matter of Neville v Koch, </em>79 NY2d 416.) V. The LCS project did not comply with the Roslyn zoning code and the site plan approval should be annulled. <em>(Sega v State of New York, </em>60 NY2d 183; <em>Matter of Town of New Castle v Kaufmann, </em>72 NY2d 684; <em>Matter of Elm St. Assocs. v Sniado, </em>159 AD2d 570; <em>Matter of Chrysler Realty Corp. v Orneck, </em>196 AD2d 631.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-5\"><em>Spellman &amp; Walsh, L.

The negative declaration issued by the SRB was the functional equivalent of a conditioned negative declaration and impermissible under SEQRA. <em>(Matter of Taub v Pirnie, </em>3 NY2d 188; <em>Matter of Shawangunk Mtn.

Zoning issues presented an alternate ground to annul the site plan. <em>(Matter of Salierno v Briggs, </em>141 AD2d 547; <em>Matter of Elm St. Assocs. v Sniado, </em>159 AD2d 570; <em>Matter of Chrysler Realty Corp. v Orneck, </em>196 AD2d 631; <em>Matter of Exxon Corp. v Board of Stds. &amp; Appeals, </em>128 AD2d 289, 70 NY2d 614; <em>Matter of Mandel v Nusbaum, </em>138 AD2d 597.) IV. As a result of the adoption of a new comprehensive plan and of a new zoning law by Roslyn, the instant appeal may be moot. <em>(Matter of Alscot Investing Corp. v Incorporated Vil. of Rockville Centre, </em>64 NY2d 921; <em>Matter of Pokoik v Silsdorf, </em>40 NY2d 769.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b646-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b646-6\">Wesley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">In 1989, the Village Board of the Village of Roslyn approved the construction of a 116,000 square foot mall that would contain an assortment of shops and a riverfront promenade. The developer of that project (the Delco project) then applied for a Tidal Wetlands Permit from the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). The permit was granted by DEC, but the developer was required to reduce the size of the mall, and to eliminate the riverfront promenade and over 25% of the parking spaces. Shortly thereafter, the developer abandoned the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">In 1994, LCS Realty acquired the rights to the project site. Instead of an assortment of shops on the riverfront, LCS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>proposed to construct a single, large 24-hour supermarket on the site. Not surprisingly, the supermarket was projected to generate higher traffic volumes by a consultant for the Village Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">LCS Realty submitted a long form Environmental Assessment Form (EAF) to the Board\u2019s environmental consultant at 7:00 p.m. on Friday, October 14. On October 17, the consultant issued a report listing nine areas that remained to be addressed before a determination of environmental significance could be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">On October 18, the Board conducted a public hearing on LCS Realty\u2019s application for site plan approval. One of the trustees then read a lengthy resolution that contained a negative declaration under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SE-QRA). The resolution compared the LCS Realty project favorably with the Delco project and recited that DEC had issued a Tidal Wetlands Permit for the Delco project without noting that DEC had first required significant reductions in the scope of the Delco project. Based in part upon the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Delco project and the mitigation measures proposed by LCS Realty, the Board found that the project would not result in significant environmental impacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Petitioners commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding to have the site plan approval annulled. Supreme Court found that the Board had issued a negative declaration despite the request of the Village\u2019s environmental consultant for additional information on the nine items identified in the EAF. The court further found that when the negative declaration was issued the Board had been misinformed that DEC had issued a permit for the Delco project as approved by the Board in 1989. In addition, the court found that the Village\u2019s traffic consultant had advised the Board of the need for further traffic safety analysis, but this analysis was not completed until l1/2 months after the negative declaration was issued. The court granted the article 78 petition, annulled the negative declaration, annulled the site plan approval, and remanded the matter to the Village\u2019s Site Review Board for preparation of a supplemental environmental impact statement. On appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed, agreeing with Supreme Court that the Board had not taken a hard look at the relevant areas of environmental concern, and that the Board\u2019s negative declaration was the functional equivalent of a conditioned negative declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>We need not determine if the Board\u2019s decision was the functional equivalent of a conditioned negative declaration (see, <em>Matter of Merson v McNally, </em>90 NY2d 742 [decided today]), because we agree with the Appellate Division\u2019s conclusion that the Board had not taken a hard look at the relevant areas of environmental concern.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">\"A court\u2019s authority to examine a SEQRA review conducted by an entity that was required to do so is limited to reviewing whether the determination was made in violation of lawful procedure, was affected by an error of law or was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion. The relevant question before the court is 'whether the agency identified the relevant areas of environmental concern, took a \"hard look\u201d at them, and made a \"reasoned elaboration\u201d of the basis for its determination\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Gernatt Asphalt Prods. v Town of Sardinia, </em>87 NY2d 668, 688, quoting <em>Matter of Jackson v New York State Urban Dev. Corp., </em>67 NY2d 400, 417).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">\"[T]he extent to which particular environmental factors are to be considered varies in accordance with the circumstances and nature of particular proposals\u201d <em>(Akpan v Koch, </em>75 NY2d 561, 570, <em>mot to amend remittitur denied </em>76 NY2d 846).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Despite the Board\u2019s reliance on the EIS prepared in connection with the Delco project, the impact of the project proposed by LCS Realty diifered dramatically from the Delco project as finally approved. In comparing the EAF for this project with the EIS for the Delco project, the Board disregarded the reductions in scope that DEC had required for the Delco project. In addition, as noted above, the Board\u2019s consultant identified at least nine major areas of concern that were not subsumed within the Delco EIS. Without waiting for the information identified as necessary by its own consultants, the Board issued a negative declaration <em>(see, Matter of New York Archaeological Council v Town Bd., </em>177 AD2d 923, 925; <em>Matter of Shawangunk Mtn. Envtl. Assn. v Planning Bd., </em>157 AD2d 273, 276). We agree with the determination of Supreme Court, affirmed by the Appellate Division, that the Board did not take a hard look at .the relevant areas of environmental concern before issuing the negative declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Titone, Bellacosa, Smith, Levine and Cipabick concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
