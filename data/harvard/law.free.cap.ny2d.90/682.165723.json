C., irrespective of the failure of respondents to satisfy the basic, essential requirements to become shareholders of the professional corporation. <em>(Matter of C &amp; M Plastics [Collins </em>\u2014 Coons], 194 AD2d 1020; <em>Matter of Stewart Becker, Ltd. v Horowitz, </em>94 Misc 2d 766; <em>Serdaroglu v Serdaroglu, </em>209 AD2d 600; <em>Zahr v Wingate Cr.

This Court\u2019s power to review is limited to determining whether the lower courts correctly applied the appropriate legal standard to affirmed findings of fact. <em>(Matter of Unbekant v Bohl Tours Travel Agency, </em>21 AD2d 317, 14 NY2d 959; <em>Matter of Buckley [Wild Oaks Park], </em>44 NY2d 560; <em>Matter of Gearing v Kelly, </em>11 NY2d 201, 1016; <em>Matter of Schmidt [Magnetic Head Corp.], </em>97 AD2d 244; <em>Shevlin v National Conservation Corp., </em>199 AD2d 995; <em>Block v Magee, </em>146 AD2d 730; <em>Chiulli v Cross Westchester Dev.

Professionals who organize their businesses as professional service corporations, regardless of their reasons for incorporating, relinguish the right to be treated as partners since the two legal entities are mutually exclusive and the decision to incorporate demonstrates a conscious and deliberate selection of one organizational form over another. <em>(Matter of Kincade v Barristers Tavern Corp., </em>187 AD2d 593; <em>Block v Magee, </em>146 AD2d 730; <em>We\u2019re Assocs.

The lower court was correct in finding, as a matter of law, that the inclusion of individuals in a certification which the professional corporation is required by law to file precludes the corporation and its officers and directors from denying shareholder voting rights to those individuals. <em>(National Bank &amp; Trust Co. v Woods, </em>128 Misc 2d 1051; <em>Matter of Greenberg [Liza Check Cashing], </em>220 AD2d 205; <em>People ex rel.

The lower court\u2019s finding, affirmed by the Court below, that E.

Heisler, Jr. and Kenneth A. Finder sued under Business Corporation Law \u00a7 619 for judicial enforcement of their shareholder status in Roemer and Featherstonhaugh, P. C., an Albany-based law firm. The joint petition sought either to confirm a corporate election held at a shareholder meeting on March 6, 1996, or to order a new election.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">At the special shareholders\u2019 meeting, Heisler and Finder were initially precluded from voting. After a brief adjournment of the meeting, James D. Featherstonhaugh, vice-president and secretary of the firm, <em>sua sponte </em>allowed the meeting to continue and permitted Heisler and Finder to vote. The disagreements among the parties escalated into this proceeding and appeal. Respondents-appellants are the professional corporation, its president James W. Roemer, its chief financial officer Michael L. Gingras, and shareholder E. Guy Roemer.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">Supreme Court ordered a new meeting of the shareholders and directed that Heisler and Finder be allowed to exercise shareholder voting rights. The Appellate Division affirmed in that regard and modified in a technical respect not before us (235 AD2d 900). This Court granted leave to appeal and we now modify the order by eliminating the relief granted to Finder. While we uphold the relief granted to Heisler as a shareholder with a right to vote, we discern no legal or factual basis to sustain the ruling in Finder\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">At the outset, we reject any estoppel theory or analysis through which to resolve this case. Estoppel, and its related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>theories (e.g., waiver, acquiescence and course of conduct) should be generally inapplicable as bases to determine controversies of this kind. A myriad of factual variations might otherwise lead to undesirable uncertainties and unevenness in connection with business and professional organizations of these kinds. Other than for exceptional circumstances not present here, equitable considerations might generate indefiniteness and detrimentally diminish the stake and stability of already inherently vulnerable minority shareholders in professional corporations and other types of small business organizations. The potential for irregularity and destabilization might be significant and highly undesirable as a matter of policy and predictable jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In the instant matter, article V, \u00a7 1 (b) of the bylaws of this professional corporation provides that \"[n]o certificate representing shares shall be issued until the full amount of consideration therefor has been paid, except as otherwise permitted by law.\u201d Business Corporation Law \u00a7 504 (a) prescribes that \"[consideration for the issue of shares shall consist of money or other property, tangible or intangible, or labor or services actually received by or performed for the corporation or for its benefit.\u201d Therefore, we conclude that for shareholder rights to be recognized under this fact pattern and dispute, consideration of some kind must have been provided and pertinent conditions precedent must have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Heisler\u2019s history and status with the firm meet these standards and are distinctive in this case in relation to appellants and copetitioner-respondent Finder. Heisler indisputably provided consideration by bringing 15 years of experience and professional relationships to the law firm that encouraged him to join it so that he might open a Syracuse office of the firm. The record supports the finding that he would not have laterally moved to the law firm in a capacity less than or different from shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">In fact, Heisler did open and manage the firm\u2019s Syracuse office and exercised managerial responsibilities, including the hiring and firing of employees and billing. Additionally, appellant James Roemer circulated a memorandum to all firm employees announcing that Heisler was joining the firm as a managing shareholder and the firm publicly proclaimed that fact as well. Since Heisler also regularly participated in shareholder meetings and voted as a shareholder, the record evidence, overall, documents and supports the lower courts\u2019 findings of his status as and entitlement to be treated as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>shareholder. \"We, thus, affirm the order in this appeal as it relates to Heisler.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Record evidence, on the other hand, refutes Finder\u2019s status as a shareholder and distinguishes him from Heisler and the relief afforded to that shareholder partner. Finder was an attorney in the firm\u2019s New York City office and failed \u2014 . even expressly declined \u2014 to pay any consideration for shares offered to him. Appellant James Roemer attested without contradiction on this record, in relation to Finder, that they had numerous discussions regarding the purchase of stock and that, during a meeting in January 1994, James Roemer informed Finder that he would not become a shareholder or be issued any shares of stock until the specific amount of consideration for shares of stock was determined and paid. Further, open exploration of Finder\u2019s status with the firm is reflected in a June 28, 1994 memorandum from appellant James Roemer to Finder. The memorandum explicitly declares that Finder would \"not be issued a share of stock in Roemer and Featherstonhaugh\u201d and would only \"be known as a shareholder for compensation and responsibility purposes.\u201d The memorandum also particularly denotes the $50,000 per share price and specifies the shareholder issue as one to be resolved sometime in 1994. Thus, Finder on this record was undeniably aware of his nonshareholder status. Lastly, unlike with Heisler, the record fails to establish that Finder ever voted as a shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Therefore, this record is not only barren of record evidence or a legal theory by which Finder could be found to have acquired shareholder status, but the uncontradicted facts actually support the opposite conclusion. Since Finder never provided any consideration as prescribed by the professional corporation bylaws and Business Corporation Law \u00a7 504, he never attained or became entitled to a shareholder role. We modify the order of the Appellate Division in that regard only as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Finally, we note that the firm\u2019s Business Corporation Law \u00a7 1514 filing, which lists petitioners as shareholders, is not in and of itself determinative of the problem presented by this case. While that filing is relevant and important in its own regulatory sphere and purpose, it is not intended to independently bind participants among themselves for the governance of the professional organization. Notably, different considerations may be warranted when the filing affects outside parties or the regulatory responsibilities and disciplinary interests of the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, by deleting the provision granting petitioner Finder shareholder and voting status and dismissing the petition as it relates to him and, as so modified, the order should be otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Titone, Smith, Ciparick and Wesley concur; Judge Levine taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
