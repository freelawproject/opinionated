The Dram Shop Act\u2019s requirement for imposing liability on a bar that plaintiff prove the bar sold alcohol to a visibly intoxicated person cannot be established solely by an expert\u2019s opinion that, based upon the person\u2019s high blood alcohol level, the person would have shown and did, in fact, exhibit visible evidence of intoxication when served at the bar. <em>(Sherman v Robinson, </em>80 NY2d 483; <em>Martinez v Camardella, </em>161 AD2d 1107; <em>Matalavage v Sadler, </em>77 AD2d 39; <em>McNally v Addis, </em>65 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Misc 2d 204; <em>Fishman v Beach, </em>214 AD2d 920; <em>Ryan v Big Z Corp., </em>210 AD2d 649; <em>Heavlin v Gush, </em>197 AD2d 773; <em>Russell v Olkowski, </em>144 AD2d 837; <em>Aleski v Freilich, </em>7 Misc 2d 631; <em>Tyrrell v Quigley, </em>186 Misc 972.) II. The expert opinion submitted by plaintiff did not constitute legally admissible proof as if there was an insufficient foundation for its admissibility and it was nothing more than the expert\u2019s purely speculative belief that the person served exhibited visible signs of intoxication. <em>(Hambsch v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>63 NY2d 723; <em>Borden v Brady, </em>92 AD2d 983; <em>People v Wesley, </em>83 NY2d 417; <em>People v Middleton, </em>54 NY2d 42.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-5\"><em>Maynard, O\u2019Connor, Smith, Catalinotto &amp; D\u2019Agostino, </em>Albany <em>(Christine Kirwin Krackeler </em>and Arete K.

The evidence before motion term established, as a matter of law, that Jack\u2019s Oyster House did not violate Alcoholic Beverage Control Law \u00a7 65 and General Obligations Law \u00a7 11-101 (the Dram Shop Act). <em>(Terbush v Buchman, </em>147 AD2d 826; <em>Martinez v Camardella, </em>161 AD2d 1107; <em>Donato v McLaughlin, </em>195 AD2d 685.) II.

The burden is upon defendants-appellants to negate all elements of plaintiff\u2019s allegations. Defendants-appellants have failed to satisfy this burden and summary judgment was properly denied. <em>(Myers v Fir Cab Corp., </em>64 NY2d 806; <em>Alvarez v Prospect Hosp., </em>68 NY2d 320; <em>Winegrad v New York Univ.

Plaintiff\u2019s expert would give testimony at trial which, if believed by the jurors, would justify a finding for plaintiff against defendants-appellants, and summary judgment was, therefore, properly denied. <em>(Scheu v High-Forest Corp., </em>129 AD2d 366; <em>Garcia v City of New York, </em>205 AD2d 49; <em>Fiegl v 1695 Ridge Rd.

Under Alcoholic Beverage Control Law \u00a7 65 (2), it is unlawful to furnish an alcoholic beverage to any \"visibly intoxicated person.\u201d The present appeal concerns the sufficiency of an expert\u2019s affidavit based solely on the intoxicated tortfeasor\u2019s blood and urine alcohol counts to establish prima facie the \"visible intoxication\u201d elements of a Dram Shop Act claim under these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">This litigation arises out of a January 18, 1991 automobile accident in the Town of Colonie in which plaintiff Marie Romano was injured and Nancy Stanley, defendant Harold Stanley\u2019s decedent, was killed. According to the parties\u2019 submissions, the accident occurred at about 10:30 p.m., when Stanley\u2019s vehicle crossed the center line of the road and collided with Romano\u2019s automobile. Alleging that Stanley had been intoxicated at the time of the accident, plaintiff brought the present action against Stanley\u2019s estate and the three establishments that had purportedly served alcohol to her on the evening of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Following discovery, two of these defendants, Jack\u2019s Oyster House and Martel\u2019s of Broadway, moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and cross claims against them. The papers submitted in support of the motions included assertions aimed at establishing that Stanley had not been \"visibly intoxicated\u201d while she was on the moving defendants\u2019 premises. According to the submissions, Stanley arrived at Jack\u2019s immediately after work on the afternoon of the 18th and left by 6:45 p.m. A co-worker who saw her there testified at her deposition that Stanley had had only one 8- or 12-ounce beer and had not been intoxicated while she was at Jack\u2019s. Three other coworkers who were acquainted with Stanley agreed that she did not appear intoxicated. A similar conclusion was drawn by Jack\u2019s bartender, who knew Stanley from her previous visits to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>the bar and had reportedly served her only one 12-ounce glass of beer on the afternoon of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Stanley left Jack\u2019s with two of her co-workers and went on to Martel\u2019s, where she was served two more drinks, at least one of which was bourbon. None of the witnesses who saw her at Martel\u2019s observed any indications of Stanley\u2019s being intoxicated. After leaving Martel\u2019s, Stanley drove a few miles away to Dee Dee\u2019s Tavern, the third establishment sued in this action. Arriving between 9:15 and 9:30 p.m., Stanley met three of the co-workers who had been at Jack\u2019s and Martel\u2019s with her. By the time she left approximately an hour later, one of her acquaintances observed that Stanley appeared intoxicated and expressed concern about her driving. The fatal accident occurred soon after Stanley left Dee Dee\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In response to the submissions by defendants Jack\u2019s and Martel\u2019s, plaintiffs submitted copies of a town police accident report and a New York State Police Crime Laboratory report indicating that Stanley had a blood alcohol level of 0.26% and a 0.33% level in her urine when she died. Additionally, plaintiff submitted an affidavit by a Dr. Thomas Oram, a forensic pathologist employed as a medical examiner for Schenectady County. Oram\u2019s affidavit, which relied on the toxicology report, asserted that, given Stanley\u2019s blood alcohol count at the time of the accident and given the normalcy of her liver and other organs, she would have had \"a substantial amount of alcohol \u2014 approximately 0.15 or more percent blood alcohol by weight \u2014 four to five hours prior thereto.\u201d Further, \"it would be * * * physically impossible * * * for there to be 0.33 percent alcohol in the urine if Nancy Stanley first became intoxicated in Dee Dee\u2019s, where she was reported to be approximately only one hour prior to the accident.\u201d Consequently, Dr. Oram opined, she \"had to have been intoxicated prior to the time that she reportedly arrived at Dee Dee\u2019s Tavern\u201d and, more precisely, she \"had to have been intoxicated, and have a blood alcohol level of substantially above the legal limit * * * (0.10 percent in the blood by weight) both during the time period that she is reported to have been at Jack\u2019s * * * and during the time period that she is reported to have been at Martel\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">It was Dr. Oram\u2019s opinion \"to a reasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d that \"Stanley would have and did show visible signs of intoxication while she was both at Jack\u2019s Restaurant, and at Martel\u2019s Bar.\u201d Specifically, she would have had \"gaze nystagmus, * * * an inability to control the focus and gaze of the eye * * *[, a] phenomenon * * * which develops at intoxication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>levels of approximately 0.10, and is very noticeable to the trained eye when a person has a blood alcohol level of approximately 0.13.\u201d Further, while she was at Jack\u2019s and Martel\u2019s, Stanley would have had glassy eyes, motor impairment, and difficulty speaking and controlling the level of her voice, \"all signs that a trained bar tender could and should * * * recognize as physical sign[s] of intoxication.\u201d Although it provided some information about the manner in which alcohol is metabolized, Dr. Oram\u2019s affidavit did not refer to the scientific or personal professional basis for his conclusions about Stanley\u2019s blood alcohol count while she was at Jack\u2019s and Martel\u2019s or for his assertions about how she must have looked and acted at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Having reviewed the parties\u2019 submissions, Supreme Court denied the motions for summary judgment, noting that there were issues of fact regarding Stanley\u2019s state of intoxication when she was served at defendants\u2019 bars. On appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed. The three-Justice majority rejected as \"too constrictive\u201d defendants\u2019 argument that the Oram affidavit was insufficient to establish Stanley\u2019s \"visible intoxication\u201d because it was based on Stanley\u2019s blood alcohol content rather than on eyewitness observations (220 AD2d 5, 7-8). The Appellate Division subsequently granted defendants leave to take a further appeal to this Court, certifying the following question: \"Did this court err, as a matter of law, in affirming the order of Supreme Court denying motions by defendants Martel\u2019s of Broadway, Inc. and Jack\u2019s Oyster House, Inc. for summary judgment dismissing the complaint against them?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Dram Shop Act cause of action against defendants rests on the premise that they \"unlawfully\u201d sold alcoholic beverages to Stanley, a \"visibly intoxicated person,\u201d in violation of Alcoholic Beverage Control Law \u00a7 65 (2) (see, General Obligations Law \u00a7 11-101 [1]). As currently drafted, section 65 (2) is designed to \"ensure that alcoholic beverage licensees have sufficient notice of a customer\u2019s condition before they can be subject to a potential loss of their license or to civil liability * * * for injuries subsequently caused by the intoxicated person\u201d (Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, 1986 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 3194; <em>see, </em>L 1986, ch 750). The \"visibly intoxicated\u201d standard was specifically crafted to limit the tavern keeper\u2019s exposure and to preclude the imposition of a regulatory or monetary penalty when \"he or she had no reasonable basis for knowing that the consumer was intoxicated\u201d (Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, <em>op. cit.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Relying on the statutory language and goal, defendants contend that plaintiffs\u2019 submissions were necessarily deficient because there was no eyewitness proof that Stanley had exhibited signs of intoxication at the time she was served in their establishments. The Legislature\u2019s use of the term \"visible,\u201d however, does not create a rigid requirement that that essential element of the claim be established by direct proof in the form of testimonial evidence from someone who actually observed the allegedly intoxicated person\u2019s demeanor at the time and place that the alcohol was served. To the contrary, as was recognized at the time section 65 (2) was amended, the statutory language \"[does] not preclude the introduction of circumstantial evidence to establish the visible intoxication of the customer\u201d (Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, <em>op. cit., </em>at 3194).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The foregoing leads to the second question raised by defendants\u2019 appeal: the nature and quality of the circumstantial proof that will suffice to establish the \"visibly intoxicated\u201d element of the claim. In cases involving substance abuse, blood and urine tests are the most common source of circumstantial proof. Blood alcohol tests are often administered when alcohol-induced intoxication is suspected <em>(see, </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194), and, indeed, our statutory scheme for penalizing drunk driving utilizes a blood alcohol count of .10 % or higher as a benchmark for per se intoxication <em>(see, </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 [2]). Further, at least one court has held that a high blood alcohol level is some evidence of an individual\u2019s intoxicated condition <em>(Johnson v Plotkin, </em>172 AD2d 88, <em>Iv dismissed </em>79 NY2d 977).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Proof of a high blood alcohol count alone, however, generally does not establish the \"visible\u201d intoxication that Alcoholic Beverage Control Law \u00a7 65 (2) requires. First, permitting blood and urine alcohol content <em>to </em>serve as an automatic substitute for perceptible intoxication would run counter to the legislative goal of requiring an innkeeper\u2019s actual knowledge or notice of the customer\u2019s condition as a predicate for an \"unlawful\u201d sale. Second, it is well known that the effects of alcohol consumption \"may differ greatly from person to person\u201d <em>(Burnell v La Fountain, </em>6 AD2d 586, 590) and that tolerance for alcohol is subject to wide individual variation <em>(People v Cruz, </em>48 NY2d 419, 426). Thus, even where it can be established,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> a high blood alcohol count in the person served may not provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>a sound basis for drawing inferences about the individual\u2019s appearance or demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In this case, the proof offered to bridge this evidentiary and logical gap was an expert\u2019s affidavit asserting that in view of Stanley\u2019s blood alcohol level when she was served at Jack\u2019s and Martel\u2019s, she necessarily must have exhibited the symptoms of intoxication that are familiar to trained bartenders: gaze nystagmus, glassy eyes, motor impairment and difficulties in controlling her speech and voice levels. The problem with this proffered proof was not that it was based on laboratory tests, but rather that the expert\u2019s ultimate conclusions were both speculative and conclusory. As this Court has previously stated, \" '[w]here the expert states his conclusion unencumbered by any trace of facts or data, [the] testimony should be given no probative force whatsoever\u2019 \u201d <em>(Amatulli v Delhi Constr. Corp., </em>77 NY2d 525, 533-534, n 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Here, although the underlying facts on which plaintiffs\u2019 expert based his opinion \u2014 i.e., Stanley\u2019s blood and urine alcohol counts and her physical characteristics \u2014 were set forth in detail <em>(see, e.g., People v Samuels, </em>302 NY 163; <em>see generally, </em>5 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac \u00b6 4515.03, at 45-429 to 45-437; <em>cf., Costa v 1648 Second Ave. Rest., </em>221 AD2d 299, 300), there was nothing in the expert\u2019s affidavit at all from which the validity of its ultimate conclusions about Stanley\u2019s appearance on the evening of the accident could be inferred. While the technical or scientific basis for a testifying expert\u2019s conclusions ordinarily need not be adduced as part of the proponent\u2019s direct case <em>(see, e.g., Tarlowe v Metropolitan Ski Slopes, </em>28 NY2d 410, 414; <em>People v Crossland, </em>9 NY2d 464; <em>Christie\u2019s [Intl.] v Gugliarda, </em>65 AD2d 714, 715; <em>Horn v State of New York, </em>45 AD2d 799, 800; 5 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, <em>op. cit., </em>at 45-437), an expert\u2019s affidavit proffered as the sole evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>defeat summary judgment must contain sufficient allegations to demonstrate that the conclusions it contains are more than mere speculation and would, if offered alone at trial,' support a verdict in the proponent\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In some situations, the nature of the subject matter or the expert\u2019s area of special skill will suffice to support the inference that the opinion is based on knowledge acquired through personal professional experience. In other situations, an expert\u2019s affidavit may be deemed sufficiently probative to defeat summary judgment if it makes reference to outside material \" 'of a kind accepted in the profession as reliable in forming a professional opinion\u2019 \u201d and such reference is accompanied by evidence establishing the out-of-court material\u2019s reliability <em>(Hambsch v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>63 NY2d 723, 726).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Here, the personal professional background of plaintiffs\u2019 expert \u2014 a clinical forensic pathologist whose specialty is the performance of autopsies \u2014 is not alone sufficient to lend credence to his opinions, since individuals in his field are not ordinarily called upon to make judgments about the manifestations of intoxication in live individuals. Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s affidavit was devoid of any reference to a foundational scientific basis for its conclusions. No reference was made either to Dr. Oram\u2019s own personal knowledge acquired through his practice or to studies or to other literature that might have provided the technical support for the opinion he expressed. Thus, Dr. Oram\u2019s affidavit had no probative force and was not by itself sufficient to defeat these defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment <em>(see, Caton v Doug Urban Constr. Co., </em>65 NY2d 909, 911; <em>Fallon v Hannay &amp; Son, </em>153 AD2d 95, 101-102).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, the appealing defendants\u2019 respective motions for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and all cross claims against them granted and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\"> There is often a considerable gap between the time the alcohol is served and the time that the blood and urine tests are administered. In recognition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>of this problem, some courts have accepted expert \"relation-back\u201d testimony, in which a forensic specialist with appropriate training uses the individual\u2019s tested blood alcohol levels and personal physical characteristics as the bases for extrapolating what that individual\u2019s blood alcohol level must have been at an earlier time <em>(see, e.g., People v Ladd, </em>224 AD2d 881, 882, <em>affd on other grounds </em>89 NY2d 893; <em>People v MacDonald, </em>227 AD2d 672, <em>affd on other grounds </em>89 NY2d 908). The propriety of such testimony was challenged in <em>People v Ladd </em>(89 NY2d 893, <em>supra) </em>and <em>People v MacDonald </em>(89 NY2d 908, <em>supra), </em>but we did not reach the issue because it had not been properly preserved in either case. In the present case, defendants Jack\u2019s and Martel\u2019s have not questioned the reliability or scientific accuracy of Dr. Oram\u2019s \"relation-back\u201d conclusions about Stanley\u2019s blood alcohol level at the time she was served in their establishments. Thus, as in <em>Ladd </em>and <em>MacDonald, </em>we do not reach the question of the admissibility of such evidence here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
