Both plaintiffs and defendant resided in York, Pennsylvania, where the former conducted the business of bankers and brokers. The plaintiffs bought and sold on orders of the defendant, who deposited from time to time, a margin, or loft certain profits as they accrued, with the plaintiffs to cover and protect them in the fluctuations of prices. The plaintiffs made their negotiations in the markets of New York, Baltimore, Chicago, and Philadelphia. The defendant failing to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>up his margins, the plaintiffs'sold some stocks credited to him,, and sued for the balance still required for their reimbursement. The defendant pleaded specially that by the law of Pennsylvania, where the contracts were made and to be performed, they were all gambling transactions and void, as the real intent of the parties was to wager on, and speculate in the rise or fall of the prices of the articles dealt in, which were not to be actually delivered, but the one party was to pay and the other party to accept the differences between the contract prices and the market prices of the-same at the dates fixed for executing said contracts, or when said contracts should be closed.

That although the plaintiffs may have acted merely as defendant\u2019s broker in negotiating the contracts, and were suing not on the contracts, themselves, but for services performed and money advanced for the defendant, they stood in the same position as if seeking to enforce the original agreement, and could not recover for services rendered or losses incurred by themselves in forwarding the transaction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b310-7\">3rd.

That if the jury shall find from the evidence, that the defendant deposited with the plaintiffs, as margins for the stock and grain transactions mentioned.-in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill of particulars, the sum of about seventeen hundred and fifty dollars, and that the stock and grain transactions aggregated the sum of upwards of eight hundred thousand dollars, this fact of itself is strong evidence to show the nature and character of the dealings between the plaintiffs and defendant, and the intention of tlie parties ; and if they further find the other testimony of the plaintiffs and defendant as to the question of intention to be in <em>equilibris, </em>then the large disproportion between the \u25a0amount of money deposited as margins, and the aggregate \u25a0amount of the transactions, is in itself sufficient to incline the scales in favor of the defendant as to the question of intention as to all the disputed transactions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">The Court ( Stewart, J.) granted the plaintiffs\u2019 prayers \u25a0and motions, and rejected the prayers of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-7\">The defendant excepted, and the v\u00e9rdict and judgment being against him, he appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b318-8\">The cause was argued before Alvey, C.

But these implied contracts arose at York, the place where the orders were given, and hence recovery is sought to be had on Pennsylvania contracts. But \u201c it is an universal principle, governing the tribunals of all civilized nations, that the <em>lex loci contractus </em>controls the nature, construction and validity of the contract.\u201d <em>Trasher vs. Everhart, 3 G. &amp; J., </em>234.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-5\">If valid by the law of the place whore made, the contract is valid everywhere ; if void or illegal by the law of the place of contract, it is held void and illegal everywhere. <em>Story on the Conflict of Laws, secs. </em>242, 243; <em>DeSobry vs. DeLaistre, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>193, 221, 228; <em>B. &amp; O.

For, \u201cwhere the validity of a contract, made in one State, and in violation of the law of that State, is the subject of inquiry in the Courts of another State, the decisions of the Courts of such first State \u2022ought to be respected and followed.\u201d <em>Moore vs. Clopton, </em>22 <em>Ark., </em>125.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">It was not for the Court below to determine whether the law announced in the cases mentioned is <em>bad law, </em>but whether it is Pennsylvania law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-8\">The transactions were governed by the law of Pennsylvania, and by the law of that State the plaintiffs could not recover. The fact that suit was brought in Maryland and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>\u25a0process served on the defendant while he chanced to be-in Baltimore, is the best proof of what the plaintiffs themselves thought of their rights to recover in the Courts of Pennsylvania. See <em>Brua\u2019s Appeal, </em>55 <em>Pa. St., </em>294; <em>Smith vs. Bouvier, </em>70 <em>Pa. St., </em>325 ; <em>Kirkpatrick vs. Bonsall, </em>72 <em>Pa.

St., </em>250.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-5\">The last case on the subject is <em>Patterson\u2019s Appeal, </em>decided in 1883, and reported in 13 <em>Weekly Notes of Gases,. </em>page 154, in which <em>Fareira vs. Gabell, </em>is followed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-6\">The view taken by the Pennsylvania Courts has been denominated unique, but- . until reversed, it is the law of Pennsylvania nevertheless. It is admitted by Biddle, in his very able treatise on <em>Stockbrokers, page </em>308, that these cases are sufficient to settle a question of law; and while expressing a doubt as to whether they will be recognized as authority outside of Pennsylvania, admits that they declare the law of the State at present. Contrary, however,, to the view taken by Biddle, the principle announced in <em>Ruchizky vs. DeHaven, </em>97 <em>Pa. St., </em>202, has since been followed in <em>Flagg vs. Baldwin, </em>38 <em>N. J. Eq., </em>219, and <em>Cobb vs. Prell, </em>22 <em>Amer. Law Reg., </em>609. See also, dissenting opinion of Justice Woodruff', in <em>Markham vs. Jaudon, </em>41 <em>N. Y., </em>256 ; and the rule established in <em>Fareira vs. Gabell, </em>which has been followed by the Supreme Court of the United States, and by many of the ablest Courts of this-country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-7\">It is conceded that a contract for the sale of goods to be-delivered at a future day is valid, even though the seller-has not the goods, nor any other means of getting them blit to go into the market to buy them. <em>Benjamin on Sales, sec. </em>82. A short sale may, therefore, be valid. <em>Appleman vs. Fisher, </em>34 <em>Md., </em>540 ; <em>Maxton vs. Gheen, </em>75 <em>Pa. St., </em>166.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-8\">But such a contract is only valid where the parties-really intend and agree that the goods are to be deliyered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>by tbe seller, and the price to be paid by the buyer. If, under guise of such a contract, the real intent be merely to speculate in the rise or fall of prices, and the goods are not to be delivered, but one party is to pay to the other the difference between the contract price and the market price of the goods at the date fixed for executing the contract, then the whole transaction constitutes nothing more than a wager, and is illegal and void. All the cases concede, and many expressly decide this point. <em>Benjamin on Sales, sec. </em>542; <em>Grizeioood vs. Blane, </em>11 <em>C. B., </em>536; <em>Irwin vs. Williar, </em>110 <em>U.

Do they intend an actual <em>bona fide </em>sale, or a mere wager ? If the former be intended, the contract is legal; if the latter, it is illegal and void. What was the intention of the parties in the inception of the contract, is a question of fact for the jury to determine from all the circumstances of the case. Hence, in <em>Grizewood vs. Blane, </em>11 <em>C. B., </em>536, Jervis, C. J.,left it to the jury to say what was the plaintiff\u2019s intention and what was the defendant\u2019s intention at the time of making the contracts, whether either party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>really meant to purchase or to sell the shares in question, telling them that if they did not, the contract was, in his opinion, a mere gambling transaction, and void. This ruling was held-to be correct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-5\">It has accordingly been decided :</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-6\"><em>a. </em>That evidence of the defendant\u2019s inability to perform the contracts, known to the plaintiff, is admissible to show the real intention of the ^parties. <em>Kirkpatrick vs. </em>Bonsall, 12 <em>Pa. St., </em>155 ; <em>Ruchizky vs. DeHaven, </em>91 <em>Pa. St., </em>202 <em>Gregory vs. Wendell, </em>39 <em>Mich., </em>337.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-7\"><em>b. </em>That fire intention of the parties may be inferred from the manner and method of carrying on the business,, from the fact that \"the commodity in which the parties dealt was never tendered or demanded, from the large number of contracts which the party had on hand, and from the fact that the party dealing was not a regular' dealer in the commodity bought and sold. <em>Rumsey vs. Berry, </em>65 <em>Me., </em>510 ; <em>Gregory vs. Wendell, </em>39 <em>Mich., </em>331.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-8\">c. That the plaintiff, when testifying, may be asked,, whether or not he intended to deliver the commodity sold. <em>Gregory vs. Wendell, </em>39 <em>Mich., </em>337; <em>Yerkes vs. Salomon, </em>18 <em>N. Y. Sup. Ct., </em>471.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-9\">But it is claimed that the plaintiffs acted merely as the defendant\u2019s brokers in negotiating the contracts, and as they are suing, not on the contracts themselves, but for services performed and money advanced for the defendant, at his request, they do not stand in the same position as a party sued for the enforcement of the original agreement. It must be admitted that the English cases seem to hold to this doctrine in construing the Statute 8 and 9 <em>Vict., ch. </em>109, <em>sec. </em>18.. <em>Thacker vs. Hardy, </em>4 <em>Q. B. Div.,. </em>685 ; <em>Gooper vs. Meil, </em>21 <em>W. R., </em>159 ; <em>Read vs. Anderson, </em>48 <em>L. T. N. S., </em>14.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-10\">But these decisions proceed upon the principle that the statute renders the transactions simply void, not illegal. This appears from the language of Bindley, J., in <em>Thacker </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>vs. Hardy, supra. </em>He says: \u201cif gaming and wagering were illegal, I should be of opinion that the illegality of the transactions in which the plaintiff and defendant were engaged, would have tainted, as between them* whatever the plaintiff had done in furtherance of their illegal designs, and would have precluded him from claiming in a Court of law any indemnity from the defendant in respect of liabilties incurred.\u201d In this country, wagering transactions are generally held to be illegal and void as against public policy. <em>Irwin vs. Williar, </em>110 <em>U. S., </em>499, and cases, there cited. But even here some of the cases, while conceding that the parties to the original contracts would fail on account of the illegality of the transactions, hold that the broker can recover his commissions and advances, on the ground that he can make out his case \u201c without going into the illegal transactions.\u201d For this doctrine the leading cases of <em>Armstrong vs. Toler, </em>11 <em>Wheaton, </em>258; <em>Brooks vs. Martin, </em>2 <em>Wallace, </em>70, and <em>McBlair vs. Gibbes, </em>17 <em>Howard, </em>232, are relied upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">The principles enunciated in those cases do not apply to-the case of the broker, for the following reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-6\">1. There is a broad distinction between suits to enforce-illegal contracts and those asserting title to money arising out of them. In all of the following cases, usually cited to sustain the broker\u2019s claim, the plaintiff was only asserting title to money which was the product of the illegal transaction: <em>State vs. B. &amp; O. R. R., </em>34 <em>Md., </em>344; <em>Brooks vs. Marlin, </em>2 <em>Wallace, </em>70 ; <em>McBlair vs. Gibbes, </em>17 Howard, 232; <em>Thompson vs. Thompson, </em>7 <em>Vesey, </em>468; <em>Farmer vs. Russell, </em>1 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull., </em>296; <em>Tenant vs. Elliott, </em>1 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull, </em>3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-7\">2. If money be loaned by the plaintiff to the defendant to pay losses incurred by the defendant in illegal transactions, it may be recovered back. It is simply a case of money loaned. <em>Armstrong vs. Toler, </em>11 <em>Wheat., </em>278; <em>Petrie vs. Hanney, </em>3 <em>Term, </em>422; <em>Faikney vs. Reynous, </em>4 <em>Burr., </em>2069.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>\"Where, however, money is advanced in furtherance of \u2022an illegal transaction, the agent cannot recover from his principal the money advanced. <em>Brown vs. Turner, </em>7 <em>Term Rep., </em>630; <em>Josephs vs. Pebrer, </em>3 <em>B. &amp; C., </em>639; <em>Buck vs. Buck, </em>1 <em>Campbell, </em>547; <em>Raymond vs. Leavitt, </em>46 <em>Mich., </em>447; 1 <em>Parsons on Contracts, page </em>111; <em>Brooks vs. Martin, </em>2 <em>Wallace, </em>79.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-5\">And this-is the position of the plaintiffs in this case. They conducted the transactions for the defendant, they \"brought the parties together. It was their money, or their credit with their correspondents which enabled the \u2022defendant to speculate at all. As said in <em>Irwin vs. Williar, 1</em>10 <em>U. S., </em>499, \u201cwhere a broker is privy to a wagering contract, and brings the parties together for the very purpose of entering into the illegal agreement, he is <em>par.ticeps criminis, </em>and cannot recover for services rendered \u2022or losses incurred by himself in forwarding the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-6\">' Nearly all of the American authorities are to this effect, -as a consideration of the following cases will disclose: <em>Irwin vs. Williar, </em>110 <em>U.

Both plaintiffs and defendant resided in York, Pennsylvania, where the former conducted the business of bankers and brokers. The plaintiffs bought and sold, ostensibly at least, on orders of the defendant, who deposited from time to time or left certain profits, as they accrued, with the plaintiffs, as margins, to cover and protect them in the fluctuations of prices. These transactions extended over a period of from two to three years, and reached in the aggregate some eight hundred thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The plaintiffs made their negotiations in the markets of New York, Baltimore, Chicago and Philadelphia; the margin to be kept up by defendant, as to the transactions in the last named city being five per cent., and for the dealings in the other cities ten per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">In course of time, the defendant failing to keep up his margins, the plaintiffs sold some stocks credited to him, and sued for the alleged balance still required for their reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>In addition to'the general issue, the defendant specially pleaded that by the law of Pennsylvania, where the contracts were made and to be performed, they were all gambling transactions and void, because both parties were and still are citizens and residents of Pennsylvania; that all of said alleged contracts w.ere to be performed within said State, and were for the purchase or sale of the bonds or shares of stock of incorporated companies, or for the purchase or sale of wheat for future delivery; that neither party ever contemplated or intended to deliver or receive the said stocks or bonds or wheat, and they never were in fact delivered, nor had the plaintiffs or defendant ever the said stocks, bonds or wheat for delivery, nor did they ever intend that the other was bound to deliver the same, but that in all of said contracts, the real intent of the parties was to wager on and to speculate in the rise or fall of the price of said articles, and that the one party was to pay and the other to accept the differences between the contract prices and the market prices of the same, at the dates fixed for executing said contracts, or when said contracts should be closed, . The plaintiffs replied, traversing these averments. An agreement was made by the parties that the following decisions, viz., <em>Ruchizky vs. De Haven, </em>91 <em>Penn. St., </em>202; <em>Dickson\u2019s Ex\u2019r vs. Thomas, </em>97 <em>Penn. St., </em>218; <em>Fareira vs. Gabell, </em>89 <em>Penn. St., </em>89; <em>North vs. Phillips, </em>89 <em>Penn. St., </em>250; <em>Brua\u2019s Appeal, </em>55 <em>Penn. St., </em>294, should be read at the trial of the case as evidence of the law of Pennsylvania, and have the same effect as if proved under a commission or by the testimony of members of the bar of that State.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">There was judgment for the plaintiffs and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The testimony of the defendant, taken subject to excep- \u25a0 tion, including the Pennsylvania decisions offered under the agreement as to the alleged law of Pennsylvania, with reference to the validity of the dealings between plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>and defendant, was on motion of plaintiffs improperly ruled out as irrelevant to the issues. The six prayers of the plaintiffs were granted. All the defendant\u2019s eleven prayers were rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">'While the testimony of the plaintiffs tends to show that the dealings between them and defendant were <em>bona fide, </em>and that an actual delivery of the articles bought and sold by them for defendant, was intended, and there were actual purchases and sales made, and actual delivery to the defendant was not made because waived by him, or an equivalent under the rules of exchange was accepted by him ; the proof also shows that in the numerous transactions, there was no actual delivery but in a single instance, and the defendant testifies explicitly that \u201c it was the express understanding between him and plaintiffs that the.stocks and grain were not to be bought outright, and no delivery was to be made, but that he was simply to deal with them on margins; if the market was in his favor he would gain, if it went against him ho would lose ; that the total amount of margins put up by him, outside of mere profits from the fluctuations of the market, was 01700. lie further testified, that while the transactions carried on within his margins of five and ten per cent., aggregated 0800,000, some of the items of purchase and sale amounting to over 017,000, he was worth only $3500; that he was a lawyer by occupation, and resided next door to plaintiffs who knew him well. This and similar testimony from him, was competent to go to the jury. In cases like this, it is competent to show that although in form the contract is perfectly legal, it is in fact a mere guise under which a gambling transaction may be conducted. The true nature of a fraud upon the law and public morals could not otherwise be exposed, and the evil of wagers under the guise of a legitimate enterprise be prevented.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">This principle is well settled apart from what the law in Pennsylvania may be. <em>Grizewood vs. Blane, </em>11 <em>C. B., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>536 ; <em>Benjamin on Sales, sec. </em>542 ; <em>Irwin vs. Williar, </em>110 <em>U. S., </em>499. The plaintiffs seem to assume that if they acted, merely as defendant\u2019s broker in negotiating the contracts, and as they are suing not on the contracts themselves, but for services performed and money advanced for the defendant, they do not stand in the same position as if seeking to enforce the original agreement. But as laid down in <em>Irwin vs. Williar, 110 U. S., </em>499, <em>\u201c </em>where a broker is privy to a wagering contract, and brings the parties together for the very purpose of entering into an illegal agreement he is <em>particeps criminis, </em>and cannot recover for services rendered or losses incurred by himself in forwarding the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">As to the <em>locus </em>of the contract between the parties, the jury should have been given the law of Pennsylvania, as comprised in the decisions of that State bearing on wagering contracts within its limits. The defendant employed plaintiffs to make purchases and sales, but the settlement was to be with them in York. His name was not disclosed in any of the transactions, and the plaintiffs conducted the negotiations in their own name and upon their own credit. And the plaintiffs have declared in assumpsit on the common counts for services rendered by them. It is their relations with defendant on which the suit is based. The parties with whom they dealt are in no wise connected with the suit. According to these Pennsylvania cases, if there was such an understanding between plaintiffs and defendant, as the latter testifies to, the transactions were mere wagers, and no recovery can be had hy plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">It follows, that, defendant\u2019s second, third and seventh prayers, going to the <em>bona Jides </em>of the transactions, should have been granted instead of refused. The defendant\u2019s eighth prayer should also have been granted. This relates to the <em>lex loci contractus. </em>The law of the place where a contract is made is to be looked to im determining its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>validity and construction. <em>Trasher vs. Everhart, </em>3 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>234. As to his ninth prayer, relating to the Consolidated Gas Company stock, we think it was properly refused, no tender to the defendant being required before sale, because of the authority given plaintiffs to sell when from exhaustion of margins it was necessary for their indemnification. His tenth prayer, however, relating to the sale and re-purchase of the said stock as one and the same transaction, by plaintiffs, should have been granted, as importing bad faith, and not compatible with their relations to the defendant. Defendant\u2019s first prayer, instructing the jury there was no evidence of any purchases or sales of grain by plaintiffs or their agents, on behalf of defendant, was properly rejected. His fourth and fifth prayers, referring to the \u201cringing out\u201d process, and asking an instruction that there was no evidence that defendant knew anything of such a mode of settlement, were likewise properly refused. His eleventh prayer w also correctly refused. It would be invading the province of the jury for the Court to characterize any piece of evidence as entitled to special and controlling weight with them.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b329-8\">(Decided 14th May, 1886.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In regard to plaintiffs\u2019 prayers, with the exceptio of the first two, which, in our opinion, were improperly granted, we think, based as they are upon the assumption of <em>tona fides </em>in the transactions, they might be allowed to stand with the granting of the instructions we have indicated as due to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and new trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
