The testator died in 1884, without revoking the bequest to L., and among his papers were found sundry promissory notes and other evidences of the indebtedness of L. to him.

Phelps and John Y. L. Eindlay his executors. The estate was fully, administered, except as to that portion of it which has given rise to the present controversy. The testator bequeathed to his son, Lindley H. Maitland, the sum of six thousand dollars. This son had married, and there was fruit of the marriage the infant, Jennie Ward Maitland. The\u2019father \u25a0having deceased, Charles Wallace was appointed the guardian of the child, and as such guardian claimed the whole of the legacy left to the father. Creditors of Lindley claimed that they should be paid the amount of their bills out of his distributive share. Legatees under the will of Benjamin Maitland claimed that certain promissory notes of Lindley, given to his father and found among his effects, as also the amount of receipted bills paid by him for the funeral expenses of Lindley and of his wife, should be treated as a partial ademption or satisfaction of the legacy left to the said Lindley. On a bill filed by the executors to obtain the advice and direction of the Court as to their duty in respect of these conflicting claims, a decree was passed rejecting the claims of the creditors of Lindley, and directing that the promissory notes executed by the said Lindley, and the bills for funeral expenses of said Lindley and his wife, should be treated and considered as a partial ademption and satisfaction of the legacy to the said'Lindley from his father, and rejecting the claim of the guardian of Jennie W. Maitland to receive the amount of said promissory notes and bills for funeral expenses. From this decree the guardian appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-6\">The cause was argued before Alvey, C.

It does not involve the elements of legal obligation or <em>future liability </em>on the part of the party advanced, but it is a pure and irrevocable <em>gift, </em>and must result from a complete act of the intestate in his life-time by which he divests himself of all property in the subject. <em>Harley vs. Harley, et al., </em>57 <em>Md., </em>342.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-6\">It is entirely contrary to the character of an advancement, that it should be viewed in the light of a debt upon interest. * * * It has never been thought that it was <em>borroived capital, </em>on which interest was to accumulate. <em>Osgood vs. Breed, </em>17 <em>Mass., </em>358.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-8\">If security or note is taken for repayment, it is a debt and not an advancement. <em>Harley vs. Harley, et al., </em>57 <em>Md., </em>342-3 ; <em>High\u2019s Appeal, </em>21 <em>Pa.

L.

The will being a revocable instrument, the intention to revoke it, by the substitution of a benefit for a precedent gift, will be more readily presumed than if there had been a prior obligation on the part of the testator to the legatee, which could not be discharged without his consent. <em>In re Tussaud\u2019s Estate, L.

Indeed the earlier cases carried the presumption so far as to turn a partial satisfaction into a complete ademption of the legacy. <em>Ex parte Pye, </em>18 <em>Ves., </em>140; 1 <em>Pom.

Does the accident of his death occurring before that of his father, defeat not only claims of creditors, but also the claim of the estate itself from which the legacy is derived? Such a construction would be grossly inequitable, and could only be sustained by language too clear for doubt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-6\">The Acf of 1810, chapter 34, transfers the right, estate and interest, in the property mentioned in the devise or bequest, <em>as if such </em>devisee or legatee had survived the testator. <em>Sec. </em>304 <em>of Art. </em>93 <em>of the Code.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-7\">The object of the law was to point out the persons who should take, and this is done by the words \u201c as if the legatee had survived the testator.\u201d <em>Glenn vs. Belt, </em>7 <em>G.&amp; J., </em>366.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-8\">In other words, the next of kin of Lindley, or his person\u00e1l representatives, take through him as if he had survived the testator and then died before distribution was made under the Act of 1198, ch. 101.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-9\">If this is the true construction, then, by the very terms of that Act, they must take Lindley\u2019s share, less by what he received. \u00bb</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b178-10\">Robinson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ajs\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">This is a question in regard to ademption or satisfaction of a legacy. The testator gave to his son, Lindley, a legacy of six thousand dollars, and to each of his other children he also gave legacies, except Burgwyn, who had received already, the testator says, more than his share of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The will was made in 1879, and Lindley died in 1883, in the life-time of his father, leaving a daughter, the appellant, his only child and heir-at-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The testator died in 1884, without revoking the bequest to Lindley, and among his papers were found three promissory notes of Lindley, dated February 10th, April 26th, and July 20th, 1882, respectively, amounting in the aggregate to two thousand dollars \u2014 also a promissory note dated August 2nd, 1880, for $187.30 \u2014 also accounts of the funeral expenses of both Lindley and his wife, all of which were paid by the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">These notes and accounts it is contended, are to be considered as an ademption or satisfaction <em>pro tanto </em>of the legacy to Lindley.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The law in regard to the ademption of legacies is quite Avell settled, and the only difficulty lies in its application to the facts of each particular case. Where a father gives a legacy to a child without stating any particular purpose for which it is given, the legacy is in itself regarded as a portion of the estate intended for such child. And if the testator afterwards makes an advancement to such child on his marriage or upon going into business, the money thus advanced Avill be presumed to be in payment or satisfaction of the legacy, either <em>pro tanto </em>or in full, as the money advanced may be equal to or less than the legacy. This presumption is founded on the equitable principle that a father in making a distribution of his property by will among his children, means to give to each the amount which he ought to have, in vieAv of the claims of all upon his bounty; and if he afterwards deems it proper to make an ad\\Tancement to one or more of them, the amount thus advanced ought to be deducted from the portion of the child benefited. It is a rule adopted by Courts of equity to prevent a child from getting a double portion, an inequality which it is but fair to presume the testator did not intend. <em>Shudal vs. </em>Jekyll, 2 <em>Atk., </em>518; <em>Ex parte Pye, </em>18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>Ves., </em>150; <em>Suisse vs. Lowther, </em>2 <em>Hare, </em>424; <em>Pym </em>vs. <em>Lockyer, </em>5 <em>My. &amp; Cr., </em>34; <em>Kirk vs. Eddowes, </em>3 <em>Hare,. </em>509; <em>Hopwood vs. Hopwood, </em>7 <em>House of Lords\u2019 Cases, </em>726.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">And if the money is advanced or paid by the father under such circumstances as not to raise a presumption of satisfaction of the legacy, parol evidence may be offered to. show that such was his intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Now in this case the three promissory notes, amounting to two thousand dollars, are \u25a0 ordinary, promissory notes, and upon their face import merely an indebtedness on the part of Lindley to the testator. But the proof shows they were given for money advanced by his father for the purpose of setting' him, Lindley, up in business, and further* that the money thus advanced was intended by the father* and so understood by Lindley, to be in part payment of the legacy. And this being so, the amount of these notes, must be deducted from the legacy. As to the note, however, dated August 2nd, 1880, for $187.30, there is nothing on its face-, nor is there a particle of proof, to show that it was given for money advanced on account of the legacy. It bears date eighteen months before Lindley started in business, and in the absence of proof to the contrary it must be regarded merely as a debt due by him to. his father. And so as to the accounts for the funeral expenses of Lindley and his wife. These accounts were paid, it is true, by the testator, but the evidence does not show that they were paid by him on account or in part satisfaction of the legacy! Mrs. Du Bois says, it was her father\u2019s intention to deduct them from the legacy \u2014 that he often spoke about it. But what he said, and at what time the declarations were made, does not appear. And besides, upon cross-examination, her father, she said, always expected to be paid the amount advanced by him in pay- ' ment of the funeral expenses. If this be so \u2014 if he considered it an indebtedness and not a gift, the payment by him would not operate as an ademption <em>pro tanto.o\u00ed </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>legacy. Eor the distinction between a loan and a gift is the right reserved by the father to demand payment of the money \u2014 if this right be reserved, it is a loan and not a gift. <em>Harley vs. Harley, el al., </em>47 <em>Md., </em>340.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b181-11\">(Decided 10th March, 1880.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Bindley having died in the life-time of the testator, the legacy to him did not, by operation of the Code, <em>lapse, </em>but passed directly to his daughter. <em>Art. </em>93, <em>sec. </em>304. It constituted no part of the assets in the hands of his executor or administrator. His daughter took it by force of the statute. This was expressly decided in <em>Glenn vs. Belt, </em>7 <em>G.&amp; J, </em>360 : \u201cThe time of the transfer,\u201d says the Court in that case, \u201cis the death of the testator, and as the legatee died before the testator he would not be the person meant as the object of the statutory transfer. But the law refers to such persons then <em>in esse, </em>entitled by law to the distribution of the legatee\u2019s estate in case of intestacy \u2014 that is, his representatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">So here, the legatee having died in the life-time of the testator, the daughter of the legatee takes the legacy directly from the testator. She takes unaffected by the debts of her father, the deceased legatee. His creditors have no right to claim the payment of their debts out of such a legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Eor these reasons the decree below will be affirmed in part, and reversed in part, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed in part, and reversed in part, and cause remanded,.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
