J., Irving and Bryan, J., and Yellott, Miller, Robinson, and Ritchie, \u25a0J., participated in the decision.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-11\"><em>Edward </em>Stake,, and <em>Howard Bryant, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-12\"><em>\u201c </em>Issue,\u201d as used in this devise, means children, and is a word of purchase and not of limitation, judging by the intent and purpose of the testatrix gathered from the whole context of the will. Since the term issue may be employed either as a word of purchase or of limitation as will best effectuate the testatrix\u2019s intention, and it is much more flexible tlxan the words \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d Courts more readily interpret the word issue as the synonym of children, \u00e1nd as a mere description of the person or persons to take, than they do the words heirs of the body. The word issue is not <em>ex vi termini </em>within the rule in <em>Shelley\u2019s Case.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-13\">This Court has said, that the rule in <em>Shelley\u2019s Case </em>does not apply where the limitation is to the individuals of the family of the person to whom the life estate is given as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>sons or children; and if issue in this case means the sons or children of Elijah, and that they should take the estate before Samuel, as suggested by the case of <em>Dickson vs. Satterfield, et al., </em>(53 <em>Md., </em>320,) still the rule cannot apply, and for this reason the case is not applicable to this devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-5\">As a word of limitation, issue is collective, and signifies all the descendants in all generations, but as a word of purchase, it denotes the particular person or class of persons to take under the devise. In order for the rule to apply, which is, \u201c if a devise be to one for life, and afterwards in the same instrument there is a limitation either immediately or mediately to his heirs generally, or heirs of his body, he takes an estate in fee-simple or fee-tail in possession in the one case and in remainder in the other; \u201d there must be a limitation to the ancestor\u2019s heirs generally, or heirs of his body, but it will be observed in the first item of the devise, there is no estate limited or given -to the issue whatever, and thus the words, \u201cif he dies without issue,\u201d simply explain what estate Elijah took.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-6\">It cannot be reasonable to suppose that the testator intended to'give Elijah a fee, which, with his consent,, could be sold, and if he had children, thus cut them off and transfer the estate out of the family, and avray from his brother Samuel, and if Elijah left no issue, defeat the rest of the scheme of the will, which was, that the farm was to go to his brother Samuel in fee. <em>Fulton, et al. vs. Hainan, et al., </em>44 <em>Md., </em>263; <em>Timanus, et al. vs. Dugan, et al., </em>46 <em>Md., </em>415; <em>Lyles vs. Digges, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>313; <em>Daniel vs. Whartenby, </em>17 <em>Wall., </em>646; <em>Doe vs. Colyear, </em>11 <em>East, </em>548.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-7\"><em>Edwin H.

By the second clause thereof she devises as follows: \u201cI give and bequeath unto Elijah Comegys, the oldest son of Samuel Comegys, my farm where Zachariah Rolph now lives, together with fifteen acres of woodland to be laid off on the north of the public road; if he dies without issue, then I give and bequeath the same to his. brother, Samuel Comegys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The appellee claims, by virtue of a series of alienations and conveyances, from Elijah Comegys. The appellant claims as an heir-at-law of Samuel Comegys, to whom the farm was given in the event of. Elijah Comegys dying without issue, which, it is admitted, is the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">This will took effect prior to the passage of the Act of 1862, ch. 161, and must therefore be construed with reference to the law as it existed <em>token </em>the will took effect. <em>James vs. </em>Rowland, 52 Md., 466; <em>Estep &amp; Shaw vs. Mackey, et al., </em>52 <em>Md., </em>596; <em>Woollen, Trustee vs. Frick &amp; Golder, Ex\u2019rs, </em>38 <em>Md., </em>437. Construing it without the -aid of that Act, the judgment of the Court below must be affirmed. The devise is to Elijah Comegys, and \u201cif he dies without issue,\u201d then over. In <em>Woolen\u2019s Case, </em>above -cited, this Court says, \u201c these words, according to their settled legal construction, import a general or indefinite failure of issue, and whenever found in a will must be taken in their technical sense, unless there be something clearly demonstrating a different intention on the part of the testator, restricting them to a definite failure of issue, \u25a0or failure of issue at the death of the first taker; \u201d and the learned Judge adds, that authorities need not be cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>for a rule of construction so familiar and well established as this/\u2019 The same rule was followed in <em>Dickson vs. Satterfield,, </em>53 <em>Md., </em>320; and was approved quite as emphatically in <em>Estep &amp; Shaw vs. Mackey, et al., </em>52 <em>Md., </em>600. Applying that rule it is clear, that the first taker took the fee, and the devise over was void, because the contingency was too remote. We find nothing in the will outside of this clause to aid us in construing it, or which rescues it from the operation of the technical rule, which, in the absence of clearly expressed intention to the contrary, must control. Neither of the devisees mentioned in this clause are again mentioned in the will,- therefore we can gather nothing further respecting the intentions of the testator as to them, than is disclosed in this clause; and there is certainly nothing in it which can prevent the devise over from failing.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b341-6\">(Decided 27th May, 1886.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
