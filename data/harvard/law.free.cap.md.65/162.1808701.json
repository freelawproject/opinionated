That if the jury shall find from the evidence in this cause that the plaintiffs effected the policy of insurance offered in evidence, and shall further find that after the execution and delivery of the said policy, the oil clothing mentioned therein, and in the sundry entries in the book attached to the said policy, or any part of the said oil clothing, was, during the month of October, after the 23rd day of the month, and during the months of November or December, in the year 1883, damaged by fire or fires, and the notice of said loss or losses was communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendant, with due and reasonable diligence on their part, after the said damage had been sustained, and that proofs of loss were furnished the defendant by the plaintiff's, and that the same were furnished with reasonable diligence after the fire, and that the defendant has not paid the said loss, nor any portion thereof, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>that the amount of said loss from fire, in the case of each shipment entered in the said book, and so damaged by fire, was in excess of twenty per cent, of the value of the same, then their verdict must be for th'e plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-5\">2. That if the jury shall find the facts as set forth \"in the plaintiffs\u2019 first prayer, then their verdict shall be for such proportion of the loss or damage sustained by the plaintiffs on such of the shipments entered in the boob, attached to the policy of insurance offered in evidence, as were so damaged by fire, not exceeding the amount of insurance on each, as the amount underwritten in each case bears to the whole amount at risk in each case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">3. That the jury may, in their discretion, allow interest upon the amount of their verdict, accounting the same from a date sixty days after the proofs of loss were furnished the agents of the company, as testified to by Louis Adler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">4. That the defendant in taking a risk like the present, upon oil cloth clothing, is presumed to know, and to have contemplated all the casualties and incidents to which the subject insured might be liable, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, provided they find the facts to be as set forth in the first prayer of the plaintiffs, even should the jury find that the loss proceeded from spontaneous combustion; should the jury further find that spontaneous combustion is one of the casualties and incidents to which the subject insured is liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">The defendant then submitted to the Court the following instructions, which, it asked, should be given to the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-9\">1. That the plaintiffs under the pleadings in this case cannot recover, if the jury shall find from the testimony that the oil cloth coats, called \u201cFlickers,\u201d shipped by the plaintiffs to their consignees in Louisiana and Texas, were damaged or destroyed from spontaneous combustion caused by their inherent infirmity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>2. That it is competent for the jury to find from the testimony in this case, to what extent the oil cloth coats were damaged, and what loss the plaintiffs suffered by such damage, should they, under the instructions of the Court, find a verdict for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\">The Court (Fisher, J.,) granted the prayers of the plaintiffs, as also the second prayer of the defendant, but rejected the defendant\u2019s first prayer.

Let these appellees show, if they can, by the record, that a peril covered by our policy was the proximate cause of the loss. But there can be no question, looking to the testimony, that this loss was caused by the inherent infirmity \u2014 the perishable nature, of the subject, and that when this policy was effected the appellant was not aware \u201c that spontaneous combustion was one of the casualties and incidents to which the subject insured was liable \u201d\u2014 and from the testimony of the assured could not be presumed to know it. <em>Emerigon, ch.

They insured this clothing before shipment in the office of the defendant company. The clothing was packed in boxes, and on its arrival at its destination, it was found injured and comparatively worth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>less, either by spontaneous combustion or by some chemical action arising from the material in the goods themselves. They all presented the appearance of having been burned or charred within the boxes. The clothing was' not injured by any external force or accident, but whatever the injury was, it was the result of the inherent in-, firmity of the goods themselves. Neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants knew at the time the insurance was effected, that the goods were liable to spontaneous combustion, or to be injured by any inherent defect in the goods. No extra premium to cover such risk was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Under these circumstances, the defendants claim that by the general principles of insurance law, they are not liable for a loss by spontaneous combustion, caused by the inherent infirmity of the goods themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">This was a marine policy, and one of the dangers insured against, by the terms of the policy, was fire. But while this is undoubtedly so, the question remains, and is still undecided in this State, whether the term \u201c fire \u201d used in the ordinary marine policy will, upon general principles, cover the case of spontaueous combustion, caused by an inherent infirmity in the article insured, and not the result of accident or peril of the sea. There is no doubt of the liability of the defendant company, under its policy, had the ship taken fire, and the goods been consumed ; or had the fire originated from any of the perils insured against; but the question is a very different one, when, as in this case, the goods are in good faith insured, and believed both by plaintiffs and defendant, not to be liable to spontaneous combustion by reason of their inherent infirmity, but which in fact were so liable, and were so injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The authorities are few upon this subject, and neither full nor satisfactory. One of the oldest to which we have access is <em>Emerigon, </em>who says, page 290 :</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u201cArt. 12 of another title establishes, as a general rule, that everything which happens through the <em>inherent vice </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number><em>of the thing, </em>or by tlxe act of the owners, master or merchant shipper, shall not be reputed a peril, if not otherwise borne on the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">It is then certain that the insurers never answer for damages and losses which happen directly through the act or fault of the assured himself. It would be in fact intolerable that the assured should be indemnified by others, for a loss of which he is the author. This rule is grounded on first principles. It is a general rule, from which it is not permitted to derogate by a contrary agreement. As <em>Pothier </em>remarks, \u201cit is evident that I cannot validly agree with any one, that he shall charge himself with the faults that I shall commit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We do not understand this learned author to mean, that an article may not be insured that is inherently liable to spontaneous combustion, or decay, <em>provided it is so expressed in the policy, </em>but not otherwise. But if the loss happens through <em>the fault of the assured, </em>then the insurers are not liable, whatever may be the terms of the policy. For example, if an article is insured, which <em>when dry </em>is not liable to spontaneous combustion, but when he puts it on board, <em>it is wei, </em>in such case no recovery can be had. Such we understand to be the views of this author.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The next case to which we are referred, is the case of <em>Boyd vs. Dubois, </em>3 <em>Campbell. </em>In that case Lord Eelenborougk said, \u201c If the hemp was put on board in a state liable to effervesce, and it did effervesce, and generate the fire which consumed it, upon the common principles of insurance law, the assured cannot recover for a loss which he himself lias occasioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The defendant in that case attempted to prove that the hemp, which was insured, was put aboard ship in a <em>damaged </em>condition; and for that reason, was apt to ferment and take fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">This case is in accord with <em>Emerigon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">The next authority, is <em>Parsons on Contracts, </em>2 <em>vol., page </em>374, <em>6th edition. </em>The author therein says:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>\u201cIt is another rule, that insurers are not liable for property destroyed by the effect of its own <em>inherent deficiencies or tendencies, </em>unless these tendencies are made active and destructive, by a peril insured against. Thus, if hemp, which was dry when laden, be afterwards wet by a peril of the sea, and by reason of such wet ferments, or rots, or burns, the insurers would be liable.\u201d And that very learned author refers to both <em>Emerigon </em>and the case of <em>Boyd &amp; Dubois </em>as his authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Chancellor Kent also takes a similar view, in his <em>Commentaries, </em>3 <em>Volume, ch. </em>48.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\"><em>Phillips on Insurance, ch. </em>13, <em>marginal page, </em>says:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u201c It is a general rule that insurers are not, under the common form of the policy, liable to any damage or loss arising from the qualities or defects of the subject insured, since these are not among the perils assumed by the underwriter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\"><em>Parsons on the Law of Marine Insurance, vol. </em>2, <em>page </em>216, holds the same view. He says :</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\u201cIt is also a rule, that the insurers are liable for no subject-matter of insurance, which is destroyed by reason of its own inherent defects or tendencies. But this rule does not apply to tendencies which are called into activity only by a peril insured against. Thus, if hemp insured, burns up, or rots from spontaneous ignition or fermentation, it being known that this may happen, if the \u2019 hemp be damp, but not if it be dry, the question would be, whether it was damp or dry, when it was put on board. But if the hemp were dry when laden, and was afterwards wet by reason of the straining of the ship in a storm, or by the shipping of a sea, or any like peril, then the insurers, whether on ship or cargo, would be liable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">All these authorities refer to <em>Emerigon </em>and the case in 3 <em>Campbell, </em>and are all upon marine insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">On the other hand, we have been referred to the case of <em>The British American Insurance Co. vs. Joseph, </em>de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>cided in the Court of Appeals for Lower Canada, which has been supposed to decide that a fire insurance (not marine) covers the risk of spontaneous combustion; and citing that case only, Mr. <em>May, </em>in liis <em>Work on Fire Insurance, </em>comes to the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The <em>Lower Ganada </em>case is certainly very imperfectly reported. The report is in French, and the Court gave no opinion; the terms of the policy are not set out, and but a very few of the facts in the case. It is by no means clear, from the few facts that are stated, that the spontaneous combustion did not originate in a heap of <em>uninsured </em>coal, and extend from that to the insured coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">But suppose the case has all the effect claimed for it, by the appellees, and does decide that in a purely fire insurance, the risk of spontaneous combustion is covered, we could not agree that it should overrule the long list of high authorities to the contrary in marine policies. More especially since the reasons to the contrary, we think, are satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">No well managed insurance company would take a marine risk, on an article inherently liable to spontaneous combustion; nor would any prudent shipmaster or owner receive such on his vessel, as not merely the property so insured, but the property of others, and the safety of the ship, and the lives of the crew, would be endangered by so doing. It would, as <em>Fmerigon </em>says, be intolerable that the owner should receive pay for goods, that destroyed themselves. The object of a marine policy is to insure against the perils of the sea, and not against the perils incident to the goods themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">In this case it is very clear that the goods wore injured by their own inherent infirmity, and that such inherent infirmity was not called into activity by any peril insured against. We think such loss was not within the contemplation of either party to the contract of insurance. That the term, <em>\u201c </em>fire,\u201d used in the policy, included fire from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>accident, or brought about by a peril of the sea, and not spontaneous combustion.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b190-8\">(Decided 11th March, 1886.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Entertaining these views, we think, the Court below was in error, in granting the fourth prayer of the plaintiffs, and in refusing the first prayer of the defendant, and the judgment must be reversed. But inasmuch as the evidence is full and explicit, that the injury was caused0 by the inherent infirmity of the goods, a new trial will not be awarded. <em>&gt;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">Application was made in this case, on the 1st of April, 1886, in behalf of the appellees, for a re-hearing, upon the ground that the Court was in error, in determining that there was full proof in the record, that the injury was caused by the inherent infirmity of the goods insured. Upon a careful re-examination of the case, the Court were of the opinion that their. judgment was justified by the evidence in the record, and disallowed the application; but, assuming that the appellees might be able to furnish other evidence on the point in question, not offered in the former trial, the case was remanded, and a new trial was awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
