In this respect this case differs from <em>Kelly &amp; Partington, </em>5 <em>B. &amp; A., </em>645, 648, 649, <em>and Moore vs. Burnett, </em>48 <em>Barb., </em>229, 231.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWF\">In <em>Dorsey vs. Whipps, </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>457; <em>Jones vs. Hungerford, </em>4 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>402; <em>Shealy vs. Briggs, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>363, and <em>Peterson vs. Sentman, </em>37 <em>Md., </em>140, <em>the words </em>laid were claimed to be actionable <em>per se; </em>and motions in arrest were sustained because without some averment or <em>colloquium </em>they did not necessarily impute a criminal charge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-11\">In these cases no <em>special damages </em>resulting from the words laid, were either claimed or proven, and they do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>not therefore support the ruling on the motion in arrest in this case.

The words set forth are not otherwise actionable. The allegation is that the \u201c defendant, intending to injure the plaintiff in his character and business, falsely and maliciously, spoke and published of and concerning the plaintiff\u201d certain words, \u201cby means of the speaking and publishing of which said false and malicious words, the plaintiff was greatly injured in his character and business, and was dismissed from his said employment.\u201d The import of the words set out is not such as to involve in any way the appellant\u2019s trade or business, and certainly they are not laid in the declaration as so spoken. <em>Dicken vs. Shepherd, </em>22 <em>Md., </em>400, 416; <em>Ayre vs. Craven, </em>2 <em>Ad. &amp; Ell., </em>2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-8\">This action then belongs to that class of actions for oral slander, in which the cause of action is \u201cdefamatory words falsely spoken of a person, which, though not in themselves actionable, occasion the party special damage.\u201d <em>Pollard vs. Lyon, </em>91 <em>U S., </em>225, 226.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-9\">The chief requisites of a declaration in this class of cases, without which the declaration is bad in substance, are^\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>First. </em>That the words set out shall be defamatory, either in their ordinary meaning or in the meaning in which the innuendo, based upon a proper <em>colloquium, </em>shows them to have been used by the defendant. <em>By definition, </em>the cause of action must be <em>defamatory toords. Pollard vs. Lyon, supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-5\">If the words are equivocal, the circumstances relied upon- to give them a defamatory meaning must be set forth in a proper inducement or <em>colloquium.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-6\">\u25a0 In the present case the words are not defamatory, and the declaration contains no inducement or <em>colloquium </em>to show where, when and to whom the words were spoken, or to explain the meaning of the words themselves. All authorities agree that either the words spoken must on their face be capable of the meaning given them hy the innuendo, or there must be a <em>colloquium </em>to explain how they had that meaning. The words must have a defamatory meaning, and -it must be gotten without any strained interpretation or speculative inference. <em>The innuendoes </em>in the present case, in so far as they attempt to give meaning to the words spoken, are not supported by the colloquium, and must be disregarded. <em>Peterson vs. Sentman, </em>37 <em>Md., </em>153, 155 ; <em>Bloss vs. Tobey, </em>2 <em>Pick., </em>320; <em>Havemeyer vs. Fuller, </em>60 <em>How. Pr., </em>316.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-7\">That the words must be defamatory to support an action of slander, is a proposition that follows as a corrollary from the nature -of the action. The action of slander is an action on the case for consequential damages, resulting from a wrongful act of the defendant, to wit: the speaking of false and defamatory words, from which speaking the law presumes malice, except in certain cases. If the words are not defamatory, there can be no presumption of malice, and therefore the speaker is guilty of no wrong. <em>Kelly vs. Partington, </em>5 <em>B. </em>&amp; <em>Ad., </em>645; <em>Sheahan vs. Ahearne, </em>9 <em>Ir. Rep., C.

The words were as follows: \u201cHe (meaning the plaintiff) has caused the downfall and ruin of my clerk; (meaning defendant\u2019s clerk, Lewis B. Wilson;\u201d) \u201cWill (meaning the plaintiff) has been the ruination of my clerk;\u201d \u201cI (meaning defendant) do not want him to have anything to do with my business, (meaning that plaintiff* should not weigh any goods consigned to defendant.\u201d) There are other words in the declaration of a similar import; but these are sufficient to illustrate the principle on which this case must be decided. Their actionable character must be tested by the question whether they impute to the plaintiff the want of any qualification such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>as a clerk ought to have, or any misconduct which would make him unfit to discharge faithfully and correctly all the duties of a clerk. This was the rule declared in <em>Lumby vs. Allday, </em>1 <em>Crompton &amp; Jervis, </em>301; and it has the support of the best authorities. The learned Judge who delivered the opinion of the Court, said: \u201c Every authority which I have been able to find, either shows the want of some general requisite,, as honesty, capacity, fidelity, &amp;c., or connects the imputation with the plaintiff\u2019s office, trade, or business. I am of opinion, that the charge proved in this case is not actionable, because the imputation it contains does not imply the want of any of those qualities which a clerk ought to possess, and because the imputation has no reference to his conduct as clerk.\u201d The plaintiff, in the case from which we have quoted, was a clerk in the Birmingham and Staffordshire Gas Light Company. He charged the defendant with speaking falsely and maliciously these words: \u201c You are a fellow, a disgrace to the town, unfit to hold your situation for your conduct with whores. I will have you in the <em>Argus. </em>You have bought up all the copies of the <em>Argus, </em>knowing you have been exposed. You may drown yourself, for you are not fit to live, and are a disgrace to the situation you hold.\u201d There was no averment of special damage ; and consequently the judgment of the Court was expressed upon the words as they stood alone. When some specific damage is caused by words falsely and maliciously spoken, they may become actionable, when otherwise the law would give no redress against the person speaking them. Many instances of such words are found in the books. In <em>Comyns\u2019 Digest, Action on the case for Defamation, (D. </em>30,) a long list is given of \u201cwords by which the party has a special damage.\u201d It has been well said in <em>Kelly vs. Partington, </em>5 <em>Barn. &amp; Ad., </em>650, that in all these instances put by <em>Comyns, </em>the words are injurious to the reputation of the person, of whom they are spoken; and to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>the speaking of the words wrongful, they must in their nature be defamatory.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b217-8\">(Decided 11th March, 1886.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">In <em>Terwilliger vs. Wands, </em>17 <em>New York, </em>61, in speaking of this subject, the Court said: \u201c The words must be defamatory in their nature; and must in fact disparage the character ; and this disparagement must be evidenced by some positive loss arising therefrom directly and legitimately as a fair and natural result.\u201d The words charged in the declaration are very reproachful: they accuse him of the grievous wickedness of causing the ruin of another person. This accusation, if true, would naturally and properly injure him in the estimation of all virtuous persons, and cause them to shun all social intercourse with him. It was well adapted to cause the loss of his situation as clerk, by grousing the just indignation of his employers. This loss of employment would be (within the meaning of theTaw,) a natural consequence of the words spoken; that is, one which in the ordinary .course of events might occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">For these reasons, we think that the declaration stated a cause of action. It is not drawn with technical accuracy ; but under the well known rule in <em>Rushton vs. Aspinall, Douglas, </em>619, its imperfections of statement are cured by the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
