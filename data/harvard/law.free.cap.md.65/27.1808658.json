That the burden of proof in this case is upon the defendants to establish any warranty by the plaintiff respecting the quality of the machinery sold by plaintiff to the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-7\">4. That if the jury shall find from the evidence in this cause, that the machinery mentioned as delivered to the defendants in this case by the plaintiff, were delivered upon the order of the defendants, or either of them, and were the specified articles or pieces of machinery which it was agreed between the defendants or either of them and the plaintiff, should be delivered by the plaintiff to .the defendants, and that the price agreed to be paid by the defendants to the plaintiff for said articles was $1200, payable in equal instalments, at the expiration of three and four months from the date of said delivery, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover of the defendants the agreed price, with such interest thereon as the jury may see fit to allow, from the date of the expiration of said three and four months after delivery, up to the present, unless the jury shall further' find that there was a warranty respecting the quality of the machinery sold and delivered by the plaintiff to the defendants, which warranty was fraudulently untrue on the part of the plaintiff, and which warranty formed part of the contract of sale between the plaintiff and defendants, and that said warranty has been broken by the plaintiff, and in that case the jury is entitled to deduct from the plaintiff\u2019s claim, proven as aforesaid, the amount of money proven to have been expended by the defendants in bringing the said machinery up to the state in which they shall find it was warranted to be by the plaintiff at the time of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The defendant, Adler, offered the following prayer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-5\">That any affirmation or declaration of the quality or condition of the ice machine (not uttered as a matter of opinion or belief) made by Robert Fortner, at the time of the sale, for the purpose of assuring the defendants of the truth of the facts affirmed, and inducing the defendants to make the purchase, if so received and relied on by the defendants, is an express warranty, even though the word warranty was not used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-6\">The Court granted the third and fourth-prayers of the plaintiff, and the prayer of the defendant, Adler, and gave also the following instruction:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-7\">If the jury find that after the delivery of the machinery, and after the expiration of a sufficient time to have become acquainted with its condition and quality, the defendants asked for an extension of time, and promised to pay the claim, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-8\">To the granting of the prayers of the plaintiff, and to the special instruction given by the Court, the defendant Adler excepted. Judgment by default was entered against the defendant Mulhauser. On inquisition had the jury rendered a verdict for $1344 against Mulhauser, and judgment was entered accordingly. Verdict and judgment were also given against Adler for the like amount. Adler appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-9\">The cause was argued before Alvey, C.

The machine was sold <em>for a particular-purpose, </em>and where a party sells an article for a particular purpose, he must be understood to warrant it reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>ably fit and proper for that purpose. <em>Randall vs. Newson, </em>2 <em>L.

Such a promise might have estopped the purchaser from asking to rescind the sale. <em>Taymon vs. Mitchell, </em>1 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>496. But the purchaser could either rescind the contract, recoup, or bring an action for breach of warranty. <em>Rutter vs. Blade, </em>2 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>J., </em>302; <em>Franklin vs. Long, </em>7 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>407; <em>McCeney vs. Duvall, </em>21 <em>Md., </em>166; <em>Lane, Adm\u2019x vs. Lantz, </em>27 <em>Md., </em>211.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>It is not oven necessary to give notice within a reasonable time, to maintain a suit for breach of warranty. <em>McCeney vs. </em>Duvall, 21 <em>Md., </em>166.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-5\">If the appellant, in order to save his business credit, had even paid the notes when they matured, he would not have lost his right to sue for a breach of warranty, and it has recently been held that even a judgment rendered upon default for the price of goods sold, is not a bar to an action by the purchaser for a breach of warranty of the quality of the goods. <em>Parker vs. Roberts, Sup. Ct. N. H., June, </em>1885.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-6\"><em>Archibald II. </em>Taylor, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b51-7\">Bryan, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aa\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The appellee sued the appellant to recover the price of certain machinery. The defendant relied on an alleged breach of warranty. It appeared that the machinery was sold by one Robert Portner, to the firm of Adler &amp; Mulhauser, of which the defendant was a member, and that the cause of action was assigned to the plaintiff, a body politic and corporate. The defendant testified that in September, 1882, he purchased the machine in question in the City of Baltimore, from Robert Portner; that the price was $1200; no time of payment was mentioned ; nothing was then said about notes ; that Portner warranted the machine to do all the work Adler wanted to do; that he bought only on Portner\u2019s warranty; that Mulhauser, defendant\u2019s partner, went over to Alexandria a week or two afterwards to look at the machine that was to be shipped, and that the machine came on, and was received by the defendant about the beginning of October. This testimony is contradicted by Portner and Mulhauser, who testify that the purchase was made by Mulhauser in Alexandria, and that there was no warranty; Portner testifying that Mulhauser knew the machine, and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>seen it work for four or five years when he was in Portner\u2019s employment, and on visits to Portner\u2019s brewery. Another witness also testified that Mulhauser looked at the machine at the time of the purchase and that it was known to him. Mulhauser testified that he had seen the machine often, and.that he examined it when at work at the time of the purchase. Adler testified to breaches of the warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Notwithstanding the contradiction to Adler\u2019s testimony, it was necessary that it should be considered by the jury, and if they found according to it, the Court was required to give to their finding its legal effect. Adler testified to an express warranty, and if this were broken, it was not material whether it were fraudulently made or not. This point was. decided in <em>Osgood vs. Lewis, </em>2 <em>Harris &amp; Gill, </em>495, and is considered as fully settled. The fourth prayer of the plaintiff did not correctly state the law, when it required the jury to find the warranty, \u201cfraudulently untrue,\u201d before they could deduct damages for the breach of it, from the amount of the purchase money. The alleged contract for the purchase of the machine was oral, nothing was given by way of earnest to bind the bargain and no payment was made in whole, or in part. In this condition it was within the Statute of Frauds, but when the delivery afterwards took place, it became valid and binding. If there were no other features in the case, we should reverse the judgment. We must however consider the other incidents of the trial. There was evidence tending to show that one-half of the purchase money was to be paid in three months, and the other half in four months; and that in November, Mulhauser asked for an extension of credit until May, and it was granted by Portner; that frequent demands were made for the notes, and that in May, Adler sent his .book-keeper over to Alexandria, and that it was agreed that he should send three notes for the purchase money, with interest, and that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>should, be endorsed, or secured by bill of sale of the machine; that when Adler\u2019s clerk was in Alexandria in May, Portner offered to take the machine back, as he had another purchaser, but his offer was refused, and that the notes were given, but were returned to Adler because they did not bear interest, and were not secured by indorsement or bill of sale. Adler testified as follows, we quote the words of the transcript: \u201cthat he gave his notes in May, 1883, because Portner was threatening to sue him,\" and he did not want to be sued; he wanted time to test the machine; he could find out whether the machine would work or not by the time the first note would mature (four months,) and if it would not work he would not pay the notes.\u201d Facts which a party to a suit admits, of course need not be .submitted to the jury, if the adverse party is willing to accept the admission. It appears from this admission that the defendant after having had possession of the machine for about eight months, gave to the seller his notes for the purchase money. If there was a breach of warranty, he knew it at that time; or at least, he had had the most ample opportunity of ascertaining it. According to his statement no time for the payment of the price was mentioned in the contract of purchase; it was therefore due on the delivery of the machine. After eight months he seeks to obtain a further credit by giving notes. Some significance must be attributed to the giving of a note. In good faith it imports that the maker will pay it at maturity. If the defendant did not intend to pay these notes because of some matter which had then occurred; or if he intended to refuse payment in some contingency which he did not make known to his creditor; in either of these cases, he was contemplating a fraud. We can give to the defendant\u2019s conduct no interpretation consistent with good faith, except that he had no purpose of refusing to pay these notes at maturity. This clearly implied that he would make no objections to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the amount claimed to be due as the purchase money of the machine. After this the defence arising from an alleged breach of warranty, or from any other cause, could not in good faith be set up in bar of a suit on this account. We think, therefore, that the Court would have been justified in refusing to submit such question to the jury; and as a matter of course, the plaintiff in his fourth prayer, took upon himself a greater burden than he was 'required to bear, inasmuch as on the hypothesis therein stated, the defendant was to be allowed a deduction for a breach of warranty. We think that-the instruction given by the Court proposed the true inquiry to the jury.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b54-6\">(Decided 30th March, 1886.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
