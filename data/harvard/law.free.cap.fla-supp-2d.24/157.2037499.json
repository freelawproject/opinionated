The defendant invoked his right to remain silent, and also his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Thereafter the defendant was advised of his rights under the implied consent law. Defendant then gave a breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The Court below granted a Motion to Suppress, based on the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">A review of case law indicates this was in error; <em>see.Bracken </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>452 So.2d 540 (Fla. 1984); <em>State v. Mcgarry, 477 </em>SO.2d 1030 (Fla. 2d DCA 1985) and <em>Pastori v. State, </em>456 So.2d 1212 (Fla. 2d DCA 1984) with reference to the giving of a breath test as not being in violation of the Fifth Amendment; and <em>United States v. Gouveia, </em>82 L.Fed.2d 146 (1984) with reference to right of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Therefore, that portion of the Trial Court\u2019s action in suppressing the breath test results is reversed; the other rulings of the Court are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED for further action of the Court in compliance with the above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
