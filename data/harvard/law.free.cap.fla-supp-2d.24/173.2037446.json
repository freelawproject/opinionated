Neither defendant nor her attorney appeared for the scheduled arraignment. Trial was nevertheless set but continued twice at the request of the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Defendant thereafter moved for discharge alleging violation of the Spe\u00e9dy Trial Rule. This appeal is from the order discharging the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\">It is a well established rule that when a defendant, or her attorney, is not available for trial for whatever reason, no order for discharge can issue. Rule 3.191(e), R.Cr.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Further, as clearly stated by the Supreme Court of Florida, any continuance granted at the request of the defense constitutes a waiver of the right to a speedy trial under the rule. <em>Butterworth </em>v. <em>Fluellen, </em>389 So.2d 968 (Fla. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
