We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-17\">At trial, the State\u2019s only witness testified that she saw Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>car a split second before Defendant hit her car, and that Defendant was going \u201ctoo fast\u201d. There is no explanation of what \u201ctoo fast\u201d means, nor was there a reasonable basis for this opinion. She did not see Defendant fail to stop at any stop sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\">Defendant\u2019s testimony explained the accident, but in our view such testimony was unnecessary since the State failed to present a prima facia case of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The State has a strict burden of proving the charged infraction beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Levity v. State, </em>339 So.2d 655 (Fla. 1976). There must be sufficient, competent and substantial evidence to support a conviction. <em>Sindrich v. State, </em>322 So.2d 589 (Fla. 1st DCA 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The State clearly failed to meet its burden. We reverse the conviction with directions to the trial judge to enter a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
