See <em>Szteinbaum v. Kaes Inversiones y Valores, </em>C.A., 476 So.2d 247 (Fla. 3d DCA 1985). Obviously S.C. Rule 7.050 was intended to permit the filing of a suit by a corporation. In the event there is a default or non-defense, it would be inappropriate in a Court created to collect small sums to require legal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">However, said rule was never intended to stand the unlawful practice of law rule on its head. Once the suit has commenced and is contested, normal rules apply and a corporation must obtain services of an attorney to represent itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Reversed and Amended Final Judgment and Writ of Garnishment are reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
