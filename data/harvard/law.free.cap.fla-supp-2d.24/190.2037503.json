The fact that there were unintelligible portions of the video tape would not exclude the evidence but would only effect the weight and sufficiency, <em>Odom v. State, </em>403 So.2d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">If the testimony of the arresting officer was a direct result of his own recollection then that testimony may not be excluded, <em>State v. Sarmiento, </em>396 S.2d 643. In that case the officer that participated in that conversation could testify as to the contents of the conversation even though the warrantless recording of a private conversation was inadmissible as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Based upon the analysis of this Court, the exclusion of the officer\u2019s testimony and the suppression of the entire video tape were improper under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The Trial Court\u2019s ruling on both issues are reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
