The trial justice sentenced Roscoe to two concurrent sentences of life imprisonment. The defendant timely appealed. After thoroughly reviewing the record and after carefully considering the arguments of the parties, we vacate the judgment of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In August 1990, Richard Mouchon arrived at the West Warwick home of his grandmother, eighty-five year old Germaine Mouchon, intending to bring her to a birthday party for one of her great-grandchildren. When Mrs. Mouchon did not answer the locked door, Richard decided to check to see if she was doing laundry in another building of her elderly-housing complex. As he walked around the building outside her apartment, he peered through a window and was horrified to see his grandmother lying naked and in a perpendicular position on her bed. He immediately asked Mrs. Mouchon's neighbor to call the police and the fire department. When first responders arrived, they found that the deadbolt on the apartment door was locked from the inside and, consequently, they were required to remove an intact screen from the apartment window to gain access into the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Detective Dennis Bousquet of the West Warwick Police Department arrived shortly thereafter and found that there had been no forced entry and, further, that the apartment was in relative order, aside from a woman's slip or housecoat that had been discarded on the living room floor and an overturned plastic end table. A cigarette lighter and a small brown leather belt were discovered next to Mrs. Mouchon's body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The medical examiner, Francis Garrity, M.D., pronounced Mrs. Mouchon dead at the scene, and he also conducted a cursory external examination of her body. Upon a more detailed examination at the medical examiner's facility, he catalogued injuries to Mrs. Mouchon's head and face, including bruises and a lacerated upper lip. There was another bruise on her left breast. Doctor Garrity used cotton swabbing to sample tissues from the decedent's mouth, anus, and vagina, sealed the samples in an evidence collection kit, and sent them to a laboratory for testing. The next day, Dr. Garrity performed an autopsy, which revealed fluid around Mrs. Mouchon's lungs, an enlarged heart, and other indicators of a failing cardiovascular system. Significantly, there were no vaginal injuries and no defensive wounds, such as blood or skin under her fingernails or fresh injuries to her hands. However, the autopsy did uncover that Mrs. Mouchon had been suffering from a urinary tract infection. Based on those observations and findings, Dr. Garrity determined that Mrs. Mouchon's cause of death\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was \"a heart attack or a cardiac arrest following a traumatic event[,]\" namely \"[m]ultiple blunt force injuries about the face, left breast.\" At trial, Dr. Garrity testified that a single fall was unlikely to have caused Mrs. Mouchon's \"constellation\" of injuries, but that he could not medically rule out that possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Doctor Garrity was unable to determine the manner of death at the time of his\n   examination. However, when he later learned that laboratory testing on the evidence collection kit had revealed the presence of sperm, Dr. Garrity contacted Det. Bousquet to inquire as to whether Mrs. Mouchon had been involved in a relationship at the time of her death. Detective Bousquet questioned Mrs. Mouchon's son George, her grandson Richard, and two of her friends, Anna Blais and Henriette Van Coughen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After completing these tasks, Det. Bousquet advised Dr. Garrity that Mrs. Mouchon had not been involved in a relationship. Now believing Mrs. Mouchon to have \"died as a result of actions of another[,]\" Dr. Garrity changed his opinion as to the manner of Mrs. Mouchon's death from \"undetermined\" to \"homicide.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nearly twenty-five years later, Richard discovered Mrs. Mouchon's death certificate among his late father's belongings, and he was surprised when he discovered that his grandmother's manner of death had been determined to be homicide. He contacted Detective Thomas Nye of the West Warwick police, who reopened what had become a cold case. Detective Nye got in touch with Cara Lupino at the Rhode Island Department of Health Forensic Laboratory, who was able to locate the evidence collection kit that had been created decades earlier by Dr. Garrity. Lupino tested the preserved cotton swabs inside the kit and successfully obtained a male DNA profile. She ran that profile through a DNA database and obtained a potential match for defendant. Pursuant to a search warrant, West Warwick police collected a buccal swab\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   from Roscoe, which also matched the male DNA profile obtained from the evidence collection kit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 16, 2015, Roscoe was charged by indictment with one count of murder, in violation of G.L. 1956 \u00a7 11-23-1, and one count of first degree sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 \u00a7 11-37-2. A jury found Roscoe guilty on both counts after a six-day trial. The trial justice denied Roscoe's motion for new trial and later sentenced him to two concurrent life sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by (1) failing to order a mistrial after the prosecutor made improper remarks to the jury during closing argument; (2) allowing the medical examiner's determination as to the decedent's manner of death to be presented to the jury; and (3) allowing statements of deceased declarants to be admitted into evidence, in violation of the Confrontation Clause of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. Further, defendant argues that his convictions for both felony murder and the predicate offense of first degree sexual assault violated the prohibition against double jeopardy in the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    \" 'Cause of death' means the agent that has directly or indirectly resulted in a death[,]\" and refers to the specific injury or disease that resulted in death.

In this regard, defendant argues that the prosecutor strayed beyond the bounds of proper conduct during his closing arguments in three separate instances: (1) the prosecutor referred to the rules of hearsay as the reason he \"couldn't say things[,]\" (2)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    the prosecutor misstated the medical examiner's testimony, and (3) the prosecutor claimed multiple times that defense counsel had referred to Mrs. Mouchon as a \"slut\" and a \"whore[,]\" and he expressed his personal outrage at those characterizations during his closing statement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    \"It is well settled that a decision to pass a case and declare a mistrial are matters left to the sound discretion of the trial justice.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

The court held that \"the implication is clear that there existed other incriminating or sinister facts which either were inadmissible or could not be produced.

As the trial justice ruled, when read in context, it is clear that the prosecutor was merely attempting, albeit ineloquently,\n    to explain the complex and potentially confusing process by which sperm was matched with DNA taken from buccal swabs and other samples. To us, that is quite different from the direct appeal to \"wild speculation\" that was found to be the case in\n    <em>\n     Bolden\n    </em>\n    . Here, the trial justice discerned no error in the prosecutor's remarks, stating that, while \"the [c]ourt's ears went up\" at the mention of hearsay, \"what [the prosecutor] was trying to do is explain to the jury what the different swabs were and the different testing process that [the jury] heard or didn't hear certain things.\" The trial justice was in the best position to evaluate any prejudice that the prosecutor's remarks might have engendered, sitting, as he was, in a \"front row seat\" during the trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dubois\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7295680\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/36/191/#p197\">\n     36 A.3d at 197\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . He determined that there was no prejudice to defendant, and, as noted above, \"[t]he ruling of the trial justice * * * is accorded great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly wrong.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7295680\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/36/191/#p197\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    We can see no error in his ruling about the prosecutor's remarks regarding the rules of hearsay.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <strong>\n     2\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <strong>\n     Inferences Drawn from the Expert Testimony\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred when he allowed the prosecutor to mislead the jury by misstating the testimony of the medical examiner. We do not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    During the trial, the prosecutor posed this hypothetical to the medical examiner on redirect examination: \"a person who has a serious heart condition, who is sexually assaulted and assaulted, what impact would you believe that the assault and the sexual assault would have on that person who has that type of heart condition?\" The medical examiner's response to this question was, \"I believe it would cause an extreme risk to life. I think the individual, the decedent, would have suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of the stress, the panic, and the pain.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    There can be no argument that posing a hypothetical question to an expert witness is appropriate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

Roscoe assigns error, however, to the manner in which the prosecutor characterized the answer to that question in his closing argument to the jury. The prosecutor told the jury:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    \"The next question for you is if you find there was a sexual assault, the next question did she die as a result of the sexual assault. And I am going to direct your attention back to Dr. Garrity, the expert in this case, 'The pain, the panic, the anxiety of the sexual assault pushed this woman over the edge.' \"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Roscoe argues before this Court, as he did below, that with those remarks the prosecutor purported to directly quote Dr. Garrity, but in fact he blatantly misrepresented the medical examiner's testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    After reviewing the trial transcripts, we agree with the trial justice that the prosecutor was not engaged in an effort to directly quote Dr. Garrity. Rather, the prosecutor called attention to Dr. Garrity's testimony and attempted to draw what seems to us to be a fair inference that could be gleaned from that testimony. In\n    <em>\n     State v.

For example, if something was said during closing argument and your recollection or notes of what the testimony was during the trial are different, you are to rely on your memories and your notes and not what was said. * * * [T]he only evidence in this case are the responses of the witnesses on the witness stand during their direct and cross-examination and any full exhibits that are in evidence.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    After closely examining the prosecutor's closing remarks in light of the record, and after considering the cautionary instruction imparted by the trial justice, it is our opinion that the prosecutor did not drift outside the bounds of proper prosecutorial conduct by suggesting that the jury draw a reasonable inference from the medical examiner's testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <strong>\n     3\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <strong>\n     The Prosecutor's Characterization of Defense Strategy\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    During her closing arguments, Roscoe's defense counsel argued that evidence of sexual assault was lacking and that the prosecution's case necessarily depended on the inference that an eighty-five year old widow simply would not have engaged in consensual sexual relations with a man fifty years her junior. This inference, she argued, was out of step with modern society.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    In response to defense counsel's suggestion in this respect, the prosecutor told the jury during the state's closing argument, \"And I apologize for being angry but I'm tired of this victim being called a slut the whole trial.\" Later, he added, \"I make faces. My wife yells at me all the time. I can't play polka [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] and I get upset. An 85-year old woman, serious health condition, urinary tract infection, being called a whore.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    This type of coarse and vulgar verbiage is simply unacceptable and has no place in the courtrooms of this state. Perhaps more\n    importantly, the prosecutor's comments were untethered to the record. In the absence of injuries typical of a violent sexual assault, defense counsel asked the jury to consider that Mrs. Mouchon and defendant may have engaged in consensual intercourse. At best, the prosecutor mischaracterized this defense as an attack on Mrs. Mouchon, and then inappropriately expressed his personal anger at the very mischaracterization that he had concocted. At worst, the prosecutor launched an\n    <em>\n     ad hominem\n    </em>\n    attack on the defendant, demonizing him in an effort to arouse the jury's passions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    We have repeatedly condemned \"\n    <em>\n     ad hominem\n    </em>\n    attacks that solely 'serve to demonize a particular defendant.' \"\n    <em>\n     Barkmeyer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8241887\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/949/984/#p1007\">\n     949 A.2d at 1007\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     State v.

Because an anecdotal history of a decedent's death is often helpful in making a sound determination as to manner of death, and because it cannot be said that Dr. Garrity relied solely or primarily on information relayed to him by the police, we cannot agree with defendant that the trial justice erred by admitting Dr. Garrity's testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    After an initial external examination of the decedent's body, Dr. Garrity performed a more extensive examination and a detailed autopsy, in which he catalogued evidence of external injuries and examined internal organs for signs of disease.

Based on his findings, the medical examiner concluded that the cause of death was \"[b]asically a heart attack or a cardiac arrest following a traumatic event[,]\" namely \"[m]ultiple blunt force injuries about the face, left breast.\" Doctor Garrity was at that point unable to opine as to the manner of death, however, until he learned that laboratory testing of the evidence collection kit indicated the presence of sperm in Mrs. Mouchon's body and that witness statements indicated she had not been in a relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Roscoe argues that a medical examiner's conclusions do not assist the trier of fact when they are based on witness statements and the results of a police investigation because this extrinsic information is just as easily understood by a jury, without the need for expert testimony.

Evid. 702, so long as they do not rely solely or primarily on such information.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    It is for the trial justice, based on the particular facts and circumstances of the case before him, to determine whether a medical examiner has relied too heavily on witness statements such that the testimony amounts to an impermissible comment on the witness's credibility. We do not disturb such findings on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Griffin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11913785\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/691/556/#p558\">\n     691 A.2d at 558\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    In this case, the trial justice ruled that Dr. Garrity's opinion as to the manner of death was within his area of expertise and that his testimony would assist the jury in its fact finding function. In our opinion, allowing Dr. Garrity to testify about his consideration of witness statements was not clearly erroneous, because\n    he did not rely solely or primarily on those statements. At trial, Dr. Garrity testified that he catalogued extensive injuries to Mrs. Mouchon's head, face, and left breast-injuries that he did not believe were consistent with falling-and that those blunt force injuries likely caused Mrs. Mouchon's already-compromised heart to fail. He also testified that, at the time of her death, Mrs. Mouchon was suffering from a urinary tract infection and that the inflammation and pain from that infection would certainly dampen any desire for sexual intercourse. The statements of acquaintances to the effect that Mrs. Mouchon had not been involved in a relationship may have assisted Dr. Garrity to arrive at the conclusion that Mrs. Mouchon's manner of death was homicide, but we cannot say that Dr. Garrity's conclusion was based solely, or even primarily, on those statements.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Roscoe also argues that Dr. Garrity's testimony should have been excluded under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, because Dr. Garrity's determination that Mrs. Mouchon's manner of death was by homicide was likely to confuse jurors who might have equated the medical term \"homicide\" with the legal charge of murder. We do not agree. Again, as we acknowledged in\n    <em>\n     Mattatall\n    </em>\n    , where police believe that violence may have caused the death of an individual, a medical examiner is obliged by \u00a7 23-4-8 to \"immediately proceed to the place where the body lies and take charge of it, view it, and make personal inquiry into the cause and manner of death.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mattatall\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7939973\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/603/1098/#p1116\">\n     603 A.2d at 1115\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting the predecessor statute to \u00a7 23-4-8, with minor linguistic deviations).

He contends that this violated his right to confront the witnesses against him, in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution. Because we agree that the Confrontation Clause was violated when the state implicitly conveyed the content of statements made by deceased witnesses to the jury, both through Det. Bousquet's testimony and the closing argument of the prosecutor, and because we cannot say that those violations were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we are constrained to vacate the judgment of conviction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    \"When a criminal defendant claims on appeal that the introduction of certain evidence violated his constitutional rights of confrontation and cross-examination, we review such an evidentiary ruling in a\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    manner.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

Massachusetts\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/\">\n     557 U.S. 305\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/\">\n     129 S.Ct. 2527\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/\">\n     174 L.Ed.2d 314\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2009), the United States Supreme Court was not persuaded by that very argument, reasoning that the Sixth Amendment \"contemplates two classes of witnesses-those against the defendant and those in his favor. * * * [T]here is not a third category of witnesses, helpful to the prosecution, but somehow immune from confrontation.\"\n    <em>\n     Melendez-Diaz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/\">\n     557 U.S. at 313-14\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/\">\n     129 S.Ct. 2527\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    That reasoning applies here with full force. Although it is true that the statements of the now-deceased declarants do not directly identify or implicate Roscoe, the statements were nonetheless employed in an effort to prove that defendant's DNA was present as the result of nonconsensual sexual contact. Anna Blais, Henriette Van Coughen, and George Mouchon were therefore witnesses against the defendant. Their deaths prior to trial deprived Roscoe of the ability to subject them to cross-examination, yet the trial justice nonetheless admitted testimony that referred to their statements to police in 1990. In our opinion, this was error.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    It is further our opinion that this error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The state was tasked with proving that any sexual contact between Roscoe and Mrs. Mouchon was nonconsensual. However, there were no signs of forced entry into Mrs. Mouchon's apartment, there were no defensive wounds on Mrs. Mouchon's hands, and vaginal injuries were not present. We therefore cannot say that, had \"the damaging potential of the cross-examination [been] fully realized,\" no reasonable jury could have acquitted the defendant.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     Albanese\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7336354\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/970/1215/#p1222\">\n     970 A.2d at 1222\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the introduction of out-of-court statements of deceased declarants violated the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10, of the Rhode Island Constitution.

I write separately merely to express my belief that the trial justice's failure to grant defendant a mistrial based upon the prosecutor's comments in closing argument insinuating that the defense had called Mrs. Mouchon \"a slut\" and \"a whore\" throughout the trial was an abuse of discretion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    These statements are not only inflammatory, they are false. The record is devoid of any reference by the defense to the victim as being a \"slut\" or a \"whore.\" In my judgment, these remarks could not help but \"arouse the sympathy and passion of the jurors.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

Nor do I believe that a curative instruction could expiate the prejudice inherent in such fallacious and incendiary comments. To be sure, the defense strategy was to suggest that this 85-year-old woman was involved in a consensual sexual relationship with a man over fifty years younger. As difficult to believe as that theory may seem-the jury clearly rejected it-the theory is a far cry from characterizing the victim as a \"slut\" and a \"whore.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    I appreciate the majority's indignation concerning the prosecutor's inappropriate remarks. I would, however, go one step further and declare that they were so outrageous as to require a new trial.

In my judgment, there are two available grounds in this case on which a new trial could be ordered: because of the Confrontation Clause issue so nicely analyzed in the Court's opinion and also because of the impropriety of the prosecutor's closing argument-an argument that was not focused on the evidence in the record, but instead egregiously mischaracterized defense counsel's theory of the case as well as what defense counsel had actually said and done in the course of the trial.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Although the majority does not reach the\n    issue, I should add that there was error here which was certainly not harmless.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Therefore, it is my view that the defendant in the instant case is entitled to a new trial because of the violation of the Confrontation Clause, as the majority opinion holds; but I also wish to explicitly note that this case could also be reversed due to the very inappropriate language and baseless animadversions in the prosecutor's closing argument.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-126\">\n     While the troubling aspects of the prosecutor's closing argument were in all likelihood the product of an advocate's zeal, they are, in my view, nonetheless so serious as to form the basis for requiring a new trial.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-127\">\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      State v.
