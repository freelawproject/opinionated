The state charged the petitioner and Soler with felony murder and robbery related charges following the murder of Miguel Delgado, Jr., during the course of a robbery at Delgado's apartment. After Soler provided testimony implicating the petitioner as the person who murdered Delgado, and after the petitioner was convicted of felony murder, the state declined to prosecute the felony murder charge against Soler. Although the prosecutor denied during the petitioner's criminal trial that the state had entered into any formal arrangement with Soler in exchange for his testimony, he acknowledged that he had presented to Soler's attorney potential \"hypothetical\" outcomes that could come about if Soler were to testify truthfully against the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal to this court, the petitioner asks us to conclude, contrary to the determination of the habeas court and the Appellate Court;\n   <em>\n    Marquez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489107\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/73/#p240\">\n    170 Conn.

The state filed a five count information charging the petitioner with one count of felony murder, three counts of robbery in the first degree, and one count of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=967%20A.2d%2056\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The following additional evidence presented at the petitioner's criminal trial is relevant to this appeal. As recounted previously, at trial, the state presented testimony from two of the robbery victims, Valle and Clement, who described the events of the night of the robbery and the murder of Delgado. Both Valle and Clement identified the petitioner as the person who entered with the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In light of these identifications, the petitioner was arrested. He subsequently gave a statement to the police, blaming the murder on Soler. Soler's photograph was placed in a photographic array and shown to Valle, who identified Soler as the person who had assisted the gunman during the course of the robbery. Soler was arrested and charged with the same offenses as the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The state called Soler to testify at the petitioner's criminal trial. Soler's account of the incident in question was largely similar to Valle's and Clement's testimony describing the incident, and Soler testified that the petitioner was the gunman. He also testified that during a chance encounter at the prison medical unit, the petitioner asked Soler to recant the statement he had already given to the police about the incident. Soler also testified that the petitioner questioned him about whether he would testify against the petitioner at his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On direct examination, the prosecutor asked Soler if he had been promised any benefits from the state in\n   exchange for his testimony, which Soler denied. When prodded on cross-examination about his motivation for testifying, Soler stated: \"I'm testifying cuz it's the right thing to do.\" Soler further stated that he was not offered any particular deal by the state and that he did not know whether he would receive any kind of consideration as a result of testifying. Soler also testified that he would not lie about the events of the night in question in order to benefit himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following Soler's testimony, and outside the presence of Soler and the jury, defense counsel requested that the court inquire of the state, on the record, if there were any discussions relayed to Soler about his cooperation being brought to his sentencing court's attention. Specifically, defense counsel questioned whether Soler was told that the felony murder charge would be dropped if he were to testify in accordance with the facts that existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In response, the prosecutor explained that, because Soler testified at trial, \"some credit perhaps would be due him. What the extent of that credit is, I don't know. I know counsel has suggested that perhaps I would reduce the charge. We've had discussions that maybe that would happen. I can't say that it would. In my discussions with [Soler], I've indicated to him that I hadn't made any promises to him, so we have not come to a disposition or an understanding as to what any testimony would be.... [His testimony] potentially ultimately would be presented to a sentencing judge .... I don't see how that would not happen.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court responded by stating that \"some favorable consideration is something that [the state] would certainly consider at some point in time, but no promises have been made.\" The prosecutor replied, \"[r]ight.\" The prosecutor further explained that \"[the petitioner] was deciding to elect trial, so essentially for [Soler], we sort\n   of tabled his case because he was available and willing to participate in [the petitioner's] trial.\" When defense counsel questioned whether Soler's testimony would mean that \"his charges could be lowered and he would not face a mandatory minimum of twenty-five years,\" the prosecutor responded by stating that, \"I've not conveyed that to him ... my conversations with him were that there are no offers on the table.... [H]ow this works out is still yet to be determined.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Soler's defense attorney then stated: \"We have discussed the possibility of there being a benefit. We had at one point, I believe, discussed the possibility of coming down to twenty-five years if a variety of things fell into place. I do not believe that I've ever indicated to my client that I had received an offer because there has never been an offer from the state in this case or an indication from the state that they would be inclined to drop the charge ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court summarized: \"[T]here's been no fixed offer. And that's the way it should be characterized .... It doesn't rise to the level of a promise. It's not a promise.\" The prosecutor affirmed her understanding\n   that, if benefits had been offered in exchange for testimony, the state would have been obligated to disclose such information. The court, therefore, accepted the prosecutor's representation that no agreement existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition to the testimony of two of the robbery victims, the state also presented a statement the petitioner had given to the police after his arrest, in which he blamed the murder on Soler. The statement was read into the record at trial. In the statement, the petitioner admitted to the police that he had gone to Delgado's apartment on the night of the robbery with Soler, whom the petitioner referred to by his nickname, \"Monstruo.\" He claimed that they briefly stopped in at the apartment, looking to obtain marijuana, which they bought, and,\n   just as they were about to leave, Soler stopped him and was holding a gun. According to the petitioner's statement, Soler proceeded to rob the victims, at one point asking the petitioner to hold the gun for him. The petitioner stated that, after he returned the gun to Soler, Delgado approached and grabbed Soler, leading to a struggle during which Delgado was shot. See footnote 4 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The state also presented testimony at the petitioner's criminal trial from an inmate, David Williams, who had been incarcerated in the same facility as the petitioner and Soler while they awaited trial. Williams had previously known both Soler and the petitioner for about ten years. Williams testified that, while they were incarcerated, the petitioner asked Williams if he knew Soler. When Williams confirmed that he knew Soler, the petitioner informed Williams that Soler was his accomplice in the incident giving rise to the petitioner's arrest and incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Williams testified that the petitioner eventually told him that \"he could help [Williams] with [his] case, [Williams] could help [the petitioner] with his case ....\" The help that the petitioner sought was for Williams \"to give [the petitioner's] lawyer a statement ... that [Soler] had told [Williams] he had shot somebody ... [a]nd that they had somebody else for the murder.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Williams further testified that the petitioner wrote what he wanted Williams to say in the false confession in a letter. The petitioner then instructed Williams to convey the details of the letter to his attorney, who would then get in touch with the petitioner's attorney or investigator. Williams testified that the petitioner \"said to memorize it and rip it up when I finish memorizing,\" before speaking to his attorney. Instead, Williams\n   gave the letter to his attorney and told him how he had received it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Williams testified that the petitioner was urging him to claim that this was a conversation between Williams and Soler while they were on the same cellblock, even though Williams and Soler were actually on the cellblock together for only \"a couple hours\" total, and did not speak to each other in that time. Williams testified that the petitioner admitted to Williams that he was actually the person who \"shot the kid\" that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The petitioner's defense counsel presented the defense case by cross-examining the state's witnesses to cast doubt on the validity of their testimony. They\n   did not present any witnesses for the defense. Defense counsel argued to the jury in closing that the victims who had identified the petitioner likely chose the petitioner's photograph from the array because his photograph, which was the only one with a white ruler and bright lighting, stood out from other photographs presented to the victims. Defense counsel also asserted that the petitioner's statement to the police was not reliable because he was pressed into giving a statement when the police confronted him with the prior, allegedly tainted identifications by the victims. See footnotes 4 and 5 of this opinion. As for Soler, defense counsel specifically argued that he was likely looking for a deal in exchange for his testimony, telling the jury that Soler was involved and has \"been around the block, he has a lot to lose, and he knows that what he could do is he can get off felony murder, not get the twenty-five year mandatory minimum if he comes in here and he says what the state wants him to say and, anyway, he can say it.\" Defense counsel discredited Williams' testimony as a fabrication by someone facing a man-slaughter charge and looking for a deal, and pointed out that Soler and Williams knew each other before they were incarcerated, thereby implying that they might have worked together to pin the crime on the petitioner. Lastly, defense counsel critiqued the ability of the victims to recall certain events during the robbery and the thoroughness of the police investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found the petitioner guilty of one count of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, two counts of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134(a)(2), and one count of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of\n   \u00a7 53a-134(a)(2) and General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marquez\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5764830\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/122/\">\n    291 Conn. at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=967%20A.2d%2056\">\n    967 A.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, the petitioner claimed that the state had an undisclosed agreement with Soler that his charges would be reduced in his pending criminal matter in exchange for testimony against the petitioner. He also claimed that the prosecutor knowingly failed to correct Soler's false testimony that he had received no consideration in exchange for his cooperation. If the state had made the appropriate disclosure and correction, the petitioner asserted, the result of his trial would have been different and more favorable to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   These assertions are based in large part on information exposed during Soler's sentencing. At that time, the prosecutor stated that \"the state had represented to [Soler's] counsel that, in the event that [the petitioner] chose to proceed to trial and that [Soler's] testimony would be needed and would, in fact, be forthcoming\n   and be proffered truthfully ...\n   <em>\n    the state would sort of come off the felony murder\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    charge\n   </em>\n   ] and charge various counts of robbery or some of the substantive offenses in lieu of the felony murder since that would have a minimum mandatory of twenty-five years to serve. And that was discussed with the victim's family and other victims as well.\" (Emphasis added.) Notably, after Soler testified at the petitioner's trial, the prosecution chose not to pursue the felony murder charge originally brought against him. Instead, he was sentenced to a total term of twenty years of imprisonment, execution suspended after nine years, and five years of probation, for two counts of robbery in the first degree and attempt to commit robbery in the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Notwithstanding the phrasing he used at sentencing, at the petitioner's habeas trial, Soler's prosecuting attorney testified that his statement at Soler's sentencing \"was referring to discussions subsequent to his testimony, not prior to\" it. He also stated that the discussion he probably was referring to was when he \"discussed with the [victim's] family whether or not they would object to [Soler] having the charge other than felony murder ....\" He also stated that \"[w]e didn't codify or create any deals.... So if I did discuss or say or suggest things while [Soler's] case was pending, it would be in sort of the hypothetical that maybe we could do things.\" He insisted that, \"at that time that [Soler] testified, I made no offers ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The prosecutor further explained that his decision not to pursue the felony murder charge was, instead, \"based upon [Soler's] cooperation, based upon his completeness and truthfulness in his statement from day one when he got arrested,\" and because \"felony murder ... carries a mandatory twenty-five year sentence. I didn't think that was an appropriate sentence for his role,\" given that he was not the gunman. He also testified that, as a general policy in all criminal matters, he\n   does not \"make a deal [with any cooperating witness] because it doesn't pay as a prosecutor to try to make a deal upfront because you don't know how it's going to work out\" with the quality of the witness' testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The habeas court denied the petitioner's habeas petition, concluding that none of the testifying witnesses in the petitioner's underlying criminal trial had agreements promising them benefits in exchange for their testimony, and, thus, no\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation occurred. The petitioner sought certification to appeal from the judgment,\n   claiming that, among other things, the habeas court made a clearly erroneous factual finding that there was no agreement between the state and Soler at the time of his testimony in the petitioner's underlying criminal trial. The habeas court denied the petition for certification to appeal.

The petitioner claims that, if the jury had known that, in exchange for his testimony, \"the state would sort of come off the felony murder\" charge, there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury would have seen the case differently. We conclude, however, that there is no reasonable likelihood that full disclosure of any agreement or Soler's allegedly false testimony would have brought about a different result at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   First, it is important to point out that, at his criminal trial, there was little question that the petitioner was present at the scene. The state presented a statement given by the petitioner to the police acknowledging that he was present during the incident that caused Delgado's death, and that he had, at some point, held the gun used in the murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The primary issue in the\n   case, if the petitioner's statement is credited,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   therefore, was whether the petitioner participated in the robbery that led to Delgado's murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was ample evidence presented at trial to show not only that the petitioner actively participated in the robbery, but that he also fired the shots that killed Delgado. Valle clearly identified the petitioner to be the gunman. He testified that he first observed the petitioner in a \"brightly lit\" hallway. Then, after entering the apartment, the petitioner was only \"[i]nches\" away from Valle's face. Even though the living room was unlit, Valle stated that he \"could see [the petitioner] real good\" because of the light pouring in from other rooms. When speaking to the police, Valle was able to give a detailed description of the petitioner, including his approximate height, hairstyle, hair length, build, approximate age, and complexion. Additionally, Valle noted that, when he first saw the petitioner at the apartment, he thought that the petitioner \"exactly\" resembled someone else that Valle knows. Valle specifically told the police at the time of the murder that his observation of the petitioner and Soler would allow him to identify the two men if given the chance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Although two men came into the apartment looking to rob the occupants, the man that Valle positively identified\n   as the petitioner was the same man who, he testified, displayed the gun when he came into the apartment, directed Valle and the others to sit on the couch, and indicated that his gun was \"on safety.\" The other individual \"acted like he had [a gun], but he never showed it.\" It was the petitioner whom Valle described as struggling with Delgado when the gun went off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   When Valle saw the petitioner again at the parole office-out of context from any investigation or prompting-Valle immediately recognized him. When subsequently presented with a photographic array, \"[i]t only took [Valle] three seconds\" to identify the petitioner as \"the one [who] had the gun.\" In response to a question from the prosecutor as to how certain he was of his identification of the petitioner as the murderer, Valle replied, \"I'm positive.\" Simply put, Valle provided strong evidence of the petitioner's guilt by identifying him during a chance encounter, selecting with certainty his photograph from an array, identifying him in court, and providing credible, corroborated testimony about the incident in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Clement provided testimony consistent with Valle's testimony. Clement confirmed that, on the night of the murder, \"[i]t was light ... enough to see\" in the living room, as light was provided by adjoining rooms that did not have doors. Clement came within \"[a] foot or two\" of the robbers, and handed the petitioner his watch, providing him ample opportunity to observe the petitioner and Soler. Clement told the responding police officers, \"I could give you a good description of what [the petitioner and Soler look] like, and if you were to catch them, I could point them out.... More with the guy with the gun.... [T]he guy with the gun, I could-I remembered his clothes pretty good.... And his eyes I could probably catch if I saw him again.\" Clement testified that he had the presence of mind during the robbery to make a concerted effort to remember the\n   gunman's appearance because, based on a prior experience, he knew that he might have to identify the perpetrator. He noted: \"I was enough minded to at least to be able to look the guy in his eyes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Upon viewing the photographic array, Clement stated that, \"right away, there was one photograph that caught my attention.... And then I paused for a second and I wanted to look at the other ones because I didn't want to just give [the detective] an answer right away. I wanted to make sure I got it right.... And I looked at another guy ... briefly, but then I eventually went back to my first instinct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In response to a question from the prosecutor as to how certain Clement was of his identification of the petitioner as the murderer, Clement testified, \"I was pretty sure, 90 percent.\" Clement stated that what made him certain about the identification was the petitioner's \"eyes.... [I]t's more his eyes and pretty much his facial features. I could pretty much tell.\" Clement's memory of the petitioner's facial features lends credibility to his identification, as opposed to reliance on a changeable feature, such as the petitioner's facial hair. At the end of his testimony, Clement made an in-court identification of the petitioner as the person who was carrying the gun during the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In short, both Valle and Clement presented persuasive testimony, selecting with confidence the petitioner's photograph from a photographic array, identifying him in court, and providing testimony consistent with one another's accounts of the evening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In addition to Valle's and Clement's strong testimony, the state provided confession and consciousness of guilt evidence. The petitioner's fellow inmate, Williams, testified that the petitioner had confessed to him that he was the one who shot Delgado that night. Williams testified that the petitioner stated that he used an \"old\n   black Colt .45\" gun and shot Delgado in the neck while Soler ran away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Additionally, consciousness of guilt evidence was presented at trial through Williams' testimony that the petitioner sought to trade favors with him by suggesting that each testify falsely at each other's trials. Williams testified that the petitioner wrote him a letter containing a false story, reversing Soler's and the petitioner's roles, with Soler confessing to the murder to Williams in jail. The petitioner instructed Williams to communicate the letter's contents to his own attorney, who would convey it to the petitioner's attorney and then destroy it. The letter, however, was entered into evidence and contained details largely corroborating Soler's testimony, save for the role reversal. See footnote 1 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Soler's testimony served only to corroborate independent testimony from eyewitnesses Valle and Clement, testimony from Williams, who heard a direct confession from the petitioner himself, and the petitioner's written confession attempting to frame Soler as the gunman. Soler provided very little information about the incident that was not also revealed by Valle, Clement, Williams, and by the petitioner's own written words, rendering much of Soler's testimony duplicative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Moreover, Soler was thoroughly impeached on cross-examination. Although he did not admit to receiving any benefit, he did admit that he was hoping his attorney could do \"[w]hatever she can do\" to make him a good deal on the felony murder charge. Soler also testified that he did not speak to the police until after he was arrested because he was hoping to get away with the crimes. In other words, he conceded opportunistic aspirations for the disposition of his own case, regardless of whether a formal deal existed. Throughout cross-examination, defense counsel continually focused on Soler's motivation to testify consistently with the state's\n   narrative of the case. In fact, Soler admitted that it was only after he was arrested that he was willing to cooperate. Defense counsel also impeached Soler in other ways, underscoring Soler's drug use, voluntary participation in the underlying armed robbery, and the fact that his nickname on the streets is Monstruo-the Spanish word for \"monster.\" Defense counsel told the jury, during closing arguments, that Soler likely testified as a means to have the felony murder charge, and its mandatory minimum\n   sentence, dropped in exchange for testimony favorable to the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Thus, even if jurors believed Soler's allegedly false testimony that he did not have a deal with the prosecutor, their impression was harmful only to the extent that Soler's testimony provided unique value to the state's case. Given the testimony of Valle, Clement, Williams, and the handwritten confession evidence, we are not persuaded that Soler's testimony proved significant aside from its consistency with multiple other witnesses. When Soler's testimony is weighed against the overwhelming strength of the state's case, as we are obligated to do, the elevated standard for materiality is not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In support of his materiality claim, the petitioner principally asserts that \"it is likely that Soler's testimony was extremely influential on the jury,\" and, thus, Soler's hidden motives were \"not harmless.\" He supports this contention by emphasizing that there were \"problems surrounding the state's other witnesses.\" We find these problems to be largely illusory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Most notably, the petitioner contends that \"the tenuous credibility of the testimony of Clement, Valle and Williams,\" was \"insufficient to render Soler's false testimony harmless ....\" Specifically, the petitioner contends that Clement \"felt that he 'had to pick somebody' \" in the photographic array and was \"vacillating between\n   two individuals in the lineup.\" This is an incomplete representation of Clement's testimony. Clement testified that he \"was pretty sure, 90 percent\" confident in his identification of the petitioner as the gunman. He also testified that he intentionally hesitated in making his identification out of an abundance of caution because he \"wanted to make sure [he] got it right.\" He also provided detailed testimony about his memory of the petitioner's facial features, which he purposely studied at the time of the incident because he had the presence of mind to know that he may have to identify the gunman in the future. Moreover, he testified that the officers who presented the photographic array to him \"\n   <em>\n    didn't\n   </em>\n   make it sound like\" he \"had to pick somebody.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The petitioner also asserts that Valle was a weak witness because he \"was consuming alcohol on the evening of the homicide\" and \"did not even witness the fatal shot that was fired ....\" He also emphasizes that \"Valle was serving a sentence in a criminal matter and had not been abiding by the conditions of his 'addiction program.' \" These qualifications, while true, are unpersuasive in discrediting Valle's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Although Valle was consuming alcohol that night, he characterized his consumption as drinking \"a little bit\" and noted that the alcohol he purchased was shared among four individuals. Notably, there was no testimony presented by either Valle or Clement that they were drunk or had consumed excessive amounts of alcohol that evening. At best, the extent to which Valle's alcohol consumption weakens or impairs his testimony is unclear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The petitioner's argument that Valle did not observe the fatal shot being fired is unconvincing. Although he had fled to another room by that time, Valle still had the opportunity to \"see [the petitioner] real good\" and\n   was \"positive\" when he identified the petitioner as the gunman in a photographic array. Although Valle did not know with eyewitness certainty that the petitioner was the one who fired the fatal shot, he did witness the petitioner as the only one with a visible gun and observed that Delgado had begun physically fighting with the armed petitioner immediately before Valle exited the living room and the gun discharged.\n   And, although it is true that Valle was serving a sentence in a criminal matter and was participating unsuccessfully in an addiction program, these facts do not discredit his testimony. On redirect examination, the prosecutor underscored the fact that, in Valle's pending case, he did not use his cooperation in the present case to gain any benefit for the disposition of his own case. As for the noncompliance with his addiction program, in the absence of any additional facts, we see no reason why it would discredit his testimony in any meaningful way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, the petitioner discounts Williams' testimony on the basis of his admission \"that he had an interest in testifying for the state and an expectation of a benefit ....\" Although Williams was somewhat of a \"jailhouse snitch,\" he did testify that it was the petitioner who, in fact, sought him out for help in framing Soler as the gunman. The prosecutor fully exposed Williams' self-interest, appropriately leaving it to the jury to weigh his credibility. Notwithstanding Williams' status as a \"jailhouse snitch,\" the bottom line remains that his testimony concerning the petitioner's story about the events that night was consistent with the other witnesses' accounts. More important, Williams provided the letter as physical evidence corroborating the petitioner's attempt to engineer false testimony to frame Soler as the shooter. Biased or not, Williams' value as a witness stems from his possession of the physical evidence exposing the petitioner's plot to blame his accomplice,\n   demonstrating powerful consciousness of guilt evidence that no level of self-interest could negate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Because we do not find the testimony of Clement, Valle, and Williams \"problematic,\" as the petitioner urges, we disagree that \"[e]xposing Soler's motives would have significantly detracted from the [jury's] crediting\" the testimony of the other witnesses. Given how strong the state's case was, exposing Soler's motives would not have made a meaningful difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In the present case, \"the state's case [was] so overwhelming that there is no reasonable likelihood that [Soler's] false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\" (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20354\">\n    314 Conn. at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20A.3d%201\">\n    102 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After weighing Soler's testimony, its probable effect on the jury, the strength of the state's case, and the extent to which defense counsel was able to impeach Soler, we conclude that Soler's allegedly false testimony and the prosecutor's failure to correct it were immaterial under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   .

See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%20359\">\n    309 Conn. 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 363,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20A.3d%20512\">\n    71 A.3d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Hines\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485004\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/430/#p717\">\n    164 Conn.

Often such representations are made only to the witness' counsel, while the prosecutor's communication with the witness makes clear that there is no promise. Under such circumstances, the prosecutor may not actually know if any representations of possible leniency have been conveyed by the witness' counsel to the witness. Thereafter, if, before the jury, the witness denies that there is any actual \"agreement\" or \"deal,\" the prosecutor can accurately state, as the respondent argues in this case, that he does not have a reason to know if the witness is being untruthful. Although it might very well be accurate that no definitive promises have been made by the state, and, even if any possible outcomes as described to counsel might be \"tentative,\" experienced counsel operating in a courthouse in which he or she is familiar with the practices of prosecutors and presiding judges can comfortably advise the witness of the possible credit that might follow from his testimony. Thus, these \"hypothetical\" outcomes serve as a real incentive to motivate a witness to testify for the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Left out of this equation, however, is the jury. See\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%20359\">\n    309 Conn. at 369-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20A.3d%20512\">\n    71 A.3d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collateral review of conviction obtained by false testimony requires \"a careful review of that testimony and its probable effect on the jury\").

Jurors are not well versed in the nuanced vagaries of such leniency agreements.

Even if the failure to disclose is ultimately found not to be material, the practice of vague understandings can lead to lengthy posttrial inquiries, delaying finality and consuming resources. For example, in the present case, the habeas court was faced with reconstructing and examining, years after the fact, communications that took place-both on the record and off-the-record-during a cooperating witness' pretrial plea negotiations, during that witness' testimony at the trial of his accomplice, or during the witness' ultimate sentencing hearing. This collateral fact-finding might include, as in the present case, attempts to secure testimony from prosecuting authorities or the cooperating witness' counsel. Issues of privilege,\n   availability, and faulty memories are likely to abound.\n   Second, the absence of an express agreement may require a defendant to explore other means to reveal to the jury a cooperating witness' motivation to testify. For example, in an attempt to inform the jury about a system in which promises are not explicitly made but understandings are drawn from pretrial discussions, defendants might resort to calling expert witnesses to attempt to explain to the jury just how much leniency a cooperating witness can expect from his testimony.

This approach has its own disadvantages. In addition to increased costs, it leaves the jury to choose between competing experts without a framework from which to properly assess the significance of those experts' opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, this court or the Rules Committee of the Superior Court could also conclude that this practice should be addressed by the exercise of supervisory authority or the passage of a rule of practice. For example, in federal courts, \"it is standard practice in federal criminal cases for the prosecution to enter into a written cooperation agreement that memorializes the potential\n   benefits that may ensue as a result of a cooperating [witness'] testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Noze\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274790\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/352/#p353\">\n    255 F. Supp. 3d at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The agreements usually contain an express provision that the government is not making any promises as to the level of leniency and that the recommendation for a reduction in the sentence will be based on the level of cooperation provided. Cf. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K1.1 (2016) (upon motion of government that defendant has provided substantial assistance in investigation or prosecution of another, court may depart from sentencing guidelines).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Thus, the risks attendant to the practice of entering into vague, off-the-record, cooperation agreements are completely avoidable. Understandably, the state is concerned about making actual, enforceable promises to the cooperating witness because it does not want to commit to a precise outcome until the witness has testified. However, outlining the terms of its agreement, including the charges and the maximum and minimum exposure to which it has agreed that the witness will be exposed, does not constrain the state any more than the practice of entering into an informal understanding with defense counsel. The state retains the option to deny the witness an opportunity to plead to a reduced charge or to receive a lenient sentence if the witness rescinds the agreement to testify truthfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, the state can avoid the risk that a cooperating witness will engage in perjury by asking the witness leading questions about the nature of the witness' agreement with the state. See\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499579\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/190/851/\">\n    330 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 27 and n.18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499579\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/190/851/\">\n    190 A.3d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Some trial courts find that the better practice is to make a clear record of the nature of the agreement or understanding, including the anticipated charge(s) and the maximum and minimum penalties for those charges. For example, prior to the witness' testimony, on the\n   record but outside the presence of the jury, the\n   court may ask the prosecutor to outline the nature of the agreement-the charges and maximum and minimum penalties-in the presence of the witness, the defendant, and all counsel. Requiring the state to negotiate the parameters of its cooperation agreement with the witness ensures the integrity of the process and protects the state, the witness, and the defendant against the consequences of an undefined vague agreement. This approach not only makes a clear record of the agreement, it eliminates the risk that the disclosure is insufficient or that the witness will testify untruthfully about the nature of the agreement and his expectations. Both sides can examine the witness and argue to the jury the motivation of the witness to testify and how that impacts, if at all, the witness' credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \"We ordinarily invoke our supervisory powers to enunciate a rule that is not constitutionally required but that we think is preferable as a matter of policy.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Medrano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20604\">\n    308 Conn. 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 630,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20A.3d%20503\">\n    65 A.3d 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).

I write separately, however, to discuss briefly the issue that, for purposes of this case, we need not, and do not, decide, that is, whether any such agreement actually existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As the majority explains, at the petitioner's trial, Soler testified that he had been made no promise of any benefit by the assistant state's attorney (prosecutor), that he didn't expect to receive any consideration for his testimony, and that he was testifying solely because it was \"the right thing to do.\" At the habeas trial, the prosecutor's testimony was consistent with Soler's, as was the habeas testimony of the attorney who represented Soler in his\n   criminal case. On the basis of this testimony, the habeas court found that there was no undisclosed agreement, and the Appellate Court upheld\n   the habeas court's determination, even though representations by the prosecutor at Soler's sentencing suggested that he had told Soler's counsel that Soler might well receive a substantial reduction in both the charge and sentence if he testified against the petitioner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, however, the prosecutor elected not to pursue the felony murder charge, and Soler received a total effective prison sentence of nine years, far less than the mandatory minimum twenty-five year sentence he otherwise faced on the felony murder charge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Needless to say, any witness who had reason to believe that he might receive such a benefit for cooperating with the state would have a strong incentive to do so and would be subject to cross-examination concerning that obvious and compelling motivation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Although I have no reason to second guess the habeas court's finding that there was no formal or definitive agreement that Soler would receive a particular benefit in exchange for his testimony, it seems clear that, at the least, there was an understanding between the state and Soler that he would receive consideration in return for his testimony against the petitioner. In fact, the majority acknowledges this fact in commenting on what it characterizes as \"the state's practice\"-employed by the state in the present of case-\"of informal, off-the-record leniency understandings with cooperating witnesses.\" As the majority also recognizes, these understandings\n   \"can prevent defense counsel from effectively impeaching the witness for [interest or] bias, perhaps leaving jurors with the impression ... that [the witness had no] incentive to testify favorably for the state.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) And I also fully agree with the majority's observation that \"[j]urors are not well versed in the nuanced vagaries of such leniency agreements. Yet, we rely on jurors to assess a witness' credibility-including a witness' motivation to testify-while withholding from them critical information that would help them assess just how motivated that witness might be.\" Because it is contrary to the vitally important principles underlying\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]his practice,\" the majority rightly concludes, \"carries with it risks that threaten the ... fair administration of justice.\" Indeed, such understandings, although informal and perhaps somewhat undefined, are no less a motivating factor for a cooperating witness than a more formal cooperation agreement. This is so because, for all practical purposes, an understanding between the state and the witness is really no different from an agreement between the two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   I therefore join the majority in urging that measures be taken, by the state and, if necessary, by the trial court, to ensure that \"understandings\" of the kind at issue in the present case be disclosed to defense counsel so that a cooperating witness may be questioned effectively about that witness' true motivation for testifying. Although it may be understandable, as the majority observes, for the state to be \"concerned\n   about making actual, enforceable promises to the cooperating witness because it does not want to commit to a precise outcome until the witness has testified,\" that concern is readily addressed by the use of a properly crafted cooperation agreement, which is common in virtually all jurisdictions, both federal and state. And although it also is understandable that the state would prefer testimony\n   from a cooperating witness simply denying the existence of any agreement or promise-exactly what occurred in the present case-such testimony does not accurately reflect the true nature of the understanding or arrangement between that witness and the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   It seems clear that written cooperation agreements are the fairest and most accurate way to identify and memorialize any understanding that exists between the state and a cooperating witness. In contrast to the majority, I do not believe that the use of such agreements would present any serious administrative difficulty for the state-those agreements need not be lengthy or complicated-and any modest inconvenience that might result from their use would be far exceeded by their value in promoting fundamental fairness in cases involving cooperating witnesses. That is why in federal court, such agreements are routinely reduced to writing and submitted to the court. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (2018) \u00a7 5K1.1, p. 467. I therefore commend the matter to the Rules Committee of the Superior Court for its review and consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, it is well known that, on the recommendation of the prosecutor, cooperating witnesses in this state invariably receive significant consideration from the court for their cooperation, and, again, that is precisely what happened in the present case. As the majority aptly explains, \"experienced [defense] counsel operating in a courthouse in which he or she is familiar with the practices of prosecutors and presiding judges can comfortably advise the witness of the possible credit that might follow from his [or her] testimony.\" Of course, I have no quarrel with that practice, for the reality is that the state needs to provide an incentive for certain witnesses-many of whom, like Soler, were themselves involved in the underlying crime-to testify on its behalf. Nevertheless, at trial, the state cannot fairly\n   pretend that there is no understanding that the cooperating witness will receive a considerably more lenient sentence than he would have received if he had not cooperated; indeed, it is virtually inconceivable that a witness who decides to cooperate will not have been advised by counsel, in one way or another, that his cooperation will result in a markedly reduced sentence. Consequently, if other approaches to identifying the true nature of that understanding are not undertaken by the state or the trial court, defense counsel may find it necessary to seek a jury instruction explaining that when the cooperating witness is sentenced, he reasonably can expect to receive a very significant benefit-that is, a significant reduction in his sentence-for his cooperation. Such an instruction would help alleviate the serious unfairness that arises when jurors are misled into believing that a cooperating witness-who, unbeknownst to the jurors, can expect to receive a reduced sentence in return for his or her cooperation with the state-is testifying only because \"it's the right thing to do.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   I respectfully concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    More specifically, the prosecutor told the court at Soler's sentencing that \"the state had represented to [Soler's] counsel that, in the event that [the petitioner] chose to proceed to trial and that ... Soler's testimony would be needed and would, in fact, be forthcoming and be proffered truthfully ... the state would sort of come off the felony murder [charge] and charge various counts of robbery or some of the substantive offenses in lieu of ... felony murder since that would have a minimum mandatory of twenty-five years to serve.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    The petitioner, who, according to Soler and other witnesses called by the state, was the shooter, received a total effective prison sentence of thirty-five years.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
