We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The Centennial Connecticut Post Mall (mall) is located at 1201 Boston Post Road in Milford (mall property). Currently owned by Centennial Corporation (Centennial), the mall was previously owned by Westfield Corporation (Westfield). Westfield, and later Centennial, has employed Dan Kiley as the mall's general manager. The mall contracts with Professional Security Consultants for security services. Professional Security Consultants employs Thomas Arnone as security director at the mall, and Arnone reports directly to Kiley. Wilfred Castillo, also an employee of Professional Security Consultants, began working at the mall in November, 2014, and had received calls about the defendant on approximately ten to fifteen occasions prior to November 28, 2015. In each call, the defendant was described as a man carrying a red gas can and was present in one of the parking lots at the mall. In response\n   to the calls, Castillo would find the defendant and tell him that panhandling is not allowed on mall property and that he would have to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During the holiday season, from November through January, the mall hires Milford police officers to support the mall security staff and conduct traffic control at the mall's exterior entrances and exits. The mall pays the city of Milford, which pays the police officers' wages, to work what is described as a \"private duty\n   job.\" On November 27, 2015, Officer Joanna Salati of the Milford Police Department was working for the mall on a private duty job when she observed the defendant walking around on mall property with his gas can.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   She called for a security officer to come out and confirmed with security that the defendant was banned from the mall property. Salati told the defendant that he had been advised several times before that he was banned from the mall property, and she informed the defendant of the property's boundaries. Salati told the defendant that he would be arrested the next time he was found on mall property. Salati saw the defendant leave the mall property and reported the incident to the Milford Police Department, where a report of the incident was generated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The next day, November 28, Salati was again working private duty at the mall when her partner, Detective Steve Noss, also of the Milford Police Department, told her that he had observed the defendant on mall property near Sears. Salati, who was working traffic enforcement at the intersection of Boston Post Road and Cedarhurst Road at the time, called for additional officers. She also told mall security to meet her in the Sears parking lot and began walking in that direction, where she observed the defendant approaching customers with his red gas can. The defendant walked away from Salati as she called his name. The defendant eventually stopped walking, Salati arrested him, and he was transported by other officers to the Milford Police Department. The defendant was charged in a long form information with one count of criminal trespass in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-107(a)(1). The defendant elected a jury trial, and evidence was presented on September 14, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the close of evidence on September 14, 2016, the court held a charge conference on the record. The court preliminarily discussed the defendant's request to charge the jury on the infraction of simple trespass as a lesser included offense to criminal trespass in the first degree. Defense counsel agreed to submit a revised proposed charge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the court also indicated that it would afford the state an opportunity to brief its opposition to the defendant's request. The court stated its intention to decide the issue the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The next morning, defense counsel submitted to the trial court a revised written request that the court charge the jury on the infraction of simple trespass as a lesser included offense to criminal trespass in the first degree. In the written request, defense counsel asked that the court give the following charge: \"If you have unanimously found the defendant not guilty of the crime\n   of criminal trespass in the first degree, you shall then consider the lesser offense of simple trespass. Do not consider the lesser offense until you have unanimously acquitted the defendant of the greater offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"A person is guilty of simple trespass when, knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so, he enters any premises without intent to harm any property. For you to find the defendant guilty of simple trespass, the state must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: first that he entered the premises. Premises is not defined in the law so it has the common meaning. The second element is that he entered knowing he was not licensed or privileged to do so. To be licensed or privileged the defendant must have either\n   consent from the owner of the premises or other authorized person or have some other right to be on the premises. A person acts knowingly with respect to conduct when he is aware that his conduct is of such nature or such circumstances exist.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The state filed a memorandum in opposition to the defendant's request to charge as to the infraction of simple trespass, arguing that (1) the claim fails under the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Whistnant\n   </em>\n   test\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) an infraction should not be submitted to a jury as a lesser included offense of a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court heard oral argument on the defendant's request to charge after counsel gave closing arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court then issued an oral decision denying the request to charge. The court began its discussion by noting the absence of appellate authority directly on point. With respect to the issue of whether the jury should be permitted to decide the facts of a case as it relates to an infraction, the court read\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Steinmann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"745956\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/20/599/#p607\">\n    20 Conn.

See footnotes 1 and 2 of this opinion. The court then instructed the jury, and the jury retired for deliberations. The next day, the jury reached a verdict, finding the defendant guilty of criminal trespass in the first degree. On October 28, 2016, the defendant was sentenced to one year incarceration, execution suspended after four months, followed by two years conditional discharge. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly declined to instruct the jury on the infraction of simple trespass as a lesser included offense of criminal trespass in the first degree. Specifically, he argues that the infraction of simple trespass satisfies all four prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Whistnant\n   </em>\n   test. The state responds that the trial court \"correctly found that an infraction\n   could not be treated as a lesser included offense of a crime.\" The state argues in the alternative that, even if certain infractions could be submitted to a jury as lesser included offenses of crimes, the infraction of \"simple trespass contains an element that criminal trespass in the first degree does not-the lack of intent to harm property.\" Thus, the state argues that the trial court correctly found that the infraction of simple trespass fails to satisfy the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Whistnant\n   </em>\n   . Although we conclude that the defendant's claim fails the third and fourth prongs of\n   <em>\n    Whistnant\n   </em>\n   , we also briefly address the defendant's claim as to the second prong.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We first set forth our standard of review. \"It is well settled that [t]here is no fundamental constitutional right to a jury instruction on every lesser included offense....

The defendant argues that the court wrongly construed the phrase \"without intent to harm any property\" in \u00a7 53a-110a(a) as an element of the infraction of simple trespass. The defendant maintains that the phrase is not an element, but rather \"[i]ts purpose is to alert the police and prosecution that a defendant who commits a trespass but does not damage property may be charged with simple trespass.\" The defendant further argues that if\n   <em>\n    lack\n   </em>\n   of intent was an element, \"the state would be forced to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant's lack of intent to harm the property. The absurd effect of this mandate is that once the state proved the lack of intent, the accused would then be able to successfully defend against the charge by presenting evidence that he or she\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   intend to harm the property.\" The state responds that \"because the lack of intent to harm property is expressly set forth in [\u00a7] 53a-110a (a), this court must construe it as an element of simple trespass when contrasting the infraction with criminal trespass in the first degree as alleged in the information.\" The state relies on the principle of statutory interpretation providing that statutes must be construed so that no clause shall be superfluous, citing, inter alia,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Agron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487868\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1052/#p638\">\n    323 Conn. 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 638,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487868\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1052/#p638\">\n    148 A.3d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We agree with the defendant and reject the state's argument that the lack of intent to harm property is an element of simple trespass. Reading the statute as the state suggests would lead to the absurd and unworkable result that a defendant could defend against a charge\n   of simple trespass by merely introducing evidence of an intent to harm property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z ;\n   <em>\n    Tomlinson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tomlinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%20539\">\n    305 Conn. 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 554,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20A.3d%20112\">\n    46 A.3d 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (\"we read each statute in a manner that will not thwart its intended purpose or lead to absurd results\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).

The defendant argues that an examination of the evidence and arguments at trial show that this element was sufficiently in dispute. Specifically, he claims that \"there was insufficient evidence that the security department, a separate entity from the mall, had the requisite authority to ban the defendant from the property for any length of time beyond 24 hours.\" He argues that the evidence established reasonable doubt as to \"the authority of security\n   and, by extension, Officer Salati, for banning the defendant from the property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendant contends that although the criminal trespass statute requires that the defendant obtain his knowledge from a clear, unequivocal order, personally conveyed by the property's owner or his agent, \"knowledge under the simple trespass statute can be gleaned from circumstances and does not have to be explicitly communicated.\" According to the defendant, the jury could have found that the order was insufficient to convey the knowledge required for a conviction of criminal trespass in the first degree but was sufficient to satisfy the knowledge element contained in the simple trespass statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Our resolution of the defendant's claim requires a review of the evidence presented at trial as to the element in dispute. The state presented Castillo's testimony that he previously had told the defendant that panhandling is not allowed on mall property and that he would have to leave. The state also presented Salati's testimony that she told the defendant, on the day before he was arrested, that he was banned from the mall property and that he would be arrested the next time he was found there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendant's defense at trial was that the state had failed to present evidence that the owner of the property had given either Salati or Castillo authority to ban\n   the defendant from the mall property. The defendant introduced into evidence a \"Lesson Plan,\" which was provided by Professional Security Consultants' corporate office to Arnone for purposes of training his staff. That document provides, under the heading of \"Temporary Suspension,\" as follows: \"Suspend the privilege of being on the property for an amount of time\n   that is determined by the severity of the incident and local and state ordinance.

He further argued that the state had failed to present evidence that Westfield, the owner of the mall property, gave authority to ban the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Arnone testified that, although there was no other written procedure, the \"Lesson Plan\" did not guide the day-to-day practices at the mall. Specifically, he stated that the \"Lesson Plan\" was \"not the end all be all of the policy or what we are expected to do as a security staff as far as banning goes.\" Arnone testified that security can ban someone from the property for either six months or one year and that bans are reviewed by\n   Arnone or his assistant, or Dan Kiley, the general manager of the mall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Arnone testified: \"[W]e [issue] anywhere from 360 to 370 [bans] a year.\" Arnone stated that a ban notice is created for each ban, which notice includes \"basic information on the person as well as a photo, if one is able to be obtained, as well as the time period that they are banned, the start date, end date, as well as their offense that they've committed, and whether or not we were able to obtain a signature from the individual.\" Arnone testified that the forms \"are finalized through me or my assistant, and then they go one step further and are further finalized and reviewed by the general manager\" of the mall. When Castillo was asked whether he had any personal knowledge as to whether the defendant signed a ban notice in this case, he responded: \"No, by the time I got there he was already in the back of the police car so I couldn't have him sign it.\" Castillo testified that the defendant \"was already banned previously.\" Specifically,\n   he said that the defendant was banned from mall property on July 9, 2015, and that the ban was in place for one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Arnone further testified that there were two ban notices on file in the security office for the defendant, dated July 9, 2015, and November 28, 2015. Arnone, however, was not present when either form was created and could not say whether the defendant received either form. No ban notice was introduced into evidence, and no further detail of any incident occurring on July 9, 2015, was presented to the jury. Based on the July 9, 2015 ban notice, both Arnone and Castillo testified that the defendant was not permitted to be on mall property in November, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendant also challenged Salati's authority, introducing into evidence the Milford Police Department \"General Orders\" regarding \"Off Duty Arrest Powers.\" That policy provides in part, under the heading\n   \"Permitted Off-Duty Arrests,\" as follows: \"When off-duty and within the legal jurisdiction of this law enforcement agency, an officer may make an arrest only when ... (ii) There is an immediate need to prevent a crime or apprehend a suspect; especially those crimes involving the infliction of physical injury to another ....\" It further provides, under the heading \"Prohibited Off-Duty Arrests,\" as follows: \"Officers of this Department may not make an arrest off-duty: ... (iii) When the arrest is made solely as enforcement of a minor traffic regulation, or the violation is minor in nature and does not require an in-custody arrest for the violation.\" Lastly, under the heading \"Off-Duty Responsibilities,\" it provides: \"Except as allowed by this policy off-duty officers should not enforce minor violations such as harassment, disorderly conduct, or other nuisance offenses. On-duty personnel shall be contacted to respond to the situation where an off-duty officer becomes aware of such violations.\" When asked whether she violated that policy in arresting the defendant, Salati testified: \"I guess you can say that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Arnone testified that Milford police officers working on private duty for the mall are permitted to ask individuals to leave mall property. He further testified, however, that he prefers that his security staff initiate any interaction with patrons and customers and that the police officer who is working private duty support the security staff if necessary. When asked whether mall security policy is that security takes the lead on interactions with people on mall property, Salati responded: \"I don't know what their policy is.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Our Supreme Court has held that, in order to satisfy the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Whistnant\n   </em>\n   , \"there must be sufficient\n   evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, to justify a finding of guilt of the lesser offense,\" and has \"rejected the proposition that a defendant is entitled to instructions on lesser included offenses based on merely theoretical or possible scenarios.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"389281\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/235/67/#p78\">\n    235 Conn. 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 78,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=663%20A.2d%20972\">\n    663 A.2d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995).

He claims that the state \"did not produce any evidence that the defendant was told how long he was banned from the property\" and points to his argument at trial that the defendant \"may have thought each order to leave lasted only ... until the end of the day.\" If the jury was to credit that argument, it then could not have found that the defendant knew he was not privileged to be on mall property on November 28, 2015, because the jury was not presented with any other source of knowledge from which the defendant could become aware that he was not privileged to enter or remain on mall property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence introduced during the trial was such that the jury could not have found that the defendant knew that he was not privileged to enter or remain on mall property; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-110a ; if he had not received \"an order to leave or not to enter personally communicated to\n   [him by an] authorized person.\" See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-107(a)(1). Specifically, under the facts of this case, if the jury was to reject the evidence presented by the state that the defendant received an order not to enter from an authorized person, i.e., Castillo or Salati, there was no other evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, from which the jury could have found that the defendant knew he was not privileged to enter or remain on mall property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Indeed, one potential outcome of the trial was that the jury credited the documentary evidence in the form of the Lesson Plan and Off Duty Arrest Powers documents to conclude that the state had not proven that the owner of the property had authorized Castillo and/or Salati to personally communicate an order to the defendant to leave or not to enter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury accordingly\n   could have found the defendant not guilty of criminal trespass in the first degree. However, if the jury credited that documentary evidence and disbelieved the testimony of Arnone and Castillo that they, and by extension Salati, possessed authority to issue a one year ban, there\n   would be no factual basis for the jury to find that the defendant knew that he was not privileged to be on mall property. The jury would have had to find the defendant not guilty of the infraction of simple trespass as well. Therefore, the defendant was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction under\n   <em>\n    Whistnant\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In sum, we conclude, as a matter of law, that the evidence presented before the jury excludes the possibility that the defendant could be found not guilty of criminal trespass in the first degree, but then be found guilty of the infraction of simple trespass.

If a banned subject refuses to leave the center's property, the Security Supervisor will retrieve all documentation of the banned subject, Security will contact the local police department, and have him/her arrested for trespassing.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Castillo also testified that he was permitted to issue a one year ban.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Although there was evidence of mall policies posted at the entrance to the mall building, none of the witnesses testified that they had ever seen the defendant inside the mall.

The former \u00a7 14-227a(d)(4) provided that a blood alcohol level of 'ten-hundredths of one per cent or more ... shall be prima facie evidence that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor within the meaning of this section.' That section thus created only a rebuttable presumption that a person was 'under the influence of intoxicating liquor' where his or her blood alcohol level was found to equal or exceed .1 percent. While evidence of such an alcohol level was sufficient to establish the state's prima facie case, the defendant was formerly allowed to introduce evidence to show that, despite a blood alcohol level equal to or greater than .1 percent, he or she had not been\n    <em>\n     under the influence\n    </em>\n    of intoxicating liquor at the time of arrest. Thus, although in the present case the defendant's blood alcohol level was measured at .165 percent, the possibility that she was merely impaired, and not under the influence, cannot be excluded as a matter of law under the former General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a(d)(4).\" (Emphasis in original; footnote omitted.)\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Hancich\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559565\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/615/#p619\">\n     200 Conn. at 620-21\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%20638\">\n     513 A.2d 638\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    As further support for his argument that he challenged the knowledge element of criminal trespass in the first degree, the defendant references his argument that \"Salati was not totally credible because she was especially preoccupied with ejecting the defendant from the property.\" We fail to see how any preoccupation on Salati's part could affect a jury finding as to whether the defendant knew that he was not privileged to enter or remain on mall property.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    See\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     LoSacco\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1970903\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/12/172/#p176\">\n     12 Conn.

In\n    <em>\n     LoSacco\n    </em>\n    , this court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the defendant's conviction for criminal trespass in the first degree on the basis that the state had failed to prove that the defendant had been \"ordered personally by the owner of the premises, or other authorized person, not to enter the building.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%201348\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    Although a tenant of the building previously had personally communicated to the defendant an order not to enter the building, there was no evidence that the building superintendent or any other agent of the owner had conferred authority on the tenant to order the defendant not to enter the public lobby of the apartment complex.

The court stated that although the jury could have concluded that the building superintendent had conferred such authority upon a police officer who responded to a previous incident involving the defendant, that officer did not testify, and the defendant denied that the officer issued an order to him. Thus, there was \"no evidence of the words spoken\" between the officer and the defendant.

The court noted the testimony of the mall's operations manager that he considered the security guards to be his agents. The court concluded that evidence supported the jury's finding that the banning guidelines, which provided in part that security could only ban individuals for the remainder of the business day, were suggestions rather than mandatory procedures that security guards must follow.
