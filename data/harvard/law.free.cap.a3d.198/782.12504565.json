Doe now appeals from a judgment entered by the Superior Court (Androscoggin County,\n   <em>\n    MG Kennedy, J.\n   </em>\n   ) that affirmed the Department's decision to deny Doe's request. Doe challenges the Department's denial as,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a violation of his procedural due process rights. Given the unique timing of the substantiation at issue here, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] The parties do not dispute the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3] On October 1, 2003, the Department mailed a letter to Doe informing him that he had been substantiated for sexual abuse of a minor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter explained the basis for the Department's substantiation finding and stated that Doe had the right \"to request a review of the assessment record ... in writing within thirty [ ] calendar days.\" Doe acknowledges that he did not write the Department within thirty days after October 1, 2003, to request a review of his substantiation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] When the Department substantiated Doe in October of 2003, a \"paper review\"-established by a 2000 Department policy (the 2000 policy)-was the only appeal process available to an individual wishing to challenge a substantiation finding; there was no opportunity for any sort of hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Me. Dep't Health &amp; Human Servs.,\n   <em>\n    Review of Substantiation Decisions of Child Abuse and Neglect\n   </em>\n   , Child &amp; Fam. Servs. Manual (2000) [hereinafter 2000 Policy]. The 2000 policy purportedly applied to \"all official findings of child abuse or neglect [that were] substantiated on or after February 1, 2000,\" and it set forth the process by which the Department attempted to comply with the Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As the Department conceded at oral argument, it did not adopt the 2000 policy pursuant to the Maine Administrative Procedure Act (APA). 5 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8001 - 11008 (2017) ; 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 42(1) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] In November of 2003-a month after Doe received his substantiation letter-the Department adopted formal rules for substantiation appeals (the 2003 rules) pursuant to the APA's emergency rulemaking provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 8054 (2017) ; 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 42(1) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.M.R.%2010\">\n    18 C.M.R. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   148 201 \u00a7 XI (effective Nov. 1, 2003). The 2003 rules created the opportunity for a person whose substantiation was upheld after a paper review to request an administrative hearing in order to challenge the Department's substantiation finding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.M.R.%2010\">\n    18 C.M.R. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   148 201 \u00a7\u00a7 IV(E), V(B) (effective Nov. 1, 2003). Despite the promulgation of the formal rules in November of 2003, the Department's 2000 policy was still in effect when Doe received his substantiation letter and thus it is that policy-and not the 2003 rules-that apply here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.M.R.%2010\">\n    18 C.M.R. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   148 201 \u00a7 XI (effective Nov. 1, 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6] One day after the Department mailed Doe his substantiation letter, a Sagadahoc County grand jury handed down an indictment charging him with eight counts of gross sexual assault (Class A),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and eight counts of unlawful sexual contact (Class C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In January of 2004, a jury convicted Doe on all sixteen counts; we upheld the conviction but, after Doe's successful post-conviction review and a subsequent retrial in 2009, a second jury acquitted Doe of all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 7] In 2008, while Doe's criminal case was unfolding, the Department promulgated yet another version of the substantiation-appeal rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.M.R.%2010\">\n    18 C.M.R. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   148 201 \u00a7\u00a7 I-XIV (effective Oct. 1, 2008). The 2008 rules created procedures by which an individual could retroactively request an administrative hearing to review his substantiation, but only if (1) he had been substantiated before November of 2003 and (2) he had timely requested a paper review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.M.R.%2010\">\n    18 C.M.R. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   148 201 \u00a7 XIV (effective Oct. 1, 2008). There is no indication in the record that the Department notified any of the individuals substantiated before November of 2003 of the opportunity for a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 8] In January of 2017, the Department notified Doe that, based on his 2003 substantiation, his presence in a home where children were residing could lead to the removal of those children. On February 23, 2017, Doe requested a hearing to review his 2003 substantiation, and on April 21, 2017, the Department denied, as untimely, Doe's request:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. [Doe]'s request has been denied due to his failure to request a review in a\n   timely manner following his receipt of his notice that the Department had made a finding against him. It is clearly stated in Mr. [Doe]'s letter that if he wished to request a review, he needed to make that request in writing within thirty calendar days of the date he received the notice. Mr. [Doe] signed for the notice on October 4, 2003.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 9] Doe asked the Department to reconsider its denial. The Department refused, prompting Doe to petition the Superior Court (Androscoggin County) for a review of the Department's denial pursuant to Rule 80C of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 80C ; 5 M.R.S. \u00a7 11002 (2017). The Superior Court affirmed the Department's decision. Doe timely appealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 11008(1) (2017) ; 14 M.R.S. 1851 (2017); M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 10] Doe challenges the Department's denial of his request for a hearing to review his 2003 substantiation. Specifically, Doe asserts that the Department's 2000 policy is judicially unenforceable and that the Department's refusal to review his substantiation violated his procedural and substantive due process rights, as well as his equal protection rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 11] Generally, \"[w]hen the Superior Court acts in an intermediate appellate capacity pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 80C, we review the administrative agency's decision directly for errors of law, abuse of discretion, or findings not supported by substantial evidence in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Manirakiza v.

The Department's 2000 Policy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 12] Doe first argues that the Department's 2000 policy is not judicially enforceable because it was not promulgated according to the APA, and therefore Doe's failure to request a paper review in 2003 cannot be used by the Department to bar his 2017 request for a review. The APA provides that an agency rule \"is not judicially enforceable unless it is adopted in a manner consistent with [the APA].\" 5 M.R.S. \u00a7 8002(9) (2017). There are certain procedures that an agency must follow when promulgating rules, such as,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , providing public notice and submitting the proposed rules to the Attorney General for approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8052, 8053, 8056. There are also APA requirements for emergency rulemaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 8054. \"Rules adopted in a manner other than that prescribed by [the APA] are void and of no legal effect ....\" 5 M.R.S. \u00a7 8057(1) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 13] The Department's letter notifying Doe that he had been substantiated stated that Doe had \"thirty calendar days\" to appeal the substantiation finding, but no such thirty-day appeal period is found in the Department's 2000 policy-the 2000 policy referenced an appeal period of only ten days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2000 Policy (explaining that the Department must include the following statement in all letters to substantiated individuals: \"[y]ou must request this review in writing with [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] TEN days of receiving this notice\"). Even if the letter had correctly quoted the appeal period in the 2000 policy-ten days-\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   appeal period would be unenforceable because the 2000 policy was not promulgated pursuant to the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 8057(1) ; 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 42(1). The thirty-day appeal period\n   mentioned in the letter is unenforceable because the 2003 rules had not yet gone into effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.M.R.%2010\">\n    18 C.M.R. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   148 201 \u00a7 XI (effective Nov. 1, 2003). Because there is no judicially enforceable appeal period that relates to Doe's 2003 substantiation, Doe's failure to request a paper review in 2003 cannot act as a bar to his request for a review in 2017. The Department's refusal to review Doe's 2003 substantiation because he failed to \"request a review in a timely manner\" is thus misguided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 8057(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B. Procedural Due Process\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 14] Doe also argues that the Department's refusal to review his 2003 substantiation violates his procedural due process rights pursuant to the United States and Maine Constitutions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1 ; Me. Const. art. I, \u00a7 6-A. Specifically, Doe asserts that he was never provided an opportunity for a hearing before an impartial factfinder and that the Department's 2003 letter did not provide him with notice of the collateral consequences of his substantiation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b6 15] \"No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\" Me. Const. art. I, \u00a7 6-A ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1 (\"[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\").

He did not become aware of these consequences until 2017, at which time he requested a hearing.
