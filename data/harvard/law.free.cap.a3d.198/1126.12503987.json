In addition, the Pledgers appeal from the July 11, 2014 order granting partial summary judgment in favor of Janssen on the Pledgers' punitive damages claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After review, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We provide the following background. Austin was born in 1994. In 2000, Austin, who was living with his parents about an hour outside of Birmingham, Alabama, was diagnosed as having autism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In April 2002, Mrs. Pledger took Austin to meet Dr. Jan Mathisen, a pediatric neurologist in Birmingham[,]\" in an effort to \"relieve behavioral symptoms including temper tantrums.\" Trial Court Opinion, 8/11/2017, at 3;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.T., 1/26/2015 (p.m.), at 44. Dr. Mathisen first saw Austin on April 22, 2002, and Dr. Mathisen and Mrs. Pledger discussed Austin's autism diagnosis and the potential for medication that may help him. At Austin's next visit, on June 17, 2002, Dr. Mathisen prescribed Risperdal\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to Austin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Mathisen warned Mrs. Pledger \"that weight gain was possible\" as a side effect of taking Risperdal. Trial Court Opinion, 8/11/2017, at 4 (citing N.T., 1/26/2015 (p.m.), at 57. Mrs. Pledger believed, however, that \"this [risk] was acceptable because she thought [weight gain] could be mitigated by diet.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Austin did indeed gain weight, and Mrs. Pledger noticed that about two-and-a-half months after Austin began taking Risperdal, he \"started getting heavy around his nipples.\" N.T., 2/6/2015 (a.m.), at 71. A 2005 photograph of Austin with his shirt off reveals enlargement in his chest area.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Exhibit 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Around November 2006, Mrs. Pledger sought to switch Austin to a different doctor, Dr. Donald Paoletti. Dr. Paoletti discontinued Austin's use of Risperdal in April 2007. The last time Austin saw Dr. Mathisen was in October of 2006, and Dr. Mathisen's last refill for Austin's Risperdal occurred on January 19, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Around October 2011, Mrs. Pledger saw a commercial on television about the potential for Risperdal to cause a condition called gynecomastia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   She called the telephone number for the law firm on the television, and then sent in pictures of Austin as she was asked to do. It was at that time she learned that there may be a connection between Austin's Risperdal use and his large breasts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April 2012, the Pledgers filed a complaint against Janssen, which included claims asserting\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Janssen's negligence in failing to warn physicians and patients that Risperdal could cause gynecomastia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   That complaint also contained a\n   count for punitive damages. On February 10, 2014, Janssen filed a global motion for partial summary judgment with respect to several of the claims common to all cases, including the punitive damages claim. On July 11, 2014, the trial court granted partial summary judgment on\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the punitive damages claim as to all cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Austin's case proceeded to a jury trial beginning January 20, 2015, and did not conclude until February 24, 2015. There were numerous issues in the case, all of which were vigorously contested by both the Pledgers and Janssen. By way of overview, the Pledgers sought to prove that Janssen \"had discovered a significant risk of gynecomastia among boys who ingested Risperdal for eight through twelve weeks and had demonstrated elevated prolactin levels while taking the drug.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial Court Opinion, 8/11/2017, at 5. According to the Pledgers, despite Janssen knowing that information, it did not communicate this risk to the FDA or to doctors prescribing Risperdal. In support of this claim, the Pledgers presented testimony of their expert, Dr. David Kessler, Federal Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner from 1991-1997.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Kessler testified that data collected at Table 21 showed [a] statistically significant side effect among children taking Risperdal between 8 and 12 weeks. In Dr. Kessler's opinion, Table 21 showed that children taking Risperdal within this time period, and had elevated prolactin levels, were 7.8 percent more likely to develop gynecomastia than children taking Risperdal whose prolactin level had remained normal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 5-6 (citing N.T., 1/29/2015 (p.m.), at 30-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Janssen acknowledged that Table 21 was never shared with the FDA. N.T., 2/11/2015 (p.m.), at 114. Moreover, because this information was never shared with the FDA, and was not on Risperdal's label in 2002 at the time Dr. Mathisen prescribed Risperdal to Austin, Dr. Mathisen believed \"any association between Risperdal and gynecomastia was rare\" and never checked \"Austin's prolactin levels\" or examined him for gynecomastia. Trial Court Opinion, 8/11/2017, at 6 (citing N.T., 1/26/2015 (p.m.), at 104). Dr. Mathisen further testified that \"he would have discussed the relationship between Risperdal and gynecomastia with Mrs. Pledger had he known of the data in Table 21.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   In addition, Mrs. Pledger testified that had she known about the risk of gynecomastia, she would not have permitted Austin to take Risperdal. N.T., 2/6/2015 (a.m.), at 58-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Janssen also vigorously contested causation; in other words, Janssen claimed that Austin's large chest area was not caused by his taking Risperdal. In order to prove that Austin did indeed have gynecomastia caused by Risperdal, the Pledgers presented the testimony of Dr. Mark Solomon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Dr. Solomon explained his medical opinion that the diagnosis of [ ] gynecomastia depends on the presence of\n   breast tissue and he explained that breast tissue is biologically not the same as fat tissue. He showed the jury the difference using medical slides. Dr. Solomon stated breast tissue growth does not go away on its own since it does not come from obesity which is characterized by fat cells that grow and recede depending on weight. Dr. Solomon testified that his own physical examination of Austin confirmed the presence of breast tissue inside Austin's breasts. Dr. Solomon said Austin had been on Risperdal for several years and his medical records had reported no other causal agent. He said female breasts in boys develop from the center and then spread outwards. The areola grows first and then breast tissue multiplies around the areola to form gynecomastia. Dr. Solomon told the jury that a picture of Austin shows what he termed \"end stage growth.\" Pointing at the 2005 picture of 11[-]year[-]old bare[-]chested Austin coming out of a swimming pool, Dr. Solomon testified, \"That's a full breast. That's not a little nipple out pouch. In 2005, he was 11 that would be the beginning of puberty. So if it were pubertal in origin, you would see a little pouch of a nipple, not an outline of a breast.\" (N.T., 2/9/[20]15, [at] 66.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Trial Court Opinion, 8/11/2017, at 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Janssen conceded that Austin had gynecomastia, but also contended that Austin had a condition called pseudogynecomastia, \"a disease category diagnosed by some physicians who link obesity and fat to the development of feminine looking breasts in boys.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 28. According to defense expert, Dr. Tom Vaughn, III, an endocrinologist, Austin had both gynecomastia and pseudogynecomastia. N.T., 2/18/2015 (a.m.), at 105. Dr. Vaughn testified that pseudogynecomastia is \"obesity... in the chest, and sometimes it can look very much like breast tissue.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 104. Dr. Vaughn stated that Risperdal caused Austin's weight gain, which caused his pseudogynecomastia.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 107. In addition, Dr. Vaughn testified that he could not tell from the 2005 picture whether Austin had gynecomastia or pseudogynecomastia at that point. N.T., 2/18/2015 (p.m.), at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to the foregoing, Janssen suggested that even if Austin's large chest area at that time were gynecomastia, it was not caused by Risperdal. Dr. Vaughn testified that Austin's gynecomastia was not caused by Risperdal, but instead was caused by puberty. N.T., 2/18/2015 (p.m.), at 33-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On the other hand, the Pledgers relied upon Dr. Solomon's testimony. He testified that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   to a reasonable degree of medical certainty ... Austin's ingestion of Risperdal caused his gynecomastia.... Dr. Solomon said he based his causation opinion in part by performing a differential diagnosis and told the jury why he ruled out other causes. Dr. Solomon testified that in his opinion gynecomastia does not develop in pre-puberty boys absent an abnormality caused by disease or an outside agent such as a medication. Reviewing Austin's medical records, Dr. Solomon saw no evidence of a disease causing Austin's gynecomastia. He specifically ruled out other known causes which were not present in Austin's medical history including the absence of Kl[ine]felter's syndrome, thyroid abnormality, or either pituitary or testicular tumors. \"Absent another cause, another drug, another tumor, another kind of anything, a normal 8[-]year[-]old boy has a zero incidence of gynecomastia.\" (N.T., 2/9/[20]15, [at] 106 [ ] ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Dr. Solomon testified that in his medical opinion, based on all the evidence before him, Risperdal was the only remaining variable and he told the jury why:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [S]o, briefly, Risperdal is a drug that among its side effects, it's a stimulant of prolactin which is this hormone that we talked about briefly that's secreted by the pituitary gland and acts on the breast tissue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   He was exposed to this drug at the age of 8. If you review literature, in 8 to 12 weeks from exposure to the drug, prolactin goes up, significantly. And his response to that significant rise, time related according to his mom, was the development of some breast buds which she didn't rightfully connect, because she wouldn't. He stayed on that drug for five years. I believe until 2007. So that he had a constant stimulus with elevations in prolactin for some prolonged period of time that we can - I'm sure occurred. I have no reason not to think it occurred because of my knowledge of the drug, and therefore, it stimulated his breasts to grow.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Trial Court Opinion, 8/11/2017, at 26-27 (quoting N.T., 2/9/2015 (a.m.), at 104-105).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Janssen suggested that even if Austin had gynecomastia that was caused by Risperdal, Dr. Mathisen was primarily at fault because the label for Risperdal revealed that ingestion could increase prolactin levels.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Janssen acknowledges that the label in 2002 stated that gynecomastia was \"rare,\" that label also stated that Risperdal increased prolactin levels.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Exhibit 10; N.T., 1/26/2015 (p.m.), at 120. Thus, according to Janssen, Dr. Mathisen had sufficient knowledge to discuss this risk with Mrs. Pledger prior to prescribing Risperdal for Austin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nevertheless, on February 24, 2015, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Pledgers, concluding that Janssen was negligent in not adequately warning Dr. Mathisen about the risk of gynecomastia to Austin from his taking Risperdal, and that this negligence was a cause of Austin's gynecomastia. The jury awarded Austin $2.5 million in damages. Janssen timely filed post-trial motions, which were denied on May 4, 2016. The Pledgers entered judgment on June 8, 2016, and both Janssen and the Pledgers timely filed notices of appeal. The trial court filed its opinion on August 11, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Appeal of Janssen\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, Janssen presents several issues for our review.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Janssen's Brief at 6-7. We begin with Janssen's contention that the trial court erred in denying judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) because the Pledgers \"failed to prove that any alleged inadequacy in Risperdal's labeling\" caused Austin's gynecomastia.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 41. In considering this issue, we set forth the following. \"The standard which we employ when reviewing the denial of a motion of directed verdict and a motion for [JNOV] is the same. We will reverse the [trial] court when we find an abuse of discretion or an error of law that controlled the outcome of the case.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jones v.

However, at trial and on appeal, Janssen contends that it did not breach that duty. In considering a breach of duty in the context of a pharmaceutical failure to warn case, \"Alabama courts follow the learned-intermediary doctrine, and thus, a manufacturer's duty to warn a consumer about a drug is limited to an obligation to advise the prescribing physician of any potential dangers that may result from the drug's use.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Stephens v.

First, Janssen claims that \"Dr. Mathisen was 'well aware' Risperdal may elevate prolactin and potentially cause prolactin[-]related side effects like gynecomastia.\" Janssen's Brief at 42. Thus, according to Janssen, Dr. Mathisen had all of the information he needed to warn the Pledgers, but he failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"[T]he causal link between a patient's injury and the alleged failure to warn is broken when the prescribing physician had 'substantially the same' knowledge as an adequate warning from the manufacturer should have communicated to him.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Christopher v. Cutter Labs.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572995\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/53/1184/#p1192\">\n    53 F.3d 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1192 (11th Cir. 1995). Here, the question then is whether the 2002 Risperdal label adequately warned Dr. Mathisen of the risk of gynecomastia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the time Dr. Mathisen first prescribed Risperdal to Austin, the warning label stated that gynecomastia was \"rare,\" meaning it occurred \"in fewer than 1/1000 [ (.001%) of] patients.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Exhibit 10. In addition, that label provided that \"[a]s with any other drugs that antagonize dopamine D [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] receptors, risperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   N.T., 1/28/2015 (p.m.), at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At the time Dr. Mathisen initially prescribed Risperdal to Austin, Dr. Mathisen had no reason to believe that Risperdal would have any different effect on Austin's prolactin level than any other drug in its class. This is clearly not \"substantially the same\" knowledge that the risk of gynecomastia was 23 times what Dr. Mathisen reasonably believed it to be. Thus, viewing the testimony in the light most favorable to the Pledgers, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying JNOV on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Janssen also contends that because Dr. Mathisen's final refill for Austin occurred in January of 2007, after the updated October 2006 label was available, it was Dr. Mathisen's failure to read the updated warning that actually caused Austin's gynecomastia. Janssen's Brief at 43-44. In considering this issue, we point out that Janssen's own studies revealed that it was the elevation in prolactin during weeks eight through twelve of administration that was causally related to gynecomastia.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Trial Court Opinion, 8/11/2017, at 5. By 2006, Austin was well beyond this point. In fact, the 2005 photograph shown at trial reveals that Austin already had increased breast size.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Exhibit 71. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying JNOV based upon Dr. Mathisen's final refill for Risperdal because the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict-winner, the Pledgers, showed the damage from Risperdal had already been done to Austin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, Janssen argues it is entitled to JNOV because Dr. Mathisen still prescribes Risperdal to minors today, even though the label has been updated to identify the additional risks related to elevated prolactin and gynecomastia. Janssen's Brief at 42-43. However, the issue is whether an adequate warning in 2002 would have changed Dr. Mathisen's prescribing habits. Dr. Mathisen testified specifically that if he were aware of the 2.3% risk of gynecomastia in 2002, it would not have been a rare event and \"[h]e would have brought up the potential for that problem.\" N.T., 1/26/2015 (p.m.), at 80. In fact, Dr. Mathisen testified that he tells patients about the risk of gynecomastia when prescribing Risperdal today.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 194, 207.

He examined Austin and diagnosed him with gynecomastia. Austin's parents gave Dr. Goldstein an oral medical history.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   On March 31, 2014, Dr. Goldstein signed an expert report based on the physical examination, the parents' oral history, written medical records and deposition testimony. Dr. Goldstein's report includes his opinion as an expert in pediatric endocrinology that \"the treatment of children and adolescents with [r]isperidone causes gynecomastia\"; that Austin has \"very enlarged breasts primarily due to gynecomastia\" and that Austin's treatment with [r]isperidone between 2002 and 2007 is \"a substantial contributing factor to the development of Austin's gynecomastia.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The [law] firm disclosed Dr. Goldstein's expert report to [Janssen's] Philadelphia attorneys at Drinker Biddle within the case management time frame set by Judge Arnold L. New, Mass Torts Supervising Judge. Soon after, on April 16, 2014, Dr. Goldstein appeared for a deposition conducted by Janssen attorney and Drinker Biddle partner Thomas Campion, Esq. Mr. Campion asked Dr. Goldstein whether he was \"practicing medicine\" on March 5, 2014[,] when he examined Austin. Dr. Goldstein said that he was \"hesitating\" in saying he had not been \"practicing medicine\" but only because he had told Austin's parents \"a couple of things [he] would recommend they did, but not under [his] care, like go to your doctor and do this and do that.\" (N.T. 4/16/[20]14, p. 43).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Trial Court Opinion, 8/11/2017, at 15-16 (some citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   No issues were raised with respect to Dr. Goldstein's competency to testify during the period provided for in the case management order.

The Pledgers also informed the court that Dr. Goldstein was now unwilling to testify because of concern about his potential for criminal legal exposure, and he was unavailable to the Pledgers because he had left Pennsylvania. Thus, the Pledgers requested that the trial court permit them to re-open discovery, have Austin fly to Philadelphia with his father, and then be examined by a new expert. The trial court agreed to permit the Pledgers to switch experts mid-trial, and Janssen objected and moved for a mistrial, which the trial court denied.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-24-74\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-24-74\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-24-74\">\n    at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; N.T., 2/3/2015, at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Austin was then examined by Dr. Mark Solomon, a doctor familiar to Janssen because Dr. Solomon was also an expert in another Risperdal case that had just settled.

Prolactin has several ways it acts on the breast.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   It will cause the breast to grow. Then, in women-and in men, it can do this too-it will cause the breasts to secret[e] milk. That's the direct effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   There's also an indirect effect that's discussed, where it suppresses the testosterone, which boosts estrogen, which also acts upon the breast almost synergistically, meaning, the two together are a bigger punch than either one alone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   So if you look at the data, what I see, the internal documents are also published, but the internal documents break down in a graphic way, patient takes the drug. Prolactin goes up and typically, at a period after some weeks of exposure to the drug, patient starts developing breasts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   There are table after table of these [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] history of Tim, where he was given the drug in '06.

It's plain as day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   This is all consistent with that, plus the history, plus the subsequent finding of breast tissue, is all consistent with the fact that Risperdal was the insinuating agent to elevate prolactin, which has a direct effect on breast tissue which gave [Stange] gynecomastia [ ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   There is nothing scientifically novel about using differential diagnosis to conclude that Stange's gynecomastia was caused by Risperdal. Certainly differential diagnosis is a generally accepted methodology; indeed, Janssen does not dispute the validity of differential diagnosis generally.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cummins,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   [ ] 846 A.2d [at] 151 [ ] ( [holding]\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Frye\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   did not apply where the methodology employed by the plaintiffs' medical experts was generally accepted among the medical community for diagnosis and treatment; plaintiffs' experts analyzed plaintiff-wife's medical records and relied upon\n   their personal expertise to reach a conclusion regarding the source of her injuries).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Janssen complains that Stange's prolactin levels were never tested while he was taking Risperdal and that Dr. Solomon could not rule out puberty as the cause of Stange's gynecomastia. However, Dr. Solomon testified that prolactin testing was not necessary in order to render an opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Risperdal was responsible for Stange's gynecomastia :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Because in anywhere from 25 times the control to up to 80 some percent of patients, depending upon the doses of Risperdal, prolactin goes up. In all the agents of this class of drugs, Risperdal is the greatest offender at increasing prolactin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   So as part of my job as a physician is to take a set of the facts and come to a conclusion.

He further stated that \"the incidence of prepubertal gynecomastia is zero. It should never occur.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 59-60. Then, counsel for Janssen sought to show Dr. Solomon \"an article ... by Dr. Bachar, Dr. Phillip, and Dr. Klippert and Dr. Lazar from Clinical Endocrinology, dated 2004, talking about prepubertal gynecomastia.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 60. Counsel for Janssen told the trial court that it \"is a learned treatise from a respected journal.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Thus, it wished to \"cross-examine [Dr. Solomon] on it.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Counsel for the Pledgers objected and stated that \"[Dr. Solomon] needs to agree it's authoritative.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 61.

Dr. Solomon specifically stated he had not read the article. Moreover, counsel for Janssen never even asked Dr. Solomon whether the treatise or the article was a standard work in his field; rather, she continued to ask Dr. Solomon questions about the contents of the article to which counsel for the Pledgers objected. Janssen complains on appeal that this was error because \"[e]xploring Dr. Solomon's total lack of knowledge of the relevant medical literature would have shown that he was unqualified to offer his causation opinion, and that the opinion failed to take into account studies contrary to his view.\" Janssen's Brief at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Janssen is correct that this would have been fertile ground for cross-examination of Dr. Solomon; however, counsel did not ask any of these questions at trial. Per\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Majdic\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , counsel could have asked Dr. Solomon about any treatise it wanted, so long as it also asked whether the treatise was a\n   standard work in the field. However, counsel did not do that.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in any respect by not permitting Janssen to question Dr. Solomon on this learned treatise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   We now turn to Janssen's final issue on appeal, which is a challenge to the trial court's causation jury instruction.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Janssen's Brief at 44-49. Specifically, Janssen complains the trial \"court failed to give a complete instruction on proximate causation under Alabama law.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 44.

But I want to say up front, that is not the law that we are examining in this case, okay?\" N.T., 2/20/2015 (p.m.), at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Janssen then takes issue with the trial court's explanation of the Alabama law\n   applicable in this case. The trial court offered the following causation instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   You must decide whether Janssen's conduct caused Austin Pledger's harm. Janssen's conduct caused the harm if the conduct naturally and probably brought about the harm; and, two, the harm would not have happened without the conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   The failure of a manufacturer to ... provide the prescribing physician with an adequate warning of the risks associated with a prescription product is not the cause of the patient's injury if the prescribing physician has his own independent knowledge of the risks that should have been included in an adequate warning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   In other words, if you find that the doctor was not given adequate warning, yet at the same time had independent knowledge on his own of the risk, then cause has not been shown.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   Now, the conduct of two or more persons, however, may cause harm. Two or more persons may cause harm in the sense of causation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   Now, in this case you may find that Dr. Mathisen, though not named as a defendant here, engaged in wrongful conduct. If this is so, and you find that Janssen's negligence also caused injury to Austin Pledger, each is a cause of his harm, if it naturally and probably brings about the harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   The fact that Dr. Mathisen is not a defendant here does not relieve Janssen of responsibility for the harm if you find that Janssen's negligence caused [Austin] harm, all right? So that's causation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   N.T., 2/20/2015 (p.m.), at 38-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   According to Janssen \"[t]his statement is accurate but incomplete. The instruction did not describe [the Pledgers'] burden under Alabama law to prove that a different warning would have caused him to avoid injury.\" Janssen's Brief at 46. According to Janssen, \"[t]his was particularly crucial here, where Dr. Mathisen never read the October 2006 labeling, and so could not have changed his prescribing decisions in response to additional risk information.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879884\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/112/1246/6879884/#p1256\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Furthermore, Janssen suggests that the trial court should not have given the \"concurrent causation\" instruction at all because it is appropriate only \"when 'an injury may have several concurrent proximate causes ... including the actions of two or more tortfeasors, neither of whose action was sufficient in and of itself to produce the injury, who act, either together or independently, to produce it.' \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 47-48. Janssen suggests that since it did not contend that Dr. Mathisen was negligent and he did not appear on the verdict form, this instruction \"left jurors with the misimpression that Dr. Mathisen's failure to read the labeling was irrelevant to [the Pledgers'] warning claim.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 48-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   First, with respect to the combined or concurrent cause instruction, Janssen did not object to the trial court's including it at trial.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.T., 2/19/2015 (p.m.), at 136-38. Thus, even though Janssen raised this issue in its post-trial motion, it failed to preserve this issue at trial, and it cannot raise it on appeal.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Pa.R.C.P. 227.1(b) Note (\"If no objection is made, error which could have been corrected in pre-trial proceedings or during trial by timely objection may not constitute a ground for post-trial relief.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Furthermore, upon our review of the jury instruction given by the trial court as a whole, we conclude there was no error. Janssen acknowledges that the instruction accurately reflected Alabama law. Moreover, we have already held that Janssen's arguments about Dr. Mathisen's failing to read the 2006 label prior to refilling Austin's prescription are without merit. The issue, as reflected accurately in the\n   jury instructions, was whether the information provided by Janssen to Dr. Mathisen in 2002 was adequate, and whether a different warning would have changed his prescribing behavior then. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Janssen is not entitled to relief on the basis of its jury instruction issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Having concluded that Janssen has presented no issue on appeal entitling it to relief, we affirm the judgment as to Janssen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Appeal of The Pledgers\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The Pledgers have appealed from the July 11, 2014 order of the trial court, which granted summary judgment in favor of Janssen and against the Pledgers on the Pledgers' claim for punitive damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   In granting Janssen's motion as to all plaintiffs involved in the Risperdal litigation, the trial court held the following: 1) \"New Jersey had a greater interest than Pennsylvania in the application of its law on the issue of punitive damages,\" and 2) \"the New Jersey Products Liability Act does not permit Plaintiffs to recover punitive damages.\" Trial Court Opinion, 10/22/2015, at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   This Court recently considered these issues in both\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Stange\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Murray\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .
