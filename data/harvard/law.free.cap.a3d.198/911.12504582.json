The planning board denied approval of the application upon finding that it failed to comply with three general considerations of Hanover's site plan regulations. The trial court upheld the planning board's decision following a hearing at which several Hanover residents owning properties abutting the proposed site intervened to defend the board's decision (abutters). We reverse and remand because the evidence does not reasonably support the trial court's findings. The certified record confirms that the board based its denial of Dartmouth's application upon subjective and personal feelings and the trial court unreasonably adopted a rationale not supported by the record to affirm the board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts were found by the trial court or are otherwise evident from the certified record. In March 2016, Dartmouth submitted its site plan application\n   seeking approval of the construction of a 69,860 square foot IPF within the college's 41-acre athletic complex located in Hanover's Institutional Zoning District (I-District). The athletic complex includes two, similarly-sized, indoor sports facilities - the Thompson Arena and the Boss Tennis Center - as well as several outdoor athletic fields, tennis courts, and a large parking lot. Dartmouth proposed building the IPF next to the Boss Tennis Center on an area known as the \"sunken garden,\" at the northeast corner of the athletic complex. The proposed site abuts a neighborhood of single-family homes on Tyler Road and Chase Road located in Hanover's Single Residence zoning district (SR-District).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hanover created the I-District as a \"special district\" to meet certain needs of the institution, here, the college - by permitting the development of facilities for educational and recreational purposes and large buildings that could accommodate warehouse and medical center uses.\n   <em>\n    Town of Hanover Zoning\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ordinance\n   </em>\n   (HZO) \u00a7 405.6(A), (B). The town enacted stringent height limitations and setback requirements for buildings within the I-District that are in close proximity to residential zoning districts.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 405.6(C)(2), (3). For example, no building within the I-District may be placed within 75 feet of a residential zoning district boundary,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 405.6(C)(2), buildings constructed within 150 feet of a residential zone may not be more than 35 feet in height, and buildings set back 150 feet or more from a residential zone may be, on average, a maximum of 60 feet in\n   height.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 405.6(C)(3);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   HZO \u00a7 505.1(B)(2) (describing the method of calculating height of buildings in the I-District).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hanover's SR-District provides for one-family residences that are \"typical [to] many New England villages\" along with other types of uses by special exception, including agricultural and governmental uses that complement and serve single-family homes.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 405.8(A), (B). Additional uses are permitted within the SR-District by special exception, such as governmental uses for public safety, education, and recreation.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 405.8(B). The interplay and impacts, both real and potential, between the uses within the I-District and the abutting SR-District became a focal point of the opposition to the IPF and the board's consideration of Dartmouth's site plan application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Between April and December 2016, the board held no fewer than 16 meetings, including two site visits, during its consideration of the IPF. The abutters who reside on Tyler and Chase Roads and own properties closely abutting the athletic complex vigorously opposed the IPF.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dartmouth revised its site plan application several times to address their concerns, by,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   : (1) adding plantings of landscape screening in coordination with the requests and preferences of the abutting\n   neighbors; (2) modifying the size of the IPF's windows and adding the installation of automatic shades and window glazing to reduce light spill from the proposed building; and (3) adjusting the IPF's roof line to lower the building's height profile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although the Hanover Zoning Administrator informed the board that the IPF would be fully compliant with the town's zoning ordinances, including ordinances regulating height restrictions, setback requirements and building-to-lot size ratio limitations, the abutters complained about the negative impacts the IPF would impose on their neighborhood, including a concern that the building's height would block an unreasonable amount of sunlight and cast shadows on their homes. In response, Dartmouth conducted a study of this potential impact and presented its findings to the\n   board by way of an animated shadow study.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The abutters prepared their own interpretation of the college's shadow study that purported to calculate the duration of time that the IPF would cast shadows on their residences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In anticipation of the board's final deliberations on the college's application, Hanover's planning board staff prepared a final memorandum recommending the approval of the application with 21 conditions. Dartmouth agreed to comply with all 21 conditions. In December 2016, the board deliberated on the final site plan application and discussed, among other things, the members' feelings about the project's scale and the aesthetic effect it would have on the adjacent neighborhood. Following deliberations, the board voted 4-1 to deny the application and issued a notice that enumerated three reasons for its decision. In doing so, the board found that the college's site plan application:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1) Does not conform with the Hanover Master Plan (As cited in Article IX A 2b of the Site Plan Review Regulations);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2) Negatively impacts the abutters, neighborhood and others, town services and fiscal health (As cited in Article IX A 2c Site Plan Review Regulations); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   3) Does not relate to the harmonious and aesthetically pleasing development of the town and its environs (As cited in Article IX A 2h Site Plan Review Regulations).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dartmouth appealed the board's decision to the trial court, arguing that the three regulations relied upon by the board are vague, ambiguous, and not proper standards by which to review a site plan application under either RSA 674:44 (2016), or the New Hampshire and United States Constitutions. N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15 ; U.S. CONST. amend. XIV. The college also maintained that the board impermissibly based its decision on personal and subjective feelings, rather than objective and discernible standards. Hanover appeared but deferred to the intervening abutters with respect to Dartmouth's appeal. The abutters argued that the board's decision was legal and reasonable and maintained that the IPF: (1) is massive and out of character with the abutting residential neighborhood; (2) fails to provide for the harmonious, aesthetically pleasing, or attractive development of the\n   town; and (3)\n   is capable of blotting out the sun and shadowing homes in the abutting neighborhood for 7 months of the year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court held a one-hour hearing in August 2017 following substantial briefing and arguments submitted by the college and the abutters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record of the hearing establishes that the parties did not dispute that the application complied with the requirements of Hanover's zoning ordinances applicable to the I-District. Nonetheless, the trial court subsequently upheld the board's decision, ruling that the regulations the board relied upon are valid. The trial court also ruled that the board did not err by basing its decision, \"to a considerable degree on its concerns about the project's impacts on the abutting homes, as opposed to the entire 'neighborhood' of the proposed facility.\" The trial court further ruled that the board members did not impermissibly rely upon their personal feelings, and concluded that the board's decision was lawful and reasonably based upon a particular concern that the IPF \"would block an unreasonable amount of sunlight from reaching abutting homes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, Dartmouth argues that: (1) the board and the trial court erred by relying upon general considerations of Hanover's site plan regulations to deny the application because the general considerations are vague and fail to establish clear standards necessary to assess the application under our \"average person\" standard,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Town of Freedom v. Gillespie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4449172\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/120/576/#p580\">\n    120 N.H. 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 580,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=419%20A.2d%201090\">\n    419 A.2d 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980) (ordinance must be framed in terms sufficiently clear, definite, and certain, to enable an average man after reading it to understand when he is violating its provisions); and (2) the board improperly based its decision on personal feelings and engaged in\n   <em>\n    ad\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    hoc\n   </em>\n   decision-making, while the trial court erroneously relied upon unsupported claims and adopted a rationale, not supported by the evidence or the board's deliberations, to affirm the board's decision. The abutters respond by maintaining that, in general and as applied to Dartmouth's application, the location of the proposed IPF provided the necessary \"observable character,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Town of Deering v. Tibbetts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4459372\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/105/481/#p485\">\n    105 N.H. 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 485-86,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=202%20A.2d%20232\">\n    202 A.2d 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964), such that the \"ordinary person\" could understand and comply with the general considerations. The abutters also argue that, pursuant to our deferential standard of review, the record supports the trial court's determination that Dartmouth failed to meet the general considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We now turn to the applicable standard of review. The trial court's review of a planning board's decision is governed by RSA 677:15, V (2016), which provides that the trial court \"may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or\n   may modify the decision brought up for review when there is an error of law or when the court is persuaded by the balance of probabilities, on the evidence before it, that [the board's] decision is unreasonable.\" As such, the trial court's review is limited.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Motorsports Holdings v.

Specifically, we will address the college's argument that the trial court's decision is unreasonable and legally erroneous because the court: (1) relied upon factual claims and a rationale, not supported by the evidence or the board's deliberations; and (2) upheld a planning board decision that was based upon\n   <em>\n    ad\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    hoc\n   </em>\n   decision-making and personal feelings, rather than objective or discernible facts, to find that the application failed to meet the general considerations. Before assessing the merits of this argument, we briefly review the planning board's duties and obligations in conducting the site plan review process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Site plan review is designed to insure that uses permitted by a zoning ordinance are 'constructed on a site in such a way that they fit into the area in which they are being constructed without causing drainage, traffic, or lighting problems.' \"\n   <em>\n    Summa Humma Enters. v.

The trial court found that the board denied the application out of a concern that the IPF \"would block an unreasonable amount of sunlight from reaching the abutting homes.\" As support for this finding, the trial court cited certain statements made by board members during their deliberations and relied upon the report prepared by the abutters in response to Dartmouth's shadow study. The trial court quoted this report and expressly relied upon its conclusion that \" 'residents of neighboring homes will lose a significant portion of the direct sunlight when days are shortest,' and in some cases, 'more than 10 [percent] of direct sunlight will be lost.' \" Based on this evidence, the trial court found that \"[b]oard members could reasonably have concluded that the proposed facility would block a significant amount of sunlight from reaching abutting homes [which] is objectively both a negative impact upon abutters and inconsistent with the harmonious and aesthetically\n   pleasing development of the environs of the proposed facility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The record of the board's deliberations, however, does not support the trial court's findings or its conclusion. On the record before us, a reasonable person would not have found, as the court did, that the board rejected the site plan due to a concern that the IPF would negatively impact the neighborhood by blocking \"a significant amount of sunlight from reaching abutting homes.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Motorsports Holdings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142741\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/160/95/#p99\">\n    160 N.H. at 103-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=993%20A.2d%20189\">\n    993 A.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing review of certified record to determine whether the board sufficiently apprised the applicant of its reasoning in denying an application for a special use permit). Our review of the transcript of the board's deliberations reveals that two board members mentioned \"general darkening,\" \"blocked views,\" the \"absence of light,\" and \"shading\" as\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   concerns with the IPF. But, the record also reflects that these board members did not base their decision on any one of these factors. Rather, board member Carter acknowledged that \"our own site plan regulations are not sufficiently developed on these topics ... to deny the IPF [on that basis].\" Board member Sims reasoned that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   What we also have to recognize is that there is some shading probably already caused by the existing trees, which are already quite tall and will continue to grow, I hope, in some respects for\n   many years to come. So the question is, how much more shading on top of the existing shading, will the building create, and is it excessive? And I don't know how we can measure that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The remaining two board members who voted to deny the application did not reference shadows, shading, or any other objective criteria. Instead, board member Mayor concluded that the \"building itself, in its location as proposed, looms as an affront to the adjacent neighborhood,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and board member Criswell reasoned that \"the crux of the matter has been the scale and proximity of the building to the neighborhood and how those things, in turn, affects [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] the character.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court misinterpreted the record because, contrary to its findings, the board did not deny Dartmouth's application because the IPF would deprive abutting homes of sunlight. Although the trial court acknowledged our prior rulings prohibiting planning board decisions based upon personal opinions or \"vague concerns,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ltd.

Because the record does not support the trial court's finding that the board rejected the application out of a particular concern that the IPF would block an unreasonable amount of sunlight from reaching abutting homes, the trial court's decision is erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moreover, even if the trial court could have reasonably found that the board's deliberations reflect a concern with the IPF's potential impact on blocked sunlight and shading, the record does not reasonably support this conclusion. In its order, the trial court relied upon the conclusions of the abutters' analysis of the college's shadow study that purported to calculate the hours in a day during which the IPF would cast shadows on five abutting homes between September 21 and March 21. Based upon these conclusions, the trial court gathered that \"the facility would block up to over an hour of mostly afternoon\n   sunlight from reaching certain homes during some months of the year.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Absent from the trial court's analysis, however, is any recognition of the impact caused by the existing tree line within the border between the athletic complex and the abutting properties. Notably, the record includes\n   evidence that the abutters' analysis of the college's shadow study acknowledged that \"[t]he presence of foliage on the trees obscures the impact of the IPF shadows\" and board member Sims identified shading caused by existing trees as a basis for\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   relying upon this potential impact as a rationale for denying the application. Dartmouth's animated shadow study surveyed trees on the college's property for height and foliage in an effort to accurately depict darkening or shadowing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The college's study concluded that any shading that could be attributed to the IPF was heavily intertwined with the shadows cast by existing buildings and trees located within the athletic complex that bordered the abutters' residences.

Our review of the record, however, fails to identify a valid alternative ground that was considered by the board and which supports the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Undoubtedly, the Tyler and Chase Road neighborhood has benefited from Dartmouth's undeveloped, open fields, such as the sunken garden, within its athletic\n   complex. The record confirms that the abutters opposed any development of the sunken garden to preserve the buffer of open space between the college's athletic complex and their neighborhood. The record of the board's deliberations evidences the board's support for the abutters' position. Nonetheless, a planning board cannot use the site plan review process to require a landowner to dedicate its own property as open space for essentially public use without proper compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robbins Auto Parts, Inc. v.

The record does not reasonably support a conclusion that Dartmouth should be prohibited from developing its\n   property, in a manner consistent with the zoning requirements, and maintain open space to satisfy a general consideration for the harmonious and aesthetically pleasing development of the town and its environs. Accordingly, the trial court erred in upholding the board's finding that the IPF failed to meet either Article IX 2(c) or 2(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To the extent that the abutters argue that the board relied upon the project's potential impact on property values, the record shows that, while one board member referenced property values as a factor in his decision, the other board members either rejected or did not mention this rationale as a basis for denying the site plan application. The record includes studies submitted by Dartmouth and prepared by a licensed appraiser who determined that the IPF would not impact the property values of the abutting neighborhood. Evidence submitted by the abutters refuting this opinion consisted of anecdotal statements and conclusory estimates, without supporting data, from residents and retired or unidentified real estate agents. Even if the board denied site plan approval based upon the IPF's negative impact on property values, the record fails to include evidence that would reasonably support such a finding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Continental Paving\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4141926\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/158/570/\">\n    158 N.H. at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20A.2d%20467\">\n    969 A.2d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, the record reflects that the planning board staff concluded that the application met all requirements. The record also establishes that the college repeatedly revised its site plan and performed multiple studies to determine and address the IPF's potential impacts on the abutting neighborhood with respect to sound, light, property values and storm water discharges. In its application and its subsequent submissions to the board, Dartmouth repeatedly and reasonably explained why the proposed location of the IPF was the most logical and feasible site to accommodate the new facility. During its final deliberative session, board members repeatedly praised Dartmouth for the time and effort the college devoted to addressing the concerns of its neighbors. On this record, we cannot find that the evidence reasonably supports the trial court's conclusion that the college refused to alter its site plan to address the concerns of the abutters and to comply with Hanover's site plan regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Our review of the record of the board's deliberative session supports Dartmouth's contention that the board unreasonably relied upon personal feelings and\n   <em>\n    ad\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    hoc\n   </em>\n   decision-making in denying the college's application. This record reveals that the board was more concerned with the IPF's scale and height, characteristics governed by specific zoning ordinances, than the building's aesthetics or its allegedly negative impacts on the environs. There is no dispute that the application complies with all of the applicable and specific zoning and site plan regulations. Nonetheless, board member Criswell stated that, for him, \"the crux of the matter [is] the scale and proximity of the building to the neighborhood and how those things, in turn, affect[ ] the character.\" In explaining his vote, board member Mayor concluded simply that the \"building itself, in its location as proposed, looms as an affront to the adjacent neighborhood.\" We recognize that, on appeal,\n   a planning board's factual findings are considered\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   lawful and reasonable,\n   <em>\n    Motorsports Holdings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142741\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/160/95/#p99\">\n    160 N.H. at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=993%20A.2d%20189\">\n    993 A.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but the planning board's deliberations in this case cannot logically be considered fact-finding.

Sustaining the board's decision here would sanction a denial of a property owner's site plan application simply because board members felt that the owner's permitted use of its own property was inappropriate.

For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court's order upholding the planning board's denial of Dartmouth's site plan application. As we previously found, the record establishes that the IPF complies with Hanover's specific zoning ordinances and site plan regulations. Further deliberations or fact-finding are unnecessary to determine whether the college's application is lawful or reasonable. Therefore, Dartmouth is entitled to relief which rewards its efforts challenging the legality of the board's decision and prevents retributive action by the municipality.\n   <em>\n    Britton v.

This board member recused herself from the board's deliberations on the application because her residence closely abuts the athletic complex. Dartmouth argues that, despite this member's recusal, she represented the abutters and voiced her strong opposition to the project in letters, e-mails and formal presentations to her fellow board members. The college complains that the recused board member's influence on the board was apparent, given that the board ultimately decided to deny the application based upon the three general considerations that she advanced throughout the site plan review process. The abutters counter that Dartmouth did not raise this issue with the trial court. We agree with the abutters. Dartmouth did not raise this issue with the trial court or identify it in the college's notice of appeal. Thus, we do not opine on the propriety of the recused board member's participation in the opposition to the college's application.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The record reveals that the abutters' opposition maintained numerous objections that were not relied upon by either the board or the trial court and, thus, are not pertinent to this appeal, including complaints with: (1) the project's impact on the town's storm water management system; (2) the building's lack of architectural detail; (3) the negative impact the IPF posed to the abutters' property values; and (4) the potential noise and sound pollution created by the proposed building. In response to these complaints, Dartmouth retained professionals to study these potential impacts and either modified its site plan to address these concerns or presented sufficient evidence to rebut them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The Town of Hanover did not participate in the appeal other than to defer to the abutters and, assuming the college prevailed on appeal, agree to Dartmouth's request for the \"builder's remedy\" provided the college complied with the conditions to approval recommended by the town's planning board staff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    We recognize that board member Mayor also commented on his responsibility to protect the neighborhood from a loss of property values as a factor in his decision.

Here, counsel for the abutters informed the trial court that the board members who voted to deny approval of the application did not base their decision on a lack of conformity with the master plan, although the record suggests otherwise.
