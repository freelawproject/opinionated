General Statutes \u00a7 53a-166 (b). The maximum term of imprisonment for a class C felony is ten years. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a (7). Likewise, the maximum period of probation\n   for a class C felony is five years. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-29 (e). In the present case, the court sentenced the defendant to consecutive terms of seven and one-half years incarceration, execution suspended after five years, with five years of probation for each hindering prosecution count, which resulted in a total effective sentence of fifteen years incarceration, execution suspended after ten years, with five years of probation.

Specifically, the defendant claim[ed] that a twenty year sentence of imprisonment followed by a five year term of probation effectively constitutes a twenty-five year sentence [and] thus exceeds\" the statutory maximum set forth in \u00a7 53a-35a. This court disagreed, stating: \"Absent a statutory prohibition, a term of imprisonment with the execution of such sentence of imprisonment suspended after a period set by the court and a period of probation is an authorized sentence. ... The plain language of the statute concerning authorized sentences ... specifies that a defendant can be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, but have that sentence suspended while he serves a period of probation. ... In the present case, the defendant's maximum exposure to imprisonment under such a sentence is twenty, not twenty-five, years. Moreover, \u00a7 53a-35a expressly states that the\n   <em>\n    sentence of imprisonment\n   </em>\n   shall be a definite sentence and ... the term shall be ... (1) [f]or a class B felony other\n   than manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm ... a term not less than one year nor more than twenty years ....

On May 17, 2017, he filed a motion to correct an\n   illegal sentence with the trial court. When the state did not file a written response to that motion, the defendant filed a motion for procedural default on June 27, 2017. In that motion, the defendant alleged that the state had failed to comply with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 \"10, 11, and 66.\" The defendant then quoted from Practice Book \u00a7 66-2, which provides that \"[a] party intending to oppose a motion, petition or application shall file a brief statement clearly setting forth in separate paragraphs appropriately captioned the factual and legal grounds for opposition within ten days after the filing of the motion ....\" (Emphasis omitted.) Because the state had not filed a written response to his motion to correct, the\n   defendant claimed that the state had \"waived and forfeited [its] right be heard ... in this matter.\" The defendant thus submitted that \"[t]he [s]tate's acquiescence permits my arguments and claims to proceed unopposed, nullifying any objections.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court held a hearing on the defendant's motion on July 26, 2017. When the defendant indicated that he was relying on the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 \"10, 11 and 66,\" the court inquired: \"When you say 10 and 11, what do you mean ...?\" The defendant responded, \"Section 10, 11. More specifically, section 66-2.\" The court at that time apprised the defendant that \u00a7 66-2 was a rule \"of appellate procedure\" and explained that the present proceeding was \"not an appellate matter.\" The court further explained that chapters 10 and 11 of the rules of practice pertained to civil matters. The following colloquy then transpired:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The Court: [What] you're referring to, Mr. Adams, are procedures in civil matters. This is not a civil matter, sir. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"The Defendant: In civil matters?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"The Court: Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"The Defendant: It's the Connecticut Practice Book. I thought it was all matters-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"The Court: Yes, it is, but there are civil and criminal and appellate [chapters], and you referred to the appellate and to the civil [chapters]; this [proceeding] is neither.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"The Defendant: So it doesn't apply to criminal?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"The Court: Correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"The Defendant: All right. So, basically, I file a motion and the state ... doesn't have to, like, respond to my motion at all?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"The Court: In writing?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"The Defendant: Yeah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"The Court: No, they are not required to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"The Defendant: They don't have to acknowledge the motion at all? They can just come in and oppose it?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"The Court: The motion, of course, will be acknowledged in court today. ... [The state] is prepared to argue your motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"The Defendant: All right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court then denied the defendant's motion for procedural default, noting that the Practice Book sections relied upon by the defendant did not apply to the present proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On appeal, the defendant has provided this court with no authority to substantiate his bald assertion that the state was obligated to respond in writing to his motion to correct.

Our review of the record reveals that the defendant's allegation is wholly unfounded. The transcript of the July 26, 2017\n   hearing is twenty-eight pages in length and is punctuated by multiple misstatements of law by the defendant. For example, the defendant incorrectly insisted that the offense of hindering prosecution in the second degree was a class D felony, when \u00a7 53a-166 plainly specifies that it is a class C felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant also incorrectly argued that the calculation of his maximum definite sentence under \u00a7 53a-35a must include his period of probation and that our rules of practice obligated the state to file a written response to his motion to correct an illegal sentence. In each instance, the court responded in a measured and respectful manner and carefully explained to the defendant why his assertions were untenable under Connecticut law. Those\n   explanations were entirely proper and do not evince any impartiality on the part of the court.
