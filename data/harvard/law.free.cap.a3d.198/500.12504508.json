Simms (Simms) appeals from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County (trial court), which dismissed Simms' summary appeal due to her failure to appear at the scheduled trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . We now vacate the trial court's order and remand for further consideration by the trial court consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 28, 2016, Rostraver Township Police issued Simms two citations for (1) driving with a suspended license and (2) improper use of a turning lane, in violation of Sections 1371 and 3331 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1371, 3331. After a summary trial on the matter-at which Simms failed to appear-a magisterial district judge found Simms guilty. Simms appealed the judgment to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 16, 2017, the trial court held a trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . Simms did not attend this trial, nor did she apprise the trial court of\n   her anticipated absence. The transcript of the proceeding provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [Cmwlth]: Francine Simms, it's Number 364 of 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Judge, she's failed to appear. The officer is here. We would request that the appeal be dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [TC]: All right. Is Francine Simms or anyone on her behalf in the courtroom?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Answering not, and seeing that the notice of this hearing was sent to the defendant at her address and not returned, the appeal is dismissed for failure to appear and prosecute the appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Supplemental Reproduced Record at 2.) By order dated May 16, 2017, the trial court affirmed the judgment of the magisterial district judge and dismissed Simms' appeal. Simms appealed the trial court's order to the Superior Court and, thereafter, motioned to transfer the case to this Court. The Commonwealth did not file an objection to the motion to transfer. By order dated November 21, 2017, the Superior Court granted Simms' motion. The matter is now ripe for disposition in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Simms argues that the trial court erred by dismissing her appeal without first ascertaining whether Simms had good cause for her absence from the trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . In a footnote in Simms' brief, Simms' counsel offers the following excuse for Simms' nonappearance: \"On or about the date of your Appellant's Summary Appeal hearing she had multiple close family deaths that resulted in her inability to appear in Court or to notify the Court of her circumstances.\" (Simms' Br. at 5, n.2.) Simms seeks a remand for the trial court to determine whether she had good cause for her nonappearance and, if so, for a new trial. In response, the Commonwealth argues that Simms' proffered reason for her absence is unverified and insufficient for the grant of a new trial. Further, the Commonwealth objects to this Court's jurisdiction over the matter, arguing that proper jurisdiction lies with the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to evaluating the merits of Simms' appeal, we must address the Commonwealth's objection to this Court's jurisdiction. The Commonwealth argues that this matter does not fall within this Court's appellate jurisdiction, asserting that the Superior Court has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals arising under the Vehicle Code. Pursuant to Section 742 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 742, the Superior Court has jurisdiction over all appeals from orders of common pleas courts unless jurisdiction is vested in this Court under Section 762 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 762. After review, we perceive no basis in Section 762 of the Judicial Code upon which we could conclude that this Court has appellate jurisdiction over the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Nonetheless, Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 741(a) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The failure of an appellee to file an objection to the jurisdiction of an appellate court on or prior to the last day under these rules for the filing of the record shall, unless the appellate court shall otherwise order, operate to perfect the appellate jurisdiction of such appellate court, notwithstanding any provision of law vesting jurisdiction of such appeal in another appellate court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 704. Here, the Commonwealth raises an objection to jurisdiction for the first time in its brief on the merits. The Commonwealth, therefore, has failed to object to this Court's appellate jurisdiction in a timely manner, thereby waiving the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pettko v. Pa. Am.

Rule 462 provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Rule 462. Trial\n    <em>\n     De Novo\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (A) When a defendant appeals after the entry of a guilty plea or a conviction by an issuing authority in any summary proceeding upon the filing of the transcript and other papers by the issuing authority, the case shall be heard\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   by the judge of the court of common pleas sitting without a jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (D) If the defendant fails to appear, the trial judge may dismiss the appeal and enter judgment in the court of common pleas on the judgment of the issuing authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pa. R. Crim. P. 462. The explanatory comment to Rule 462 provides the following with respect to Paragraph (D): \"Paragraph (D) makes it clear that the trial judge may dismiss a summary case appeal\n   <em>\n    when the judge determines that the defendant is absent without cause from the trial de novo.\n   </em>\n   \" Pa. R. Crim. P. 462 cmt. (emphasis added). Accordingly, before a summary appeal may be dismissed, \"the trial court must ascertain whether the absentee defendant had adequate cause for his absence.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

In the event that good cause is established, the defendant is entitled to a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Super. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While practice may vary from judicial district to judicial district, it is not uncommon for a common pleas court to list seriately multiple summary appeals for hearing before a single judge on a particular day. Like this case, the failure of a defendant/appellant to appear at the scheduled proceeding will usually elicit an oral motion from the prosecutor to dismiss the appeal pursuant to Rule 462(D). This places the common pleas court judge in an awkward position, as the Pennsylvania Superior Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The problem that arises in these types of cases is that, for a quite obvious reason, trial courts often dismiss the appeals without inquiring into whether the absentee defendant had good cause: the person who could offer cause for the absence is the absent defendant himself. In other words, there is no one present in the courtroom whom the trial judge can question regarding the reasons for the absence. Moreover, pursuant to [Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure] 720(D), a defendant in a summary appeal case is not permitted to file post-sentence motions. The trial court cannot question an absent defendant regarding the cause of the absence, and the defendant cannot file post-sentence motions to explain the absence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7308718\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/66/794/#p796\">\n    66 A.3d at 796-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a consequence, where a common pleas court grants a motion to dismiss for nonappearance at the time of the scheduled hearing, whether a defendant had good cause not to appear is often raised for the first time on\n   appeal to either this Court or to the Superior Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

On appeal to the Superior Court, the defendant contended that the common pleas court erred in dismissing the matter without requiring the Commonwealth to present evidence. The Superior Court rejected that contention and affirmed the common pleas court, holding that Rule 1117(c) authorized the common pleas court to dismiss the appeal and re-enter judgment on the summary conviction when the defendant failed to appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Mesler\n   </em>\n   , on the day of the scheduled summary appeal hearing, the defendant's attorney was present in the courtroom when the common pleas court called the defendant's case. The defendant, however, was absent from the courtroom at the time. Over the objection of the defendant's counsel, the common pleas court entered an order dismissing the summary appeal under then Rule 1117(c). This Court reversed, holding that the common pleas court failed to assess whether or not the defendant had good cause for his absence, as required by the explanatory comment to the rule. In so doing, this Court acknowledged the Superior Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lowe\n   </em>\n   , but distinguished it on the facts: \"If neither [the appellant] nor his attorney was present when the case was called, the court could conclude that [the appellant] did not intend to appear and prosecute his statutory appeal and it could be summarily dismissed.\"\n   <em>\n    Mesler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11545466\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/732/21/#p25\">\n    732 A.2d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because, however, the defendant's counsel was present in the courtroom when the common pleas court judge called the case and objected to its dismissal, the common pleas court in\n   <em>\n    Mesler\n   </em>\n   could not conclude that the defendant did not intend to pursue the appeal. Accordingly, under that circumstance, the common pleas court was required to determine whether the defendant had good cause for his nonappearance before dismissing the appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11545466\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/732/21/#p25\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Marizzaldi\n   </em>\n   , the defendant appealed a summary conviction\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . The defendant, however, was not present in the courtroom when his case was called. The common pleas court dismissed the case pursuant to Rule 462(D). On appeal, and represented by counsel, the defendant argued that he arrived ten minutes late for his trial, but the matter had already been dismissed due to his absence from the courtroom. He\n   claimed he was delayed because he missed his bus. He further claimed that the common pleas court did not afford him an opportunity to explain his tardiness. These claims by the defendant were set forth in an affidavit attached to his brief on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Marizzaldi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9337384\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/814/249/#p252\">\n    814 A.2d at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A divided three-judge panel of the Superior Court reversed. The appellate court noted first that, because the defendant was precluded by rule from filing post-trial motions, the appellate brief was the defendant's first opportunity to challenge the common pleas court's compliance with Rule 462(D).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9337384\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/814/249/#p252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9337384\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/814/249/#p252\">\n    at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The appellate court also distinguished\n   <em>\n    Lowe\n   </em>\n   , because in\n   <em>\n    Lowe\n   </em>\n   the appellant did not argue that he had good cause for his nonappearance; rather, he challenged only the entry of a verdict against him without the Commonwealth's presentation of evidence at the trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9337384\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/814/249/#p252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 252 n.2. The appellate court reviewed the transcript and record and found no indication that the common pleas court made any determination of the cause or duration of the defendant's absence from the courtroom. For purposes of the appeal, the appellate court accepted as true the allegations in the affidavit accompanying the defendant's brief on appeal. The appellate court then found as fact that the defendant's absence from the courtroom was not \"voluntary,\" and, therefore, he should be given an opportunity to present a defense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9337384\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/814/249/#p252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9337384\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/814/249/#p252\">\n    at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Bryant\n   </em>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 1808 C.D. 2016,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206612679\">\n    2017 WL 6612679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , filed December 28, 2017), the defendant claimed on appeal that the common pleas court erred in dismissing his summary appeal pursuant to Rule 462(D). In his brief on appeal, the defendant claimed confusion about the trial date and time. We noted the following with respect to the record: \"[T]he [original] record provided to this Court does not contain any scheduling orders or notations that indicate Bryant received notice of the correct hearing date.\"\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 3, n.2. Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Shoaf\n   </em>\n   , we remanded to the common pleas court with direction that it determine whether the defendant had good cause for his nonappearance and, if so, to provide the defendant a trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Based on our review and consideration of the foregoing mix of binding and persuasive authority, we hold that an appellant, seeking to set aside a dismissal under Rule 462(D) for failure of a common pleas court to make the necessary good cause determination, must establish the following: (1) that the appealed order was issued pursuant to Rule 462(D) ; (2) that there is nothing in the original record to indicate that the trial court made the necessary inquiry or determination of good cause for nonappearance prior to entry of the final appealable order; and (3) that either (a) the record on appeal shows that the trial court failed to consider reasons advanced for the nonappearance that may amount to good cause for the defendant's nonappearance, or (b) the defendant advances a justification for his nonappearance on appeal that, if credited by the common pleas court on remand, may amount to good cause for the defendant's nonappearance-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the nonappearance was not voluntary. If these elements are established, this Court will vacate the common pleas court's order and remand the matter for the good cause determination required by Rule 462(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The reason for the first and second elements are obvious. The third element, however, bears additional explanation, because on this point we part company with our sister appellate court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Marizzaldi\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   . In both of those cases, the Superior Court considered evidence, in the form of affidavits\n   <em>\n    dehors\n   </em>\n   the original record. In\n   <em>\n    Marizzaldi\n   </em>\n   , the Superior Court, relying on the averments in the affidavit, effectively found that the defendant's failure to appear was not voluntary, vacated the common pleas court's sentence, and remanded for a new trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   , the Superior Court reached the opposite conclusion, finding that the averments in the affidavit failed to make out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing of good cause, and, therefore, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As a general rule, appellate courts must confine their review of a common pleas court's decision to matters of record.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Erie Indem.

To the extent\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Marizzaldi\n   </em>\n   could be read as requiring supplementation of the record and fact finding by this court sitting in its appellate jurisdiction, we do not find them persuasive. Rather than require the submission of affidavits on appeal and engaging in fact finding, we will instead first look to the original record to determine whether the defendant or the defendant's representative advanced some basis on which the common pleas court could have found good cause, but that the common pleas court failed to consider.\n   <em>\n    Mesler\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Shoaf\n   </em>\n   . Alternatively, and in the absence of such record evidence, we will consider averments of good cause in the defendant's brief on appeal, but only for purposes of determining whether, if true, the defendant may be entitled to a new trial\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Akinsanmi\n   </em>\n   . In any event, a remand for a new trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   is not the appropriate relief on appeal. Instead, we will vacate and remand for the common pleas court to determine whether the defendant had good cause for her nonappearance-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , was it voluntary-and if so, to hold a new trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shoaf\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Marizzaldi\n   </em>\n   (Beck, J., concurring);\n   <em>\n    Mesler\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Turning now to Simms' appeal, there is nothing in the original record in this case to indicate that Simms, either directly or through a representative, offered any justification for her nonappearance to the common pleas court. In her brief, however, Simms avers that she failed to attend the hearing due to the deaths of multiple relatives. (Appellant's Br. at 5, n.2.) The Commonwealth challenges Simms' proffered excuse, asserting that Simms fails to provide sufficient information or detail on how the deaths impacted her ability to attend the trial. While we agree that Simms' proffered excuse lacks the level of detail we would prefer, we will not strictly hold Simms to the standards set forth for the first time in this opinion. Simms' assertion of multiple deaths in the family at or around the time of the May 16, 2017 trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   is at least as detailed as the claimed, but also lacking in specificity, hospitalization that this Court accepted in\n   <em>\n    Shoaf\n   </em>\n   . As we did in\n   <em>\n    Shoaf\n   </em>\n   , we will leave it to the trial court on remand to assess the veracity and details of the allegations in order to determine whether Simms' absence from the trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   was not voluntary. In future cases, the Court will insist\n   that appellants provide greater detail so the Court can better assess whether, if accepted as true, the allegations would support a good cause determination by the common pleas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In sum, the trial court dismissed Simms' summary appeal for failure to appear pursuant to Rule 462(D). Our review of the original record reveals that the trial court did not make an inquiry or determination as to whether Simms had good cause for her nonappearance before dismissing the summary appeal. Similarly, the record does not establish that Simms or a representative advised the trial court of the reason for her nonappearance. Nonetheless, on appeal to this Court Simms advances a reason for her nonappearance that, upon further inquiry by the trial court, may amount to good cause for her nonappearance. Accordingly, we vacate the order of the trial court and remand the matter with direction that the trial court determine whether Simms had good cause for her failure to appear at the May 16, 2017 trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and, if so, to hold a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   AND NOW, this 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of November, 2018, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County (trial court) is VACATED, and the matter is REMANDED to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the accompanying opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Jurisdiction relinquished.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    This Court's review of a trial court's determination on appeal from a summary conviction is limited to determining whether there has been an error of law or whether competent evidence supports the trial court's findings.\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.
