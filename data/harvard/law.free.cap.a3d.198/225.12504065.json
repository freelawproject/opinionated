TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2) provides for \"implied consent\" to take an alcohol concentration test, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Any person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State is deemed to have consented ... to take a test if the person should be detained on\n   suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of [TR] \u00a7 16-813 [ (Driving Commercial Motor Vehicle with Alcohol Concentration in Blood or Breath Prohibited) ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Despite TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2)'s recognition of a driver's implied consent to take a test, the driver may refuse to take a test unless the driver has been in an accident that results in the death of, or a life-threatening injury to, another person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(1), (c)(1). That said, a driver's refusal to take a test will result in consequences. For example, the first time that a driver refuses to take a test, the driver's license will be suspended for 270 days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TR \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(8)(v) 5A. TR \u00a7 16-205.1 is called the \"administrative per se law\" because the possible administrative sanctions-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , suspension of a driver's license-automatically result from a driver's refusal to take, or a driver's failure of, a test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Here, we must decide whether an officer is required to specify the type of test-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a breath test or a blood test-when the officer requests that a driver take an alcohol concentration test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   James R. Nelson, Respondent, crashed a vehicle that he had been driving. Corporal Brandon Foor of the St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office approached the vehicle. Nelson-who was conscious, but unable to move-said that he was drunk. Corporal Foor smelled a strong odor of alcohol on Nelson's breath. Corporal Foor requested that Nelson take an alcohol concentration test and Nelson refused. On behalf of the Motor Vehicle Administration (\"the MVA\"), Petitioner, Corporal Foor confiscated Nelson's commercial driver's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nelson requested an administrative hearing, at which his counsel moved that an administrative law judge (\"the ALJ\") take no action against Nelson. The ALJ denied the motion to\n   take no action, and determined that Nelson had violated TR \u00a7 16-205.1. The ALJ ordered that Nelson's commercial driver's license be disqualified for 12 months, and that, instead of having his driver's license suspended for 270 days, Nelson would participate in the Ignition Interlock System Program. Nelson petitioned for judicial review. The Circuit Court for Prince George's County reversed the ALJ's decision, reasoning that Corporal Foor was required to specifically request that Nelson take a blood test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before us, the MVA contends that the circuit court erred. The MVA argues that TR \u00a7 16-205.1 simply requires an officer to ask a detained driver to take an alcohol concentration test, but does not require the officer to advise the driver whether the alcohol concentration test will be a breath test or a blood test. Nelson responds that Corporal Foor was required to specifically identify the type of alcohol concentration test that he was being asked to take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We hold that, under TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2)(ii)'s plain language, an officer is simply required to request that a driver take an alcohol concentration test; in other words, an officer is not required to specifically\n   advise the driver whether the alcohol concentration test will be a blood test or a breath test. TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2)(ii) unequivocally states that an \"officer shall ... [r]equest that the person permit\n   <strong>\n    a test\n   </strong>\n   to be taken[.]\" (Emphasis added). In turn, TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(1)(iii) defines the word \"test\" as a blood test, a breath test, or both. Simply put, nothing in TR \u00a7 16-205.1 requires an officer to specify the type of alcohol concentration test when requesting such a test be taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Officer's Certification and Order of Suspension and Advice of Rights Form\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In an \"Officer's Certification and Order of Suspension\" dated November 6, 2016, Corporal Foor stated as follows. At 1:46 a.m., in St. Mary's County, Corporal Foor saw a vehicle that had \"crashed off the roadway.\" Nelson was in the driver's\n   seat, and said that he was drunk. Corporal Foor smelled a strong odor of alcohol on Nelson's breath. Nelson \"was unable to satisfactorily complete\" the Standardized Field Sobriety Test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Corporal Foor signed an \"Advice of Rights\" form, which was labeled DR-015 and dated October 2016, and stated in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   You have been stopped or detained[,] and reasonable grounds exist to believe that you have been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle under circumstances requiring that you be asked to submit to a test under [TR] \u00a7[ ]16-205.1. In this situation, the law deems that you have consented to take a test to measure the alcohol concentration or drug or controlled dangerous substance content in your system. You may refuse to submit to the test(s), unless you were in a motor vehicle accident resulting in the death of or life-threatening injury to another person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Suspension of Your Maryland Driver's License or Driving Privilege:\n   </strong>\n   If you refuse to submit to the test, or if you submit to the test and the result indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing, your Maryland driver's license shall be confiscated, you will be issued an Order of Suspension and, if eligible, a temporary license [that will be] valid for 45 days. The following periods of suspension shall be imposed against your license or privilege to drive in Maryland:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    If you refuse to submit to a test, your suspension shall be 270 days for a 1st offense and 2 years for a 2nd or subsequent offense.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    If your test result is an alcohol concentration of at least 0.08 but less than 0.15, your suspension shall be 180 days.

Both the Advice of Rights form and the Officer's Certification and Order of Suspension indicate that Nelson refused to take an alcohol concentration test. According to the Officer's Certification and Order of Suspension, Corporal Foor confiscated Nelson's commercial driver's license and provided him with a temporary license that would expire in forty-five days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Administrative Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nelson requested an administrative hearing, which took place on August 17, 2017. At the administrative hearing, Corporal Foor testified that, on November 6, 2016, at approximately 1:30 a.m. or 2 a.m., while he was driving \"south of Poplar Ridge Road[,]\" he saw a vehicle \"off the roadway[.]\" The vehicle's \"front end was smashed [ ] in[.]\" Corporal Foor approached the vehicle, and saw Nelson lying \"on the side of the seat\" with a large cut on his face. Nelson was conscious, but unable to move. Corporal Foor called Emergency Medical Services, which responded to the scene, and Emergency Medical Services personnel decided to take Nelson to a hospital. Nelson was placed on a stretcher and taken to UM Prince\n   George's Hospital Center. Corporal Foor followed the ambulance to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Nelson testified that he was unconscious at the scene of the accident. According to Nelson, he experienced a concussion, the effects of which lasted one-and-a-half to two weeks. Nelson testified that he did not remember being involved in a motor vehicle accident, encountering Corporal Foor, being asked to take a field sobriety test, or giving blood at the hospital. According to Nelson, he never refused to take an alcohol concentration test, which he would have been willing to take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After Nelson finished testifying, the ALJ heard argument from his counsel, who moved that no action be taken against Nelson. Nelson's counsel contended that, under the circumstances surrounding the accident, Nelson was not coherent enough to refuse to take an alcohol concentration test. The ALJ observed that, in the Officer's Certification and Order of Suspension and the Advice of Rights form, Corporal Foor stated that Nelson refused to take an alcohol concentration test, whereas Nelson testified that he did not \"remember anything.\" The ALJ stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   I have to do a credibility assessment[,] and[,] when the choice is between someone who has a clear recollection of what happened and contemporaneously documented it versus someone who says [']I don't remember['] or [']I don't recall,['] I'm going to give more weight to the person who remembers what happened.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The ALJ also stated that it was \"clear that [ ] Nelson was conscious, at least when he was interacting with\" Corporal Foor. The ALJ explained that, given that Corporal Foor \"essentially attest[ed] under penalties of perjury that [ ] Nelson refused, ... the reasonable inference that I can draw from that ... is that Corporal Foor did not determine[,] based on his interaction with [ ] Nelson at the time[,] that [ ] Nelson was incapable of refusing\" to take an alcohol concentration test. Nelson's counsel responded that that was \"a judgment call on\" Corporal Foor's part. Nelson's counsel stated that Nelson had a visible scar, and that Corporal Foor knew that Nelson had\n   suffered \"a bad injury.\" The ALJ pointed out: \"[S]imply because someone is ... injured to the point that they need ...\n   medical attention, does not mean that they're injured to the point that they can't make knowing and voluntary decisions.\" The ALJ explained that a reasonable inference could be drawn that Corporal Foor \"did not independently direct the drawing of blood because[,] based on what he was observing on that evening[,] he did not think that [ ] Nelson was incapable of refusing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The ALJ denied the motion to take no action and issued a \"Findings of Fact\" form in which she determined that Nelson had violated TR \u00a7 16-205.1, and ordered that Nelson's commercial driver's license would be disqualified for 12 months, and that, instead of having his driver's license suspended for 270 days, he would participate in the Ignition Interlock System Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Petition for Judicial Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On September 8, 2017, in the circuit court, Nelson petitioned for judicial review. On April 13, 2018, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the petition. At the hearing, Nelson's counsel contended that the issues were whether Nelson was capable of refusing a breath test, and whether the breath test was \"even applicable ... based on the circumstances.\" Nelson's counsel argued that Nelson was incapable of refusing to take an alcohol concentration test, and that Corporal Foor should have directed medical personnel to take his blood. After hearing the parties' arguments, the circuit court took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On April 16, 2018, the circuit court issued an Opinion and Order, reversing the ALJ's decision and remanding with instructions to take no action with regard to Nelson's commercial driver's license. The circuit court acknowledged that substantial evidence supported the ALJ's determination that Corporal Foor did not need to direct medical personnel to involuntarily take blood from Nelson. The circuit court reasoned, however, that Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol.) (\"CJ\") \u00a7 10-305(a) required Corporal Foor to\n   specifically request that Nelson take a blood test. The circuit court determined that there was no evidence that Corporal Foor requested that Nelson take a blood test. The circuit court concluded that the ALJ erred in failing to apply CJ \u00a7 10-305(a) in determining that Nelson violated TR \u00a7 16-205.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    Petition for a Writ of\n    <em>\n     Certiorari\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On May 18, 2018, the MVA petitioned for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   , raising the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Where the [ALJ] found that a [driver], after being properly advised via the [ ] Advice of Rights form, expressly refused to take a blood-alcohol concentration test, was the [driver] correctly suspended [ ] for a test refusal under [TR] \u00a7 16-205.1, even though the detaining officer did not deviate from the Advice of Rights form and explicitly offer the [driver] the option of choosing between a breath[ ] test and a blood test?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On July 12, 2018, this Court granted the petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Admin. v.

The MVA argues that TR \u00a7 16-205.1 simply requires an officer to ask a detained driver to take an alcohol concentration test, and does not require the officer to advise whether the alcohol concentration test will be a breath test or a blood test, or to specifically request that a driver take a blood test. The MVA asserts that the type of alcohol concentration\n   test that is administered depends on the detained driver's location and condition, as well as the availability of test equipment. The MVA maintains that CJ \u00a7 10-305(a) does not require an officer to specify the type of alcohol concentration test, as that is not up to the officer or the driver; instead, CJ \u00a7 10-305(a) requires an officer to conduct a breath test except under certain circumstances, such as when the driver is unconscious.\n   Nelson responds that the circuit court was correct in determining that the ALJ failed to account for CJ \u00a7 10-305(a). Nelson contends that Corporal Foor was required to request that he take a blood test because his injuries were serious enough to warrant a trip to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"Where, as here, the facts are undisputed, a court determines whether an administrative law judge's decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Seenath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310346\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/448/145/#p149\">\n    448 Md. at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310346\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/448/145/#p149\">\n    136 A.3d at 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). \"A court reviews with some deference an administrative law judge's interpretation of a statute that the relevant administrative agency administers.\"\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Admin. v.

TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2)(ii) unequivocally states that an \"officer shall ... [r]equest that the person permit\n   <strong>\n    a test\n   </strong>\n   to be taken[.]\" (Emphasis added). In turn, TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(1)(iii) defines the word \"test\" as a blood test, a breath test, or both. Nothing in TR \u00a7 16-205.1 requires an officer to specify a type of alcohol concentration test when requesting such a test to be taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Nor does CJ \u00a7 10-305(a) impose such a requirement. CJ \u00a7 10-305(a) lists the circumstances under which an officer must administer a blood test, as opposed to a breath test. For example, as explained above, under CJ \u00a7 10-305(a)(1)(ii), where \"[i]njuries to [a driver] require removal of the [driver] to a medical facility[,]\" and the driver consents to an alcohol concentration test, it must be a blood test. No provision in CJ \u00a7 10-305(a) directs an officer to specifically request that a driver take a blood test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Our holding is warranted not only by CJ \u00a7 10-305(a)'s plain language, but also by its legislative history. Before 1983,\n   CJ \u00a7 10-305(a)'s predecessor allowed drivers to choose between a blood test and a breath test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20Md.%20Laws%201033\">\n    1983 Md.

In 1983, to address this concern, the General Assembly amended CJ \u00a7 10-305(a)'s predecessor to no longer allow drivers to choose between a blood test and a breath test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20Md.%20Laws%201033\">\n    1983 Md. Laws 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -34 (Pt. 2, Ch. 289, S.B. 513). Since 1983, CJ \u00a7 10-305(a) and its predecessors have generally required a breath test where a driver consents to an alcohol concentration test, except in a limited number of circumstances in which a blood test is required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20Md.%20Laws%201033\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The 1983 amendment to CJ \u00a7 10-305(a)'s predecessor demonstrates that there is no longer a need for an officer to specifically request that a driver take a blood test or a breath test. When CJ \u00a7 10-305(a)'s predecessor allowed drivers to choose between a blood test and a breath test, an officer was required to question a driver along the following lines: \"Are you willing to take a breath test or a blood test? If so, which one?\" Now that drivers no longer have the discretion to choose the type of test, it would be pointless for an officer to specify the type of test, as that is not up to the driver; to the contrary, it is determined by CJ \u00a7 10-305(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Our conclusion furthers TR \u00a7 16-205.1's purpose, which is \"to reduce the incidences of drunk driving and to protect public safety by encouraging drivers to take alcohol concentration tests[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Admin. v.

If we were to hold that an officer must specify the type of alcohol concentration\n   test to be taken, then, where an officer requested that a drunk driver take an alcohol concentration test without identifying the type of alcohol concentration test, the drunk driver could freely refuse and avoid a suspension of his or her driver's license. Holding that, for an advisement to be valid, an officer must specify the type of alcohol concentration test is not consistent with TR \u00a7 16-205.1's purpose of encouraging drivers to take alcohol concentration tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The circuit court was mistaken to the extent that it reasoned that, under\n   <em>\n    Dove\n   </em>\n   , an officer must specify the type of alcohol concentration test. This Court did not hold as much in\n   <em>\n    Dove\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Dove\n   </em>\n   , we did not address the question of whether the officer was required to specifically request that the driver take a blood test (which the officer did), as opposed to generally requesting that the driver take an alcohol concentration test. Instead, the three issues before this Court were:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   1) whether the circumstances, particularly [the driver]'s removal to the hospital for medical treatment, warranted a blood test rather than a breath test pursuant to [CJ] \u00a7 10-305 [ ]; 2) whether [the driver] refused the alcohol concentration test, when he offered to take a breath test instead of a blood test; and 3) if [the driver] refused the alcohol concentration test, whether the breath test performed by hospital personnel negated [the driver]'s refusal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84-85,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690802\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/70/#p86\">\n    991 A.2d at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
