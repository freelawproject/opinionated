This case involves a dispute over a husband's designation of his niece and nephew, defendants Allison Hayes and Brian Hayes, as the beneficiaries of his Individual Retirement Account (IRA) rather than his wife, plaintiff Patricia Hayes. Husband is now deceased. Wife filed a declaratory judgment action, arguing that the beneficiary designation should be declared void under 14 V.S.A. \u00a7 321 and that the IRA funds should pass through husband's estate. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants, concluding for several reasons that wife was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 321. We agree with the trial court that \u00a7 321 does not apply here because wife took under husband's will rather than electing her statutory share of his estate. We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. The following facts are undisputed. Husband and wife married in December 1973 and separated in 2006. In June 2016, husband filed for divorce. Husband died in September 2016. During his lifetime, husband had a deferred compensation retirement plan through his work. Wife was the beneficiary of this account. In June 2015, husband withdrew the money in this account (approximately $119,000) and rolled it into a traditional IRA managed by defendant LPL Financial, LLC. Husband designated his niece and nephew as co-primary beneficiaries. Husband was close to his niece and nephew, and they visited him regularly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. Husband died testate. His will, executed in December 2001, left the rest and residue of his estate to wife. The probate division allowed the will in October 2016, finding that it was properly executed and authenticated and that wife consented to its allowance. Wife inherited husband's personal estate valued at $95,000 (less a lien against a vehicle), as well as husband's probate estate. Wife also obtained sole\n   possession of husband's primary residence, which the couple owned as tenants by the entirety at the time of husband's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. In June 2017, wife filed this declaratory judgment action, arguing that husband's IRA beneficiary designation was void under 14 V.S.A. \u00a7 321. Defendants maintained that the statute did not apply, but even if it did, that the undisputed facts showed that husband did not violate it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5. Section 321 was part of a much larger bill that both restated and revised existing law. See 2009, No. 55, \u00a7 5. Section 321 is entitled \"Conveyance to defeat spouse's interest,\" and it provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A voluntary transfer of any property by an individual during a marriage or civil union and not to take effect until after the individual's death, made without adequate consideration and for the primary purpose of defeating a surviving spouse in a claim to a share of the decedent's property so transferred, shall be void and inoperative to bar the claim. The decedent shall be deemed at the time of his or her death to be the owner and seised of an interest in such property sufficient for the purpose of assigning and setting out the surviving spouse's share.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court concluded that \u00a7 321 was a modern articulation of a longstanding rule that a spouse cannot convey property to others to fraudulently deprive the surviving spouse of property to which he or she has a right, that is, commit \"a fraud upon ... [the surviving spouse's] marital rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Thayer v. Thayer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2352142\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/14/107/#p123\">\n    14 Vt. 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 123 (1842) (emphasis omitted). The court emphasized that \"an intent to defraud must be found as a fact\" and that a fraudulent intent could not be \"presumed from the knowledge that [a diminished estate] would be the effect of the conveyance.\"\n   <em>\n    Dunnett v. Shields\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2367728\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/97/419/#p426\">\n    97 Vt. 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 426, 428-29,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.%20626\">\n    123 A. 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 630-31 (1924) (emphasis omitted) (stating that \"the law in no case presumes fraud,\" and \"[o]ne who seeks to set aside a conveyance on the ground that it is fraudulent must establish that fact so clearly and conclusively as to put it beyond a reasonable doubt\"),\n   <em>\n    overruled on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trepanier v. Getting Organized, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4808126\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/155/259/\">\n    155 Vt. 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4808126\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/155/259/\">\n    583 A.2d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. The court reasoned that wife relied solely upon the\n   <em>\n    effect\n   </em>\n   of the beneficiary designation, the exact reasoning rejected in\n   <em>\n    Dunnett\n   </em>\n   . The undisputed facts showed that husband was close to his niece and nephew and that he otherwise provided for wife. These facts, in the court's view, supported an inference that husband did not intend to disinherit wife but instead intended to lawfully provide for his niece and nephew. The court thus held that wife failed to establish an essential element of her case. See\n   <em>\n    Burgess v. Lamoille Hous. P'ship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453546\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/201/450/\">\n    2016 VT 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453546\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/201/450/\">\n    201 Vt. 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453546\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/201/450/\">\n    145 A.3d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Summary judgment is mandated where, after an adequate time for discovery, a party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to the party's case and on which the party has the burden of proof at trial.\" (quotation and alterations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. The court further found that the reference to a surviving spouse's \"share\" in \u00a7 321 referred to a spouse's share under 14 V.S.A. \u00a7 311 when the decedent dies intestate or to a spouse's elective share under 14 V.S.A. \u00a7 319. See 14 V.S.A. \u00a7 311 (describing intestate share of surviving spouse);\n   <em case-ids=\"12453546\" https:=\"\" index=\"8\" xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.L&lt;extracted-citation url=\">\n    ibr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\"&gt;id\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453546\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/201/450/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 319(a) (providing that spouse can \"waive the provisions of the decedent's will and in lieu thereof elect to take one-half of the balance of the estate, after the payment of claims and expenses\"). In this case, husband died testate and wife chose to take under husband's will. It followed that wife was barred from seeking her elective share under \u00a7 319, and thus, \u00a7 321 did not apply. See\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    In re O'Rourke's Estate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8544059\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/106/327/#p332\">\n    106 Vt. 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=175%20A.%2024\">\n    175 A. 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (1934) (\"It is a familiar rule that one cannot take under a will and against it.\"). The court also concluded that wife failed to demonstrate, as a matter of law, that a beneficiary designation constituted a \"voluntary transfer of any property\" under \u00a7 321. For all these reasons, the court granted summary judgment to defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. On appeal, wife challenges each of the grounds offered by the court in support of its summary judgment decision. We find it necessary to address only wife's challenge to the meaning of the term \"share\" in \u00a7 321. Wife argues that this term is not limited to a spouse's elective or intestate share. She maintains that a surviving spouse might have a claim to a share of an asset that \"would have been distributed pursuant to the will, if not for the voided transfer, and the surviving spouse was a beneficiary under the will.\" Wife suggests that a spouse might also have a claim to an asset if he or she had been a named beneficiary of an asset and the designation was then changed. Even if the statute does refer to an intestate or elective share, wife argues that her share of the IRA should be determined under intestacy law because the IRA was a \"part of a decedent's estate not effectively disposed of by will.\" 14 V.S.A. \u00a7 301(a) (\"Any part of a decedent's estate not effectively disposed of by will passes by intestate succession to the decedent's heirs, except as modified by the decedent's will.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. \"The interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we review de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is evident that the \"share\" to which a surviving spouse has a claim, referenced in \u00a7 321, is his or her statutory share. This is consistent with the statutory scheme and the use of the term \"share\" both in our case law and prior statutory provisions. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Thayer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2352142\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/14/107/#p123\">\n    14 Vt. at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing widow's statutory right to \"at least, one-third of the personal estate, after the payment of debts, &amp; c.,\" and referring to it as \"[t]he widow's claims for her share\");\n   <em>\n    In re Peck's Estate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2361634\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/87/194/#p212\">\n    87 Vt. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 212,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20A.%20568\">\n    88 A. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576 (1913),\n   <em>\n    superseded by statute on other grounds, as recognized by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Cartmell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4623045\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/120/228/#p230\">\n    120 Vt. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4623045\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/120/228/#p230\">\n    138 A.2d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 589 (1958) (explaining that husband was entitled to waive wife's will and claim \"his statutory share of [wife]'s estate\"). We find no support for wife's assertion that the term \"share\" might refer to an asset that \"would\" have been distributed under a will but for its transfer to someone else. A beneficiary's interest under a will is not usually designated as a \"share,\" in contrast to a surviving spouse's claims under the statute, which are. Additionally, \u00a7 321 is part of the chapter addressing \"Descent and Survivors' Rights,\" including intestate and elective shares; it is not found in the chapter addressing wills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 20. We find it apparent that \u00a7 321, like its predecessor concerning real estate conveyances, straddles the competing goals that our law has recognized. It promotes the free alienation of property, and it also serves to protect a surviving spouse. Our law has long required that a spouse will receive a minimum share of a decedent's estate, and \u00a7 321 assures that the minimum protection required by the elective or intestate share is not defeated.

We note that to the extent that wife is claiming some type of contractual right to the IRA funds by virtue of\n   having once been designated a beneficiary, that claim fails. See\n   <em>\n    Luszcz v.

Because wife is arguing that she has the right to certain property that should have been included in husband's estate, she needed to pursue this argument by waiving husband's will and claiming her elective share of husband's estate under \u00a7 319. If wife succeeded in this argument, she would be entitled to, at most, half of the IRA funds, not the full amount she would recover as residuary beneficiary of husband's will. See generally M.
