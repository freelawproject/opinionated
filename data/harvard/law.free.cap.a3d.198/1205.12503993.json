Phantom Fireworks opposed the preliminary objections and filed an application for summary relief concerning its constitutional challenges, which\n   all Respondents oppose. Both the preliminary objections and the application for summary relief have been briefed and argued. They are now before us for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Act 43 originated as House Bill (HB) 542, Printer's Number (PN) 568 of 2017.

In its final form, enacted as Act 43, it contains voluminous additions concerning revenue issues beyond sales tax issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relevant here, Article XXIV of Act 43 adds a new chapter to the Tax Reform Code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   relocating and modifying the provisions of the Fireworks Law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The modifications include expansion of permissible fireworks sales to consumers, imposition of a 12% tax (including the 6% sales tax) on those sales, and permitting peak season sales of fireworks in tents and other temporary structures. Act 43 repeals the entire former Fireworks Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Among its provisions concerning fireworks sales in temporary structures, Act\n   43 provides that sales in temporary structures are governed by the safety standards in \"NFPA 1124,\" defined as Standard 1124 in the 2006 edition of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) CODE FOR THE MANUFACTURE, TRANSPORTATION, AND STORAGE OF FIREWORKS AND PYROTECHNIC ARTICLES (Code) \"or any subsequent edition\" of that Code. Pet. for Review, Ex. A at 33. This definition is significant to our reasoning below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Phantom Fireworks asserts, and Respondents do not dispute, that NFPA 1124 has been amended in subsequent editions of the NFPA Code. According to Phantom Fireworks,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the 2013 edition, NFPA Code 1124 was similar to the 2006 edition. However, the NFPA withdrew NFPA Code 1124 in 2014. The current edition of the NFPA Code, published in 2017, contains\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   safety standards for retail sales of consumer fireworks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the course of the various amendments to HB 542, its title also expanded substantially. In its final form, the title included the phrase \"providing for fireworks,\" referring to Article XXIV of Act 43, titled simply \"Fireworks.\" Pet. for Review, Ex. A at 2, 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Phantom Fireworks contends Act 43 violates the following several provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Adding the provisions of the Fireworks Law, including its safety provisions, to the text of Act 43 violates the original purpose rule of Article III, Section 1. Similarly, by including provisions governing sundry subjects in addition to the original tax provision, Act 43 violates the single subject requirement of Article III, Section 3. By burying a short descriptor, \"providing for fireworks,\" in its lengthy title, Act 43 also violates Article III, Section 3's requirement that a bill's title contain a clear expression of its subject matter. Further, by failing to set forth the entire text of the repealed Fireworks Law, Act 43 violates the repealed text publication requirement in Article III, Section 6. In addition, by providing that sales in temporary structures will be governed by NFPA standards in the 2006 or any subsequent edition, Act 43 impermissibly delegates legislative authority in violation of Article II, Section 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   There is considerable overlap in the preliminary objections filed by the Executive Respondents, Senator Scarnati, and Speaker Turzai. The various preliminary objections allege failure to join the Commonwealth and the Attorney General as indispensable parties, lack of standing, improper inclusion of the Executive Respondents as parties, non-ripeness of Phantom Fireworks' claims, improper pleading of a request for relief as a separate count of the petition, and sovereign immunity of Executive Respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Phantom Fireworks argues its claims present questions of law appropriate for resolution by summary relief. Respondents disagree that Phantom Fireworks is entitled to any relief, but they do not contend that summary disposition of the issues is inappropriate. In fact, Senator Scarnati asserts a counter-request for summary relief, seeking dismissal of all counts of the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   There is substantial overlap in the parties' briefing of issues relating to the preliminary objections and the request for summary relief. Accordingly, we dispose of all issues, including the preliminary objections, the request for summary relief, and the counter-application for summary relief, in a single decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Moreover, if the Attorney General files a brief on the constitutional issue, the Commonwealth will thereafter be deemed an intervening party. If the Attorney General were an indispensable party, there would be no need either for intervention or for rules allowing the Attorney General to be heard without deciding to intervene. Similarly, if the Commonwealth were an indispensable party, there would be no need for a provision deeming the Commonwealth a party upon the Attorney General's decision to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As support for his argument, Senator Scarnati cites\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"630455\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/575/542/\">\n    575 Pa. 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9298712,630377,9298628,630455\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/838/566/\">\n    838 A.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (\n   <em>\n    Phila. I\n   </em>\n   ). Like this case,\n   <em>\n    Phila. I\n   </em>\n   concerned Article III constitutional challenges to the validity of a statute. However, \" 'the mere fact that a challenged statute may be declared unconstitutional does not, of itself, make the Commonwealth an indispensable party.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ballroom, LLC v.

I\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that the Attorney General is an indispensable party in an action challenging the constitutionality of a statute. To the contrary, although the Governor and the Secretary of the Commonwealth were parties in\n   <em>\n    Phila. I\n   </em>\n   , the Attorney General\n   was not a named party, and our Supreme Court expressly held that no other parties needed to be joined beyond those already participating in the action.\n   <em>\n    Phila. I\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, although the Court observed that the Commonwealth was a named party, it did not hold that the Commonwealth was an indispensable party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We conclude that neither the Commonwealth nor the Attorney General is an indispensable party. We overrule Senator Scarnati's preliminary objection in that regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Senator Scarnati asserts Phantom Fireworks lacks capacity to sue because it lacks standing to bring this action.

Motels throughout the county incurred increased tax expenses, but those near the county line could not easily recoup those expenses by raising room rates because of price competition from nearby motels across the county line not burdened by the county tax. Because the tax's operation significantly affected and harmed the in-county motels, they had standing to challenge the tax.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    William Penn Parking Garage, Inc. v.

Having, in addition, lower licensing fees and little or no expense for safety features under Act 43, those vendors have a cost advantage, and thus a competitive pricing advantage. Phantom Fireworks' pricing disadvantage constitutes significant, direct harm and therefore confers standing to challenge Act 43.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monzo\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    William Penn Parking\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

In that case, the petitioner challenged the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance that had not been enforced or applied. By contrast, Act 43 is a taxing statute, and its provisions are in force. Moreover, the authorized sale of fireworks in temporary structures, the main target of Phantom Fireworks' petition, has occurred. As stated above, Phantom Fireworks alleges in its pleading that it is already suffering losses in sales because of the competitive edge Act 43 gives to transient competitors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   We conclude this case is ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Failure to Answer Preliminary Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Phantom Fireworks did not file an answer to any of the preliminary objections, although it briefed its opposition to them. Senator Scarnati argues that the lack of a responsive pleading by Phantom Fireworks entitles him to prevail by default regarding his preliminary objections asserting failure to join necessary parties and lack of capacity to sue (standing).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Pa. R.C.P. No. 1028(a)(5) includes lack of capacity to sue and nonjoinder of a necessary party among the bases for preliminary objections. Pa. R.C.P. No. 1028(c)(2) suggests these categories of preliminary objections \"cannot be determined from facts of record.\" Therefore, if the respondent filing preliminary objections endorses them with a notice to plead, the petitioner must file a response, to the extent required under Pa. R.C.P. No. 1029.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Senator Scarnati endorsed his preliminary objections with a notice to plead. Therefore, we must determine whether\n   Rule 1029 required Phantom Fireworks to file a responsive pleading on the issues of nonjoinder and standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Rule 1029 governs the effect of failure to deny averments in a pleading. Pa. R.C.P. No. 1029(a) requires the responding party to admit or deny each averment of fact in the preceding pleading. \"Averments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required are admitted when not denied specifically or by necessary implication.\" Pa. R.C.P. No. 1029(b). By contrast, \"[a]verments in a pleading to which no responsive pleading is required shall be deemed to be denied.\" Pa. R.C.P. No. 1029(d). Thus, whether Phantom Fireworks had to file a responsive pleading admitting or denying Senator Scarnati's preliminary objections concerning indispensable parties and standing depends on whether those preliminary objections contained averments of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Phantom Fireworks insists it did not need to answer Senator Scarnati's preliminary objections concerning nonjoinder and standing because they \"contain no facts as to which a responsive pleading was required or could possibly have been useful.\" Pet'rs' Br. at 27. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Our review of Senator Scarnati's preliminary objections reveals that those asserting nonjoinder of a necessary party and lack of standing aver only conclusions of law, not disputed facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Preliminary Objections by Respondent Senator Joseph B. Scarnati, III \u00b6\u00b6 6-22. Accordingly, Phantom Fireworks did not have to respond to those averments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, they are deemed denied under Pa. R.C.P. No. 1029(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Failure to Brief Immunity Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In their preliminary objections, Executive Respondents raised the defense of sovereign immunity. However, Phantom Fireworks asserts Executive Respondents waived that preliminary objection because they did not brief the issue of sovereign immunity in support of their preliminary objections. We agree. A party waives a preliminary objection it does not support in its brief.\n   <em>\n    Triage, Inc. v. Pa.

Second, and of significance here, the petitioners did not allege that any member of the General Assembly was misled by the absence of the entire text of the prior law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on that reasoning and the strong presumption of constitutionality accorded a statute, this Court agreed with the respondents in\n   <em>\n    Christ the King Manor\n   </em>\n   that the petitioners failed to present a viable constitutional challenge to the defective repeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Here, the repealer at issue is substantially similar to that in\n   <em>\n    PAGE\n   </em>\n   .

The real question is whether we may sever the unconstitutional portions of Article XXIV while leaving the remainder of the Article intact. As Act 43 is fundamentally a tax/revenue statute, we conclude that the General Assembly intended and would prefer to retain as much of Article XXIV as possible in order to minimize the effect of the unconstitutional language on the Commonwealth's revenues. Therefore, we will sever the language referring to the delegatee, \"NFPA 1124,\" and to \"Temporary structure\" from the rest of Article XXIV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   However, severing the offending language of Act 43 requires removing several provisions in Article XXIV relating to temporary structures. Act 43's definitions of \"NFPA 1124\" and \"Temporary structure\" contain the actual language effecting the unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. However, without a definition of \"Temporary structure,\" other provisions of Article XXIV referring to temporary structures are impossible to apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Pa.
