He concluded that N.J.S.A. 2C:43-6.4(c) was \"unlike the statute that governs Megan's Law registration.\" He reasoned, \"CSL may be terminated after a showing that a registrant has not committed an offense for a period of [fifteen] years. This [fifteen]-year period is measured from the date of the registrant's\n   last conviction, not [his] underlying conviction under Megan's Law.\" He entered an order terminating CSL for H.D., and subsequently denied H.D.'s motion for reconsideration of the denial of the termination of his registration obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before us, appellants argue subsection (f)'s clear and unambiguous language permits relief from their registration obligations\n   because they remained offense free for fifteen years following their last conviction. They note that subsection (f)'s reference to the \"conviction\" that starts the fifteen-year clock is not limited to the sex-offense conviction that triggered Megan's Law's registration in the first instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, according to appellants, the fifteen-year clock reset in 2001, due to appellants' subsequent \"conviction or release from a correctional facility for any term of imprisonment.\" N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(f). Alternatively, appellants contend that even if subsection (f) is ambiguous, various tenets of statutory construction, common sense and the rule of lenity require reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The State also argues that subsection (f) is clear and unambiguous. However, the State argues a conviction for any offense forever bars relief when it occurs within fifteen years following a \"conviction or release from a correctional facility\" for the sex offense. The State contends this interpretation is consistent with the Legislature's intent in enacting Megan's Law. Additionally, the State argues the Legislature's use of different language in N.J.S.A. 2C:43-6.4(c), specifically, that the applicant remain offense free for fifteen years from \"the last conviction or release from incarceration,\" evidences an intention to treat CSL differently\n   from registration, because registration is remedial, while CSL is penal in nature.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"373699\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/142/1/#p21\">\n    142 N.J. at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"373699\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/142/1/#p21\">\n    662 A.2d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding Megan's Law's registration requirements were \"clearly and totally remedial in purpose\"), with\n   <em>\n    Schubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157324\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/212/295/#p305\">\n    212 N.J. at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157324\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/212/295/#p305\">\n    53 A.3d 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding CSL was \"punitive rather than remedial at its core\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because we confront a \"question ... of statutory interpretation, ... we are 'neither bound by, nor required to defer to, the legal conclusions of a trial ... court.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re N.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322538\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/222/87/#p94\">\n    222 N.J. 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322538,4323235\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/117/1196/\">\n    117 A.3d 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

In addition, the Legislature decided the fifteen-year period began even later for some offenders, i.e., upon their \"release from a correctional facility.\" N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(f).

The original version, which focused on predicting the likelihood of any re-offense, arguably lends support to the State's position that subsection (f) was intended to permanently bar any relief to a sex offender who commits another offense. However, the Legislature did not adopt that version of subsection (f), choosing instead to focus on the predictability of a registrant's likely threat to public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The State argues that registration is a presumptive lifetime obligation under Megan's Law which the Court found was permissible as part of a comprehensive remedial design.\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"373699\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/142/1/#p21\">\n    142 N.J. at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"373699\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/142/1/#p21\">\n    662 A.2d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It asserts that subsection (f) provides relief in only a narrowly defined circumstance. The State therefore argues that permanently barring subsection (f) relief to those who commit an offense, however minor, within the first fifteen years following conviction or release for the underlying sex offense is wholly consonant with Megan's Law's remedial purpose. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We need not reiterate in detail the Court's rationale supporting its initial conclusion that Megan's Law was \" 'clearly and totally remedial in purpose' and 'designed simply and solely to enable the public to protect itself from the danger posed by sex offenders.' \"\n   <em>\n    G.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499067\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/190/1059/#p524\">\n    455 N.J.

The Court has since recognized the significance of subsection (f) to the remedial nature of the statutory scheme. \"The underlying assumption of [subsection (f) ] [was] that when a registrant, who has been [offense free] for fifteen or more years, no longer poses a risk to the safety of the public, keeping him bound to the registration requirements no longer serves a remedial purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"373699\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/142/1/#p21\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    C.K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497524\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/187/123/#p533\">\n    233 N.J. at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12495182\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/182/917/\">\n    182 A.3d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It follows that permanently denying relief to a registrant who has led a law-abiding life for fifteen years after conviction and otherwise meets the requirements of subsection (f) serves no remedial purpose. One need only consider that the State's interpretation\n   would\n   <em>\n    permanently\n   </em>\n   deny relief to an offender who: 1) lives offense free for 14 years and 364 days after his conviction for a sex offense; 2) then commits a petty disorderly persons offense; and 3) lives another 15 offense-free years thereafter. That result does not serve any of Megan's Law remedial purposes and demonstrates the State's construction of subsection (f) leads to illogical and absurd outcomes that the Legislature never intended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellants' interpretation requires no alteration of the language in subsection (f).
