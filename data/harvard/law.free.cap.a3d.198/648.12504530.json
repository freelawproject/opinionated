We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On\n   March 28, 2014, the minor victim, age seventeen at the time, reported to her family and the police that she had been sexually abused by the defendant, her stepfather. In accordance with police protocol, the minor victim was referred to the Greater Hartford Children's Advocacy Center (advocacy center) at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center for a diagnostic interview. On April 1, 2014, the minor victim participated in a diagnostic interview conducted by Lisa Murphy-Cipolla, the clinical services coordinator at the advocacy center. Although Murphy-Cipolla interviewed the minor victim alone, their conversation was observed through a \"one-way mirror\" by Detective Claire Hearn and Audrey Courtney, a pediatric nurse practitioner at the advocacy\n   center.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In conformance with the ordinary practice of the advocacy center, the interview was video recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During the interview, the minor victim disclosed, in precise detail, that the defendant sexually abused her over an approximate seven year period. The minor victim told Murphy-Cipolla, in relevant part, that beginning when she was eight or nine years old, until she was fifteen years old, the defendant, on numerous occasions, touched her inappropriately underneath her clothes. The minor victim also disclosed that, when she turned fifteen years old, the defendant \"would force [her] to have sex with him.\" She further indicated that the defendant's actions would cause her to suffer physical pain, that she does not feel comfortable with her body, and that she regrets not disclosing the sexual abuse sooner. The defendant subsequently was arrested and charged with, inter alia, six counts of sexual assault and four counts of risk of injury to a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 6, 2016, the court held a pretrial hearing to determine whether the video recording of the diagnostic interview would be admissible at trial. As an offer of proof, the state presented the testimony of Murphy-Cipolla and played a partially redacted version\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the video recording. Murphy-Cipolla testified regarding her background and the purposes and process of conducting diagnostic interviews, as well as the circumstances of her interview of the minor victim. The state argued that the video recording was admissible pursuant to the medical diagnosis and treatment exception to the hearsay rule, which is codified in \u00a7 8-3 (5) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant objected to the admission of the video recording on the ground that the minor victim's statements made during the interview constituted inadmissible hearsay because the minor victim was not seeking medical diagnosis or treatment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the court, in an oral decision, overruled the defendant's objection and held that the video recording was admissible pursuant to the medical diagnosis and treatment exception to the\n   hearsay rule. In particular, the court concluded that the hearsay exception applied because the minor victim's reports of \"physical symptoms,\"\n   \"body image mental health issues,\" and \"medical concerns\" were reasonably pertinent to obtaining medical diagnosis and treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, the defendant's case proceeded to a jury trial, at which the state presented the testimony of several witnesses, including Murphy-Cipolla. During the state's direct examination of Murphy-Cipolla, the state requested that the video recording be admitted into evidence. Notwithstanding the defendant's renewed objection, the court admitted into evidence the video recording as a full exhibit, and the state proceeded to play the video recording for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the course of the defendant's rebuttal evidence at trial, the defendant sought to introduce two cell phone screenshots depicting text messages purportedly sent by the minor victim to her stepcousin, R, who is the defendant's niece.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the court held a hearing\n   outside the presence of the jury to determine the admissibility of these screenshots. As an offer of proof, the defendant conducted a direct examination of R and produced both screenshots. R testified that, inter alia, both screenshots depict text message responses that she received from the minor victim in February or March, 2014. Both screenshots appear to display the minor victim's first name as the sender; neither screenshot, however, contains an indication as to the date or time that the messages were received. After conducting a cross-examination of R, the state objected to the admission of both screenshots arguing that they had not been authenticated properly because they were incomplete and devoid of necessary distinctive characteristics. The defendant countered that the screenshots were admissible because R sufficiently identified the messages as being authored by the minor victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the court issued an oral decision sustaining the state's objection and deciding that both screenshots had not been authenticated sufficiently pursuant to \u00a7 9-1 (a) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the court determined that the defendant failed to make a prima facie case that the minor victim authored the text messages exhibited by the screenshots because, among other things, the messages\n   were incomplete, lacking temporal indicators, and devoid of distinctive characteristics. Accordingly, the court excluded from evidence both screenshots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The jury subsequently found the defendant guilty of six counts of sexual assault and four counts of risk of injury to a child. The court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict and imposed a total\n   effective sentence of forty years incarceration, execution suspended after thirty years, with thirty-five years probation and lifetime sex offender registration. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before turning to the merits of the defendant's claims, we briefly set forth the applicable standard of review. \"It is well settled that [w]e review the trial court's decision to admit [or exclude] evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law ... for an abuse of discretion.... Under the abuse of discretion standard, [w]e [must] make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court's ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion.... [Thus, our] review of such rulings is limited to the questions of whether the trial court correctly applied the law and reasonably could have reached the conclusion that it did.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Filippelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saint Mary's Hospital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%20113\">\n    319 Conn. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 119,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20A.3d%20501\">\n    124 A.3d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant claims that the court improperly admitted into evidence a video recording of the diagnostic interview between the minor victim and Murphy-Cipolla. More specifically, the defendant argues that\n   the court abused its discretion in determining that the video recording met the requirements of the medical diagnosis and treatment exception to the hearsay rule because \"[t]he circumstances of this case make clear that criminal investigation and prosecution was not only the primary purpose of the interview, but was the overarching and singular purpose.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant's first claim on appeal. The diagnostic interview was held in the adolescent interview room at the advocacy center at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, which is an institution capable of providing medical services. At the outset of the interview, Murphy-Cipolla indicated to the minor victim that there were \"a couple of ladies ... that [she] work[ed] with\" behind the one-way mirror that were observing their discussion, but she did not identify them or state their occupations to the minor victim. Murphy-Cipolla also informed the minor victim that their conversation was being recorded so that the video could be reviewed, and so that the minor victim would\n   not \"have to keep talking over and over and over again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After several prefatory inquiries and the disclosure by the minor victim that the defendant had sexually abused her, Murphy-Cipolla then asked a series of questions to ascertain when and where the abuse occurred, as well as the manner in which the defendant had sexually assaulted her. More specifically, Murphy-Cipolla asked the minor victim to clarify which part of the defendant's body he used to touch her because it would be \"helpful for our nurse ....\" Murphy-Cipolla subsequently posed a similar question, stating that it \"would be helpful ... for our medical provider\" to confirm the parts of the minor victim's body that the defendant had touched. Moreover, when asked what the abuse felt like, the minor victim responded that it was physically painful. Immediately thereafter, Murphy-Cipolla\n   informed the minor victim that \"when we're done today I'm going to introduce you to our medical provider and any questions that you have or any concerns you can talk with her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Murphy-Cipolla also inquired as to whether the defendant always had used a condom, to which the minor victim responded that he did not. Later, when asked whether she had \"any questions or concerns right now for the medical provider,\" the minor victim responded that she goes \"to the OBGYN\" but that she \"want[ed] to make sure that [she did not] have any disease.\" Murphy-Cipolla then assured the minor victim that \"when we're done, I'll introduce you to our medical provider and she'd be happy to talk with you about any concerns that you have.\" Additionally, the minor victim expressed some psychological concerns, stating, inter alia: \"I just I hate feeling uncomfortable. And hating myself because ... I hate that I waited so long to say something because if I was to say something earlier then-sooner than I would eventually be happy ....\" In response, Murphy-Cipolla informed the minor victim that \"we could help to make a referral for counseling just so you have somebody to talk with about all those issues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"It is well settled that ... [a]n out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay and is generally inadmissible unless an exception to the general rule applies.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carrion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20823\">\n    313 Conn. 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 837,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20361\">\n    100 A.3d 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The medical diagnosis and treatment exception to the hearsay rule is codified in \u00a7 8-3 (5) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. See footnote 5 of this opinion. \"The legal principles relating to the medical treatment exception are well settled. Admissibility of out-of-court statements made by a patient to a medical care provider depends on whether the statements were made for the purposes of obtaining medical\n   diagnosis or treatment ... and on whether the declarant's statements reasonably were related to achieving those ends.... The term medical encompasses psychological as well as somatic illnesses and conditions....

Because the focus of the medical treatment exception is the declarant's understanding of the purpose of the interview, the inquiry must be restricted to the circumstances that could be perceived by the declarant, as opposed to the motivations and intentions of the interviewer that were not apparent to the declarant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Applying these principles to the present case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the video recording was admissible\n   under the medical diagnosis and treatment exception to the hearsay rule because it reasonably can be inferred from the circumstances apparent to the minor victim that she understood the interview had a medical purpose. First, the interview took place at a medical facility, and the minor victim knew that the interview was being recorded by the medical facility for future use. Further, we can ascertain no reason for the minor victim to have\n   thought that one of the observers was a police detective because the minor victim was informed only that there were \"a couple of ladies ... that [she] work[ed] with\" behind the one-way mirror. Even if the minor victim was aware of the presence of a police officer behind the mirror, however, this fact alone would not eradicate the medical purpose of the interview. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185572\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/121/775/#p783\">\n    121 Conn.

Murphy-Cipolla also asked several direct questions, including whether the defendant used a condom, which could assist a prospective medical provider to identify whether the minor victim contracted any sexually transmitted diseases. Likewise, the minor victim was asked to confirm the nature of the defendant's sexual abuse for the explicit reason that it would be helpful to the nurse and the medical provider. Finally, when the minor victim expressed concerns about her physical and psychological well-being, Murphy-Cipolla informed the minor victim that she would be introduced to a medical provider and referred to counseling. All of these facts lead to the reasonable inference that the interview had a medical purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although certain questions posed by Murphy-Cipolla were directed at uncovering facts that may be immaterial to the medical treatment or diagnosis of the minor\n   victim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   our case law is clear that the statements made in a diagnostic interview are admissible even when medical treatment or diagnosis is not the primary purpose of the inquiry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Griswold\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Conn.%20App.%20528\">\n    160 Conn.

Indeed, the defendant, by exempting from his objection the minor victim's complaints seeking medical treatment; see footnote 6 of this opinion; recognizes that the interview had a medical purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Therefore, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion when it determined\n   that the minor victim's statements made during the diagnostic interview were\n   admissible pursuant to the medical diagnosis and treatment exception to the hearsay rule, and admitted into evidence the video recording of the diagnostic interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The defendant also claims that the court improperly excluded from evidence two cell phone screenshots of text messages purportedly sent by the minor victim to R. More specifically, the defendant argues that the court abused its discretion in determining that the defendant failed to authenticate sufficiently the two screenshots because he provided evidence that \"met the requirements of a prima facie case of authenticity by presenting both a witness with personal knowledge of the conversation and [the minor victim's] phone number and that witness' description of identifying distinctive characteristics in the evidence.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant's second claim on appeal. Each of the two exhibits is a screenshot that depicts text messages that were received by a cell phone. The first screenshot portrays two text messages that were received by the cell phone, displays only the bottom half of the name of the sender, which appears to be the first name of the minor victim, does not include the phone number of the sender, and is devoid of any time or date reference. It also contains a portion of a text message to which the two text messages shown purportedly respond. The second screenshot evinces two partial text messages that were received by the cell phone, displays the entirety of the first name of the sender, which is the first name of the minor victim, does not include the phone number of the sender, displays 1:08 p.m. as the time that the screenshot was taken, but is devoid of any other time or date reference. As for the content of the messages contained in both\n   screenshots; see footnote 7 of this opinion; the author expresses discontent for her current life situation except for her relationship with \"[T]\" and her \"bf.\" The author also utilizes the terms \"SMH\" and \"hit me up,\" and complains that \"[M]anny\" failed to fulfill his promise to purchase the author a car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When defense counsel showed these two screenshots to the minor victim on cross-examination during the state's case-in-chief, the minor victim denied ever sending R any text messages and denied that she was the \"sender\" of the text messages displayed in the screenshots. At the hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, R testified that she is the stepcousin of the minor victim and that the minor victim provided her cell phone number to R at a family gathering. R testified that, in February or March, 2014, despite the fact that she was \"not really\" \"in touch\" with the minor victim, R sent the minor victim a text message \"to see how she was doing.\" R testified that the minor victim responded to her message and that the two exhibits evincing the two screenshots were a fair and accurate representation of the minor victim's responses. R also attested to her cell phone number as well as the minor victim's cell phone number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On cross-examination, R testified that the screenshots do not represent the entire conversation and, although she could not recollect the date of the conversation \"clearly,\" she did know that it was \"a couple of months before everything happened.\" R further testified that she manually input the minor victim's name into her cell phone, she was not with the minor victim at the time she received the messages from her, she never spoke to the minor victim in person about the conversation, and she did not know whether the\n   minor victim's phone was password protected. When asked if she knew whether the minor victim had sent the text messages, R responded that members of the minor victim's\n   family were referenced in the text. R also testified that the time displayed at the top of the second screenshot represents the time when the screenshot was taken, and not when the conversation occurred. Although R testified that the minor victim previously had utilized the acronym \"SMH,\" which means shaking my head, and the phrase \"why you hittin' me up\" in the past, R also testified that these sayings are not particular to the minor victim, but, rather, that they are utilized by their entire generation.

App. at 759-66,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493658\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/118/\">\n    181 A.3d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court held that the state sufficiently had authenticated a Facebook message sent by the defendant to an individual through the testimony of the individual that she had received the message bearing the defendant's name only after she agreed to be part of the defendant's criminal plan, that the message was part of\n   a larger series of messages, that the content of the messages made sense and revealed things the defendant would know, that the message contained a \"unique speaking style\" and content, and that the message definitively was from the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Applying these principles, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the defendant failed to meet his burden of authenticating both screenshots because he failed to present sufficient evidence to make a prima facie showing that the minor victim was the author of the text messages therein displayed. Both screenshots are devoid of any extra-textual identifying characteristics that would\n   evince the date and time the messages were sent by the author, or received by R. R could only say that she received them in February or March, 2014. Not only does the second screenshot contain a partial message, but R testified that both screenshots are an incomplete representation of the conversation. R did not testify as to what she had transcribed in the text messages she sent to the minor victim, and the screenshots display only a partial message that was sent by R. In the present case, unlike\n   <em>\n    Papineau\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , there was insufficient corroborating evidence that these messages were part of some longer conversation or the content of such conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Moreover, the content of the messages, as corroborated by R's testimony, also failed to provide sufficient authentication that the minor victim was the author. R was neither asked, nor did she testify, as to the general content of the messages. Rather, R testified that the author utilized two specific phrases, namely \"SMH\" and \"hit me up.\" Although she testified that these phrases had been used by the minor victim in the past, she also stated that these phrases are not particular to the minor victim and are used by her entire generation. Additionally, although the messages allude to members of the minor victim's family and the status of various relationships, this fact is insufficient to support a finding that the minor victim was the author. It is likely that many persons, including members of the minor victim's family, would possess the knowledge of these facts. Thus, contrary to\n   <em>\n    Papineau\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , R's testimony combined with the content of the messages was not sufficiently distinctive to establish that the minor plaintiff was the author.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition, unlike the identifying witnesses in\n   <em>\n    Papineau\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , R did not have a current relationship with the purported author of the text messages that would suggest a reliable basis for identifying the author.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In fact, R testified that she did not have a close relationship with the minor victim at the time of the exchange as they \"kind of split off as [they] got older.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Nor were the screenshots corroborated by other events or forensic computer evidence. The only witness the defendant offered regarding the purported text conversation was R, and she could not provide further corroborative details, testifying that she was not with the minor victim when she received the messages, and that she had never spoken with the minor victim over the phone or in person about the conversation. Nor could R say if the minor victim's cell phone was password protected such that others could not easily gain access to it. In addition, R's cell phone was not available to be examined, and information was not offered from her cell phone provider to confirm the purported exchange with the minor victim. Similarly, neither the minor victim's cell phone nor cell phone records were offered to confirm that the minor victim was the author of the messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, the entirety of the text message exchange was categorically contradicted by the direct testimony of the minor victim. During the state's case-in-chief, the minor victim\n   <em>\n    denied ever sending R any text messages\n   </em>\n   and denied that she was the \"sender\" of the texts displayed in the screenshots. This testimony, like in\n   <em>\n    Eleck\n   </em>\n   , creates further uncertainty as to the authorship of the messages, particularly given the failure of the defendant to offer other corroborating evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Therefore, we conclude that the court acted well within its discretion when it determined that the defendant failed to present sufficient evidence to support a finding that the minor victim was the author of the text messages, and excluded from evidence both screenshots of those messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The defendant originally appealed to our Supreme Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3).

We reject these contentions as unsupported by Connecticut jurisprudence. Furthermore, we find the notion that some defendants, because of the seriousness of the charges against them, are entitled to greater leeway under the rules of evidence and a heightened standard of review by this court antithetical to the principle that all defendants can expect a consistent application of the law to their cases.

We observe that in some cases, including the present one, where the minor victim was seventeen years old at the time of the interview, the defendant could have sought such direct evidence by asking to voir dire the declarant outside the presence of the jury and before the interview was admitted into evidence, as to her understanding of the purpose of the interview.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    For instance, statements made by a declarant at an interview intended by the interviewer to be for medical diagnosis and treatment would not be admissible under the exception if it reasonably could not be inferred that the declarant understood that the interview had a medical purpose.

We are not persuaded. This argument was raised for the first time on appeal, so it was not properly preserved.

In addition, whether the information provided by the declarant ultimately is determined to be true, false, or inconsistent has never been the test to determine whether the statement should be admitted in the first place. Again, the test focuses on the declarant's understanding of the purpose for the interview, not the adverse party's attacks on the veracity of the statements made during the interview.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
