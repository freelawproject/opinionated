On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred, pursuant to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in allowing a firearm and ammunition into evidence after the Providence police obtained statements from the defendant in violation of her constitutional right to remain silent and right to counsel. Moreover, the defendant contends that the trial justice erred in failing to exclude the physical evidence obtained through the defendant's statements, asserting that her statements were involuntary and the product of coercion. Finally, the defendant avers that the trial justice erred in failing to suppress the physical evidence seized from her vehicle because the Providence police violated her constitutional rights pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution by impounding her vehicle without probable cause. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 17, 2015, a grand jury indicted defendant on count one, first-degree murder, in violation of G.L. 1956 \u00a7 11-23-1 ; and count two, discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, in violation of G.L. 1956 \u00a7 11-47-3.2(b)(4). The following facts give rise to these charges. At the time of her death, Pamela Donahue (Donahue) shared her apartment with Walter Woodyatt (Woodyatt), her former boyfriend. At trial, Woodyatt testified that he had a strained relationship with Donahue due to his drinking and her drug use. He explained that his romantic relationship with Donahue ultimately ended, but that he still lived in Donahue's apartment at the time in question. Following the end of her romantic relationship with Woodyatt, Donahue met defendant while they were both staying in the hospital, and the two began dating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 1, 2014, the day before Donahue was murdered, defendant went to the Providence police station to discuss concerns she had regarding Donahue's drug use and her abusive relationship with her drug dealer, with whom, according to defendant, Donahue had had sexual relations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After spending approximately thirty minutes speaking with a detective at the police station, defendant left without ever identifying Donahue by name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the late afternoon of December 2, 2014, Woodyatt arrived at Donahue's apartment, after spending several hours at a local bar, to find Donahue and defendant talking; he alleged they were also doing drugs. Woodyatt testified at trial that, around 7:45 p.m., defendant gave him $40 and asked him to go \"to the store right across the street\" to get three packs of cigarettes and soda. Woodyatt testified that he obliged, and that he thought it was odd when he saw defendant pulling away in her vehicle as he left the store with defendant's change and the items she had requested. Woodyatt testified that he proceeded back to the apartment and that his announcement of arrival went unanswered. Woodyatt described finding Donahue face down on the floor; he testified that he \"couldn't get her up.\" At 8:25 p.m., Woodyatt, unable to find the apartment phone, went upstairs to use a neighbor's phone to call the police; he informed them that he believed Donahue had overdosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the paramedics arrived and transported Donahue's body to the hospital, the police looked around the apartment for about an hour and a half, collecting drugs and cell phones. Woodyatt testified that, after the detectives left, he learned that Donahue had died. Later that same night, Woodyatt testified, defendant called the landline phone at the apartment and asked how Donahue was doing. Woodyatt informed defendant, \"She's dead[,]\" and defendant hung up the phone. Upon examining Donahue's body, the medical examiner determined that a gunshot wound to the chest had caused Donahue's death. An investigation ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    The First Interview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 3, 2014, detectives met defendant at her Johnston, Rhode Island, apartment, and defendant agreed to accompany them to the Providence police station to discuss Donahue's death. During that time, other detectives began drafting a search warrant for defendant's apartment, and Johnston police secured the scene. Police conducted a search of defendant's apartment around 11:00 p.m. and found nothing of evidentiary value. However, while at defendant's apartment, detectives located her white Kia in the back parking lot of the apartment complex and towed the vehicle to the Providence police station for secure keeping until police could apply for a search warrant. That warrant was obtained and executed the next day, December 4, 2014. The police seized a shell casing and three cell phones from defendant's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the interim, Detectives William Corrigan and Frank Villella of the Providence police department initiated an interview (the first interview)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   with defendant at the police station and read defendant her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Detective Corrigan testified that defendant confirmed that she understood her rights and that she checked a box on the rights form acknowledging as much. He testified that defendant told the detectives that someone had stolen money from her bank account during her recent stay in the hospital. Moreover, Det. Corrigan testified that defendant told detectives\n   that she had been in a relationship with Donahue for several years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, Det. Corrigan testified that defendant admitted to having had an argument with Donahue on the night of December 2, 2014, and that defendant told the detectives that she left the apartment soon after she sent Woodyatt to get cigarettes and soda because Donahue had asked her to leave. Approximately twenty-five minutes into the interview, defendant requested counsel and the police terminated the interview. At that time, defendant was not under arrest and she left the station. Detective Corrigan testified that, based on his extensive experience dealing with individuals under the influence of narcotics or alcohol, defendant did not appear to be inhibited by either during that interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    The Second Interview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nine days later, on December 12, 2014, police obtained an arrest warrant for defendant. On December 22, 2014, police located and arrested defendant and transported her to the police station, where Officer Kathleen Chamberlain booked and processed defendant around 2:30 p.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Detective Carlos Sical and Det. Corrigan arrived at the cellblock shortly before 5:00 p.m. and took defendant to an interview room for questioning (the second interview).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the outset of the second interview, which began at 4:50 p.m., defendant asked the detectives if her attorney had contacted the police; Det. Corrigan informed defendant that the attorney had not. Detective Corrigan then read defendant her rights again. Near the beginning of the interview, defendant referenced counsel twice more. At one point she asked, \"I mean, do I get my lawyer in here with * * * me then? I don't want to be alone if that's (inaudible). I don't know. I mean, I do know. I don't want to be alone.\" Then, after a short time, the following discussion occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: * * *. I mean, my lawyer was called. But can you-can you call him again? See if he can come listen and understand what-what's going on?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"DETECTIVE CORRIGAN: So you want your lawyer present? Is that-is that what you're saying?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: Yeah. I-I want-it's not 'cause I want to be (inaudible).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \" * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: I just want someone to advocate for me. * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nevertheless, the detectives did not stop the interview, and the conversation continued. During this interview, the detectives informed defendant that, in searching her vehicle, the police had found a shell casing in the front passenger side. The defendant denied any knowledge or involvement regarding the shell casing. Instead, defendant proposed the idea that perhaps someone had planted the shell casing in her vehicle in an effort to \"pin\" the crime on her. Until this point, defendant and the detectives had remained quiet and calm in their exchanges. However, after the detectives informed defendant about the shell casing, the video recording of the interview reveals, defendant became tense and raised her voice for a moment. The detectives also became argumentative for a short time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After that, the remainder of the second interview proceeded in a conversational and seemingly relaxed manner, and defendant continually denied any involvement in Donahue's murder. Eventually, defendant stated, \"I thought I was supposed to have a lawyer here for questioning.\" The detectives, again, continued to question defendant. At some point thereafter, defendant asked the detectives if they had anything else to tell her, at which time the detectives told defendant that \"[t]he bullet-the shell casing we found in your car, it matches the bullet that we found in her body.\" In response, defendant repeatedly told detectives that was \"impossible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Subsequently, defendant again invoked her right to counsel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: You're supposed-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"DETECTIVE SICAL: Sendra-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: -to have a lawyer here. You're not even supposed to continue to talk to me. Why can't-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"DETECTIVE SICAL: Do you want your lawyer?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: Well, I called him before. He said he called down to the station. Did we check-now what do we do now? I've never been through this before.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \" * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \" * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \" * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \" * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"DETECTIVE SICAL: We've asked you several times.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   After a few more exchanges, defendant stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: I know. * * * I said, 'Yes, I do want him here.' * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Shortly thereafter, at approximately 6:15 p.m., the detectives ended the interview and brought defendant back to the cellblock. Detective Corrigan candidly testified that he was aware that he was legally required to stop questioning defendant once she requested counsel; however, he had continued to question her after her first requests for counsel in an effort to elicit information and because she had continued talking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Officer Chamberlain testified that, upon arriving back at the cellblock, defendant placed her one allotted phone call to her attorney. Officer Chamberlain further testified that she was unware if defendant's attorney had answered the call and that, while she did stand close by, she did not listen to defendant's exact words because it was a \"private phone call[.]\" Officer Chamberlain also testified that, at around 8:00 p.m., defendant \"was hollering for [Officer Chamberlain] to come\" to her cell, at which time defendant requested to speak with the detectives. Officer Chamberlain testified that she contacted the detectives and that, at around 9:00 p.m., the detectives arrived at the cellblock to take defendant back to the interview room. Lastly, Officer Chamberlain testified that, between the time detectives brought defendant back to her cell after the second interview and the time that defendant requested to speak to the detectives again, no detective or police officer spoke with defendant in the cellblock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    The Third Interview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Sergeant Fabio Zuena, of the Providence police department detective division, and Det. Sical conducted the next interview (the third interview).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sergeant Zuena\n   testified that he believed defendant had stated that she was cold as the detectives took her from the cellblock to the interview room; so, at the onset of the third interview, Det. Sical gave defendant a jacket. After that, the interview began with the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"DETECTIVE ZUENA: Before we get started, you approached them downstairs, you wanted to speak to us again?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: Yes. That's right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"DETECTIVE ZUENA: What did you tell them downstairs?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: No, nothing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \"DETECTIVE ZUENA: Oh, you just told them you wanted-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \"DETECTIVE ZUENA: -to speak to detectives again?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \"DETECTIVE ZUENA: Okay. You understand you had your rights before? And in the middle you wanted the attorney?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: Yeah. He was never called.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \"DETECTIVE ZUENA: Okay. So-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: (Inaudible)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"DETECTIVE ZUENA: -and then you expressed to them that you wanted to speak to us again?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \"DETECTIVE ZUENA: So now you want to speak to us again?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: That's right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \"DETECTIVE ZUENA: All right. We just want to make sure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"DETECTIVE SICAL: Just so you know, the same rules apply. Okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: Yeah. The same rules apply.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As the exchange demonstrates, in the third interview, the detectives did not formally re-\"Mirandize\" defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Eventually, defendant admitted to the detectives that she had bought a gun for her protection. The defendant proceeded to confess to using the gun to shoot Donahue one time in the chest. After defendant confessed to murdering Donahue, she explained that she buried the gun at a location off Route 116 in Scituate, Rhode Island. The detectives then asked defendant to bring them to where the gun was buried \"because [they] wouldn't want anybody else to get hurt with [it].\" The detectives proceeded to tell defendant that they \"really [didn't] want anybody to find it, especially a small child * * * playing in the area, to find it and hurt themselves.\" Ultimately, defendant agreed to go with the detectives the next morning to show them where she buried the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    D\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    The Fourth Interview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   At approximately 9:30 a.m. the next day, Detective Jason Simoneau and Det. Corrigan transported defendant to a park in Scituate where she had informed them that she had hidden the gun (the fourth interview).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Due to inclement weather, after pointing officers in the general direction of the gun, defendant remained in the police cruiser as the detectives searched for the gun. Eventually, the detectives located the gun, and ammunition, hidden under leaves. The detectives did not read defendant her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights at any time that morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    E\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    Pretrial Motions, Trial, and Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Prior to trial, defendant filed two separate motions to suppress-the first, in May 2015, dealt with the search and seizure of defendant's vehicle; and the second, in October 2015, just prior to trial, sought the suppression of defendant's statements to police and the physical evidence obtained from those statements. In an effort to give more context to the crux of the arguments, we will first consider defendant's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   arguments regarding the motion to suppress the statements and physical evidence obtained therefrom, and then we will address defendant's motion to suppress concerning the search and seizure of her vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   On October 16 and 20, 2015, the trial justice heard arguments on defendant's motion to suppress her statements to police, as well as a motion to suppress the physical evidence that was obtained as a result of those statements. At the October 20, 2015 hearing, the state conceded that the Providence police had violated defendant's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights with regard to the second, third, and fourth interviews. Accordingly, the parties and the trial justice agreed that defendant's statements in each of those interviews required suppression at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the remaining issue for the trial justice to consider was whether, in light of the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   violations, the gun and ammunition that defendant had led the police detectives to in Scituate were inadmissible physical evidence, as the fruit of defendant's inadmissible statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The defendant contended that the trial justice should reject the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Patane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856668\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/630/\">\n    542 U.S. 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856668\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/630/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856668\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/630/\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), in which the Supreme Court declined to extend the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine to exclude physical evidence obtained through voluntary but unwarned confessions.\n   <em>\n    Patane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856668\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/630/\">\n    542 U.S. at 636-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856668\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/630/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, defendant urged the trial justice to follow the lead of other states and broaden protections under the Rhode Island Constitution. The defendant also argued that, even if the trial justice did find\n   <em>\n    Patane\n   </em>\n   controlling, the physical evidence is nevertheless inadmissible because her mental illness and the alleged coercive nature of the interrogation rendered her confession involuntary and outside the parameters of\n   <em>\n    Patane\n   </em>\n   . The state argued, however, that the physical evidence that the Providence police obtained by way of defendant's statements was admissible, notwithstanding the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   violations, because of the holding in\n   <em>\n    Patane\n   </em>\n   . The state further contended that a suspect's mental illness is not dispositive in determining coercion; instead, the nature of the police conduct is controlling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   On November 12, 2015, the trial justice issued a written decision denying defendant's motion to suppress. The trial justice thoroughly explained the split among states' interpretations and applications of\n   <em>\n    Patane\n   </em>\n   , ultimately concluding that she was constrained to follow the approach announced in\n   <em>\n    Patane\n   </em>\n   , based on this Court's jurisprudence. Moreover, the trial justice awarded no merit to defendant's contention that her confession was involuntary. The trial justice determined that the detectives did not violate defendant's rights during the interrogations when they made \"misstatements\" regarding the link between the bullet found in Donahue's body and the shell casing found in defendant's vehicle. The trial justice also concluded\n   that the police acted lawfully in waiting more than fourteen days, after they first questioned her on the day after Donahue's murder, to arrest defendant and conduct the second interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The defendant's trial began on November 12, 2015, and concluded on November 24, 2015, when a jury found defendant guilty of second-degree murder on count one and guilty of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence on count two. On January 8, 2016, the trial justice denied defendant's motion for a new trial. Thereafter, on March 4, 2016, the trial justice imposed a life sentence on count one and a consecutive life sentence on count two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   On March 9, 2016, defendant appealed her convictions to this Court. She argues on appeal that the trial justice erred in admitting the physical evidence obtained as a result of what defendant asserts were involuntary and coerced statements in violation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, defendant avers that the seizure of her vehicle was unlawful and the evidence obtained therein was tainted physical evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We will first address whether the trial justice erred in allowing the firearm and ammunition into evidence at trial, in light of the fact that the Providence police obtained defendant's statements in violation of her right to remain silent and her right to counsel under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . Next, we will consider whether defendant's statements were involuntary and, if so, whether the trial justice therefore erred in declining to suppress the physical evidence. Finally, we will consider whether the impounding of defendant's vehicle by the Providence police violated her protections against unreasonable searches and seizures guaranteed under the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions and whether any evidence seized therefrom was tainted and inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   When we review a trial justice's decision on a motion to suppress, we engage in a two-step process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, \"we 'defer to the trial justice's findings of historical fact concerning the voluntariness of the confession unless those findings are clearly erroneous.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Second, because the issues we address herein are \"of constitutional dimension, we accept the historical facts and credibility determinations, and then conduct a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the trial justice's conclusion that the confession was voluntary.\"\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8305249\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/940/645/#p656\">\n    940 A.2d at 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    Admission of Physical Fruits of Unwarned Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Prior to commencing our analysis, we reiterate that the state conceded prior to trial that defendant's statements during her second, third, and fourth interviews required suppression and could not be used against her at trial, except for impeachment purposes. Therefore, the issue before this Court is whether law enforcement's failure to comply with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   requires the suppression of the physical evidence acquired as a result of a suspect's unwarned, but voluntary, statements. In answering this question, this Court must first decide whether to adopt the United States Supreme Court's 2004 holding in\n   <em>\n    Patane\n   </em>\n   , where the Court concluded that suppression is not required in such instances.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856668\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/630/\">\n    542 U.S. 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856668\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/630/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In appealing the trial justice's decision, defendant avers that we should instead follow the lead of other state courts and provide broader protections based on our state constitution.

For instance, defendant did not endure prolonged interrogation, and she had the opportunity to call her lawyer-albeit after several requests. Furthermore, the detectives never employed abusive interrogation tactics to elicit information from defendant. Instead, a review of the interrogation videos assures us that the interviews were relaxed in nature and conversational in tone for almost the entirety of each of the interviews. The detectives also provided defendant with water during the interviews, gave her a jacket, and agreed to inquire about getting a blanket for her to use in her cell. Officer Chamberlain testified that defendant also had food in her cell and that the officer placed more food in defendant's cell when the detectives brought defendant to the interview room. This case is also distinct from\n   <em>\n    Gilkeson\n   </em>\n   because, here, defendant voluntarily initiated the third interview with detectives when she summoned Officer Chamberlain to her cell and requested that she be allowed to speak with detectives again. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Gilkeson\n   </em>\n   did not have a choice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gilkeson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5536657\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/431/270/\">\n    431 F.Supp.2d at 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At that time, Beauregard had the opportunity to make a phone call to her attorney. Officer Chamberlain testified that no one from the Providence police department interacted with defendant during that time. Notably, as the trial justice described, defendant appeared \"intelligent, polite, alert, calm, rational and responsive during all three interviews,\" and \"[h]er responses to the police questions were clear, thoughtful and reflective.\" We therefore opine that defendant's statements were not coerced on these grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Additionally, defendant avers that law enforcement's decision to wait nineteen days to arrest her was procedurally improper and indicative of coercion.

Based on this reasoning, the detectives here acted lawfully and reasonably in waiting that allotted amount of time between the first interview with defendant and her subsequent arrest. We do not view this as a coercive tactic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Furthermore, defendant's contention that the detectives coerced her statements by misstating facts regarding the connection between the shell casing seized from her vehicle and the bullet found in Donahue's body similarly fails. The United States Supreme Court has held that \"[t]he fact that the police misrepresented the statements that [a witness] had made is,\n   while relevant, insufficient * * * to make [an] otherwise voluntary confession inadmissible.\"\n   <em>\n    Frazier v.

In light of the totality of the circumstances, we agree with the trial justice that the detectives' interview techniques did not amount to coercion and were not \"sufficient to affect a voluntariness finding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial justice clearly erred in determining that defendant's statements were voluntary. Therefore, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Patane\n   </em>\n   , the gun and ammunition that defendant's unwarned statements led detectives to are admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    Impounding of Defendant's Vehicle\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   We next consider whether the trial justice erred in concluding that the police's seizure through the impounding of defendant's vehicle and the subsequent search of the vehicle were constitutional and the evidence obtained therein consequently admissible. As stated above, the detectives obtained a search warrant for defendant's apartment after their first interview with defendant, which was at approximately 7:00 p.m. on December 3, 2014. Around 11:00 p.m. that same night, detectives executed the search warrant and found nothing of evidentiary value in defendant's apartment. After the detectives finished searching her apartment, they impounded defendant's white Kia, which was in a parking lot behind defendant's apartment complex. The next day, the police obtained a search warrant for defendant's vehicle; they performed the search at approximately 10:10 p.m. that day. In executing the search warrant, detectives uncovered a .38-caliber shell casing and three cell phones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   At the hearing on defendant's motion to suppress the shell casing and three cell phones that Providence police seized from her vehicle, defendant averred that the police had violated her Fourth Amendment rights when they seized her vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant contended that the police did not have probable cause; and, therefore, defendant argued that the items seized were inadmissible. In opposing defendant's motion, the state contended that the police had probable cause to believe that defendant's vehicle contained evidence of Donahue's murder, particularly in light of the fact that they had just obtained a search warrant for defendant's apartment. The state additionally argued that the evidence obtained from defendant's vehicle was admissible under the automobile exception to the exclusionary rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   On June 5, 2015, after considering the parties' memoranda and the relevant case law, the trial justice concluded that the police had reason to believe that defendant's vehicle contained evidence relating to Donahue's murder, and she therefore denied defendant's motion. The trial justice further noted that the automobile exception would apply to allow the evidence seized from defendant's car, even without the warrant that the police had subsequently obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In reaching her conclusion, the trial justice reviewed Woodyatt's detailed timeline of events, as described in his statement to police. Specifically, Woodyatt explained that he was in the apartment with defendant and Donahue just before Donahue was murdered. Woodyatt testified that defendant gave him $40 and asked him to go\n   to the store across the street to get cigarettes and soda; as he left the store and made his way back to the apartment with the items and defendant's change, he saw defendant driving away in her white Kia. Upon returning to the apartment, after just a short time, Woodyatt found Donahue alone and unresponsive. Video surveillance from the convenience store corroborated Woodyatt's version of the events. Further, Woodyatt had described various occasions in the past in which he witnessed defendant and Donahue having both verbal and physical altercations. Finally, the trial justice noted that, \"if the police had gone and got the warrant [before impounding the vehicle], they would have received the warrant based on * * * probable cause and obtained the same evidence.\" Accordingly, the trial justice declared that this case fell squarely within the holding of\n   <em>\n    State v. Werner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7934672\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/615/1010/\">\n    615 A.2d 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (R.I. 1992), and therefore the automobile exception to the warrant requirement clearly applied to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In appealing the trial justice's denial of her motion to suppress, defendant contends that the Providence police violated her rights under both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution, because the police lacked the requisite probable cause to seize her vehicle. As such, defendant argues that the shell casing and three cell phones seized from her vehicle were tainted and consequently inadmissible at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   To the contrary, the state maintains that the trial justice correctly determined that the police had probable cause to seize defendant's vehicle. The state also argues that the seizure of the vehicle was necessitated by the circumstances because, on the day that defendant's vehicle was seized, defendant was not under arrest and therefore she could have moved the vehicle or discarded any evidence that was inside. Lastly, the state posits that the Providence police showed good faith in obtaining a warrant to search defendant's vehicle and that the police would have been justified in searching it in the parking lot of the apartment complex without a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. Accordingly, to conduct a search, the police must have probable cause and a warrant, absent an exception to the warrant requirement. The Supreme Court has defined probable cause, in the automobile context, as \"a belief, reasonably arising out of circumstances known to the seizing officer, that an automobile or other vehicle contains that which by law is subject to seizure[.]\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

There,\n   the police relied on facts from \"eyewitnesses at the scene of the shooting [who] supplied officers with a detailed description of the assailant's car[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Werner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7934672\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/615/1010/\">\n    615 A.2d at 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We held that the officer was justified in relying on the eyewitnesses' statements and thereafter searching the vehicle, without a warrant, seeking evidence relating to the crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7934672\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/615/1010/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We relied on Supreme Court opinions in holding \"that exigency is no longer a requirement of the automobile exception\" to the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7934672\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/615/1010/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, we explained that \"[a]s long as the police have probable cause to believe that an automobile * * * holds contraband or evidence of a crime, then police may conduct a warrantless search of the vehicle * * * even if the vehicle has lost its mobility and is in police custody.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7934672\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/615/1010/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7934672\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/615/1010/\">\n    at 1013-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   We agree with the trial justice's probable-cause analysis, and hold that the Providence police had probable cause to justify the seizure of the defendant's vehicle under the automobile exception. The trial justice clearly and thoroughly articulated her review of the facts in making her determination that the Providence police had probable cause to impound and subsequently search the defendant's vehicle. Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice's denial of the defendant's motion to suppress the shell casing and three cell phones seized from that search.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   We also note that, while in an abundance of caution, the Providence police, in good faith, sought and obtained a search warrant before searching the defendant's vehicle, the police would have been justified in searching the vehicle prior to obtaining a warrant, based on the probable cause detailed herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

Although it is not necessary to consider, we would highlight defendant's lucid train of thought as she maneuvered through the interviews with police, offering alternative theories for Donahue's murder and attempting to pass blame onto various other actors throughout the interview. The defendant offered an array of suspects as well as several alternative rationales to explain why she murdered Donahue. Additionally, defendant also suggested that the police planted the shell casing in her vehicle to frame her for the crime.

While exigency is no longer a requirement for the automobile exception, the trial justice did explain why she believed exigent circumstances existed. In her decision, the trial justice noted that defendant's first interaction with the Providence police took place on December 3, 2014, when the police asked defendant to accompany them to the police station. At that time, defendant was not under arrest, and she was free to leave when the first interview ended. Accordingly, the trial justice concluded that the police had reason to believe that, in light of defendant's interactions with them, she might attempt to dispose of any evidence that may have been in her vehicle.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
