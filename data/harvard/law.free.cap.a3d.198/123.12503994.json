Li and Liping Wang, appeal from the judgment of the trial court, rendered after a trial to the court, in favor of the defendant, Valerie M. Yaggi, individually and as administratrix of the estate of Henry Yaggi, on the plaintiffs' two count complaint alleging breach of the parties' purchase and sale agreement and breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the court (1) erroneously found that the plaintiffs failed to diligently pursue a written mortgage commitment, (2) erroneously found that the plaintiffs failed to give notice of their inability to obtain financing for the real estate purchase by the agreed upon commitment date,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) erred in awarding the defendant attorney's fees. The defendant raises the doctrine of equitable estoppel as an alternative ground for affirmance of the court's decision. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. On October 26, 2012, the defendant entered into a purchase and sale agreement (agreement) with the plaintiffs with respect to a parcel of real property located at 45 Wickford Place in the town of Madison (property).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The purchase price of the property was $810,000, and the plaintiffs submitted deposits totaling $25,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The agreement contained a mortgage contingency clause in paragraph 6, which stated: \"Buyer's obligation is contingent upon Buyer obtaining financing as specified in this paragraph. Buyer agrees to apply for such financing immediately and diligently pursue a written mortgage commitment on or before the Commitment Date.... If Buyer is unable to obtain a written commitment and notifies Seller in writing by 5:00 p.m. on said Commitment Date, this Agreement shall be null and void and any Deposits shall be immediately returned to Buyer. Otherwise, the Financing Contingency shall be deemed satisfied and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\" The agreement specified that the commitment date was thirty days from the date of the October 26 agreement, which was November 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because November 25 was a Sunday, the commitment date was November 26. The closing date was set for December 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Paragraph 14 of the agreement provided: \"If Buyer fails to comply with any Terms of this Agreement by the time set forth for compliance and Seller is not in default, Seller shall be entitled to all initial and additional deposit funds provided for in section 4, whether or not Buyer has paid the same, as liquidated damages and both parties shall be relieved of further liability under this Agreement. If legal action is brought to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees.\" On November 24, 2012, the plaintiffs sent an e-mail to the defendant, stating: \"Attached is a request of mortgage extension. Due to the Hurricane Sandy and Thanksgiving holiday. We won't be able to obtain a mortgage commitment by 5 [p.m.] today. We request your approval of extension. We expect a commitment from a bank next week. Please sign and return to us ASAP.\" (November 24 e-mail) The plaintiffs attached to their e-mail a change form, which proposed an amended commitment date of December 3, 2012, and an amended closing date of December 14, 2012. The change form was signed by the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant forwarded the e-mail to her realtor, Lorey Walz, on November 24. The same day, Walz e-mailed Blake Ruchti, the plaintiffs' realtor, stating: \"We have received the request to extend the mortgage commitment date and closing date. The sellers, Hank and Val Yaggi, are willing to do so after receiving verification from the bank that you have a mortgage approval contingent upon a bank appraisal.... Hank and Valerie Yaggi would like to see you purchase the home but have to be confident that a bank commitment will be given.\" The defendant did not sign the change form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiffs submitted a second change form, signed by the plaintiffs and dated November 30, 2012, to the defendant. The second change form proposed an amended commitment date of December 14, 2012, and an amended closing date of December 21, 2012. The defendant handwrote, next to the amended commitment and closing dates, \"[t]ime is of the essence,\" and initialed next to those handwritten additions. The defendant signed the second change form on December 4, 2012. The plaintiffs did not initial next to those handwritten additions, but they subsequently executed a third and a fourth change form, requesting further extensions of the commitment and closing dates. Neither form was signed by the defendant. The fourth change form proposed an amended commitment date of January 18, 2013, and an amended closing date of January 25, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 17, 2013, the plaintiffs e-mailed the defendant's counsel, James Segaloff, following up on a conversation from February 6, 2013, in which they told Segaloff that the first bank to which they applied for a mortgage had denied their loan application, the second such bank had requested an affidavit of repair for the roof before issuing a commitment, and the third such bank had not yet responded. In their e-mail, the plaintiffs stated: \"We have requested for contract termination but no response from your clients.... Please advise the status and their consideration of the termination of the contract.\" The plaintiffs requested return of their deposits and attached a notice of loan denial from the first bank, United Wholesale Mortgage, dated December 13, 2012, and a suspense notice from the second bank, Mortgages Services III, LLC, dated December 6, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 27, 2014, the plaintiffs commenced this action, alleging in relevant part that the defendant had breached the purchase and sale agreement by \"not timely releas[ing] the deposit[s] ....\" Both parties moved for summary judgment, those motions were denied, and the matter was tried to the court on March 9, 2017. The parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. On July 25, 2017, the court issued a memorandum of decision, finding that the plaintiffs had breached the purchase and sale agreement by failing (1) to timely terminate the contract, and (2) to diligently pursue financing as required under the agreement. Specifically, the court concluded that the November 24 e-mail sent by the plaintiffs did not constitute written notice of termination of the agreement, but rather served as a request for an extension of the commitment and closing dates. The court further found that none of the change forms submitted by the plaintiffs had been agreed upon by the parties and, thus, that the original commitment date remained operative. Because the plaintiffs did not provide written notice of termination by 5 p.m. on the commitment date, the court concluded that the defendant was entitled to retain the deposits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Regarding the requirement to diligently pursue financing, the court relied on the two December, 2012\n   \"mortgage denial notifications,\" provided by the plaintiffs to the defendant on February 17, 2013. The court found that the notifications \"indicated that the plaintiffs did not fully complete their loan applications, and were thus denied financing.\" The court noted that the plaintiffs had submitted the third and fourth change forms requesting extensions of the commitment date after the issuance of the December denial notifications, at which time they were \"fully aware that they had been denied a mortgage by two\n   banks.\" Thus, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had breached the agreement by failing to pursue financing in a diligent manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had defaulted on the agreement, triggering the liquidated damages clause set forth in paragraph 14 of the agreement. The court found that the amount of the deposits, $25,000, was a reasonable amount for the defendant to retain as liquidated damages because that sum represented only three percent of the $810,000 purchase price of the property and the defendant had testified that the delay occasioned by the plaintiffs had ultimately caused the defendant to sell the property for $135,000 less than the contract price to which the parties had agreed. With respect to the defendant's request for attorney's fees, the court ordered the defendant to file a motion, together with a supporting affidavit, and indicated that it would \"determine whether reasonable attorney's fees shall be awarded\" after a hearing on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiffs filed this appeal on July 28, 2017. On January 29, 2018, the court awarded the defendant attorney's fees in the amount of $38,000 and costs, after which the plaintiffs filed an amended appeal. Additional facts shall be set forth as necessary. We now turn to the plaintiffs' claims on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the present case, the trial court determined that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the return of their deposits because they had not complied with the terms of the mortgage contingency clause. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiffs failed both to diligently pursue a written mortgage commitment and to give the notice to the defendant as described in the mortgage contingency clause. We conclude that the court's finding as to diligence was clearly erroneous because it was not specific to the relevant timeframe. We further conclude that the court's finding as to notice rested on a misinterpretation of the language contained in the mortgage contingency clause, in that the court construed the clause as requiring notice of termination of the agreement, rather than notice of an inability to obtain a written commitment by the commitment date. Consequently, the court's findings did not properly resolve the plaintiffs' breach of contract claim seeking to invoke the mortgage contingency clause's provision for the return of their deposits. The central questions that should have been decided by the court were (1) whether the plaintiffs diligently pursued a written mortgage commitment on or before the commitment date,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) whether, if they were unable to obtain a written commitment by the commitment date, they so informed the defendant in writing by 5 p.m. on that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We begin by setting forth the general law applicable to mortgage contingency clauses. A mortgage contingency clause contained in a contract for the sale of real property generally allows a purchaser to recover his or her deposit if the purchaser is unable to secure a mortgage and has complied with the provisions of the contingency\n   clause. See generally 77 Am. Jur. 2d, Vendor and Purchaser \u00a7 531 (2016) (\"The purchaser may be expressly given the privilege or option to rescind the contract and to recover any payments made\n   by him or her where the contract of sale provides for the cancellation of the contract\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the event that the purchaser is unable to obtain a mortgage or loan within a specified time. Accordingly, when a contract for the sale of real property contains a mortgage contingency clause ... they are entitled to recover their down payment if the mortgage is not in fact approved through no fault of their own.... On the other hand, where the purchaser disregards the terms of a financing contingency contained in a contract for sale ... the purchaser would not be entitled to invoke the contractual contingency and recover his or her down payment.\" [Footnotes added and omitted.] ). The condition is \"meant to protect the buyer. It is a condition of the buyer's duty, not a condition of the seller's duty under the contract. Upon the nonoccurrence of the condition, i.e., the buyer's obtaining financing, the buyer is ipso facto excused from performance.\" (Footnotes omitted.) 92 C.J.S., Vendor and Purchaser \u00a7 197 (2018) ; see also 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 225, illustration (8) (1981); id., \u00a7 226, illustration (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the present case, the plain language of the provision in question, stating that the \"Buyer's obligation is\n   contingent upon Buyer obtaining financing,\" evidences the intent of the parties that the provision be a condition precedent to the plaintiffs' obligation to perform their agreement to purchase. Our appellate courts have previously interpreted similar mortgage contingency clauses and determined them to be conditions precedent to the contract. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Luttinger\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rosen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1957302\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/164/45/#p48\">\n    164 Conn. 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20A.2d%20757\">\n    316 A.2d 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   see also\n   <em>\n    Barber\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jacobs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1046402\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/58/330/#p335\">\n    58 Conn.

They disagree, however, as to whether the plaintiffs diligently pursued such a written commitment before that date and whether they gave written notice\n   of their inability to obtain a commitment in such a way as to entitle them to the return of their deposits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The plaintiffs claim that the court erred in concluding that the plaintiffs breached the purchase and sale\n   agreement by failing to diligently pursue financing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that they provided all documents to two banks to which they applied for financing, and that the December, 2012, denial and suspense notices presented to the court evidenced their diligent pursuit of such financing. They contend that the court \"failed to understand the mortgage process and didn't analyze the denial/suspense reasons, terms, and conditions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs further argue that the agreement did not require applications to multiple banks and, thus, that their application to one bank was sufficient to comply with the agreement. The defendant argues that the trial court's finding that the plaintiffs \"did not fully complete their loan applications\" was supported by the December, 2012 denial and suspense notices. We agree with the plaintiffs that the court's finding that they failed to diligently pursue financing was clearly erroneous, although we do so on the basis that the court erroneously relied upon the December, 2012 denial and suspense notices. Those notices were ambiguous as to whether they reflected the plaintiffs' efforts up to the commitment date and, therefore, shed light on the plaintiffs' diligence in pursuing financing during the relevant timeframe, or whether they reflected plaintiffs' efforts\n   after the commitment date, i.e., after the deadline for the plaintiffs' use of diligence had passed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The mortgage contingency clause in the parties' agreement required the plaintiffs to diligently pursue a written mortgage commitment on or before the commitment date. Similar provisions have been interpreted by our appellate courts as \"imply[ing] a promise by the borrower that he or she will make reasonable efforts to secure a suitable mortgage.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Barber\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jacobs\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1046402\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/58/330/#p335\">\n    58 Conn.

Whether the plaintiff's actions constituted reasonable efforts to satisfy the contractual condition is a factual determination for the trial court.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 708,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20A.3d%20597\">\n    24 A.3d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The question for the court was whether the plaintiffs had used reasonable diligence in their efforts to pursue a written mortgage commitment on or before the commitment date. By the express terms of the agreement, that obligation terminated on the commitment date. In reaching the conclusion that the plaintiffs failed to diligently pursue a written mortgage commitment on or before the commitment date, however, the court relied solely on the December, 2012 denial and suspense notices, which were ambiguous as to whether they reflected efforts of the plaintiffs within the relevant time period. Although the trial court found that the two notices \"indicated that the plaintiffs did not fully complete their loan applications,\" the notices themselves provide no suggestion as to whether the plaintiffs were previously notified, prior to the commitment date, of any deficiencies in their applications. The court, in relying exclusively upon the denial and suspense notices, failed to properly focus on the diligence of the efforts made by the plaintiffs up to the commitment date. The court made no specific finding that there had been a lack of reasonable diligence in that earlier time period. Accordingly, the court's finding that the plaintiffs failed to diligently pursue financing is clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The plaintiffs next contend that the court erroneously found that they failed to give written notice of their inability to obtain financing for the real estate purchase by the commitment date. They argue that they provided such notice by way of their November 24 e-mail, wherein they stated: \"Attached is a request of mortgage extension. Due to the Hurricane Sandy\n   and Thanksgiving holiday. We won't be able to obtain a mortgage commitment by 5 [p.m.] today. We request your approval of extension. We expect a commitment from a bank next week. Please sign and return to us ASAP.\" The plaintiffs argue that the November 24 e-mail satisfied their obligation under the agreement to provide notice of their inability to obtain financing by the commitment date, and that, contrary to the court's finding, the agreement did not require the plaintiffs to declare the contract terminated. As support for their argument, the plaintiffs identify a separate provision of the agreement that expressly requires the buyer to notify the seller of the \"Buyer's election to terminate this Agreement.\" The defendant responds that \"the text of the ... e-mail alone is strong evidence in the record that plaintiffs did not seek a termination at all, but merely requested an extension.\" The defendant further emphasizes the plaintiffs' attachment of a change form to their e-mail as evidence that the plaintiffs sought an extension, not a termination of the agreement. We conclude that the court erred in interpreting the mortgage contingency clause to require\n   <em>\n    notice of termination\n   </em>\n   and consequently failed to make a factual determination as to whether the November 24 e-mail constituted\n   <em>\n    notice of an inability to obtain a written commitment.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We first set forth our standard of review. \"[T]he question of contract interpretation is a question of the parties' intent....

Any construction of the agreement that disregards this distinction must be rejected. See\n   <em>\n    Recall Total Information Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Federal Ins.

Accordingly, the court should have determined whether the plaintiffs' November 24 e-mail, taken as a whole, contained sufficient language to notify the defendant of the plaintiffs' inability to obtain financing by the commitment date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The court did find, and the parties agree, that the commitment date was never extended. Although the plaintiffs requested an extension of the commitment and closing dates in their November 24 e-mail, Walz replied that the Yaggis were only willing to agree to an extension \"after receiving verification from the bank that you have a mortgage approval contingent upon a bank appraisal.\" Because the plaintiffs did not provide such verification, and therefore the condition was not fulfilled, the extension never became operative.

Likewise, none of the change forms submitted by the plaintiffs to the defendant effectively changed the commitment and closing dates. The first change form, attached to the plaintiffs' November 24 e-mail, was never signed by the defendant. The defendant, after signing the second change form, indicated that \"[t]ime is of the essence\" next to each of the amended commitment and closing dates, which the plaintiffs never initialed. The third and fourth change forms were never\n   signed by the defendant. Accordingly, the original commitment and closing dates were never extended.\n   The defendant argues that if the plaintiffs \"really believed that they were terminating the agreement on November 24, 2012, when they sent the e-mail, there would be no reason for plaintiffs to ask for multiple extensions of the financing/commitment and closing dates. The underlying contract would have ceased to exist at that point and thus the financing/commitment and closing dates would have been null and void and would not need to be extended and plaintiffs would have had no reason to further pursue financing for the purchase.\" The defendant's argument relies heavily on the plaintiffs' intentions expressed within the November 24 e-mail and throughout their communications thereafter. The defendant argues that \"[r]ather than expressing an inability to obtain financing as the plaintiffs' contend the e-mail actually represents that plaintiff\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   receive financing 'next week.' \" (Emphasis in original.) Although the plaintiffs did seek an extension of the commitment and closing dates through their November 24 e-mail and subsequent change forms, it is undisputed that no agreement to an extension was ever reached. Thus, the only question for the court was whether the November 24 e-mail, taken as a whole, also contained sufficient language to notify the defendant of the plaintiffs' inability to obtain financing by the commitment date, as contemplated by the language contained in the mortgage contingency clause. The trial court's error in interpreting the plaintiffs' obligation under the contract left that question unanswered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Having concluded that the court incorrectly interpreted the agreement's notice requirement and erroneously found that the plaintiffs had failed to diligently pursue financing, we conclude that the judgment must be reversed and that a remand to the trial court for a new trial is necessary.

The defendant argues that the plaintiffs \"are estopped from claiming that they\n   intended to terminate the agreement on November 24, 2012, because they continued to act under the terms of the agreement until at least January 11, 2013, even though the mortgage commitment date had passed and they had forfeited their right to any deposit monies when they failed previously to notify the [defendant] of any intent to terminate the agreement.\" The defendant claims that she relied on the plaintiffs' representations to her detriment, in that she kept the property off the market for almost six months and ultimately sold the property for $135,000 less than the contract price with the plaintiffs. We conclude that the record is inadequate to review this claim, which was not raised before the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Our Supreme Court has held that \"[o]nly in [the] most exceptional circumstances can and will this court consider a claim, constitutional or otherwise, that has not been raised and decided in the trial court....

The plaintiffs had every opportunity to introduce these documents into the record at the time of trial, however they failed to so ....\" In their reply brief, the plaintiffs recognize that the documents were not presented before the trial court.
