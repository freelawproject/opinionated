(SOE), and Seven Oaks Management Corporation\n   (SOM), on two counts alleging breach of contract and one count alleging breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The jury awarded $1.325 million in damages to the plaintiffs. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court (1) abused its discretion in denying the defendant's motion to set aside\n   the verdict and her motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the plaintiffs did not produce the original note at trial, there was insufficient evidence that the note was lost, and the plaintiffs did not have the right to enforce the note; (2) incorrectly instructed the jury regarding SOM's right to enforce the note; (3) lacked subject matter jurisdiction over SOE because it did not have the legal capacity to commence and continue the action; and (4) abused its discretion in denying her motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and in refusing to set aside the verdict because neither plaintiff had a right to enforce the management contract, the alleged breaches did not cause any loss to the plaintiffs, and the jury could not determine with reasonable certainty the amount of damages sustained. We affirm the judgment as to SOE's claim regarding breach of the management contract and reverse as to SOE's claim of breach of contract regarding the note and all of SOM's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found or are undisputed, and procedural history are pertinent to our decision. This dispute concerns a note and a management contract arising from the purchase of a limited liability company by the defendant. Prior to the events in issue, Murray Chodos had purchased a residential property located at 516 Round Hill Road, Greenwich, in 1999. A limited liability company, 516, LLC, had been created to own the property, and SOE was the sole owner of 516, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   SOM was the general partner of SOE and Chodos was the president and managing member of SOM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Chodos met the defendant and her husband in late 2005 or early 2006. Chodos helped the defendant and her husband obtain life insurance policies and referred the defendant to an attorney, who could draft trusts for their children. In October, 2006, Chodos agreed to sell 516, LLC, to the defendant. The defendant purchased 516, LLC, from SOE for $4 million. Payment consisted of $2.675 million in cash by wire transfer and the remaining $1.325 million by a promissory note (note), which listed property located at 516 Round Hill Road as collateral. The purchase agreement was executed by the defendant individually and by SOE. Chodos signed the purchase agreement on behalf of SOM, which in turn acted in its capacity as SOE's general partner. On the defendant's side, the note was executed by the defendant both as manager of 516, LLC, and individually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition, the purchase agreement provided that until the note was paid, Chodos was to be the co-manager of 516, LLC, pursuant to a management contract, which was attached to and expressly incorporated into the purchase agreement. The defendant and Chodos personally executed the management contract, which included provisions that Chodos was not to be removed as co-manager so long as any debt was owed to SOE, that Chodos was to be compensated for his services as co-manager, and that he would have all powers available to the manager under the operating agreement of 516, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 4, 2008, the defendant, unknown to Chodos or to the plaintiffs, unilaterally executed an amendment to the operating agreement of 516, LLC. The amendment removed Chodos as co-manager, provided Chodos with no voting rights, and provided no compensation to Chodos. On May 1, 2008, the defendant executed another amendment to the operating agreement. This amendment recognized a mortgage of $365,000 in favor\n   of Allied International Fund, Inc. (Allied), and placed the Allied security interest above SOE's note in priority.\n   The defendant did not pay any of the $1.325 million owed on the note or anything to Chodos for compensation under the management contract. In April, 2010, the plaintiffs initiated this action against the defendant. On December 31, 2011, SOE executed a \"Bill of Sale and Assignment\" (assignment), which assigned to SOM \"any and all claims, rights and title to any and all defaulted loans and damages relating to the sale of 516, LLC.\" The plaintiffs alleged four counts: (1) breach of contract for the defendant's breach of the management contract; (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing for the defendant's bad faith breaches of the management contract; (3) breach of contract regarding the defendant's failure to make payments on the note; and (4) reckless and wanton misconduct by the defendant. The defendant raised several special defenses and counterclaims. There are no claims on appeal regarding the special defenses and counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial commenced on January 23, 2015. The plaintiffs withdrew their claim of reckless and wanton misconduct before the jury was charged. On February 6, 2015, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on all three remaining counts, as well as the defendant's special defenses and counterclaims. It awarded the plaintiffs $1.325 million in damages. The verdict did not attribute damages to any specific count or counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the same time, the jury provided answers to a set of written jury interrogatories. On February 23, 2015, the defendant filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a motion to set aside the verdict, which\n   motions the court denied on August 21, 2015. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in denying her motion to set aside the verdict and her motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the plaintiffs did not produce the original note at trial, there was insufficient evidence that the note was lost, and the plaintiffs did not have the right to enforce the note; that the court incorrectly instructed the jury regarding SOM's right to enforce the note; that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over SOE because SOE did not have the legal capacity to commence and continue the action; and that the court abused its discretion in denying her motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and in refusing to set aside the verdict because neither plaintiff had a right to enforce the management contract, the alleged breaches did not cause any loss to the plaintiffs, and the jury could not have determined with reasonable certainty the amount of damages required. We consider the claims in a different order for the purpose of clarity, and, in light of our conclusions, it is not necessary to address several of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We begin with our standard of review. \"The proper appellate standard of review when considering the action of a trial court in granting or denying a motion to set aside a verdict is the abuse of discretion standard....

The next question is whether SOE, SOM, or both entities retained the power to enforce the note.

The jury further found that SOE transferred the right to enforce the note to SOM.

As previously stated, the application of \u00a7 42a-3-301, in the circumstances of the present case, leads to the conclusion that SOM is entitled to enforce the note only if it satisfies the standards stated in \u00a7 42a-3-309. Subsection (a) of \u00a7 42a-3-309, in turn, provides that \"[a] person not in possession of an instrument is entitled to enforce the instrument if (i)\n   <em>\n    the person\n   </em>\n   was in possession of the instrument and entitled to enforce it when\n   loss of possession occurred ....\" (Emphasis added.) The only logical construction of the statutory language compels the conclusion that the only person who can enforce the note is the person in possession of the note when it was lost. When the text of a statute is clear, we do not adopt a different meaning or interpretation, unless the clear meaning is absurd, regardless of whether we agree or disagree with underlying policy.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lima\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489663\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/651/#p631\">\n    325 Conn. 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489663\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/651/#p631\">\n    159 A.3d 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   There are, of course, dueling policies.

On the other hand, as the plaintiffs suggest, if it is possible to enforce a note to which the right to enforce the note, but not the physical note, has been assigned, then fairness is promoted because unjust enrichment is prevented. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    National Loan Investors, L.P.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Joymar Associates\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11224804\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/767/549/#p551\">\n    767 So.2d at 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of the clear language of the statute, the plaintiffs' policy arguments cannot prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The plaintiffs also argue that assignability is favored by the common law, and that common law may be used to supplement the UCC. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Wykeham Rise, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Federer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%20448\">\n    305 Conn. 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 471,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20A.3d%20702\">\n    52 A.3d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (\"[a]ssignability of rights is clearly favored with respect to contracts generally\").

Thus, the common law of assignments does not supplement \u00a7 42a-3-309 (a) because the statute is clear and unambiguous and the legislature has not acted otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We now apply \u00a7 42a-3-309 to the facts of this case. In the course of Chodos' testimony at trial, the plaintiffs introduced a copy of the note into evidence, rather than the original. The copy did not show an endorsement from SOE to SOM, nor was it endorsed in blank. The plaintiffs also introduced the assignment, which transferred SOE's entire interest in the note to SOM. There was no evidence presented from which the jury reasonably could infer that the note was lost while in SOM's possession. Chodos never claimed to have delivered the note from SOE to SOM. The jury found, in its answers to interrogatories, that the note was lost while in the possession of SOE, and that SOE then assigned the note to SOM. In denying the defendant's posttrial motions, the court recognized that sequence, and the plaintiffs argue in their appellate brief, not that SOM was a holder of the note in any way but rather that the law allowed assignment of the proceeds of a note without physical transfer of the note. The court, then, erred in denying the motions to set aside the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, because neither SOE nor SOM was entitled to enforce the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We next consider the issues regarding the management contract. The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in denying her motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and in refusing to set aside the verdict in favor of SOE and SOM as to their claims of breach regarding the management contract. The defendant argues that there was no evidence that\n   the breach of the management contract caused any loss, and that neither the breach of the management contract nor the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, if any, resulted in damages that could be fairly ascertained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A preliminary question is whether either SOM or SOE were parties to the management contract. The management contract was signed only by Chodos on the plaintiffs' side; the management contract was expressly incorporated into the purchase agreement, to which SOE was a party. In regard to the purchase agreement, SOM is\n   not listed as a seller either in the opening paragraph or in the list of parties to be noticed in \u00a7 12 of the agreement. SOM appears in the purchase agreement only on the signature page, where Chodos, as the duly authorized president of SOM, signed for SOM, which was SOE's general partner. Because partnerships are entities distinct from their partners; General Statutes \u00a7 34-313 ; SOM's status as general partner did not have the effect of making SOM a party to the purchase agreement. Nor did SOM's purported status as the manager of 516, LLC, bestow party status because a limited liability company's manager has standing to enforce a contract only \"where the object of the proceeding is to enforce a ... manager's right against or liability to the limited liability company or as otherwise provided in an operating agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes (Rev. to 2015) \u00a7 34-134. Similarly, the note, which was part of the overall purchase transaction, was issued to SOE only. SOM does not appear in that document at all. Finally, as we have noted, the management contract, which also was signed at the October 19, 2006 closing, was executed by the defendant and Chodos.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The management contract provided that the defendant could\n   not terminate the management contract \"for any reason while any debt is owed to [SOE].\" SOM was not mentioned at all in the management contract. Thus, at least prior to the assignment from SOE to SOM, SOM did not have the ability to enforce or to pursue damages arising from the management contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We must then consider the effect, if any, of the assignment on the right to enforce the management contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The\n   assignment purported to assign \"any and all claims, rights and title to any and all defaulted loans and damages relating to the sale of 516, LLC\"; but the management contract itself stated that no assignment could be effected \"without the prior written consent of the [m]anager and the [c]o-[m]anager.\" Because the assignment was signed by Chodos alone-as agent for SOM on behalf of SOE-and not by the defendant, the \"manager\" of 516, LLC, the assignment document was ineffective to transfer SOE's rights under the management contract to SOM. Therefore, the assignment did not have the effect of transferring to SOM the ability to enforce the terms of the management contract. Only SOE, then, retained any right to enforce the management contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The defendant's claim that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion to set aside the verdict on this ground is, however, unreviewable. The defendant claimed in her motion to set aside the verdict that there was insufficient evidence to support the claims for damages arising from breach of the management contract, but the motion itself was, in its entirety, a list\n   of issues. The relevant claim, in its entirety, was the following: \"5. There is insufficient evidence to support the verdict on the claim that [the] defendant, Sherri DeVito, breached any agreement not to change the operating agreement\n   <em>\n    and, also, there was insufficient evidence to support any damage claim arising from the breach of contract claim, including lack of standing\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Her corresponding brief to the trial court did not address the claim of insufficient evidence to support damages at all. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court acknowledged that \"[t]he defendant originally listed nine grounds in her motion to set aside the verdict but has only briefed four .... Accordingly, the court addresses those four grounds.\" The defendant did not request the trial court to rule further on the issue. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The trial court's memorandum of decision did not address the defendant's claim because she did not brief the issue. On appeal, the defendant has not challenged the trial court's apparent finding of abandonment, but claims an abuse of discretion for failure to set aside the verdict for insufficient evidence. \"Both our Supreme Court and this court have stated the principle that, when a party abandons a claim\n   or argument before the trial court, that party waives the right to appellate review of such claim because a contrary conclusion would result in an ambush of the trial court.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Martone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Conn.%20App.%20315\">\n    160 Conn.

Therefore, because the defendant abandoned her claim in the trial court that there was insufficient evidence to support the claims of damages regarding the management contract, her claim is unreviewable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We briefly address the award of $1.325 million in damages. Neither party requested that the jury award damages as to the individual counts, and the jury simply\n   awarded undifferentiated damages in the amount of $1.325 million. In such circumstances, \"an appellate court will presume that the jury found every issue in favor of the prevailing party ... and decline further appellate review.... Where there was an error free path available to the jury to reach its verdict, and no special interrogatories were submitted showing which road the jury went down, any judgment rendered on such a verdict\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be affirmed.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bridgeport Police Dept.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20Conn.%20App.%2061\">\n    155 Conn.

In the circumstances of this case, because the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs on more than one count but awarded only a total amount of $1.325 million in damages, we presume that the jury found damages of $1.325 million, whether based on breach of the note or breach of the management contract. Accordingly, the verdict must stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The judgment is reversed as to SOE's claim of breach of contract regarding the note and all of SOM's claims, and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment in favor of the defendant on those claims; the judgment is affirmed as to SOE's claim regarding breach of the management contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Robert DePaolo was also named as a defendant in this action.

See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 34-38l and 34-38o. Section 34-38o (a), however, provides in relevant part that \"[a]ny foreign limited partnership may ... sell and convey real and personal property in this state for its lawful uses and purposes ... without such action constituting transacting business in this state for the purposes of this chapter.\" Under the then current statutory provision, \"[a] limited liability company membership interest is personal property.\" General Statutes (Rev. to 2015) \u00a7 34-169.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The defendant argues, however, that because Chodos, as owner of SOE, which owned 516, LLC, \"did substantial work in preparing the property for development at 516 Round Hill Road, Greenwich, and in obtaining the necessary permits for its eventual development,\" and because Chodos \"also claimed that he retained the right to co-manage\" 516, LLC, for SOE's benefit, SOE transacted business in this state. These arguments, however, do not reflect the distinct statuses of partnerships and partners, corporations and shareholders, limited liability companies and members, and the individuals who own them. The jury found that the plaintiffs had proved they were \"in good standing at the time of the formation of the contracts\" and, thus, apparently found that SOE was not transacting business in this state. The jury's action finds some support in the evidence: the only specific transactions by SOE involved real and personal property transactions, which \u00a7 34-38o exempts from the meaning of transacting business. Additionally, Chodos testified that the sole purpose of SOE was to act as a \"holding company\" of other entities.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    At trial, the court engaged in the following colloquy with the plaintiffs' counsel:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n    \"The Court: [Plaintiffs' counsel], why is [SOE] the plaintiff if it has assigned its interest?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n    \"[The Plaintiffs' Counsel]: Well, initially, when ... this case was started in 2010, they were in existence.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    \"The Court: I see....

The documents reflecting the assignment of rights in the note were admitted into evidence, and the jury was instructed on the alleged assignment of the right to enforce the note to SOM, not any assignment of the note itself. The defendant has not met the burden of proving that the assignment of rights was invalid, or that a reasonable jury could not find that SOM was entitled to enforce the note. Accordingly, the verdict will not be set aside on the ground that the original note was not produced, considering that the plaintiffs submitted sufficient evidence for the jury to reach its specific conclusion that [the] plaintiffs had the right to enforce the note against [the] defendant.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the note was \"lost\" pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 42a-3-309.

Likewise, the jury was never charged with deciding whether the management contract was assigned, as opposed to the note; the issue was not a subject of the jury interrogatories. Finally, although Chodos testified that the assignment was meant to assign \"everything\" to SOM, Chodos' list of \"everything\" included \"the binder issued by the Secretary of State of Delaware, the seal, any books and records that we would have had ....\" Chodos was later asked if the\n    <em>\n     note\n    </em>\n    was intended to be included in the assignment. He replied, \"Everything pursuant to the sale of 516, LLC, was intended to be transferred to the successor entity as we closed the former entity formally.\" The language of the assignment itself is not so broad: the management contract was not necessarily part of a claim, right, or title \"\n    <em>\n     to any and all defaulted loans and damages\n    </em>\n    ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Chodos' answer was in reply to a question about the intent to transfer the note, which the plaintiffs alleged had been assigned. The plaintiffs have never claimed, even on appeal, that the management contract was assigned.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The defendant argues that SOE did not have standing because it had dissolved and wound up its affairs prior to trial. Although Chodos testified that SOE had wound up its affairs, our holding that the management contract was not properly assigned leaves SOE with the two claims of breach regarding the management contract before SOE was terminated.
