Defendant served but two days, received no conduct credits at sentencing, and, on appeal, challenges the statutory scheme in section 4019. She asserts it denies equal protection to those who serve other than a multiple of four days in presentence confinement. We hold section 4019 does not deny equal protection and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">\n<em>Conduct Credit for Presentence Confinement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">Defendant spent two days in custody before sentencing; therefore, the trial court applied Penal Code section 4019 and awarded no conduct credits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bobb </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 88, 97 [254 Cal.Rptr. 707]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 523 [259 Cal.Rptr. 515].)  On appeal, defendant claims the section 4019 formula (six days\u2019 credit for every four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>days served) denies equal protection because it treats presentence detainees who serve other than an exact multiple of four days differently from those who serve an exact multiple of four days. She concludes she is constitutionally entitled to one day of conduct credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Equal protection requires the state to treat similarly situated persons alike, with some exceptions in which the disparate treatment is sufficiently related to the purpose of the statute in question. <em>(People </em>v. <em>King </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 882, 885-886 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 723].) \u201cPrerequisite to a meritorious claim under an equal protection analysis is a showing that the state has imposed a classification which affects two or more similarly situated groups.\u201d <em>(Duffy </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1, 20 [283 Cal.Rptr. 622].)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">While applying Penal Code section 4019 can result in an award of two days\u2019 credit for each four-day period of presentence confinement, the two days are based on one day of credit each for work and good behavior. \u201cSection 4019 awards two distinct kinds of credit. Section 4019, subdivision (b) authorizes one day of credit for each four-day period of confinement if the prisoner has performed assigned labor. Section 4019, subdivision (c) authorizes one day of credit for each four-day period of confinement if the prisoner has satisfactorily complied with the rules and regulations of the institution. The Legislature apparently determined the appropriate ratio for awarding each type of compliant behavior is a reduction of sentence by one day for four days of appropriate behavior.\u201d <em>(King, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at p. 886.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\"><em>King </em>rejected an equal protection attack on Penal Code section 4019. It found the section 4019 formula is rationally related to the Legislature\u2019s purpose. <em>(King, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at p. 886.) Defendant claims the appropriate test for determining whether section 4019 denies equal protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>tion is strict scrutiny, rather than rational relationship, because section 4019 impinges on personal liberty, a fundamental interest. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Caruso </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 13, 17 [207 Cal.Rptr. 221]; but see <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosaia </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 832, 847 [203 Cal.Rptr. 856].) However, we need not apply either test because section 4019 does not provide the prerequisite for an equal protection challenge: it does not discriminate between two or more similarly situated classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Defendant compares those who serve an exact multiple of four days to those who do not, implying they are similarly situated. She then calculates the ratios of conduct credits to time served and asserts Penal Code section 4019 violates equal protection because the ratios are not congruent. However, her method is constitutionally inapt.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Equal protection does not require equality of the ratio of conduct credit to time served. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>DeVore </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1316, 1319 [267 Cal.Rptr. 698], and cited cases.) Penal Code section 4019 therefore validly divides a presentence detainee\u2019s potential confinement into four-day periods. Each full four-day period actually served entitles a detainee to two days of additional credit, one day each for work and good behavior, if earned. Only four-day increments are cognizable under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Under the Penal Code section 4019 scheme, a detainee is <em>not </em>similarly situated to <em>all </em>other presentence detainees, as would be the case if a uniform ratio were required for all detainees. Instead, a detainee is similarly situated only to other detainees who have served the same number of days in presentence confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Defendant received the same treatment under Penal Code section 4019 as any other defendant who serves the same number of days in presentence confinement. No defendant who has served only two days in presentence confinement may receive any additional credit because section 4019 requires four days of custody before any additional days of credit are awarded. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s equal protection argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">II, III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Sims, Acting P.
