App. 730, 736, 924 A.2d 868, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 905, 931 A.2d 264 (2007). Our review of the court\u2019s decision to grant the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is plenary. See <em>Curley </em>v. <em>Kaiser, </em>112 Conn. App. 213, 220, 962 A.2d 167 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">After having examined the record and the briefs and having considered the arguments of the parties, we are persuaded that the summary judgment rendered in favor of the defendants should be affirmed. See <em>Hotshoe Enterprises, LLC </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>284 Conn. 833, 837, 937 A.2d 689 (2008). The court\u2019s thoughtful, well-reasoned decision fully addresses the claim raised on appeal, and we therefore adopt it as a statement of the facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the applicable law. See <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Farmer, </em>51 Conn. Sup. 361, 984 A.2d 807 (2008). No useful purpose would be served by repeating the discussion contained therein. <em>Sansone </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>62 Conn. App. 526, 528, 771 A.2d 243 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\">A default for failure to appear was entered against the defendant Kristy Tryjada. Tryjada is not a party to this appeal. In this opinion, we therefore refer to Farmer and Lucas as the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b380-9\"> The plaintiff alleged that the charges against him were dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
