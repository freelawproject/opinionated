The defendant claims that she was prejudiced by the court\u2019s financial orders in that the court improperly distributed the property of the parties. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">The record discloses the following pertinent facts and procedural history. In a memorandum of decision filed December 7, 2007, the court rendered judgment dissolving the parties\u2019 twenty year marriage and entered orders regarding the division of the parties\u2019 real and personal property, time limited periodic alimony for the defendant, and the custody, care and maintenance of the parties\u2019 two minor children. A third child, no longer a minor, attends college. In fashioning its orders, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>court found, inter alia, that both parties were practicing physicians and that both worked limited hours. The court further found that the parties together had purchased their marital home in Guilford as a \u201cshell\u201d and that the plaintiff alone had performed many hours of work on the home and landscaping. The parties stipulated that the value of the home was $552,000 and that the equity was $374,500. The parties also owned a seasonal home on Money Island, part of the Thimble Islands in Long Island Sound near Branford, which had a stipulated value of $450,000, and a timeshare in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, with a stipulated value of $15,000. The plaintiff had inherited from family members two pieces of real estate in Michigan, as well as money, and the defendant had inherited money from her mother. In addition, the court found that the defendant had funds in an \u201c \u2018irrevocable trust,\u2019 \u201d which she established using funds originally received from her father prior to the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) failed to award her \u201ccompensating assets\u201d to offset its award to the plaintiff of the marital home and the summer home, (2) failed to consider adequately her noneconomic contributions to the marriage and to the acquisition of the marital home and (3) failed to classify her irrevocable trust as an inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The defendant\u2019s claims implicate two standards of review. To the extent that the defendant challenges the court\u2019s factual findings, our function is to determine whether the court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Redler, </em>117 Conn. App. 403, 406, 979 A.2d 558 (2009). Additionally, to the extent that the defendant claims that the court\u2019s orders flowing from its findings were improper, we review those orders to determine whether the court abused its discretion. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">On the basis of our review of the record, we find no support for the defendant\u2019s claim that the court\u2019s factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>findings were erroneous. In each instance, the record reveals an evidentiary basis from which the court could have correctly made its factual determinations. Similarly, the court\u2019s comprehensive and well reasoned memorandum of decision reflects that the court properly and adequately considered all relevant criteria in fashioning its orders. We conclude that the court\u2019s orders did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claims must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
