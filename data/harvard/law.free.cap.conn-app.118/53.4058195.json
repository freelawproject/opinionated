Greenalch, Jr., </em>special deputy assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>Matthew C.

On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court (1) abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal and (2) improperly failed to conclude that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Following our review of the record and briefs, and after considering the oral arguments of the parties, we conclude that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the court abused its discretion in denying his petition because he has not shown that the issues involved in his appeal are debatable among jurists of reason, that a court could resolve them in a different manner or that the questions raised are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. See <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 431-32, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991); <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 616, 646 A.2d 126 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
