Beaulieu, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of two counts of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1) and two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2). On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the testimony of two late disclosed witnesses and (2) his conviction under both \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1) and (2) violated his protection against double jeopardy. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">The juiy reasonably could have found the following relevant facts. The first encounter between the victim<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the defendant occurred some time after February, 2007, when the minor victim<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> began skipping school to spend time at Hamilton Park in Waterbury. The victim would sit on a rock and wait for men to approach him and to ask him to engage in sexual acts in exchange for money. One day while the victim was sitting on the rock, the defendant drove into the park and waved the victim over to his car. The victim approached the defendant\u2019s car, and the defendant asked if the victim wanted to go into the nearby wooded area with him. The two walked into the wooded area, and the defendant then positioned the victim against a tree and pulled down both his and the victim\u2019s pants. The defendant noticed someone looking at them and moved himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>and the victim to the other side of the tree for privacy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant then performed fellatio on the victim. After about ten minutes, the defendant pulled up his pants and led the victim out of the wooded area. The defendant asked the victim to wait at the edge of the wooded area, got in his car and left the park. The victim then left the wooded area. Ronald A. Bridschge observed the defendant and the victim leaving the wooded area.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">At a later date, also between February and May, 2007, the victim and the defendant had a second encounter. The victim again skipped school to go to Hamilton Park. As the victim was approaching Hamilton Park by foot, the defendant drove up to him and asked him to get into the backseat of his car, then drove to Hamilton Park. Once at the park, the defendant stopped his car, got out and opened the door to the backseat. The defendant then pulled down both his and the victim\u2019s pants and began performing fellatio on the victim. Another car interrupted the defendant, who, after motioning for the car to pass, parked the car and again led the victim into the wooded area. Once in the wooded area, the defendant performed fellatio on the victim. After ten minutes, the defendant led the victim out of the wooded area and gave him a ride back to the entrance to the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Some time in May, 2007, the victim\u2019s father found the victim with two older men outside the Waterbury public library and took him to the police department. The victim returned to the Waterbury police department a few days later and told investigators all the relevant details pertaining to his two sexual encounters with the defendant. The defendant subsequently was charged with two counts of sexual assault in the second degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1) and two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2). Following a jury trial, the defendant was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to a total effective term of eighteen years, suspended after ten years, with fifteen years probation. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">The defendant first claims that the court abused its discretion in allowing Bridschge and Walter Rodgers to testily. Specifically, the defendant maintains that the witnesses should not have been allowed to testify, first, because the state failed to question the victim about the existence of witnesses in its initial interviews with the victim in May, 2007, and second, because the state breached its duty to disclose the victim\u2019s February 14, 2008, statement that revealed the existence of witnesses. Additionally, the defendant argues that the court abused its discretion in allowing the witnesses to testify over defense objection. The first two claims were not preserved at trial and are not reviewable on appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ankerman, </em>81 Conn. App. 503, 508, 840 A.2d 1182, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 901, 853 A.2d 520, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 944, 125 S. Ct. 372, 160 L. Ed. 2d 256 (2004). We disagree with the defendant\u2019s third claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">The following facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claims. On February 14, 2008, the victim gave an oral statement to investigators that the person who had seen the defendant and the victim engage in a sexual act in the wooded area had a \u201cgoldish brown\u201d car and that the person who had seen him emerge from the wooded area drove a green or gold colored van. The victim also gave physical descriptions of the two witnesses. Acting on this information, investigators began looking for the two individuals. On March 7, 2008, the man whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>victim had seen when he emerged from the wooded area was identified by investigators as Bridschge. On March 10, 2008, investigators first talked to Bridschge, and, the following day, Bridschge told investigators that the other eyewitness was Rodgers.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The state provided the defendant with a list of potential witnesses on February 25, 2008. The state made several revisions to the initial list and, on March 10, 2008, Bridschge\u2019s name first appeared as a potential witness. The following day, on March 11, 2008, the state sent another revised list that included the names of both Bridschge and Rodgers. The trial began one week later on March 17, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">With regard to the defendant\u2019s first two claims, he asserts for the first time on appeal that the state failed to question the victim about the existence of witnesses during its initial interviews with the victim in May, 2007, and that the state breached its duty to disclose the victim\u2019s February 14, 2008, statement that revealed the existence of witnesses. Although the defendant objected to the court\u2019s permitting Bridschge and Rodgers to testify, he did not do so on the grounds that the state improperly questioned the victim or breached its duty to disclose the victim\u2019s statement about the witnesses. The defendant therefore seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The defendant did not, however, engage in a <em>Golding </em>analysis in his appellate brief. \u201c[Defendants who seek consideration of unpreserved constitutional claims [on appeal] . . . bear the burden of establishing their entitlement to such review under the guidelines enumerated in <em>Golding </em>. . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Waz, </em>240 Conn. 365, 371 n.11, 692 A.2d 1217 (1997). In his brief, the defendant makes only passing references to <em>Golding </em>and has provided us with no analysis of its four prongs. In the absence of adequate briefing of the issues, we will not address these two arguments raised by the defendant that were not properly preserved in the trial court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ankerman, </em>supra, 81 Conn. App. 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The defendant\u2019s third claim, which is that the court abused its discretion in allowing the witnesses to testify over his objection, was preserved by his motion to preclude certain evidence and motion in limine. On March 17, 2008, the defendant filed a motion to preclude the state from calling Bridschge or Rodgers, asserting that it was \u201cunbelievable\u201d that the state could locate an eyewitness days prior to the presentation of evidence at trial. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion but offered the defendant additional time to interview the newly discovered witnesses. The defendant also filed a motion in limine to bar the testimony of Bridschge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>on the ground that it was unreliable, and a motion to suppress the identification of the defendant by both Bridschge and Rodgers. The court denied both of the defendant\u2019s motions. The court again, however, offered the defendant additional time for the purposes of further investigation in light of the testimony. Defense counsel declined, stating, \u201cI appreciate the offer, Your Honor, but just as a matter of strategy, I\u2019d rather keep going on with the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">To prevail on his claim, the defendant must demonstrate that the court abused its discretion in refusing to impose the requested sanctions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 311-12, 677 A.2d 917 (1996). \u201cIn general, abuse of discretion exists when a court could have chosen different alternatives but has decided the matter so arbitrarily as to vitiate logic, or has decided it based on improper or irrelevant factors. . . . Therefore, [i]n those cases in which an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done, reversal is required.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>271 Conn. 338, 416, 857 A.2d 808 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 845, 126 S. Ct. 94, 163 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u201cPractice Book \u00a7 40-5<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> gives broad discretion to the trial judge to grant an appropriate remedy for failure to comply with discovery requirements. Generally, [t]he primary purpose of a sanction for violation of a discovery order is to ensure that the defendant\u2019s rights are protected, not to exact punishment on the state for its allegedly improper conduct. As we have indicated, the formulation of an appropriate sanction is a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson F., </em>77 Conn. App. 405, 417, 823 A.2d 406, cert. denied, 265 Conn. 905, 831 A.2d 254 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u201cSuppression of relevant, material and otherwise admissible evidence is a severe sanction which should not be invoked lightly.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>181 Conn. 254, 265, 435 A.2d 38 (1980). Here, although the court, in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to preclude, accepted the state\u2019s explanation that the witnesses were discovered during an ongoing investigation, it nonetheless offered the defendant time for further investigation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court made a similar offer after denying the defendant\u2019s motion in limine. The remedy offered, although not that which the defendant requested, is one enumerated in Practice Book \u00a7 40-5 as appropriate for a failure to comply with disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Furthermore, the defendant cannot claim error on appeal because his trial strategy failed. The defendant elected not to accept the court\u2019s offer of additional time to investigate the two witnesses. The defendant, therefore, has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cOur appellate courts frequently have stated that a party may not pursue one course of action at trial for tactical reasons and later on appeal argue that the path he rejected should now be open to him.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>76 Conn. App. 653, 662, 820 A.2d 1122 (2003). The court did not abuse its discretion in awarding this remedy and allowing the witnesses to testify over the defendant\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that his conviction under both \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1) and (2) for a single course of conduct, stemming from his first encounter with the victim, violated his protection against double jeopardy. The defendant initially was charged with two counts of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) and two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When the state filed its long form information, it added a count of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (l).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant was found guilty on all counts. The defendant now argues that he was punished twice, under both \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1) and (2), for a single course of conduct that arose out of his initial interaction with the victim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The defendant did not preserve his claim at trial and now seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. Such review is warranted. \u201cA defendant may obtain review of a double jeopardy claim, even if it is unpreserved, if he has received two punishments for two crimes, which he claims were one crime, arising from the same transaction and prosecuted at one trial .... Because the claim presents an issue of law, our review is plenary \u201c (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crudup, </em>81 Conn. App. 248, 252, 838 A.2d 1053, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 913, 845 A.2d 415 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u201cIn determining whether a defendant has been placed in double jeopardy under the multiple punishments prong, we apply a two step process. First, the charges must arise out of the same act or transaction. Second, it must be determined whether the charged crimes are the same offense. Multiple punishments are forbidden only if both conditions are met.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Alvaro F., </em>291 Conn. 1, 6, 966 A.2d 712, cert. denied, 558 U.S. 882 130 S. Ct. 200, 175 L. Ed. 2d 140 (2009). \u201cOn appeal, the defendant bears the burden of proving that the prosecutions are for the same offense in law and fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>260 Conn. 339, 361, 796 A.2d 1118 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">With regard to the first step of the double jeopardy analysis, the defendant contends that his waving the victim over from the rock on which he was sitting to his car, asking the victim to go into the wooded area, walking with the victim into the wooded area, performing fellatio on the victim and finally exiting the wooded area with the victim constitutes one act or transaction for the purposes of the double jeopardy analysis. \u201cFor the first prong of the analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim, it is necessary to review the information and the bill of particulars.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vazquez, </em>66 Conn. App. 118, 124, 783 A.2d 1183, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 941, 786 A.2d 428 (2001). The long form information, however, does not specify the precise dates or times when the conduct occurred, nor does it detail which events underlie each risk of injury charge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">When, as here, the bill of particulars and information fail to provide the specific dates and times of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>charged acts, we must look to the evidence presented at trial to determine whether each count arose from a separate act. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>260 Conn. 93, 122-24, 794 A.2d 506, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 902, 123 S. Ct. 224, 154 L. Ed. 2d 175 (2002); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard F., </em>86 Conn. App. 702, 710-11, 862 A.2d 331 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 924, 871 A.2d 1032 (2005). The jury reasonably could have found that during the first encounter, the defendant drove to the park and, while in his car, waved the victim over to him, asked the victim if he wanted to go into the wooded area, walked into the wooded area with the victim <em>and then </em>performed the sexual act on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Though it relates to kidnapping, not risk of injuiy to a minor, both parties rely on our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>287 Conn. 509, 949 A.2d 1092 (2008).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In support of his argument, the defendant maintains that the events leading to the sexual act were minimal, incidental to and necessary for the sexual act to occur and not a separate act or transaction. The state contends that the act of enticing a victim into the wooded area to engage in a sexual act is not incidental to and necessary for the commission of unlawful sexual contact with a minor. <em>Salamon </em>holds that \u201cthe test . . . to determine whether [the] confinements or movements involved [were] such that kidnapping may also be charged and prosecuted when an offense separate from kidnapping has occurred asks whether the confinement, movement, or detention was merely incidental to the accompanying felony or <em>whether it was significant </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>enough, in and of itself, to warrant independent prosecution.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 547. Although <em>Salamon </em>concerns kidnapping, we do not dispute the parties\u2019 shared assumption that the analysis utilized in <em>Salamon </em>provides some assistance in evaluating whether the conduct at issue in this case constitutes separate acts for double jeopardy purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">This court has held previously that a defendant could be found guilty under \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1) for attempting to lure a minor into a situation for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts with him, even if the defendant was not successful in doing so. <em>State </em>v. <em>Eastwood, </em>83 Conn. App. 452, 850 A.2d 234 (2004), cert. denied, 286 Conn. 914, 914 A.2d 945 (2008). \u201cThe fact that the defendant did not <em>actually </em>impair the boys\u2019 morals is of no consequence. . . . What the statute precludes is the creation of a <em>situation </em>that is <em>likely </em>to impair the morals of a victim younger than sixteen years of age.\u201d Id., 476. The fact that here the defendant was successful in enticing the victim into the wooded area so that he could then make \u201ccontact with the intimate parts ... of a child\u201d in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2) does not belie the fact that his luring the victim over to his car was sufficient for independent prosecution under \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1) for placing a child younger than sixteen \u201cin such a situation that . . . the health of such child is likely to be injured or the morals of such child are likely to be impaired . . . .\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Snook, </em>210 Conn. 244, 261-62, 555 A.2d 390 (analogizing violations of \u00a7 53-21 to forcible sexual intercourse, where it has been held that \u201ceach separate act . . . constitutes a separate crime\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 924, 109 S. Ct. 3258, 106 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">As <em>Salamon </em>and its progeny make clear in the context of our kidnapping statutes, for an act not to warrant independent prosecution it must be \u201cmerely incidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>to and necessary for\u201d the underlying crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 542. The defendant\u2019s enticing the victim into a situation for the purpose of engaging in a sexual act was not \u201cmerely incidental and necessary to\u201d his performing fellatio on the victim; it was sufficient for independent prosecution under \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1). A different view would allow a person, who has placed a child younger than sixteen in a situation in which his morals are likely to be impaired, to touch that child\u2019s intimate parts without fear of prosecution for having created the opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The defendant\u2019s actions in luring the victim into the wooded area can be considered a separate act or transaction from the commission of the sexual act itself. As this case is decided on the first prong of the double jeopardy inquiry, there is no need to address the second prong.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-8\"> In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of sexual abuse and the crime of risk of ipjury to a child, we decline to identify the victim or others through whom the victim\u2019s identity may be ascertained.
