Reeves, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a trial to the court, of unlawful restraint in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 SSa-95<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant also was charged, in a part B information, with being a persistent offender of assault under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40d. After the trial court\u2019s finding of guilty, as to the substantive offenses, the defendant pleaded guilty to the charge of being a persistent offender. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court (1) improperly admitted impermissible hearsay statements in violation of \u00a7 8-2 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) violated his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>to present a defense by precluding him from presenting testimony from his alibi witnesses at trial. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In its oral decision, the court cited the testimony of four witnesses for the state and one for the defendant. The court discussed its decision, concluding, after deliberation, that the elements of the offenses were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, noting especially that the testimony of the victim, Kimberly Gillette, was credible. Gillette testified that during an altercation with the defendant on February 25, 2007, he pushed her to the ground, got on top of her and used his hands to choke her. As a result of the defendant\u2019s choking her, Gillette felt pain in her neck. She testified that she could not breathe, felt dizzy and was scared that she would die. Eventually, she managed to flee from the defendant and called the Hartford police department. The police directed Gillette to go to the Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center emergency room, where she was seen by medical personnel. A staff nurse at the hospital, Harvey A. Ginsberg, testified that Gillette had scratches or some red marks on her neck. He also testified that Gillette\u2019s injuries were consistent with her having been choked.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly allowed the state to introduce certain testimony in violation of \u00a7 8-2 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant claims that he was not allowed to object to improperly admitted hearsay statements, namely, the testimony of Gillette regarding statements that the defendant\u2019s sister made to Gillette. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claims. Gillette testified that on the night of the assault, she had received a telephone call from the defendant asking her to pick him up at his sister\u2019s home in New Britain. When she arrived there, at approximately 11 p.m., the defendant asked her to drive him to his brother\u2019s home at 61 Evergreen Avenue in Hartford. She did not want to take him there but, rather, wanted him to come to her home in Massachusetts. The state then questioned Gillette about the defendant\u2019s drug use, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: You were in a relationship with [the defendant] for two years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">\u201c[The Witness]: Over two years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Over two years. And during that time did you know that he had a drug problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And how did you become aware of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-11\">\u201c[The Witness]: His sister told me. I\u2019ve seen him use drugs. I\u2019ve seen him go to the drug house to purchase drugs. I\u2019ve picked him up from the drug house. I\u2019ve never been inside, but I\u2019ve been outside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor, hearsay. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-13\">\u201cThe Court: Now, what is your objection? Is hearsay as to the last one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-14\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: The witness is testifying as to what the sister said to her, Your Honor, an out-of-court statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-15\">\u201cThe Corut: Well, that was already asked and answered and we\u2019re past that, so the question outstanding referred to an answer concerning the drug house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes, Your Honor, which information was, which the witness is testifying to, was told to her by the sister of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, but you didn\u2019t object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">\u201cThe Court: Objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Thank you, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Gillette then testified, without objection, as to facts regarding the defendant\u2019s drug use, stating that she personally had seen the defendant use crack cocaine and had previously taken him to 61 Evergreen Avenue where, he told her, he had bought and used drugs. She did not want to take him there because he would get high. She testified that \u201c[t]hat\u2019s the only thing he did there.\u201d Gillette then testified that if the defendant went inside to get high, she would not take him to her home because when he got high, he was paranoid, delusional and scaiy. On cross-examination by defense counsel, Gillette testified that 61 Evergreen Avenue is a known drug house where the defendant resided off and on when using drugs. Gillette continued to see the defendant after February 25, 2007, the night on which the crimes occurred, \u201c[t]o try and get him to come back and get clean from drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">There was only one objection by the defendant concerning Gillette\u2019s entire statement. The defendant claims that Gillette\u2019s first statement, \u201chis sister told me,\u201d is inadmissible hearsay. The defendant also claims that Gillette\u2019s subsequent statements regarding the \u201cdrug house\u201d are potentially hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">The defendant first claims that the court abused its discretion by allowing Gillette\u2019s hearsay statement, \u201chis sister told me,\u201d into evidence because his objection was untimely. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>We first set forth our standard of review of the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s objection to inadmissible hearsay on the basis of an untimely objection. \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit [or exclude] evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law . . . for an abuse of discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . The trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy [and admissibility] of evidence .... In order to establish reversible error on an evi-dentiary impropriety . . . the defendant must prove both an abuse of discretion and a harm that resulted from such abuse. \u201c (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cecil J., </em>291 Conn. 813, 818-19, 970 A.2d 710 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">\u201cThe generally accepted rule as to when [an] objection to a question must be interposed has been stated to be: \u2018For evidence contained in a specific question, the objection must ordinarily be made as soon as the question is stated, and before the answer is given; unless the inadmissibility was due, not to the subject of the question, but to some feature of the answer.\u2019 1 Wigmore, Evidence (2d Ed.) 175, \u00a7 18, a, (1). This rule, however, is to be reasonably applied. Thus in an opinion quoted by Wigmore in this connection, the court, in referring to a rule of court of similar import, said: \u2018It must have a reasonable interpretation. The object is to prevent a party from knowingly withholding his objection, until he discovers the effect of the testimony, and then if it turns out to be unfavorable to interpose his objection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hackenson </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>124 Conn. 679, 683, 2 A.2d 215 (1938); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>McClelland, </em>113 Conn. App. 142, 156, 965 A.2d 586 (\u201c[i]n general, objections to the answer to a question should be made before the next question\u201d), cert. denied, 291 Conn. 912, 969 A.2d 176 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Therefore, to evaluate the defendant\u2019s claim, we first need to assess whether the question asked of Gillette was one that would likely elicit an answer involving hearsay, and, if not, we need to assess the speed with which the objection should have been made if it became apparent that the answer contained hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">On the basis of the prior testimony regarding the long-term relationship between Gillette and the defendant, the question as to how she became aware of the defendant\u2019s drug problem likely would not involve statements of others but would involve her own knowledge. Thus, the question itself would not reasonably be expected to elicit an answer that would contain hearsay. The defendant, therefore, need not have objected as soon as the question was asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The defendant objected prior to the next question, but his objection was untimely because he waited until Gillette\u2019s entire answer was forthcoming before objecting.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A party may not wait to discover the effect of the answer and then object. <em>Hackenson </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 124 Conn. 683. We, therefore, find no abuse of discretion for the court not to strike the answer or to overrule the defendant\u2019s objection. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>75 Conn. App. 364, 373-74, 815 A.2d 1261 (2003), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 272 Conn. 515, 864 A.2d 847 (2005). Even if improperly left to stand, Gillette\u2019s answer that the defendant\u2019s sister told her about the defendant\u2019s drug abuse was cumulative of other validly admitted testimony from Gillette. Consequently, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>impropriety in the admission of the sister\u2019s knowledge of the defendant\u2019s drug use was harmless error and does not require reversal of the judgment of conviction. <em>State </em>v. Gonzalez, 272 Conn. 515, 528-29, 864 A.2d 847 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The defendant next claims that Gillette\u2019s other statements in her answer to how she became aware of his drug problem that referred to the \u201cdrug house,\u201d are potentially hearsay. Specifically, the defendant argues that \u201c[w]ith regard to the defendant\u2019s objection that the nature of the drug house was information obtained from the defendant\u2019s sister, the trial court completely ignored his objection. As a result, the trial court improperly admitted the potential hearsay regarding the drug house.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">\u201cTo the extent [that] a trial court\u2019s admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the Code of Evidence, our standard of review is plenary. For example, whether a challenged statement properly may be classified as hearsay and whether a hearsay exception properly is identified are legal questions demanding plenary review. . . . We review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law, however, for an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 218, 926 A.2d 633 (2007). Accordingly, in the present case, our standard of review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">\u201cHearsay means a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the proceeding, offered in evidence to establish the truth of the matter asserted. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-1 (3). Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless an exception in the Code of Evidence, the General Statutes or the rules of practice applies. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-2.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>293 Conn. 327, 334, 977 A.2d 199 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Nothing in Gillette\u2019s statements indicates that her knowledge that 61 Evergreen Avenue was a known \u201cdrug house\u201d was obtained from anyone else or that it was not made from her own observations. The prosecutor did not continue to question Gillette to determine whether her statements about the \u201cdrug house\u201d were hearsay. Nor did defense counsel cross-examine Gillette as to whether she relied on statements of others for her testimony. Furthermore, Gillette\u2019s statements, on their face, do not indicate that she relied on statements made by the defendant\u2019s sister or others. We conclude that the court properly admitted Gillette\u2019s statements regarding the \u201cdrug house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The defendant also claims that the court violated his right to present a defense by refusing to permit his alibi witnesses to testily. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Because the defendant did not preserve his claim at trial, he requests review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. \u201cUnder <em>Golding, </em>a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>289 Conn. 496, 502-503, 958 A.2d 731 (2008). The first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>involve a determination of whether the claim is reviewable, and the second two involve a determination of whether the defendant may prevail. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>260 Conn. 610, 621, 799 A.2d 1034 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">In this case, there is an adequate record and a claim of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s right to present his own witnesses to establish a defense ... is a fundamental element of due process of law. . . . This includes the right to present alibi witnesses. . . . The sixth amendment right to compulsory process includes the right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, [and] is in plain terms the right to present a defense, the right to present the defendant\u2019s version of the facts as well as the prosecution\u2019s to the jury so that it may decide where the truth lies.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Salters, </em>89 Conn. App. 221, 226, 872 A.2d 933, cert. denied, 274 Conn. 914, 879 A.2d 893 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">However, \u201c[a] court\u2019s preclusion of alibi evidence as a sanction for failure to comply with the rules of discovery does not violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights per se. If the court\u2019s preclusion of alibi evidence reflects a sound exercise of discretion, the defendant cannot claim that a constitutional violation exists.\u201d Id., 227; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>242 Conn. 318, 330-31, 669 A.2d 911 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>199 Conn. 207, 213-14, 506 A.2d 125 (1986). Thus, although the first two <em>Golding </em>conditions are met, we must next consider whether a constitutional violation clearly exists and whether the defendant was clearly deprived of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">The defendant\u2019s claim fails under the third <em>Golding </em>prong because a constitutional violation does not clearly exist, and the defendant was not clearly deprived of a fair trial. The record is completely devoid of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>evidence that the court refused to permit the defendant\u2019s alibi witnesses to testify.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On April 10, 2008, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>defendant indicated to the court that a witness would be available to testify that day.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the witness did not appear to testify, the court inquired how the defendant wanted to proceed, and the defendant responded by voluntarily resting his case. The defendant did not request a continuance to allow any alibi witnesses to testify.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, there is no evidence that the court precluded any alibi witnesses of the defendant from testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>fying. Accordingly, the defendant has not shown that a constitutional right clearly exists and was clearly violated, and his claim therefore fails under the third prong of Golding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of unlawful restraint in the first degree when he restrains another person under circumstances which expose such other person to a substantial risk of physical injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b724-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the third degree when: (1) With intent to cause physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b724-8\"> Interspersed in the defendant\u2019s appellate brief, discussing the first issue, are claims of judicial bias. The claims are inadequately briefed, and we decline to address them. \u201cWe are not obligated to consider issues that are not adequately briefed. . . . Whejn] an issue is merely mentioned, but not briefed beyond a bare assertion of the claim, it is deemed to have been waived. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>418 Meadow Street Associates, LLC </em>v. <em>One Solution Services, LLC, </em>117 Conn. App. 651, 655, 980 A.2d 345 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">We also note that the claim of bias is patently unfounded. The defendant makes the blanket assertions that bias was shown because evidentiary rulings against him were based on a standard different from similar eviden-tiary rulings in favor of the state and that defense counsel was admonished with respect to minor procedural matters, such as the need to stand when making an objection. An adverse ruling by a court does not automatically imply bias or prejudice. If bias were to be implied because of an adverse ruling or because of the insistence of a court that formalities be observed in a courtroom, the conclusion that bias was shown would be inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">A court\u2019s ruling adverse to a party may occur because it was the correct ruling as a matter of law or because of the ineptitude of the party claiming bias. The defendant did not file a motion for recusal, disqualification or mistrial. The unpreserved claims of judicial bias do not qualify as plain error, and the conduct questioned does not reasonably give an appearance of impropriety. The claims are nothing more than an assertion that adverse rulings constitute evidence of bias. Such a claim does not demonstrate bias. See <em>Peatie </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>112 Conn. App. 8, 26, 961 A.2d 1016 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b725-9\"> Section 8-2 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides: \u201cHearsay is inadmissible, except as provided in the Code, the General Statutes or the Practice Book.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\"> It is clear from the record that the court believed that the defendant\u2019s objection was untimely because it was under the impression that another question had been asked of Gillette after her statement, \u201chis sister told me.\u201d If defense counsel knew that only one question had been asked of Gillette at the time of his objection, he should have clarified this fact to the court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>112 Conn. App. 694, 710, 963 A.2d 1099 (if defense counsel believed court\u2019s ruling was unclear, it was defense counsel\u2019s obligation to seek further clarification), cert. denied, 291 Conn. 914, 969 A.2d 175 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b733-6\"> To the contrary, the record discloses that the court was willing to allow the defendant\u2019s alibi witnesses to testify. Specifically the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. Now [defense counsel], what is your situation concerning your witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I do have one witness here today, Your Honor, and I have two witnesses who are not here today and are absolutely to be here Monday and maybe tomorrow.

Now, is there any objection to taking the defense witness that [defense counsel] is going to have out of order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-16\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: No, Your Honor. However, [defense counsel] just advised me today about a witness that is going to testify as to alibi defense 1hat was not previously disclosed as an alibi witness, Your Honor, to the state. The state has complied with discovery, as far as the witnesses that the state is going to call, and the state believes that, at this point, to call an alibi witness at this date and time as the trial is starting is prejudicial to the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-17\">\u201cThe Court: [Defense counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-18\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, the defense was only notified before trial on April 2; it is now April 9. We do have three witnesses as to an alibi defense and as this \u2014 right, there are three. And at the earliest opportunity that I could notify the state about this, I did, Your Honor, and unfortunately, it was this morning. And again, those are the witnesses which are scheduled for tomorrow or Monday at the latest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-19\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, and [Cynthia] Rankins, it was on the list for the defense with her date of birth. She was noted as an alibi defense witness, but she was on the list. So, that just leaves two witnesses, which also, are to testily as to alibi defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-20\">\u201cThe Court: All right. [Prosecutor], did you make a written demand for an alibi defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-21\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: I did not, Your Honor. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-22\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. Well, this certainly is late in the game to be bringing an alibi witness. However, Practice Book \u00a7 40-21 does say upon written demand filed by the prosecutor concerning alibi defense. In order to get the time period set forth the prosecutor has to file a written notice \u2014 a written demand of alibi defense, and if that wasn\u2019t filed, I think that sort of makes it difficult for you, [the prosecutor], because the Practice Book clearly says upon written demand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-23\">\u201cAll right. However, what I will do is, if this alibi defense is going to require investigation, you may ask for a continuance to perform investigation. I\u2019ll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>also order that the defense immediately disclose the names and addresses of the witnesses that he intends to use to establish an alibi.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\"> The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I indicated yesterday, Your Honor, I have two or three witnesses that can come in on Monday at the earliest, and I don\u2019t have any witnesses for today, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-10\">\u201cThe Court: I thought they were coming today. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And I was intending to have one witness today, and then I would need a continuance for the other two witnesses actually.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-12\">\u201cThe Court: Where\u2019s the one witness. Well, then you can proceed with the one witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: [T]he witness is not here ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-14\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Your Honor, the state was under the impression as well that there was, at least, to be one witness today. I think, in light of the fact that the defendant has failed to appear here after having been called by defense counsel, it would appear as though he has no intention of returning to court and has failed to cooperate in his defense, Your Honor. So, the state will leave the matter to the court\u2019s discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-15\">\u201cThe Court: All right. What I\u2019m going to do is, I\u2019m going to recess until two o\u2019clock. I expect you to have at least one witness here at two o\u2019clock.

All right, then, I\u2019ll note that the defense has rested. [Prosecutor], do you have any rebuttal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-22\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: At this time, no, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-23\">\u201cThe Court: All right.

Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court may reverse or modify the decision of the trial court if it determines that the factual findings are clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record, or that the decision is otherwise erroneous in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">. . . The court may in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court.\u201d \u201cThe plain error doctrine is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that tliis court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, for reasons of policy. . . . In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">. . . Plain error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly. . . .
