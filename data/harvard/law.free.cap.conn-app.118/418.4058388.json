On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) there is insufficient evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>to support her conviction of manslaughter in the first degree, (2) the court\u2019s allegedly improper jury instructions violated her due process rights and (3) the court improperly denied her motion to suppress. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant and the victim, Daayon Devane, were involved in a romantic relationship for six or seven months. Throughout their relationship, the defendant and the victim engaged in several arguments that escalated into physical altercations. Not once did the defendant call the police for assistance when such altercations arose. Instead, according to the defendant, on some occasions, she brandished a knife to quell such altercations, and, in each instance, the victim left her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">On the morning of February 22, 2005, the defendant, sensing the possibility of another altercation with the victim, walked to the police station across from her apartment to obtain assistance. At the defendant\u2019s request, the police removed the victim from her apartment. Later that evening, the defendant and a friend drove to a pool hall where they saw the victim. There, the victim informed the defendant that he had been kicked out of his mother\u2019s house and, promising to be on his best behavior, asked to return to her apartment. The defendant acquiesced and together they left the pool hall in the early morning of February 23, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Upon returning to the defendant\u2019s apartment, the victim became enraged with the defendant for speaking with \u201cmad dudes\u201d at the pool hall. The victim grabbed the defendant\u2019s arm, hit her and pushed her. The defendant then entered the kitchen and brandished a steak knife, instructing the victim to \u201cchill.\u201d As the altercation escalated, the victim followed the defendant into the kitchen, and she stabbed him in the neck with the steak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>knife. After being stabbed, the victim exclaimed, \u201cyo, babe, look what you\u2019ve done,\u201d exited the defendant\u2019s apartment, ascended the stairs to the second floor of the apartment complex, collapsed and eventually died from blood loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">When police officers arrived at the second floor landing of the defendant\u2019s apartment complex, they found the defendant cradling the victim. The defendant made several statements in the presence of the police officers. Officer David Payne and Detective Michael Fiumidinisi heard the defendant address the victim: \u201cWake up, wake up; I didn\u2019t mean to do it.\u201d Payne then asked the defendant about the identity of the victim, to which she responded: \u201cHe\u2019s my boyfriend; he came at me.\u201d The defendant told Fiumidinisi: \u201cMike, I can\u2019t wake [the victim] up.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fiumidinisi told the defendant to stop cradling the victim to allow medical personnel to assist him. As medical personnel began to assist the victim, Fiumidinisi also asked the defendant about the identity of the victim, to which she responded: \u201c[He] was my boyfriend, and I stabbed him.\u201d Next, Fiumidinisi told the defendant that she was under arrest and placed her inside of a police car. While the defendant was alone in the police car, an officer standing nearby heard the defendant proclaim repeatedly: \u201cHe was beating me. I told him to get away from me. Then he fell on the knife. I didn\u2019t mean to stab him.\u201d From there, the defendant was transported to the police station, where she was advised of her <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights before providing a written statement in which she claimed that the victim had run into the knife. Thereafter, a jury trial followed, at the conclusion of which the jury found the defendant guilty of manslaughter in the first degree, and the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>rendered judgment accordingly. From that judgment, the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to support her conviction of manslaughter in the first degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). Specifically, the defendant maintains that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she created a grave risk of death and that she evinced an extreme indifference to human life. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">We review the defendant\u2019s claim, which she preserved through her motions for a judgment of acquittal; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Padua, </em>273 Conn. 138, 146 n.12, 869 A.2d 192 (2005) (motion for judgment of acquittal on specific charge preserves charge for appeal); initially by setting forth our standard of review. \u201cWhen reviewing sufficiency of the evidence claims, we [apply] a two part analysis. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. . . . Second, we determine whether, from that evidence and all the reasonable inferences which it yields, a [trier of fact] could reasonably have concluded that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wideman, </em>36 Conn. App. 190, 202, 650 A.2d 571 (1994), cert. denied, 232 Conn. 903, 653 A.2d 192 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Moreover, \u201c[w]e note that the jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, [but] each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. ... If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>275 Conn. 534, 542, 881 A.2d 290 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1082, 126 S. Ct. 1798, 164 L. Ed. 2d 537 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u201c[T]he statute on manslaughter in the first degree . . . provides in relevant part: A person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when ... (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the death of another person. For the defendant to have been found guilty of this offense, the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following: (1) that the defendant engaged in conduct that created a grave risk of death; (2) that in doing so the defendant acted recklessly; (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life; and (4) the defendant caused the death of the victim. . . . Additionally, the state had to prove that the defendant had the general intent to engage in conduct that created a grave risk of death to another person under circumstances evincing extreme indifference to human life.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Best, </em>56 Conn. App. 742, 753-54, 745 A.2d 223, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 902, 753 A.2d 937 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The defendant concedes that, acting recklessly, she caused the victim\u2019s death. She challenges the jury\u2019s finding that she acted under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life and that she created a grave risk of death to the victim as a result of her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\u201cOur Penal Code does not define, in title 53a of the General Statutes, what constitutes extreme indifference to human life [or grave risk of death]. . . . Therefore, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>of the term[s] as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>91 Conn. App. 1, 4, 879 A.2d 534, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 904, 884 A.2d 1026 (2005). In examining what constitutes an extreme indifference to human life, \u201cwe have stated that the legislature modified the level of indifference required with the adjective extreme, which has been defined to mean existing in the highest or greatest possible degree. ... It is synonymous with excessive. . . . Extreme indifference to human life has been defined accurately, in part, as more than [m]ere carelessness or ordinary recklessness. . . . Extreme indifference to human life also has been defined accurately, in part, as a high degree of disinterest to human life.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cWhat evinces an extreme indifference to human life is really a question of fact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Best, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 755. Further, in examining what constitutes a grave risk of death, this court has noted that Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary \u201cdefines the adjective \u2018grave\u2019 as meaning \u2018very serious; dangerous to life.\u2019 \u201d Id., 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Viewed in the light most favorable to sustaining the defendant\u2019s conviction, the evidence was sufficient to prove that the defendant evinced an extreme indifference to human life. The jury could have found that the defendant stabbed the victim in the neck. During her physical altercation with the victim, the defendant, by her own admission, entered the kitchen and brandished a steak knife. Upon discovering the defendant next to the unconscious victim, Fiumidinisi testified, the defendant told him that she had stabbed the victim. Peter DeForest, a professor of criminalistics at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, testified that it was possible that the wound occurred as a result of a downward thrust of the knife and that he could not exclude any possibility as to what caused the knife to penetrate the victim\u2019s neck. Susan Williams, a forensic pathologist, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>testified that her examination of the wound indicated that the knife entered the victim\u2019s neck \u201cat a steep angle . . . basically downward and a little bit backward.\u201d An autopsy revealed that the wound itself extended three to four inches within the right side of the victim\u2019s neck and into his chest cavity, piercing his carotid artery and the top of his lung. Williams further testified that the victim\u2019s injuries were so severe that emergency medical technicians would likely have been unable to prevent the victim\u2019s death had they been there to instantaneously administer medical treatment the very moment the victim was stabbed. Further, contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion that she dropped the knife immediately after the victim was stabbed, the jury heard testimony that the knife was discovered next to mattresses and old furniture underneath the stairwell of a maintenance building near the defendant\u2019s apartment complex. Accordingly, on the basis of the cumulative effect of all of the evidence, the jury could have concluded reasonably that the defendant engaged in conduct evincing an extreme indifference to human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The jury also could have found that the defendant\u2019s conduct created a grave risk of death. In reviewing convictions of manslaughter in the first degree, this court has observed that \u201c[t]he facts of those cases demonstrate that the grave risk of death associated with the subject conduct are within the common knowledge of a layperson and that no expert testimony would be necessary to educate the jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>106 Conn. App. 467, 486, 942 A.2d 1085, cert. granted on other grounds, 287 Conn. 908, 950 A.2d 1286 (2008) (appeal withdrawn June 12, 2008). In the present case, we are unable to conclude, as a matter of law, that the grave risk of death inherent in stabbing a person in the neck with a steak knife is without the common knowledge of a layperson. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The defendant raises two claims regarding the court\u2019s charge to the jury, arguing that the court\u2019s allegedly improper instructions violated her due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The defendant first claims that the court diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof by improperly instructing the jury on self-defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Before reviewing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we first address the state\u2019s contention that we should decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim because, with respect to the instruction at issue, the defendant waived any right to challenge that charge on appeal. The facts that follow are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The defendant filed a written request to charge, pursuant to which she asked the court to instruct the jury on only deadly physical force when considering self-defense. Specifically, the written request provided: \u201cIn this case, we are talking about the use of deadly physical force by the defendant. It is therefore the last portion of that section of the statute on self-defense that is implicated in this case . . . .\u201d Rejecting the defendant\u2019s request to charge, the court instructed as to both deadly and nondeadly physical force. The court\u2019s instructions provided: \u201cThe first issue that you must resolve is whether the defendant used deadly or nondeadly force. This is a question of fact for you to decide after a full consideration of the evidence.\u201d After the court concluded reading its instructions to the jury, the defendant took exception to the charge and asked the court to instruct pursuant to her written request to charge. The court declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">For the first time on appeal, the defendant claims that the court diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof by failing to inform the jury that it must apply the beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>a reasonable doubt standard of proof in considering whether she applied deadly or nondeadly force. Having failed to preserve her claim, the defendant seeks to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Golding </em>provides that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. \u201cThe first two <em>Golding </em>requirements involve whether the claim is reviewable, and the second two involve whether there was constitutional error requiring a new trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>281 Conn. 469, 477, 915 A.2d 872 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">That the first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>are satisfied in the present case is uncontested. The record is adequate for review, and the defendant\u2019s claim is of constitutional magnitude because it involves her fundamental due process right to a proper jury instruction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>199 Conn. 273, 278, 506 A.2d 556 (1986). Accordingly, we consider whether the alleged constitutional violation clearly existed and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>[supra] 281 Conn. [478], we stated that \u2018[i]n the usual <em>Golding </em>situation, the defendant raises a claim on appeal [that], while not preserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>at trial, at least was not waived at trial.\u2019 . . . We generally do not review unpreserved, waived claims. . . . \u2018To reach a contrary conclusion would result in an ambush of the trial court by permitting the defendant to raise a claim on appeal that his or her counsel expressly had abandoned in the trial court.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>293 Conn. 327, 337, 977 A.2d 199 (2009). Recently, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ebron, </em>292 Conn. 656, 975 A.2d 17 (2009), our Supreme Court elucidated the principles governing the reviewability of claims of instructional error in which a party has acquiesced to the court\u2019s charge. The court in <em>Ebron </em>concluded that a defendant will be deemed to have waived an objection to an instruction only if he \u201cactively induced the trial court to act on the challenged portion of the instruction.\u201d Id., 680. In the present case, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s request to charge. The defendant could not have actively induced the court by virtue of the fact that the court specifically rejected her requested charge. Accordingly, the defendant did not waive her claim, and, therefore, we consider the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">We first set forth our standard of review. \u201cA challenge to the validity of jury instructions presents a question of law over which this court has plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>108 Conn. App. 566, 576, 948 A.2d 1075 (2008). \u201cIt is well settled that jury instructions are to be reviewed in their entirety. . . . When the challenge to a jury instruction is of constitutional magnitude, the standard of review is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury [was] misled. ... In determining whether it was . . . reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement .... Individual instructions also are not to be judged in artificial isolation .... Instead, [t]he test to be applied ... is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>whether the charge ... as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Makee R., </em>117 Conn. App. 191, 198, 978 A.2d 549 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The defendant directs our attention to one particular part of the court\u2019s instruction, claiming that she was denied her due process right to a fair trial. Specifically, she argues that the court diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof by improperly instructing the jury that \u201c[t]he first issue that you must resolve is whether the defendant used deadly or nondeadly force. This is a question of fact for you to decide after a full consideration of the evidence.\u201d According to the defendant, because the court\u2019s instructions as a whole are rife with the reasonable doubt standard of proof, the court\u2019s failure to include it in this one instance misled the jury into applying some other standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">On the basis of the charge as a whole, we conclude that the court\u2019s instruction on self-defense presented the case to the jury in such a manner that no injustice resulted. The court provided a general charge to the jury in which it specifically instructed that the only standard of review that the jury was to apply was that of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. At no time did the court instruct the jury to apply any other standard, and, throughout its charge, the court instructed the jury repeatedly to apply the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard. The court further emphasized that the state bore the burden in proving both the elements of the charged crime and in disproving the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense. Nothing in the court\u2019s instructions evinced a determination under any other standard of review. Accordingly, we conclude that the court\u2019s instructions did not mislead the jury and, thus, this claim fails under <em>Golding\u2019s </em>third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The defendant also claims that the court\u2019s instructions violated her due process right to a fair trial by referring to Devane as \u201cthe victim.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. The court used the term \u201cvictim\u201d ten times in its charge to the jury. Nine such references were made in the context of its charge on self-defense. The court referred to Devane as \u201cthe alleged victim\u201d in the context of its charge on the irrelevance of sympathy, prejudice and punishment. That sole reference preceded those that appeared in the self-defense charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Conceding that her claim is unpreserved as a result of her failure to take exception to the court\u2019s instructional reference or covering such in her request to charge, the defendant seeks to prevail under <em>Golding. </em>We review the defendant\u2019s claim because the record is adequate for review, and her claim that she was denied a fair trial due to the court\u2019s alleged instructional error is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Eric M., </em>79 Conn. App. 91, 99, 829 A.2d 439 (2003) (right to fair trial is fundamental liberty secured by fourteenth amendment), aff'd, 271 Conn. 641, 858 A.2d 767 (2004). Accordingly, we turn to the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Prehminarily, we note that our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim requires application of the same standard of review as applied in part II A of this opinion. In particular, \u201c[t]he test to be applied ... is whether the charge ... as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Makee R., </em>supra, 117 Conn. App. 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">\u201cThe appellate courts of this state have had occasion to consider the ambiguous nature of the term victim. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cortes, </em>84 Conn. App. 70, 86, 851 A.2d 1230 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>(2004), aff'd, 276 Conn. 241, 885 A.2d 153 (2005), this court held that the trial court\u2019s pervasive use of the term in its jury charge deprived the defendant of a fair trial. . . . This court reasoned: In cases in which the fact that a crime has been committed against the complaining witness is not contested, but only the identity of the perpetrator is in dispute, a court\u2019s use of the term victim is not inappropriate. In cases in which the fact that a crime has been committed is contested, and where the court\u2019s use of the term victim has been the subject of an objection and has not been the subject of a subsequent curative instruction, a court\u2019s use of the term may constitute reversible error. The danger in the latter type of case is that the court, having used the term without specifically instructing the jury as to its intention in using the term, might convey to the jury, to whatever slight degree, its belief that a crime has been committed against the complainant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>100 Conn. App. 236, 252-53, 917 A.2d 1051, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 933, 935 A.2d 152, 153 (2007). In our analysis, \u201c[w]e also ask whether any prejudicial effect of the court\u2019s use of the term \u2018victim\u2019 was negated by the court\u2019s other instructions to the jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cortes, </em>s+upra, 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Relying on <em>Cortes, </em>the defendant claims that the court\u2019s use of the term \u201cvictim\u201d undermined her claim of self-defense, deprived her of the presumption of innocence and infringed on the jury\u2019s function as the finder of fact. The defendant argues that the most critical determination that the jury had to make was whether she acted in self-defense. As the defendant correctly points out, if she was justified in her conduct, Devane could not have been a victim because his death would not have constituted a crime. By using the term \u201cvictim, \u201d the defendant contends, the court communicated to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>jury its belief that the defendant did not act in self-defense, thereby infringing on the jury\u2019s duty to determine if Devane was a victim of a crime and if, in fact, a crime had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Upon our review of the court\u2019s instructions as a whole, we conclude that it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s use of the term \u201cvictim.\u201d The court began and ended its instructions by referring to Devane by name and did not refer specifically to him as \u201cthe victim,\u201d except on one occasion. On that occasion, the court referred to Devane as \u201cthe alleged victim,\u201d making clear that it passed no judgment as to whether Devane was or was not the victim of a crime. Moreover, the court stated that it had no preference as to the outcome of the case, that its sole task was to apply the rules of evidence and charge the jury on the law and that it was the jury\u2019s task to decide the outcome. Any potential harm by the court\u2019s use of the term \u201cvictim\u201d was further negated through its final instructions accurately describing the defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemay, </em>105 Conn. App. 486, 493, 938 A.2d 611 (\u201c[i]n the absence of a showing that the jury failed or declined to follow the court\u2019s instructions, we presume that it heeded them\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 286 Conn. 915, 945 A.2d 978 (2008). Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails and, thus, fails under <em>Golding's </em>third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Finally, the defendant claims that the court improperly denied her motion to suppress statements that she made prior to being advised of her constitutional rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">\u201cOur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is well defined.

Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). Two threshold conditions must be satisfied in order to invoke the warnings constitutionally required by <em>Miranda: </em>(1) the defendant must have been in custody; and (2) the defendant must have been subjected to police interrogation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullins, </em>288 Conn. 345, 361, 952 A.2d 784 (2008). The burden of proving custodial interrogation lies initially with the defendant. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>200 Conn. 642, 647, 513 A.2d 58 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u201cTo determine whether a suspect is in custody so as to require <em>Miranda </em>warnings, we inquire whether a reasonable person, in view of all the circumstances, would have believed that he or she was not free to leave. . . . The term interrogation under <em>Miranda </em>is not limited to questioning explicitly designed to elicit an incriminating response but extends to any words or actions on the part of the police that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from a suspect. The police, however, cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions. . . . Voluntary statements of any kind are not barred by the fifth amendment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>Miranda </em>v.

It is an act of responsible citizenship for individuals to give whatever information they may have to aid in law enforcement. In such situations the compelling atmosphere inherent in the process of in-custody interrogation is not necessarily present.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Szabo, </em>166 Conn. 289, 293, 348 A.2d 588 (1974); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dunnings, </em>425 F.2d 836, 838 n.1 (2d Cir. 1969) (questioning defendant about identity of white powder when executing search warrant was general on scene questioning, expressly excepted by <em>Miranda), </em>cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1002, 90 S.

On December 11, 2006, the court held a hearing in which it denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress several statements she made from the time that officers first arrived at her apartment complex through her being advised of her constitutional rights at police headquarters. At that hearing, Fiumidinisi testified that when he arrives at the scene of a crime, he often finds family members of the injured there trying to assist that person. Fiumidinisi indicated that any witness or suspect would have been questioned as part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>of the investigation before being permitted to leave. When Fiumidinisi, upon arrival, saw the defendant cradling the victim, he thought it possible that the defendant and the injured victim were related and testified that \u201cit would have been [his] intention to interview [the defendant] because she was there with a person who was injured.\u201d Only after the defendant exclaimed that she had stabbed the victim was she arrested. In denying her motion, the court concluded that although the defendant was in custody for purposes <em>o\u00ed Miranda, </em>she was not interrogated. Specifically, the court reasoned that questions concerning the victim\u2019s identity amounted to general on the scene questioning, which does not invoke the warnings required by Miranda.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant now argues that the court improperly denied her motion to suppress these statements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant contends that Payne and Fiumidinisi knew or should have known that their questions concerning the identity of the victim were likely to elicit an incriminating response from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">On the basis of the facts of the present case, we conclude that the defendant was not \u201cinterrogated\u201d within the meaning of <em>Miranda. </em>The court\u2019s conclusion that Payne and Fiumidinisi\u2019s questions as to the victim\u2019s identity amounted to no more than general on the scene questioning not reasonably likely to elicit an incriminatory response finds ample support in the record. Even though Payne and Fiumidinisi heard the defendant exclaim, \u201c[w]ake up, wake up; I did not mean to do it,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>their subsequent questions were not focused on the defendant as an accused. Their questions were essentially protocol upon arriving at the scene of a crime. Having seen the defendant cradle the victim, Payne and Fiumidinisi reasonably believed that the two may have been related or that, at the very least, she knew his identity. The defendant was not asked about her involvement, if any, in the crime. Nevertheless, after identifying the victim, the defendant volunteered that he \u201ccame at [her]\u201d and that she had \u201cstabbed him.\u201d The defendant\u2019s responsive statements were unforeseeable and, thus, not barred by the fifth amendment. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\"> The defendant recognized Fiumidinisi from a previous investigation in which the defendant was the victim of or a witness to a crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b445-8\"><em> Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478-79, 86 S.

The officers to this point are just trying to sort things out. And, obviously, with a dead or dying person on the scene, there\u2019s not a lot of time for the officers to thoroughly analyze this before commencing questioning of the sort they did here.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\"> The defendant limits her claim to statements she made in direct response to questions about the victim\u2019s identity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
