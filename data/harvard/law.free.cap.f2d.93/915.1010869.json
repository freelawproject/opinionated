One of appellant\u2019s witnesses stated that during the last forty years his company had \u201creceived and studied\u201d various uses for Bon Ami and there was introduced into the record a list of such uses, which is in the form of an advertisement, which had been suggested for two of its products \u2014 the Bon Ami cake and powder \u2014 as polishers and cleaners, as dentrifices, for teeth plates and bridge work (artificial), for razor hones and strops, as a shampoo, as a face pack, and many other uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-22\">There is some dispute in the record as to whether or not appellant at the time of filing the opposition was engaged in handling toothpaste under the name \u201cBon Ami,\u201d but, as we see it, this is not a controlling consideration, since there is no serious dispute that the goods upon which appellee used its trade-mark \u201cShav-ami\u201d and the goods upon which appellant placed its mark on and prior to the date when appellee adopted its mark are of the same descriptive properties. It is the position of appellee, however, that the goods differ in character, and it is contended that the differences in the goods and the differences in the marks assure that there will be no confusion by the concurrent use of the twd marks on the respective goods of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-23\">The Examiner of Interferences held that the goods were of the same descriptive properties, that the marks were confusingly similar, and that confusion such as the statute seeks to avoid would be likely to result. He pointed out that the rule of doubt should be applied especially in an instance where, as in the case at bar, the evidence shows that the \u201cmark of the op-poser symbolizes a wide spread and valuable good will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-24\">Upon appeal to the Commissioner of Patents, the decision of the Examiner of Interferences was reversed. The Commissioner was of the opinion that, the goods not being identical, although \u201cthey are both toilet preparations and belong to the same general class of merchandise,\u201d the marks were \u201cfree of deceptive similarity,\u201d sounded differently, had a different suggestive meaning, and that confusion .was not likely to result.</p>\n<p id=\"AWg\">We 'are of the opinion that the Commissioner erred in reversing the decision of the Examiner. It is true that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>is a difference in the marks and a difference in the goods, but it seems to us that, since the mark \u201cBon Ami\u201d is for a product of everyday use, is widely known, and is unusual in its arbitrary character, confusion will be more likely to occur than under other circumstances. \u201cBon Ami\u201d means \u201cgood friend.\u201d The appellee uses the same word \u201cami,\u201d pronounces it \u201cah-m\u00e9,\u201d and pronounces the whole mark as \u201cshave-ah-me.\u201d It is difficult to understand just why appellee should choose such a mark when the field was so broad to select from. It is hardly supposable that a large, reputable concern like the appellee would seek to profit from confusion, and there is nothing in this case to indicate that that is its desire. Nevertheless, we think there is a likelihood of confusion resulting in the concurrent use of the two marks and, like the Examiner, we apply the rule of doubt which requires that doubts, if any, as to confusion, must be resolved against the newcomer.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The appellant points out that in the following cases the marks involved were held to be confusingly similar: Langfield v. Solvit-All Corporation, 49 F.2d 480, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1313, \u201csolvite\u201d and \u201cSolvit-All\u201d; William Waltke &amp; Co. v. Geo. H. Schafer &amp; Co., 49 App.D.C. 254, 263 F. 650, \u201cU-Lavo\u201d and \u201clava\u201d; In re Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles, 49 F.2d 838, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1384, \u201cLemon Frost\u201d and \u201cJack Frost\u201d; Marion Lambert, Inc., v. O\u2019Connor, 86 F.2d 980, 24 C.C.P.A., Patents, 781, \u201cVoo\u201d and \u201cDew\u201d; Malone v. Horowitz, 41 F.2d 414, 17 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1252, \u201cMolo\u201d and \u201cPoro\u201d; Kotex Co. v. McArthur, 45 F.2d 256, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 787, \u201cRotex\u201d and \u201cKotex\u201d; and Simoniz Co. v. Permanizing Stations of America, Inc., 49 F.2d 846, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1374, \u201cSimoniz\u201d and \u201cPermanize.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">On the other hand, the appellee, for supporting authority on the question of confusion, relies upon the following cases which held the involved marks not to be confusingly similar: Vick Chemical Company v. Thomas Kerfoot Co., Ltd., 80 F.2d 73, 23 C.C.P.A., Patents, 752, \u201cVapex,\u201d \u201cVicks,\u201d and \u201cVaporub\u201d; Valvoline Oil Company v. Havoline Oil Company, D.C., 211 F. 189, \u201cValvoline\u201d and \u201cHavoline\u201d; Ansco Photo-products, Inc., v. Eastman Kodak Company, 57 App.D.C. 246, 19 F.2d 720, \u201cSpeedex\u201d and \u201cSpeedway\u201d; Rosenberg Bros. &amp; Co. v. Wetherby-Kayser Shoe Co., 37 F.2d 437, 17 C.C.P.A., Patents, 794, \u201cFashion Lane\u201d and \u201cFashion Park\u201d; and Goodall Worsted Company v. Palm Knitting Company, 56 App.D.C. 148, 10 F.2d 1013, \u201cPalm-Knit\u201d and \u201cPalm Beach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">The cases relied upon by the appellee, we think, are not controlling of decision here. Most of the marks involved in those cases, such as \u201cFashion Park\u201d and \u201cFashion Lane,\u201d are made up of ordinary words used in everyday conversation, whereas the term \u201cami\u201d is a foreign word and, except to distinguish appellant\u2019s goods, is not commonly used in this country. We think there is much more likelihood of confusion where such terms as \u201cBon Ami\u201d and \u201cShav-ami\u201d are concurrently used than there was under the circumstances recited in the cases relied upon by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">The appellant urges that the normal extension of its business would include the handling of shaving cream and that there can be no question about confusion if the marks were used on goods which were identical. While this is a consideration which in close cases has often been resorted to, it is unnecessary for us to discuss it here, since it is clear to us that there is a likelihood of confusion in the concurrent use of the two marks upon goods which were dealt in by the respective parties at the time applicant adopted its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">GRAHAM, the late Presiding Judge, sat during the argument of this case, but died before&lt; the opinion was prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">HATFIELD, Associate Judge, made the following additional observations:</p>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">I concur in all that has been said by the court in the opinion by Judge BLAND. I desire, however, to add the thought that if the marks \u201cShav-ami,\u201d which means \u201cshave-friend,\u201d and \u201cBon Ami,\u201d which means \u201cgood friend,\u201d are* not confusingly similar, then similar marks, such as \u201cCleanAmi\u201d \u2014 clean friend \u2014 and various others, are no more confusingly similar, and would be registrable for use on goods possessing the same descriptive properties as those here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-14\">If all that a newcomer in the field need do in order to avoid the charge of confus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>ing similarity is to select a word descriptive of his goods and combine it with a word which is the dominant feature of a registered trade-mark so that the borrowed 'word becomes the dominant feature of his mark, the registered trade-mark, made valuable and outstanding by extensive advertising and use, soon becomes of little value, and, of course, each of the subsequent imitating trade-marks (and there would be many) is of value only to the extent that its users are trading on the good will of the owner of the original registered trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">These observations have particular application when the goods on which the respective marks are used are common, inexpensive, and widely used toilet and household articles, and are sold in the same stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">I do not question the good faith of appellee in selecting its trade-mark \u201cShavami,\u201d but, if it has the legal right to take something of substance and value from appellant\u2019s trade-mark, others of less conscience have equal legal rights to take something of substance and value from both appellant\u2019s and appellee\u2019s trade-marks</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
