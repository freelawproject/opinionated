Carroll pleaded guilty. Appellant went to trial, was convicted on each of the four counts, and was sentenced. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-27\">The only matter presented by appellant for our consideration is the charge to the jury by the District Judge on the subject of an alibi to which exception was saved thus: \u201cto that part of the court\u2019s charge on the defendant\u2019s defense of an alibi, and particularly that part of the court\u2019s charge wherein the court criticized the defense of an alibi as being an unsatisfactory defense.\u201d As to the alibi the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-28\">\u201cNow in this case, as to the evidence, we have a direct and positive conflict. The sheriff of Blaine County testified that he has known Reavis for many years; that as soon as he heard his voice he recognized him, and that he saw him when the flash light was thrown upon his face. Practically the same testimony was given by the undersheriff, and both testified positively it was Otto Reavis; that there was no doubt in their minds at all; that they were positive. * * * They further testified that he was riding a black horse; that they recognized the horse, and that they traced the horse\u2019s foot prints up to the barn lot; that they went on up to the lot that <em>night </em>and saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the horse in the lot; saw a saddle that had been thrown down there at the barn; they went in the house and Otto Reavis was in bed and they arrested him. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u201cNow on the other hand, the defendant denies positively that he was there, that he had anything to do with that still or that he knew anything about this transaction. He said he never was at the still until the officers took him up there after the arrest. The co-defendant Carroll says that this man had nothing to do with the still; that he was running it for a man named Krause, who lived in Kansas. * * * The other testimony is largely in the nature of an alibi, that at the time this man was supposed to have been down at the still he was up at the house in bed asleep. An alibi is a very unsatisfactory type of testimony. It is unsatisfactory for the reason it does not give the opposing side any notice of its character until it is too late to get witnesses to meet it, ordinarily. In this case, the mother said that the boy was there that night. The sister-in-law says he was. there that night. The brother of this defendant says he was there when he was there, so it comes right down to the proposition that all these witnesses cannot be telling the truth. Somebody is mistaken, or somebody is testifying falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u201cSo the question for you to determine is which one of thesevgroups is testifying falsely and which one is not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">None of the evidence, verbatim or in substance, is included in the bill of excep- . tions except as it is embodied in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. The bill of exceptions recites that: \u201cthe government introduced testimony in support of its indictment. Whereupon, the defendants introduced testimony tending to show that he was at another and a different place at the time the government witnesses claimed to have seen him.\u201d The Judge\u2019s certificate to the bill of exceptions states that it, \u201ccontains the proceedings had, all the evidence offered, admitted, or adduced at the trial of the said cause, together with all exceptions taken which are applicable to the questions raised on this appeal.\u201d The defendant in stating the objection and exception to the court\u2019s instruction said: \u201cWe would like to object to and reserve an exception to that part of the court\u2019s charge on the defendant\u2019s defense of an alibi, and particularly that part of the court\u2019s charge wherein the court criticized the defense of an alibi as being an unsatisfactory defense.\u201d Whereupon the court said: \u201cVery well, exceptions allowed. (Hereupon the jury retires to consider its verdict.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">It thus appears from the bill of exceptions that the testimony which the District Judge certified as having been introduced by the defendant was, in the court\u2019s opinion, \u201cin the nature of an alibi\u201d, being testimony \u201ctending to show that the defendant was at another and different place at the time the government witnesses claimed to have seen him.\u201d Viewed in that way only it would be applied by the jury to a mere conflict in the testimony. But it further appears that defendant\u2019s counsel in making his objection stated that defendant\u2019s testimony to establish an alibi was a defense to the charges against him. Viewed in that way it alone would be a complete and absolute defense, if established to the satisfaction of the jury; or if considered in connection with the other \u2022 fact\u2019s and circumstances it might have raised in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt entitling the defendant to an acquittal. The jury should have been so instructed. Glover v. United States, 8 Cir., 147 F. 426, 8 Ann.Cas. 1184; Falgout v. United States, 5 Cir., 279 F. 513; Louie Ding v. United States, 9 Cir., 246 F. 80; United States v. Vigorito, 2 Cir., 67 F.2d 329; Cangelosi v. United States, 6 Cir., 19 F.2d 923; Com. v. Webster, 5 Cush., Mass., 295, 319, 52 Am.Dec. 711; Com. v. Choate, 105 Mass. 451; Thompson on Trials, vol. 2, \u00a7 2433 et seq.; Greenleaf on Evidence, 15th Ed., vol. 1, note to section 80; Id., vol. 3, \u00a7 30; Wigmore on Evidence, 2d Ed., \u00a7 2512; The Modern Law of Evidence by Chamberlayne, vol. 2, \u00a7 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">There are two main issues that arise in every criminal case which the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: First, the corpus delicti; and' Second, the defendant\u2019s connection with the perpetration of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">The Judge\u2019s statements of the facts in his instructions to the jury indicated that a federal agent was with the sheriff and his deputy on the night or late evening at the still. Fie declined to testify that he saw Reavis. Fie said he saw the man who came only faintly that night and was not able to identify him in the court room. Carroll and the appellant both testified that the appellant had' nothing to do with the still. The court said to the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">\u201cThe only other circumstances which tend to connect Reavis with this transaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>aside from the fact that it was there adjoining his farm, in close proximity to the farm, was the statement of the co-defendant, Carroll. The revenue agent testified that Carroll said that night \u2018that old horse Otto is riding is so old it is a wonder he don\u2019t fall down.\u2019 Carroll denies that statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">We cannot agree that the proximity of the still to Reavis\u2019 farm or the statement attributed to Carroll by the federal agent had any tendency whatever to prove that, appellant was a party to the commission of any of the four offenses charged against him. Nor for that purpose can we attribute any weight to the fact, if it be a fact, that he rode up to the still on the occasion stated. On the record brought here it is our opinion that there should have been instructed verdicts of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
