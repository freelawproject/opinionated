McDonald contends that the district court erred by sua sponte dismissing his complaint, as the form upon which he filed his complaint did not permit him to provide details regarding his allegations. He also argues that the district court erred by failing to consider his allegation that he could not exhaust administrative remedies regarding the instant claims due to the inadequacies in the prison administrative review process and because his prior complaints and grievances have been met with threats and retaliatory actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The defendants did not make an appearance in the district court and, although the Louisiana Department of Public Safety &amp; Corrections was advised by this court\u2019s clerk\u2019s office of the briefing schedule, the appellees did not file a brief in this matter. This court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies de novo. <em>Powe v. Ennis, </em>177 F.3d 393, 394 (5th Cir.1999). As the district court concluded, McDonald was required under \u00a7 1997e(a) of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 202, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). \u201cProper exhaustion demands compliance with an agency\u2019s deadlines and other critical procedural rules because no adjudicative system can function effectively without imposing some orderly structure on the course of its proceedings.\u201d <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 90-91, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). In <em>Jones, </em>549 U.S. at 216, 127 S.Ct. 910, the Supreme Court held that an inmate\u2019s failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA and that \u201cinmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d <em>Jones </em>is a departure from the practice of sua sponte dismissing a complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>Carbe v. Lappin, </em>492 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2007). The prohibition against requiring prisoners to affirmatively plead exhaustion has been further interpreted by this court to encompass questions in \u201cform complaint[s]\u201d issued by district courts that are designed to elicit \u201cinformation about [a prisoner\u2019s] exhaustion of administrative remedies.\u201d <em>See Torns v. Miss. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>301 Fed.Appx. 386, 389 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Although Jones stated in his complaint that he had not exhausted the instant claims, he provided reasons why he did not exhaust his claims both in the complaint and in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, and he provided documents to support his allegations. While the district court acknowledged the holding in <em>Jones, </em>the district court nonetheless relied upon McDonald\u2019s responses to the form complaint\u2019s questions to determine that McDonald\u2019s proffered reason for failing to exhaust was a conclusory statement that was insufficient to establish exhaustion. The district court therefore erred in sua sponte dismissing McDonald\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust. <em>See Jones, </em>549 U.S. at 216, 127 S.Ct. 910; <em>Carbe, </em>492 F.3d at 328; <em>Torns, </em>301 Fed.Appx. at 389. The district court also did not make findings regarding Jones\u2019s allegations that his failure to pursue administrative relief should be excused. It would be premature for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>court to determine whether McDonald\u2019s allegations fall within an exception to the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement, or whether an exception is available to McDonald. <em>See Woodford, </em>548 U.S. at 103-04, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (Breyer, J., concurring); <em>Johnson v. Ford, </em>261 Fed.Appx. 752, 755 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">We therefore VACATE and REMAND for sendee of the defendants and subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
