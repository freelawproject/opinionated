Lopez challenges the denial of his motion to suppress an out-of-court identification and, for the first time on appeal, the admission of an in-court identification, and Lopez challenges the denial of his motion for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-21\">No error occurred in permitting Adolpho Espinosa to identify Lopez during trial. Even assuming that Espinosa\u2019s out-of-court identification was unduly suggestive, Espinosa\u2019s in-court identification was reliable. <em>See Marsden v. Moore, </em>847 F.2d 1536, 1546 (11th Cir.1988). Espinosa identified Lopez at trial based on a 45-minute meeting in which they discussed trafficking in drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-22\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Lopez\u2019s motion for a new trial in which he challenged the identification of his voice by Agent Ryan Johnson of the Drug Enforcement Agency. Johnson testified that he had compared his interview of Lopez to a recording of the 45-minute meeting between Lopez and Espinosa, and Johnson opined that one person in the record \u201csounded very much like Mr. Carlos Lopez.\u201d Johnson\u2019s testimony aided the jury in identifying Lopez as a participant in the meeting because the jury never heard Lopez speak at trial. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Fed.R.Evid. 701; <em>United States v. Marshall, </em>173 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.1999). Lopez argues that Johnson\u2019s testimony \u201cunfairly prejudiced the defense\u201d because the jury \u201cwas given the impression that [Johnson\u2019s] opinion would hold more weight\u201d because he was a law enforcement officer, but the district court instructed the jury that the \u201ctestimony of police officers or federal agents is to be given no more nor less weight than the testimony of other witnesses.\u201d We presume that the jury followed that instruction. <em>See United States v. Mock, </em>523 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir.2008). Lopez also argues that his right of cross-examination was unfairly limited and the jury surmised that he had a criminal history because Johnson testified, but Johnson did not state that he had any prior dealings with Lopez or suggest that Lopez had prior contact with the criminal justice system. The district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Johnson to testify as a lay witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">We AFFIRM Lopez\u2019s convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
