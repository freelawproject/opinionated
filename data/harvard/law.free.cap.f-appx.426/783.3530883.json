U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). We must \u201caffirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroji, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations omitted). Accordingly, \u201c[t]o conclude the BIA\u2019s decision should be reversed, we must find that the record not only supports the conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Although Lara contends the record established he did not make a false claim to U.S. citizenship, the record contains ample evidence\u2014including Lara\u2019s own sworn statement\u2014showing that Lara presented the passport at inspection in an attempt to enter the United States. Furthermore, Lara\u2019s due process argument lacks merit because, as the BIA noted, Lara was removable regardless of whether he \u201cpresented\u201d the U.S. passport for admission. Because Lara conceded removability based on the alternative ground that he was an arriving alien without a valid entry document, any alleged procedural error was harmless and Lara cannot show that any constitutional due process violation caused substantial prejudice. <em>See De Sandoval v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1276, 1285 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cTo establish a procedural due process violation, an alien must show the government\u2019s asserted error caused [him] substantial prejudice.\u201d). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review with respect to Lara\u2019s challenge to the fraud charge under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Second, Lara asserts the BIA erred by denying his application for withholding of removal because he testified he suffered past persecution on account of his disagreement with the Cuban government. We review <em>de novo </em>whether we enjoy subject matter jurisdiction over a petition for review. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d). Thus, \u201cwe lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect thereto.\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">In his brief before the BIA, Lara argued exclusively for relief under CAT. Lara\u2019s brief neither mentioned nor applied the standards for withholding of removal under the INA. Because Lara failed to exhaust his remedies with respect to his claim for withholding of removal under the INA, we lack jurisdiction to review this claim. Accordingly, to the extent Lara seeks review of his claim for withholding of removal under the INA, we dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-12\">. In his brief before this Court, Lara cites exclusively to his application for relief under the INA and makes no argument for relief under CAT. Because Lara failed to offer argument regarding the denial of CAT relief in his brief before this Court, Lara has abandoned his CAT claim. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (stating if a petitioner \"fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A2v\">. We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment, unless the BIA has expressly adopted the IJ's decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). Because the BIA wrote its own opinion in this case, we review only the BIA's opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
