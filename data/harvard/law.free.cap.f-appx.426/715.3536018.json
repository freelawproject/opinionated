Dominguez argues that he was incorrectly sentenced as a career offender because his prior conviction for aggravated assault did not qualify as a crime of violence and the district court erred by considering uncharged bad acts when it evaluated Dominguez\u2019s request for a downward departure. The United States argues that Dominguez\u2019s appeal about his sentence is barred by the appeal waiver in his plea agreement and, alternatively, his arguments fail. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-17\">We need not determine whether Dominguez\u2019s appeal is barred by the waiver in his plea agreement because Dominguez\u2019s arguments fail on alternative grounds. Dominguez was correctly sentenced as a career offender, and we lack jurisdiction to consider his argument about a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-18\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant can be classified as a career offender if he is 18 years old at the time of his crime, his crime qualifies as a crime of violence, and he has at least two prior felony convictions for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) (2009). To qualify as a crime of violence, a prior conviction must have \u201cas an element the use, attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>use, or threatened use of physical force against another person\u201d or \u201cinvolve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d person. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B 1.2(a). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u2018crime of \u2022violence\u2019 under the Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d <em>United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1240 (11th Cir.2011), and review related findings of fact for clear error, <em>United States v. Wilks, </em>464 F.3d 1240, 1242 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The district court did not err when it sentenced Dominguez as a career offender because his prior conviction for aggravated assault qualified as a crime of violence. Dominguez argues that the district court reviewed improperly a police report about the assault, <em>see United States v. Sneed, </em>600 F.3d 1326, 1333 (11th Cir.2010), but we can \u201cdisregard the facts of the underlying conviction\u201d and review the decision of the district court because \u201cwe are able to make the \u2018crime of violence\u2019 determination from the face of\u2019 the Florida assault statutes and \u201cthe elements of [Dominguezj\u2019s prior conviction,\u201d <em>Lockley, </em>632 F.3d at 1240. Dominguez was convicted in a Florida court of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Under Florida law, a defendant commits an aggravated assault when he makes \u201can intentional, unlawful threat by word or act to do violence to\u201d another person, which is \u201ccoupled with an apparent ability to do so\u201d and \u201ccreates a well-founded fear in such other person that such violence is imminent,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.011, and either involves the use of a \u201cdeadly weapon without intent to kill\u201d or is committed \u201c[w]ith an intent to commit a felony,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 784.021(1). Dominguez\u2019s pri- or conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because it involved a \u201cthreatened use of physical force\u201d against a victim. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l). Dominguez argues that \u201cthe facts underlying [his] conviction\u201d establish that he was convicted of a misdemeanor, but the district court did not clearly err when it found that Dominguez\u2019s crime constituted a felony. An aggravated assault statute is a \u201cfelony of the third degree,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.021(2), and Dominguez conceded at sentencing that he had pleaded guilty to a felony. Dominguez\u2019s prior conviction for aggravated assault qualifies as a predicate offense for the career offender enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Dominguez\u2019s motion for a downward departure. We cannot examine a discretionary decision not to depart downward \u201cunless the district court incorrectly believed that it lacked authority to grant the departure,\u201d and the record establishes that the district court \u201cunderstood that it could depart, but chose not to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006). The district court examined Dominguez\u2019s criminal history and ruled that there was no \u201cbasis to think ... that there has been a overstatement of the seriousness of the instant offense or [Dominguez\u2019s] criminal history.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Dominguez\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
