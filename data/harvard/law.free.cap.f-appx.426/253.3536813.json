Chang filed his motion to reopen more than 90 days after the BIA\u2019s final order in the removal proceeding. He argues that his motion was timely because it was based on changed country conditions in China, i.e., his own recent conversion to Christianity and the disadvantageous position in which his religious activities placed him with the Chinese government.</p>\n<p id=\"An-\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Manzano-Garcia v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 462, 469 (5th Cir.2005). Changed personal circumstances do not constitute changed country circumstances for purposes of 8 C.F.R. 1003.2(c)(2) and (c)(3)(H). <em>In re C-W-L, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 346, 350 (BIA 2007). The BIA\u2019s denial of Chang\u2019s motion to reopen was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Manzano-Garcia, </em>413 F.3d at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"ALt\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
