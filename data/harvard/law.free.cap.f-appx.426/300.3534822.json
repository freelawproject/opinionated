Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), a prisoner may not proceed IFP in a civil action or in an appeal of a judgment in a civil action if the prisoner has, on three or more prior occasions, while incarcerated, brought an action or appeal that was dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>Banos v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 885 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-19\">The record shows that King\u2019s complaint concerns events at one prison unit and that he has now been transferred to another unit. Accordingly, King faces no threat from the actions of these defendants. King has failed to show that he should be allowed to proceed IFP on appeal under \u00a7 1915(g) or that his appeal of the denial of a preliminary injunction presents a non-frivolous issue. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). King\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied</p>\n<p id=\"b324-20\">The facts surrounding the IFP decision are inextricably intertwined with the merits of the appeal. <em>See, e.g., Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). The appeal of the judgment of the district court presents no nonfrivolous issues, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-21\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
