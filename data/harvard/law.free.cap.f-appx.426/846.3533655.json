He pleaded guilty to three counts of bank robbery and received an above-guidelines sentence of 240 months\u2019 federal imprisonment. Weston raises two arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the district court inaccurately calculated his sentence because it erroneously considered his state-court sentence for October 7, 2008 conduct to be a \u201cprior sentence\u201d when determining Weston\u2019s criminal history category. Second, Weston argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After careful consideration of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs on appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-17\">\n<em>1. Calculation of Criminal History Category</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b871-18\">Weston argues that the district court erred by including his state-court sentence for an October 7 bank robbery and carjacking<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when determining his criminal history category. Because Weston raises this argument for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). To establish plain error, a defendant must show that there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-19\">Ordinarily, a sentencing judge should add three points to a defendant\u2019s criminal history category for each \u201cprior sentence\u201d of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a). But under \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l), conduct that was part of the instant offense cannot be classified as a \u201cprior sentence.\u201d Thus, Weston argues that his state-court sentence should have been excluded because it was based on conduct that is part of the \u201cinstant offense.\u201d We disagree. The first note in the commentary to \u00a7 4A1.2 defines \u201c[c]on-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>duct that is part of the instant offense\u201d as that which is \u201crelevant\u201d to the instant offense under \u00a7 1B1.3. Section 1B1.3, in turn, when read together with \u00a7 3D1.2(d), operates to exclude a \u00a7 2B3.1 offense (robbery). Accordingly, Weston\u2019s state-court sentence for bank robbery is not \u201crelevant conduct\u201d to the instant offense, and is therefore correctly classified as a \u201cprior sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Notwithstanding the district judge\u2019s passing use of the phrase \u201crelevant conduct,\u201d the district court did not err, much less plainly err, when considering Weston\u2019s prior state-court convictions when calculating his criminal history category. The district court was entitled to consider Weston\u2019s state-court sentence, along with the other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, when determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">\n<em>2. Substantive and Procedural Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Weston argues that his 240-month, above-guidelines sentence was inconsistent with the purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), greater than necessary, and overly reliant on his prior state-court convictions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we must determine whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the [sentencing] Guidelines range ..., failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors ..., or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If we determine that the district court\u2019s decision was procedurally sound, we next consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, taking into account \u201cthe totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We may not presume that a sentence outside the guidelines range is unreasonable and generally must defer to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the extent of the variance. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1187 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc), <em>cert. </em>denied -U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). A district court shall impose a sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2) (listing relevant factors for district court\u2019s consideration). Although a district court\u2019s unjustified reliance on any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor can indicate an unreasonable sentence, <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008), a district court is free to attach \u201cgreat weight\u201d to one factor over others. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">Weston has failed to establish that his sentence was procedurally or substantively unreasonable. As explained <em>supra, </em>the district court properly considered Weston\u2019s previous state-court sentence when calculating his federal sentence. Further, after hearing from the parties, the district court adequately explained why the \u00a7 3553(a) factors militated in favor of an above-guidelines range sentence. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it focused on Weston\u2019s extensive criminal history, including the conduct underlying Weston\u2019s state-court sentences, in deciding to vary upward. The district court considered Weston\u2019s arguments for mitigation and allocution, and was then free to weigh the statutory factor of criminal history more heavily than others. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>Weston\u2019s sentence was not greater than necessary, because as the district court explained, the circumstances of this case \u201ccry out for a sentence in excess of\u2019 the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Accordingly, Weston\u2019s challenge to the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-14\">. These offenses, which constituted Counts One and Two of the instant indictment, were dismissed pursuant to Weston's plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
