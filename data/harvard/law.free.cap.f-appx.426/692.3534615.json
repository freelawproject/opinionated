Cisneros argues on appeal that the court clearly erred in denying his request for a minor-role reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, because he was the least culpable in the conspiracy for which he was held accountable. After through review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-16\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a role reduction for clear error. <em>United States v. Bernal-Benitez, </em>594 F.3d 1303, 1320 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2123, 176 L.Ed.2d 746 (2010). The defendant bears the burden of establishing his minor role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>When determining a defendant\u2019s role in the offense, \u201cthe district court has considerable discretion in making this fact-intensive determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277-78 (11th Cir.2002). Furthermore, \u201c[i]n making the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the sentencing judge has no duty to make any specific subsidiary factual findings.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cSo long as the district court\u2019s decision is supported by the record and the court clearly resolves any disputed factual issues, a simple statement of the district court\u2019s conclusion is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-19\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level decrease to a sentencing calcula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>tion if a defendant was a minor participant in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n.5). Under the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>two-prong test, the district court (1) must compare the defendant\u2019s role in the offense with the relevant conduct for which he has been held accountable; and (2) the court may compare the defendant\u2019s conduct with that of the other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>Bemal-Benitez, </em>594 F.3d at 1320. \u201cThe fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Since Cisneros relies on the fact that he only delivered drugs and money as directed by others, it is noteworthy that in <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>we declined to presume that a drug courier would either always or never qualify for a minor-role reduction, holding instead that a \u201cdistrict court must assess all of the facts probative of the defendant\u2019s role in h[is] relevant conduct in evaluating the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43. Some relevant factual considerations we identified include (1) amount of drugs, (2) fair market value of drugs, (3) amount of money to be paid to the courier, (4) equity interest in the drugs, (5) role in planning the criminal scheme, and (6) role in the distribution. <em>Id. </em>at 945. However, this list is not exhaustive, and, ultimately, the final analysis \u201cfalls within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In this case, the district court did not clearly err in finding that a minor-role reduction was not warranted for Cisneros, who was a participant \u201cinvolved in the loading and unloading of the drugs and money over a lengthy period of time and in many individual transactions.\u201d Cisneros was held accountable for 9 different drug drops/money pick-ups over the course of several months, in which he personally transported 85 kilograms of cocaine and $1.8 million in cash, with another coconspirator transporting an additional $550,000. Cisneros\u2019s active role, as well as the large drug quantity involved, support the district court\u2019s finding that Cisneros was not a minor participant in his relevant conduct, which is a factual finding left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See id. </em>at 943, 945. The court also compared Cisneros to others in the offense, stating that there were participants with a more aggravated role, but finding that the record did not clearly establish that Cisneros was less culpable than most of the other participants. The court further noted that it did not give a minor-role reduction to the truck drivers, and Cisneros\u2019s supervisor, Arias-Reyes, received a sentence enhancement for his supervisory role. Therefore, the court\u2019s denial of the minor-role reduction was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
