Walker challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-13\">\u201cWe review sentencing decisions only for abuse of discretion, and we use a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Alfaro-Moncada, </em>607 F.3d 720, 734 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009)). We first must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error ... [and] then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). Procedural errors include: \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). We look to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to guide our substantive reasonableness review. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-15\">Walker first argues that the district court committed procedural error by failing to acknowledge his request for a noncustodial sentence and neglecting to explain its reasons for imposing Walker\u2019s sentence. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1313 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005)). When the district court imposes a sentence within the guideline range \u201cdoing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court need only make \u201can acknowledgment ... that it has considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. \u201c[N]othing ... requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The district court did not commit procedural error. Before imposing Walker\u2019s within-guideline sentence, the court stated it had considered the guidelines and that Walker\u2019s sentence was \u201can appropriate sentence in this case, complies with the factors that are to be considered as set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and adequately addresses the totality of the circumstances.\u201d Moreover, the district court gave Walker\u2019s counsel an opportunity to argue in support of Walker\u2019s request for a non-custodial sentence. Given that Walker\u2019s counsel reported to the district court that Walker had no technical objections to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) but merely requested a variance based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court\u2019s explanation of Walker\u2019s sentence was sufficient.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Walker next argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the circumstances of his case warranted less severe punishment in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. When reviewing a sentence for substantive reasonableness, we examine the totality of the circumstances and determine whether the sentence achieves the sentencing goals stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Culver, </em>598 F.3d 740, 753 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. We ordinarily expect a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Further, it is within the district court\u2019s discretion to weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and \u201c[w]e will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant [statutory] factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AFs\">Walker\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable. It is at the bottom of the applicable guideline range, which was 70 to 87 months. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. It is also well below the ten-year statutory maximum sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). It was within the district court\u2019s discretion to weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, especially in light of Walker\u2019s criminal history, and select a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range. <em>See Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"Amoz\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-8\">. Walker argues for the first time on appeal that the district court failed to confirm, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(l)(A), that Walker and his counsel had reviewed and discussed the PSR. Rule 32(i)(l)(A) requires the sentencing court to \"verify that the defendant and the defendant\u2019s attorney have read and discussed the presentence report.\u201d The district court did not plainly err in violation of Rule 32. <em>See United States v. Gerrow, </em>232 F.3d 831, 833 (11th Cir.2000) (plain error review applies to arguments raised for the first time on appeal). At the beginning of Walker's sentencing hearing, Walker\u2019s counsel informed the district court that he had filed an objection to the PSR based on \"certain 3553(a) factors that warrant a departure\u201d but reported that he had \"no technical objections to the PSR.\u201d Walker's counsel then described in detail the contents of the PSR and conceded that the guidelines calculation in the PSR was correct. The court noted on the record that the PSR had been considered and accepted. Additionally, Walker does not contend that any changes should have been made to the PSR and therefore cannot show prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
