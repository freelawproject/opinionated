Count One charged him with conspiracy to traffic and use unauthorized access devices, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371,1029(b)(2) and (c); Count Two charged fraud in connection with counterfeit credit cards or access devices, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1029(b)(2) and (c); Count Eight charged aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A. The district court sentenced appellant to concurrent prison terms of 60 months on Count One and 97 months on Count 2 and a consecutive prison term of 24 months on Count Eight. He now appeals his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Appellant argues that the district court erred by imposing a two-level enhancement of his offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10), for \u201c(A) possession or use of any (i) device making equipment\u201d or \u201c(B) production or trafficking of any (i) unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device\u201d because he was also subject to the mandatory 24 months consecutive sentence on Count Eight. He relies on the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.6, which restricts the application of \u201cspecific offense characteristics for the transfer, possession, or use of a means of identification when determining the sentence for the underlying offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.6, comment (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s legal interpretations of the Sentencing Guidelines under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review and we must accept its factual determinations unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Zaldivar, </em>615 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2010) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 959, 178 L.Ed.2d 791 (2011). Because appellant did not object to the district court\u2019s application of the two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10), we review this issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1233, 1238-39 (11th Cir.2009) (applying plain error review to sentencing arguments raised for the first time on appeal), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2361, 176 L.Ed.2d 575 (2010). To succeed on this point, appellant must show (1) an error that (2) is plain, (3) affects substantial rights, and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). An error cannot be deemed plain where \u201cthere is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving\u201d a doubtful question of statutory construction. <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">Appellant cannot establish that the district court plainly erred in its application of the two-level enhancement. We have not yet addressed the scope of the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.6 as applied to the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10) specific offense characteristics. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) states that the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10) enhancement applies under (A)(i) for \u201cpossession or use of any device-making equipment\u201d because the \u201coffense included an encoder\u201d and under (B)(i) for \u201cproduction or trafficking of any (i) unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device\u201d because the \u201cdebit cards in this case were produced with the express intent to defraud.\u201d The limitation on application of specific offense characteristics in the commentary to \u00a7 2B1.6 extends only to \u201ctransfer, possession, or use of a means of identification,\u201d such as a card, code, account number, or PIN. U.S.S.G \u00a7 2B1.6, comment (n.2); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028(d)(7)(D), 1029(e)(1). The offense conduct that triggered the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>enhancement in this case involved both the use of an encoder to produce counterfeit debit cards and the production of debit cards, rather than merely the \u201ctransfer, possession, or use\u201d of those debit cards. Thus, the plain language of the relevant guidelines, commentary, and referenced statutes support the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10) in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AYD\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the factual basis for his plea agreement does not support the enhancement is wholly without merit. He never objected to the factual basis for the enhancement, i.e., use of an encoder and production of debit cards, and he withdrew his objection to his designation as a \u201chandler,\u201d which the PSI described as including the activity of \u201creencoding cards.\u201d <em>See Wade, </em>458 F.3d at 1277 (\u201cfailure to object to allegations of fact in a PSI admits those facts for sentencing purposes\u201d). Although the offense conduct also involved \u201ctransfer, possession or use\u201d of counterfeit debit cards, the district court did not rely on this conduct for application of the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10) two-level increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
