He has suffered pain as a result and underwent surgery again in 2009. Both before and after this surgery, James\u2019s health care providers prescribed Tylenol # 3. According to James, on numerous occasions, various prison personnel delayed providing him Tylenol # 3 or refused to provide it, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Following a hearing pursuant to <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), the magistrate judge, proceeding with consent of both parties, determined that James\u2019s complaint was frivolous and failed to state a claim and dismissed the suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. James now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">We review a dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 1915A de novo. <em>See Longoria v. Dretke, </em>507 F.3d 898, 900 (5th Cir.2007). Our review of the record satisfies us that the magistrate judge correctly dismissed James\u2019s claims that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. <em>See Domino v. Texas. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001). We thus conclude that James\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, and we dismiss it as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. James is cautioned that the dismissal of his suit by the magistrate judge and the dismissal of his appeal count as strikes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). He is further cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). James\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
