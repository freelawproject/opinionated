Kinnard challenges the hypothetical questions posed to the vocational expert. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>Kinnard argues that the hypothetical question was incomplete because the administrative law judge did not mention that the claimant could tolerate frequent exposure to certain environmental conditions, but we disagree. A \u201chypothetical question[ ] adequately accounts] for a claimant\u2019s limitations ... when the question ] otherwise implicitly accounts] for the[ ] limitations.\u201d <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1180 (11th Cir.2011). The administrative law judge instructed the vocational expert that the hypothetical individual had \u201cno significant environmental limitations,\u201d which accounted for the minimal environmental limitations that the administrative law judge included in Kinnard\u2019s residual functional capacity assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Kinnard also argues that the questions posed to the vocational expert did not account for his difficulty in maintaining concentration, persistence, and pace because of his depression and substance abuse, but again we disagree. \u201cConcentration, persistence, or pace refers to the ability to sustain focused attention and concentration sufficiently long to permit the timely and appropriate completion of tasks commonly found in work settings.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, Subpt. P, App. 1. The administrative law judge credited the findings of Steven Kanakis, a consultative psychologist, that Kinnard had logical and coherent thought processes, fair concentration and attention, and of Alfred Jonas, a psychiatrist, that Kinnard could complete and make judgments about simple matters, suffered no more than mild impairments in completing and making judgments about complex matters, and could interact with others and respond appropriately in usual work surroundings. Based on this evidence, the administrative law judge determined that Kinnard had \u201cmild to moderate difficul-</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">ties in concentration, persistence, and pace,\u201d and hypothetical questions asked by the administrative law judge and Kinnard\u2019s attorney accounted for these limitations, <em>see Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1180. The administrative law judge asked the vocational expert to determine what work could be performed by a claimant who was mildly limited in his ability to understand, remember, and execute complex instructions; mildly to moderately limited in his ability to make judgments on complex work-related decisions; mildly limited in his ability to interact appropriately with the public, supervisors, and coworkers; and mildly limited in his ability to respond appropriate to changes in a routine work setting. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(c) (the \u201climited ability to carry out certain mental activities\u201d encompasses \u201climitations in understanding, remembering, and carrying out instructions, and in responding appropriately to supervision, co-workers, and work pressures in a work setting\u201d). Kinnard\u2019s attorney later asked if a marked limitation in executing detailed instructions would eliminate any of the four jobs available to Kinnard, and the vocational expert responded that the limitation would not reduce the availability of the jobs because they were \u201csimple, repetitive, one to three-step jobs.\u201d <em>See Simila v. Astrue, </em>573 F.3d 503, 521-22 (7th Cir.2009) (\u201cclaimants who ... are \u2018mildly to moderately limited in [concentration, persistence, or pace]\u2019 are able to perform \u2018simple and repetitive light work\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Sims v. Barnhart, </em>309 F.3d 424, 431 (7th Cir.2002)). The vocational expert understood and considered all of Kinnard\u2019s limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The denial of Kinnard\u2019s application for benefits is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
