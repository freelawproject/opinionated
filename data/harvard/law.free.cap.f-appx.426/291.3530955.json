He also moves this court for a stay of removal pending the location of a third, safe country of removal. Woldegiorgise makes the following five arguments before this court: (1) that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>2008 conviction no longer qualifies as an aggravated felony due to the suspension of his sentence, (2) that his 2008 conviction is not a crime of violence or domestic violence, (3) that he is eligible for and should be granted asylum, (4) that he should be granted withholding of removal, and (5) that he should be granted relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration under a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496-97 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Osuchukwu v. INS, </em>744 F.2d 1136, 1141 (5th Cir.1984). Under this standard, this court must uphold the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration, even if the court \u201cdeem[s it] in error, so long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so aberrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Osuchukwu, </em>744 F.2d at 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The issues briefed by Woldegiorgise are legal arguments challenging the validity of the underlying removal order. Woldegiorgise\u2019s brief does not identify or analyze any error related to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. Because Woldegiorgise\u2019s attorney-prepared brief does not adequately brief the sole issue before this court, he has abandoned it. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Beasley v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 116, 118 (5th Cir.1986). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED. The motion for a stay of removal is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
