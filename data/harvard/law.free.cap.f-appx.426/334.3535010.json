He argues that the district court erred by determining that he warranted an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a) and by failing to follow the correct procedure when calculating the extent of the departure under \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-21\">Although the district court stated at sentencing that it would impose an \u201cupward departure,\u201d it also stated that it would \u201cimpose a sentence that is above the advisory guideline range,\u201d discussed the various 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors that justified the sentence, and noted that it received guidance from <em>United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, because the district court clarified in the Statement of Reasons that it was imposing a sentence outside the advisory sentencing guidelines system, we review the imposed sentence as a non-guideline sentence. <em>See United States v. Jacobs, </em>635 F.3d 778, 780 n. 1 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-22\">Henley\u2019s arguments specifically regarding the \u00a7 4A1.3(a) departure are not relevant as to the imposed non-guideline sentence. Moreover, our review of the district court\u2019s reasons for applying the variance and determining the extent of the variance show that the imposed sentence was not unreasonable under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>circumstances. <em>See Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
