On appeal, Spates argues that her 66-month sentence is substantively unreasonable, and that the district court should have imposed the 60-month mandatory minimum sentence that she requested. Specifically, Spates argues that the district court failed to give appropriate weight to certain factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), such as her lack of criminal history, minimal participation in the conspiracy, and the fact that she has a child that she will be unable to care for while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">On this record, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion when it sentenced Spates to 66 months imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record indicates that the district court carefully considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors in determining an appropriate sentence for Spates, including her personal characteristics and background, and found that they warranted a 21-month downward variance from Spates\u2019s advisory guidelines range of 87 to 108 months. However, the district court concluded that a sentence above the mandatory minimum of 60 months was appropriate because selling drugs near a playground is a serious offense, and one in which Spates played a substantial role.</p>\n<p id=\"A0qx\">Although Spates disagrees with the weight given by the district court to her personal characteristics and background, we cannot say the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009) (\u201c[A] district court has \u2018considerable discretion\u2019 in deciding whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify a variance and the extent of one that is appropriate.\u201d) (citation omitted). Accordingly, we affirm Spates\u2019s 66-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"ASB\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-8\">.
