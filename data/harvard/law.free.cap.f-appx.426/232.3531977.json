That judgment was rendered pursuant to the court\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law of even date following a bench trial on Picasso\u2019s employment claims. Her action was grounded in allegations that discrimination on the basis of sex, pregnancy, race, and national origin, as well as retaliation, culminated in her being fired from her job at the City\u2019s animal shelter.</p>\n<p id=\"A0V\">We have reviewed the briefs and record excerpts of the parties, including the extensive analysis of the case presented by the parties at the bench trial, as set forth in the district court\u2019s opinion. As a result, we are convinced that the district court correctly disposed of Picasso\u2019s case and committed no reversible error in the course of doing so. Accordingly, the judgement of that court is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"A58\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
