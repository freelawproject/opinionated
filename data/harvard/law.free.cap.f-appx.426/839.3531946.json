He contends that the decision and order should be set aside because the court erred in denying him a face-to-face Collections Due Process (\u201cCDP\u201d) hearing and demonstrated a judicial bias against him as a <em>pro se </em>litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-16\">We review the Tax Court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and review its imposition of sanctions for an abuse of discretion. <em>Roberts v. C.I.R., </em>329 F.3d 1224, 1227, 1229 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-17\">A levy may not be made unless the taxpayer is notified in writing of his right to a CDP hearing. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(a)(1); <em>Redeker-Barry v. United States, </em>476 F.3d 1189, 1190 (11th Cir.2007). If a hearing is requested and the grounds are stated, the IRS Office of Appeals will hold the hearing. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(b)(1). During a CDP hearing, a taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). Relevant issues include: \u201c(i) appropriate spousal defenses; (ii) challenges to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>appropriateness of collection actions; and (iii) offers of collection alternatives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The appeals officer need not consider frivolous arguments, such as positions designated by the IRS as frivolous or arguments reflecting a desire to delay the administration of the tax laws. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 6330(c)(4)(B), 6702(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">A taxpayer should provide the appeals officer with \u201call relevant information requested,\u201d so the officer can consider \u201cthe facts and issues involved in [a CDP] hearing.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6330-l(e)(l). A taxpayer, however, may not challenge the amount or existence of the underlying tax liability unless he \u201cdid not receive any statutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax liability.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Because proceedings before an appeals officer are informal, tax regulations provide that a CDP hearing may, but is not required to, consist of a face-to-face meeting. <em>See Roberts, </em>329 F.3d at 1228-29; <em>see also </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6330-l(d)(2) (A-D6) (\u201cCDP hearings ... are informal in nature and do not require the Appeals officer or employee and the taxpayer, or the taxpayer\u2019s representative, to hold a face-to-face meeting\u201d). A CDP hearing may consist of one or more written or oral communications between an appeals officer and the taxpayer, with or without a face-to-face meeting. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6330-l(d)(2) (A-D6). The formal hearing procedures required under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551, <em>et seq., </em>do not apply to CDP hearings. <em>Id. </em>A face-to-face meeting will not be granted if \u201cthe taxpayer wishes only to raise irrelevant or frivolous issues concerning [the] liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 301.6330-l(d)(2) (A-D8). In addition, a face-to-face meeting regarding a collection alternative will not be granted if the taxpayer is not eligible for an alternative because, for example, he has not filed a required tax return. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">\u201cThe Tax Court may impose sanctions on a taxpayer, if he institutes or maintains proceedings primarily for delay or his position is frivolous or groundless.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>329 F.3d at 1229 (citing 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a)(l)(A)-(B)). We have affirmed sanctions where a taxpayer was \u201con notice that his claims were frivolous.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>329 F.3d at 1229. The Tax Court is empowered to impose sanctions in any amount up to $25,000. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">The record indicates that a notice of deficiency was mailed to Deems\u2019s last known address, but that Deems denied receiving it. If Deems did not receive the notice, he was entitled to challenge his underlying tax liability. Nevertheless, he chose not to do so. Instead, he repeatedly requested a face-to-face hearing, suggesting that the IRS was harassing him in its effort to collect his delinquent 2003 income taxes. Contrary to Deems\u2019s position, Appeals Settlement Officer (\u201cASO\u201d) Rivers was not required to give Deems a face-to-face hearing. <em>See Roberts, </em>329 F.3d at 1228-29; <em>see also </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6330-1(d)(2) (A-D6, A-D8). The record demonstrated that ASO Rivers exchanged at least two written communications with Deems and attempted to contact him by phone, after providing him with notice of the date and time of the phone call. Deems refused to provide ASO Rivers with the requested financial information, and although Deems alleges that he desired to discuss collection alternatives, he did not provide any specific arguments regarding his eligibility for a collection alternative. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6330-l(d)(2) (A-D8).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">Further, at the Tax Court hearing, Deems admitted that he had earned income in 2003 as a carpenter, did not file a tax return in 2003, and had no non-frivo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>lous issues to identify at that time\u2014all of which provided further justification for the denial of a face-to-face hearing. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6330\u20141(d)(2) (A-D6, A-D8). Consequently, the Tax Court did not err in granting the IRS\u2019s motion for summary judgment and determining that collection of the deficiency by levy could proceed; for, Deems failed to present any non-frivolous, relevant issues to be reviewed at an in-person CDP hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">As for the imposition of sanctions, the Tax Court was empowered to impose a penalty on Deems, in any amount up to $25,000, if it found that he raised frivolous or groundless positions or instituted and maintained the proceedings primarily for delay. <em>Roberts, </em>329 F.3d at 1229; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a)(1). In <em>Roberts, </em>we affirmed sanctions where the taxpayer was \u201con notice that his claims were frivolous.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>329 F.3d at 1229. Deems was repeatedly warned about maintaining frivolous arguments; he continued to do so anyway, so the imposition of $1,000 in sanctions was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a)(1)(A); <em>see also Roberts, </em>329 F.3d at 1229 (concluding that a $10,000 penalty was not an abuse of discretion). All of the arguments Deems presented were frivolous; hence, he cannot find refuge in the argument that he was not properly advised about which arguments lacked merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Deems claims that the judge who presided over his ease was biased. He did not present the claim to the judge; thus, we review the question the judge should have recused <em>sua sponte </em>for plain error. <em>See Hamm v. Members of Bd. of Regents of State of Fla., </em>708 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir.1983). To establish plain error, one must show that \u201c(1) an error occurred; (2) the error was plain; (3) it affected [his] substantial rights; and (4) it seriously affected the fairness of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>627 F.3d at 1380 (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AYA\">\u201cAny justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify [herself] in any proceeding in which [her] impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). A judge is also required to disqualify herself if she has a personal bias or prejudice against a party or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts in the proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(b)(1). The standard under \u00a7 455 is objective and \u201crequires the court to ask whether an objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2000) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Aja\">The allegation of bias must show that \u201cthe bias is personal as distinguished from judicial in nature.\u201d <em>Bolin, </em>225 F.3d at 1239 (citation and quotation omitted). That is, the bias \u201cmust stem from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from [her] participation in the case.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Joint Legis. Comm, on Performance and Expenditure Review of the State of Miss., </em>637 F.2d 1014, 1020 (5th Cir.1981) (citation and quotation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While a \u201cjudge\u2019s remarks in a judicial context [can] demonstrate such pervasive bias and prejudice that it constitutes bias against a party,\u201d rulings that are adverse to a party do not. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number><em>Hamm, </em>708 F.2d at 651 (citation omitted). Disqualification \u201cordinarily may not be predicated on the judge\u2019s rulings in the instant case or in related cases.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>637 F.2d at 1020 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">With regard to bias, Deems\u2019s arguments are meritless. The purported bias stem from comments the judge made at Deems\u2019s hearing and in the orders granting summary judgment and imposing sanctions, not from any alleged personal interest in the resolution of Deems\u2019s case. The judge made no remarks in a judicial context that demonstrated a pervasive bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Contrary to Deems\u2019s argument, the judge\u2019s remarks concerning the origin of the materials relied upon did not demonstrate a pervasive bias against <em>pro se </em>litigants. The remarks simply commented on the origin of frivolous arguments the court had witnessed. Furthermore, the court\u2019s determination that Deems had instituted the proceeding primarily for delay did not demonstrate pervasive bias, as that determination was necessary to rule on the IRS\u2019s motion for sanctions. Rulings adverse to a party do not constitute pervasive bias. <em>Hamm, </em>708 F.2d at 651 (citation omitted). In sum, the Tax Court exhibited no extrajudicial bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">We accordingly affirm the court\u2019s summary judgment and imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-7\">.
