Umondak alleged in his complaint that, while housed at the Byrd Unit as a transient prisoner, he was denied out-of-cell recreation, contrary to Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) policy. He claimed violations of: his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment; and his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-19\">The dismissal of Umondak\u2019s claims, as both frivolous and for failure to state a claim, is reviewed <em>de novo. Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 678 (5th Cir.2009). In reviewing whether the complaint fails to state a claim, the dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is reviewed under the same standard for reviewing a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Id. </em>at 678. \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.... \u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (citations omitted). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Alternatively, a dismissal of a complaint as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) will be upheld if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Samford, </em>562 F.3d at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Umondak contends the TDCJ\u2019s out-of-cell recreation policy creates a protected liberty interest in such exercise; he maintains the denial of such exercise without notice and a hearing violated his due-process rights. Umondak\u2019s claim, which involves an alleged deprivation of out-of-cell recreation for approximately 25 days, fails to state a due-process violation. <em>See Madison v. Parker, </em>104 F.3d 765, 767-68 (5th Cir.1997) (changes in conditions or quality of confinement do not implicate due-process concerns).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">For his Eighth Amendment claim, Umondak contends the denial of out-of-cell exercise for 25 days while he was at the Byrd Unit violated his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. As stated in an attachment to the complaint, Byrd Unit policy is that transient-status prisoners are not permitted out of their cells for recreation. \u201c \u2018Prison administrators are to be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.\u2019 \u201d <em>Block v. Rutherford, </em>468 U.S. 576, 585, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984) (quoting <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 547, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Furthermore, to establish an Eighth Amendment violation for conditions of confinement, a prisoner must show that the alleged violation was sufficiently serious\u2014 it deprived him of the minimal level of life\u2019s necessities\u2014and that prison officials acted with deliberate indifference to his health or safety. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). \u201cTo establish deliberate indifference in the context of the Eighth Amendment, the prisoner must show that the defendant ] (1) w[as] aware of facts from which an inference of an excessive risk to the prisoner\u2019s health or safety could be drawn and (2) that [he] actually drew an inference that such potential for harm existed.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Puckett, </em>157 F.3d 1022, 1025 (5th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970). Umondak has not alleged that defendant was aware of an \u201cexcessive risk\u201d to Umondak\u2019s health or safety or knew a potential for harm existed and acted with deliberate indifference to it. Accordingly, the allegations in Umondak\u2019s complaint are insufficient to state a claim that is plausible on its face. <em>See Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949; <em>Samford, </em>562 F.3d at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac2\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
