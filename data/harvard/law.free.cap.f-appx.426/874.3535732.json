Specifically, he contends that the evidence the government submitted in support of the increase was not sufficiently reliable. First; he asserts that the government presented almost no physical evidence to corroborate a co-offender\u2019s statement that Ramos-Colin paid him to smuggle a total of 40 aliens. Second, Ramos-Colin argues that his own incriminating statements were too imprecise to be considered for purposes of the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Lopez-Garcia, </em>565 F.3d 1306, 1323 (11th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1012, 175 L.Ed.2d 620 (2009). \u201cFor a factual finding to be clearly erroneous, this court, after reviewing all of the evidence, must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). Credibility determinations are factual findings within the province of the district court. <em>United States v. Villarreal, </em>613 F.3d 1344, 1349 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">When the defendant has objected to the facts contained in the PSI, as Ramos-Colin has, it is the government\u2019s burden to prove the disputed facts by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2009). A sentencing court may consider relevant information \u201cwithout regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a); <em>see also United States v. Bernardine, </em>73 F.3d 1078, 1080-81 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">Under the Guidelines, a defendant is subject to a six-level increase if his offense involved the smuggling, transporting, or harboring of at least 25, but not more than 99, unlawful aliens. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(2)(B). As with all level-increase provisions, a defendant may be subject to this increase on the basis of \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts ... in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). Thus, \u201c[i]f a defendant is aware of the scope of a conspiracy outside of his individual actions, he may be held accountable for actions by co-conspirators even though he was not personally involved.\u201d <em>United States v. De La Cruz Suarez, </em>601 F.3d 1202, 1221 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 393, 178 L.Ed.2d 157 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. In the instant case, the government submitted sufficiently reliable evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that Ramos-Colin\u2019s offense conduct involved at least 25 unlawful aliens. First, according to the trial testimony of an agent with Immigration Customs and Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), Ramos-Colin admitted that there were as many as 30 unlawful aliens waiting to be transported from the stash house he worked out of \u201cat any given time.\u201d Second, a co-offender reported to a United States Border Patrol agent that Ramos-Colin had paid him to transport 40 unlawful aliens. Notably, the co-offender\u2019s overall account of his relationship to Ramos-Colin was substantially corroborated by other evidence, including Ramos-Colin\u2019s own testimony that he had made several payments to the co-offender as a fee for transporting aliens. Ramos-Colin\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>trary assertions, that the government did not meet its burden because it lacked physical evidence to corroborate the co-offender\u2019s statement, and that his own incriminating statements were too imprecise, are not persuasive. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Ramos-Colin\u2019s conduct involved at least 25 unlawful aliens and applying a six-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
