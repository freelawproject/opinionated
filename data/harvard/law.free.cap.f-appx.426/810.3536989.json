He argues that the magistrate judge committed plain error by participating impermissibly in his plea discussions with the government. The government concedes the error and suggests that we instruct the district court to reassign the case on remand. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate Shaw\u2019s conviction and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">In 2006, a federal grand jury indicted Shaw on three counts: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and at least 50 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(iii), (b)(1)(C), 846, 851; (2) possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1); and (3) possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">On September 17, 2009, Magistrate Judge Christopher Hagy convened a suppression hearing. During the hearing, defense counsel Thomas Hawker noted that the parties\u2019 \u201cdifficult\u201d plea negotiations were not yet resolved, but they had reached a point where Shaw wanted to take a plea, so he wished to postpone the instant hearing until September 29th. The prosecutor, Matthew Jackson, stated that the government was not ready to proceed with the suppression hearing, and he set forth the following time line of the plea negotiations. The hearing originally had been scheduled for August 24th, but counsel contacted him that day to state that Shaw was willing to enter into a binding plea. Accordingly, the court had postponed the suppression hearing to September 4th. During the last week of August, Jackson offered defense counsel a binding plea agreement for a 15-year sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) charge. Jackson noted to the court that Shaw was eligible for two \u00a7 851 enhancements on the drug charge, so if he were convicted at trial, he would face a mandatory-minimum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Jackson further stated that, on August 31st, counsel informed him that Shaw would plead to the \u00a7 924(c) charge in exchange for a 15-year sentence and dismissal of the other charges. Later that day, though, Jackson was told that Shaw had changed his mind and wished to plead to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment on the drug charge, instead. Because everyone believed that a plea ultimately would be entered, the hearing was postponed again to September 17th. On September 11th, Jackson offered defense counsel a binding plea agreement for 15 years\u2019 imprisonment for the drug charge. Counsel said that Shaw would accept the plea, and that the instant suppression hearing would be unnecessary. On September 15th, Jackson sent the plea agreement to counsel. The next morning, counsel informed Jackson that Shaw had changed his mind and would go forward with the suppression hearing unless the government agreed to a sentence of less than 12 years\u2019 imprisonment on one of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Jackson added that Hawker had asked that morning for a 12.5-year sentence, which the government found unacceptable. Jackson said that, if Shaw went forward with the suppression hearing, he would file the \u00a7 851 notice seeking the mandatory-minimum life sentence. He also characterized Shaw\u2019s negotiations as \u201cgames\u201d and an attempt to \u201cplay the government,\u201d and indicated that, if Shaw did not plead by 5:00 p.m. the next day, September 18th, the government would make no further offers and would pursue both the \u00a7 851 enhancements and a possible superseding indictment containing easier-to-prove substantive drug charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Jackson expressed concern that Shaw would agree to take the 15-year deal, then back out on the night before the rescheduled suppression hearing. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to necessarily resolve this and hopefully Your Honor has a better idea, because I can\u2019t think of one.\u201d The following exchange then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-10\">THE COURT: Well, maybe we ought to\u2014I mean first, he\u2019s got the right to negotiate just to find out how far he can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>bring you down. I think he\u2019s reached bottom at 15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-5\">MR. JACKSON: He has.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-6\">THE COURT: I know with me, I\u2019m not going to continue this thing anymore. We\u2019ve got to move this thing forward and let the chips fall where they may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-7\">And I think he knows that. But you can\u2019t blame anybody for trying to negotiate. I know you are not trying to blame, but the point is we have been at it for six months. It\u2019s making the case difficult, it\u2019s backing up everybody\u2019s dockets, and it\u2019s time to fish or cut bait.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-8\">Either take 15 years or take what you get if you are found guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-9\">MR. JACKSON: I agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-10\">... [W]hat we could do is say we need to have a plea before Judge Story on or before September ... 29th. If it falls through, then we can have our suppression hearing ... either later that week or the following Monday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-11\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">Judge Hagy rescheduled the hearing and addressed Shaw:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-13\">All right. We will schedule it on October the 7th at 9:00 a.m. and we are going forward. No more\u2014I don\u2019t care whether you are discussing a plea or not. We are going to go forward and get this thing moving and let the chips fall where they may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-14\">Again, Mr. Shaw, you are entitled to negotiate. I don\u2019t hold that against you. But I\u2019ve got to move the docket and we\u2019ve got to let things happen. And it seems to me, you know, if you are fishing and you are testing for the bottom with a sinker, I think you\u2019ve hit bottom. They are not going to go any further than that. And it sounds like they are going to ask for more if you don\u2019t go there. So that\u2019s the choice in front of you and we\u2019ll just go ahead on that basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-16\">So is it your intent to indicate before me today that the defendant is willing to enter a plea of guilty to the drug charge or the [\u00a7 ] 924(c) [charge]?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-17\">Hawker and Jackson confirmed the offer for a 15-year sentence for conspiracy to distribute powder cocaine. Hawker stated that he and Shaw had talked about the written plea agreement over the phone, had reviewed it briefly that morning, and had discussed the previous version in detail. The exchange continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-18\">THE COURT: Does Mr. Shaw intend, then, to plead guilty to the charge of Count One limited to powder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-19\">MR. HAWKER: Limited to powder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-20\">THE COURT: And to a 15-year sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-21\">MR. HAWKER: That is my understanding of his intent as we sit here today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-22\">Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-23\">THE COURT: Is that your intent, Mr. Shaw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-24\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-25\">THE COURT: Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-26\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-27\">THE COURT: Okay. Has anybody\u2014 is that voluntary? Has anybody forced you or coerced you or is this a decision you have reached after discussing it with counsel of your own free will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-28\">THE DEFENDANT: Well, really, Your Honor, my back is kind of against the wall, I mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-29\">THE COURT: Well, I mean other than that. I know your back is against the wall. I mean you\u2019ve got to know your options and they need to tell you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>your options. And your options would be you could get not guilty if everything went\u2014or you could get 15 years or you could get life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-4\">THE DEFENDANT: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-5\">THE COURT: And your counsel knows what the evidence is against you and what\u2019s likely and so they could pretty much tell you what the likely result is and then you just have to make a judgment. And you have made a judgment that you would accept a 15-year sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-6\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-7\">THE COURT: And you are going to plead guilty on that basis; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-9\">THE COURT: All right. Well, that would be in front of Judge Story and we\u2019ll try to get it. I\u2019ll give him a call ... and see if I can get him to get you on the calendar quickly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">After confirming the new date of the hearing and reviewing which motions would be addressed, Judge Hagy said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-11\">Mr. Shaw, I know you\u2019ve got not great choices, but sometimes we\u2019ve got to make hard choices. And you\u2019ve had good counsel and we\u2019ve been at it a long time. So it sounds to me like a reasoned decision and one that\u2019s supported by common sense and judgment and so the record reflects the guilty plea will have to be redone in front of Judge Story.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">Later that day, the parties appeared before District Judge Richard Story for a change-of-plea hearing. During the colloquy, Judge Story asked, \u201cAside from the plea agreement, has anyone threatened or forced you to plead guilty or told you that if you do not plead guilty, further charges are going to be brought against you or any other adverse action taken against you?\u201d Shaw replied, \u201cNo, other than I\u2019m going to get a life sentence if I go to trial and be found guilty. I mean, that right there is about the only thing really pressuring me into taking this plea today.\u201d Judge Story said, \u201cI understand. You\u2019ve looked at what the potential possibilities are if you went to trial and were convicted, the sentence you might face; and that\u2019s what\u2019s caused you to decide to accept this agreement. Is that fair?\u201d Shaw answered, \u201cThat\u2019s part of it, yeah, uh-huh.\u201d He indicated that, otherwise, no threats had been made against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">During a discussion about the possibility of credit for time served, Shaw said to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-15\">What I was saying is that, you know, I\u2019ve been locked up for three years for something that I didn\u2019t do, a crime that I didn\u2019t commit. And it\u2019s been a hard three years on me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-16\">Mr. Jackson was\u2014stated to Judge Hagy that I was playing the games about taking a plea. It\u2019s never been that. It\u2019s that ... if you give me 15 years, then, okay, I\u2019ll take the 15 years. But if you\u2019re not giving me [credit] for the [time] I\u2019ve been locked up, it\u2019s like I\u2019m getting 18 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-17\">The court stated that it would review the matter before sentencing. After Jackson recited the factual basis for the plea, Shaw stated that he admitted to possessing powder cocaine that he planned to distribute, but not that he conspired with others. Judge Story reiterated that Shaw was charged with a conspiracy, which required him to have been working with someone else in possessing the cocaine with intent to distribute. Shaw then confirmed that he worked with others in order to accomplish the cocaine possession. During discussion of the sentence appeal waiver in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>the plea agreement, Jackson reiterated that the plea agreement would be void and the parties would <em>\u201cgo </em>back to square one\u201d if Shaw were to receive other than a 15-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Judge Story accepted Shaw\u2019s plea and adjudged him guilty. At the sentencing hearing in February 2010, he stated that his intention was to impose a 180-month sentence, but because Shaw had already been detained for 40 months, he ordered Shaw to serve 140 months\u2019 imprisonment with no additional credit for time served. Judge Story further indicated that he had received several communications from Shaw over the previous few months in which Shaw expressed reservations about the plea. He asked whether Shaw wanted to raise any of those concerns before the sentence was imposed, but Shaw said that he did not. Accordingly, the court imposed the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Where, as here, the defendant did not raise any objections related to his guilty plea, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mosley, </em>173 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1999). A guilty plea must be free from coercion. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(2). Accordingly, while the government and the defense may discuss and reach a plea agreement, \u201c[t]he court must not participate in these discussions.\u201d Rule 11(c)(1). Rule 11(c)(1) is \u201can absolute prohibition on all forms of judicial participation in or interference with the plea negotiation process.\u201d <em>United States v. Corbitt, </em>996 F.2d 1132, 1134 (11th Cir.1993) (discussing the former Rule 11(e)(1), which was renumbered in 2002 without relevant textual changes). Judicial participation in plea discussions is plain error, and a defendant who has pled guilty after a judge participated in the discussions should be allowed to replead without showing actual prejudice. <em>Id. </em>Even where \u201cit is clear that the ... judge ... was motivated primarily by the concern that [the defendant] be thoroughly apprised of the situation that he faced, Rule 11[ (c)(1) ] requires that this concern, however well-intentioned, be addressed by someone other than the judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Casallas, </em>59 F.3d 1173, 1178 (11th Cir.1995). Where the judge does \u201cnothing flagrant,\u201d but merely indicates that the defendant is likely to receive a heavy sentence and should think carefully about the prosecution\u2019s offer, the comments still violate Rule 11(c)(1) and the conviction must be reversed. <em>Corbitt, </em>996 F.2d at 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Here, Judge Hagy explicitly told Shaw that he had to choose between the government\u2019s 15-year offer and the possibility of a life sentence. He also emphasized the government\u2019s suggestion that additional charges would be brought against Shaw if Shaw refused the offer. He told the parties that he would not accept any further delays in the proceedings, he asked whether Shaw would commit at that time to entering a guilty plea, and he offered to call Judge Story in order to expedite the change-of-plea hearing. Shaw agreed to plead on the ground that his \u201cback [was] against the wall.\u201d Furthermore, when he pled guilty before Judge Story a few hours later, he made comments suggesting that his decision was directly influenced by the events in Judge Hagy\u2019s courtroom, and he appears to have contacted Judge Story between the change-of-plea hearing and the sentencing hearing expressing reservations about the plea. Judge Hagy\u2019s comments plainly were improper, and, thus, Shaw\u2019s conviction must be vacated. <em>Corbitt, </em>996 F.2d at 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">A case such as this requires reassignment to another judge on remand, even if there is no evidence that the judge is vindictive or biased. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>we instruct the district court to reassign Shaw\u2019s case to different district and magistrate judges on remand. In doing so, we do not suggest that Judge Hagy\u2019s comments were other than well-intentioned, and we have no reason to believe that Judge Story was aware of the events that took place in Judge Hagy\u2019s courtroom. Reassignment of the ease is merely intended to \u201cextend the prophylactic scheme,\u201d ensure a clean proceeding, and avoid any possible misimpression created by the judges\u2019 continued participation in the case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate Shaw\u2019s conviction and remand for further proceedings, with instructions to reassign the case to different magistrate and district judges on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
