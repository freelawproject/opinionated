Where, as here, the defendant objects to a sentencing enhancement in the district court, this court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>445 F.3d 815, 817 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-22\">Green\u2019s contention that the teller was not abducted because she was not isolated and because she was moved within the same room is without merit. The facts in the presentence report and the exhibits introduced at sentencing provide evidence that the teller was moved from her teller station to the bank\u2019s vault, so that the conspirator could rob the vault, which was located in a separate area, down a hallway, and around the corner from the teller area. Additionally, the vault was located behind the teller area and out of public view. Thereafter, the teller was moved from the vault area to the back door of the bank so that Green and the conspirator could escape. There was therefore no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Green\u2019s conspirator abducted the bank teller. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>619 F.3d 469, 474 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-23\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b270-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
