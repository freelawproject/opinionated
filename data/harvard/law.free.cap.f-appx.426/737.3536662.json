Ramirez-Hernandez argues that his prior conviction for statutory rape did not qualify as a crime of violence and his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">The district court correctly determined that Ramirez-Hernandez\u2019s prior conviction in a Georgia court for statutory rape constituted a crime of violence. A defendant is subject to a 16-point increase in his offense level if he previously has been deported after being convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2009). \u201cStatutory rape\u201d is considered a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under section 2L1.2, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iii), and Ramirez-Hernandez admitted at sentencing that his prior conviction was equivalent to the generic offense listed in the Guidelines. Ramirez-Hernandez argues that his crime did not involve the type of physical force required to qualify as a crime of violence, but \u201c[i]t is well settled that a felony conviction for an enumerated offense qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under \u00a7 2L1.2, whether or not the use of physical force is an element of the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1327 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 722 (Enumerated offenses \u201care always classified as \u2018crimes of violence,\u2019 regardless of whether the prior offense expressly has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-18\">Ramirez-Hernandez\u2019s sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. The district court correctly calculated Ramirez-Hernandez\u2019s advisory guideline range and imposed a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range after considering the \u201cpresentence report which contains the advisory guidelines[ ] and the statutory factors.\u201d Ramirez-Hernandez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>argues that the district court failed to take into account his \u201cown unique circumstances,\u201d but the district court stated that it had considered Ramirez-Hernandez\u2019s \u201cstatements\u201d in fashioning an appropriate sentence. The district court reasonably determined that a sentence of 70 months of imprisonment was required to punish Ramirez-Hernandez for reentering the United States illegally and to deter similar future conduct. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Ramirez-Hernandez\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
