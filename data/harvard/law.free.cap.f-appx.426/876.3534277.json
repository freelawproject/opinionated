Pugh argues that the Government did not meet its burden under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3600(a)(4) to show that the evidence he sought to have tested was destroyed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-20\">We review both criminal and civil motions to reconsider under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Simms, </em>385 F.3d 1347, 1356 (11th Cir.2004) (criminal); <em>Cliff v. Payco Gen. Am. Credits, Inc., </em>363 F.3d 1113, 1121 (11th Cir.2004) (civil). The interpretation of a statute is a question of law which we review <em>de novo, </em>and the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Simmons, </em>368 F.3d 1335, 1338 (11th Cir.2004) (interpreting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3600, \u201can individual under a sentence of imprisonment\u201d may-file a written motion for the DNA testing of specific evidence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3600(a). The district court may order this testing if it finds that ten conditions apply. <em>Id. </em>The only condition at issue in this case is \u00a7 3600(a)(4), which states:,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-5\">The specific evidence to be tested is in the possession of the [g]overnment and has been subject to a chain of custody and retained under conditions sufficient to ensure that such evidence has not been substituted, contaminated, tampered with, replaced, or altered in any respect material to the proposed DNA testing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">\u00a7 3600(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(e)(2)(B) provides that, \u201cIf anything material to either party is omitted from or misstated in the record by error or accident, the omission or misstatement may be corrected and a supplemental record may be certified and forwarded ... by the district court before or after the record has been forwarded.\u201d We can affirm a summary judgment on grounds other than those relied upon by the district court. <em>Edwards v. Niagara Credit Solutions, Inc., </em>584 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Here, the district court clearly erred in adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s factual finding that the government showed that the evidence Pugh sought to have tested was destroyed. The Government offered no evidence before the district court in support of this assertion. However, since that time, the Government has moved to supplement the record on appeal and submitted the evidence log of the Escambia County Sheriffs Office. The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion and we note that the record log shows that items 7 and 8, hand made masks, have been destroyed. To the extent that Pugh argues the Government violated the strictures of \u00a7 3600 when it destroyed the evidence, we reject that argument because the Sheriffs Office destroyed the evidence before \u00a7 3600 became law and thus it was not bound by any of \u00a7 3600\u2019s preservation mandates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because there is no evidence to submit to testing, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"AL9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-14\">. We reject the Government's argument that Pugh\u2019s appeal was untimely. In a civil case where the United States is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed within 60 days of the date the order appealed from is entered on the docket. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1)(B). Post-conviction proceedings are considered \"civil in nature,\u201d and, therefore, they are subject to this 60-day appeals period rather than the 14-day period of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(l)(A)(i). <em>See Barbour v. Haley, </em>471 F.3d 1222, 1231 (11th Cir.2006). Further, a notice of appeal filed by a <em>pro se </em>prisoner is deemed filed on the date the prisoner delivers it to prison authorities or places it in the prison mail system. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App.P. 4(c)(1); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 275-76, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). Absent contrary evidence, we will assume that a prisoner's filing \"was delivered to prison authorities the day he signed it.\u201d <em>Washington v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 1299, 1301 (11th Cir.2001). Pugh delivered his notice of appeal to prison authorities 26 days after the district court\u2019s opinion was issued, falling safely within the 60 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-9\">.
