Jiang asserts three issues on appeal, which we address in turn. After review, we deny Jiang\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b731-20\">Jiang filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal based on his political opinion on March 14, 2005. On May 1, 2006, an IJ in New York found that Jiang had not established that he applied for asylum within one year of entering the United States, and pretermitted his application for asylum. However, because Jiang established that his wife was forcibly sterilized, the New York IJ concluded he was entitled to withholding of removal under <em>In re C-Y-Z-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 915 (BIA 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-21\">Jiang appealed to the BIA the New York IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility finding, as well as the IJ\u2019s alleged failure to consider all of the evidence or to give him an opportunity to explain any inconsistencies. The BIA remanded to the Immigration Court for a new hearing before a different IJ \u201csolely for a determination of [Jiang\u2019s] eligibility for ... asylum.\u201d An IJ granted Jiang\u2019s motion for a change of venue, and transferred his removal proceedings to the Immigration Court in Orlando, Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-22\">At the beginning of the removal proceedings in Orlando on April 29, 2009, the IJ stated \u201c[s]o we all agree that the respondent already has been granted withholding, so now the only issue is can he increase that to asylum.\u201d The IJ rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>an oral decision denying Jiang\u2019s application for asylum. The IJ found that Jiang was not credible based on inconsistencies between his 2006 testimony in New York and the testimony adduced in the April 29, 2009, proceeding. The IJ further explained that, even if Jiang were credible, he would deny the application because Jiang did not establish his eligibility for asylum. Although the IJ denied Jiang\u2019s application for asylum, he refused to disturb the New York IJ\u2019s grant of withholding of removal because the BIA\u2019s remand order directed him only to determine whether Jiang was eligible for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The Government appealed the IJ\u2019s refusal to terminate the New York IJ\u2019s grant of withholding of removal. The Government asserted that when the New York IJ decided Jiang\u2019s application in 2006, the BIA interpreted the INA as providing <em>per se </em>refugee status to the spouse of a person who had been forcibly sterilized. Subsequently, in 2008, the Attorney General overruled the BIA\u2019s interpretation and established that the spouse of a person who had been forcibly sterilized was not automatically eligible for refugee status. The Government asserted that Jiang\u2019s new and inconsistent testimony \u201creopened\u201d his case, giving the IJ authority to reconsider the previous grant of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In his response, Jiang stated he was appealing the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for asylum, and that the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility finding was clearly erroneous. He further asserted that substantial evidence did not support the IJ\u2019s finding that he had not established past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Finally, Jiang contended the BIA had qualified and limited its remand to the IJ solely to the issue of his eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag9\">The BIA dismissed Jiang\u2019s appeal, sustained the Government\u2019s appeal, terminated Jiang\u2019s grant of withholding of removal, and ordered him removed. The BIA concluded the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not clearly erroneous because the finding was based on discrepancies between his 2009 and 2006 testimony. Further, even if Jiang\u2019s testimony was credible, to the extent that his asylum claim was based on the forced sterilization of his wife, such a claim was foreclosed by the Attorney General\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of J-S- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 520 (A.G.2008). The BIA then concluded the New York IJ\u2019s grant of withholding of removal was not a final disposition of Jiang\u2019s case because he was never ordered removed. Because <em>Matter of J-S- </em>provided its holding was to be applied to all non-final cases, the BIA was obliged to apply <em>Matter of J-S- </em>and to vacate Jiang\u2019s grant of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AdhG\">\n<em>A. Adverse credibility determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AXV\">Jiang first contends the BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility finding<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was clearly erroneous. \u201cWe review administrative fact findings, including credibility determinations, under the highly deferential substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Todorovic v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>621 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2010) (quotations omitted). Accordingly, \u201cwe view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1324 (quotations omitted). We, therefore, \u201cwill reverse the agency\u2019s findings only if the evidence compels a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>able fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The REAL ID Act of 2005 provides that an adverse-credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies that do not go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Because Jiang\u2019s application was filed before these amendments became effective on May 11, 2005, they do not apply to his claims. <em>See Shkambi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>584 F.3d 1041, 1049 n. 7 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">As in <em>Shkambi, </em>we need not resolve \u201cwhether adverse credibility determinations in pre-REAL ID Act cases must be based on inconsistencies that go to the heart of the claim because the inconsistencies identified by the IJ and the BIA in this case relate directly to [Jiang\u2019s] claims of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Inconsistencies between Jiang\u2019s 2006 account of how and when he arranged to leave China and his 2009 version of those events relate directly to his claim of past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution. Jiang\u2019s most recent claims of persecution are premised on his fear that a loanshark will report him to the Chinese government, and that he will be arrested, imprisoned, beaten, and fined as a consequences of the loanshark\u2019s actions. In his earlier testimony, however, Jiang explicitly denied procuring funds from a loanshark to finance his hasty departure. Thus, the issue of whether Jiang actually owes money to a loanshark relates directly to his claim of a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility determination. Contrary to Jiang\u2019s contention, his 2009 testimony-that he traveled from Mexico to California by boat, that his neighbor helped him locate a \u201csnakehead,\u201d and that he boarded a boat for Mexico the same day that the snakehead contacted him-flatly contradicted and undermined his 2006 testimony-that he ventured into California in the trunk of a car, that he found a snake-head through his aunt, and that he left China eight days after contacting the snakehead. Substantial evidence in the form of numerous and blatant omissions and inconsistencies between Jiang\u2019s 2006 and 2009 testimony supported the BIA\u2019s credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">\n<em>B. Past Persecution or Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">Jiang next contends he demonstrated past persecution because the Chinese government fined him for violating its family-planning law. He further asserts he established a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his fear of being fined, imprisoned, and beaten should he return to China.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">We review the BIA\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>while reviewing findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). The government has the discretion to grant asylum to any alien meeting the definition of a \u201crefugee\u201d contained in the INA. <em>See id. </em>at 1351. The statute defines a refugee as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-15\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The burden of proof is on the applicant to establish his status as a refugee. <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351. \u201cTo establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that he was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration omitted). The potential for prosecution and punishment in the form of, <em>inter alia, </em>heavy fines, torture, and imprisonment for leaving a country illegally is not a statutorily protected ground entitling an alien to asylum. <em>Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1310, 1316-17 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">We have concluded that persecution \u201cis an extreme concept,\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir.2006), and the fact government officials have fined an applicant and attempted to arrest him is insufficient to establish persecution. <em>Yu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1328, 1334 (11th Cir.2009). The BIA also has concluded that economic hardship must be extreme in order to amount to persecution, and, thus, \u201c[g]overnment sanctions that reduce an applicant to an impoverished existence may amount to persecution.\u201d <em>In re T-Z, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 163, 174 (BIA 2007); <em>cf. Barreto-Claro v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>275 F.3d 1334, 1340 (11th Cir.2001) (providing \u201cemployment discrimination which stops short of depriving an individual of a means of earning a living does not constitute persecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A6j\">To establish a well-founded fear of future persecution an applicant must establish \u201ca fear of persecution in his country of nationality on account of a protected ground, a \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 of suffering persecution if he returns to that country, and that he is unable or unwilling to return because of his fear.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1352 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i)). We have rejected an applicant\u2019s claim that his wife\u2019s abortion and sterilization and his payment of a fine established a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Yu, </em>568 F.3d at 1334.</p>\n<p id=\"AUa0\">As discussed above, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility determination. Nevertheless, even if the BIA had found Jiang\u2019s testimony to be credible, Jiang still would have failed to establish his eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. To the extent Jiang\u2019s claim is premised on the fact that he paid a fine in the past, he has failed to establish eligibility for asylum because being fined is insufficient to establish persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"Apd\">Further, we have previously rejected the argument that an applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s sterilization and his payment of a fine establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. Jiang also has failed to demonstrate that any future fine would reduce him to an impoverished existence because the record is devoid of evidence of his financial situation. Accordingly, Jiang has failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Having failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, it follows that Jiang also was ineligible for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>\n<em>C. Termination of Withholding of Removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Finally, Jiang contends the BIA erred in terminating his grant of withholding of removal. He maintains the parties stipulated before the second IJ that the first IJ\u2019s grant of withholding of removal was not to be disturbed on remand. He also asserts the BIA mistakenly believed that the change in the law wrought by <em>Matter of J-S- </em>occurred subsequent to the hearing before the second IJ. Jiang summarily concludes that it was fundamentally unfair for the BIA to overturn its prior decision, in which it instructed the second IJ to consider only the asylum issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The INA provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">[f]or purposes of determinations under this chapter, a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). The BIA originally interpreted this provision as providing an applicant \u201celigibility for asylum by virtue of his wife\u2019s forced sterilization.\u201d <em>In re C-Y-Z-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 918, <em>overruled by Matter of J-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 521. However, as we explained in <em>Yu, </em>\u201c[i]n 2008, the Attorney General overruled the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B) in <em>C-Y-Z- </em>... to the extent th[at] case[ ] established automatic spousal eligibility.\u201d <em>Yu, </em>568 F.3d at 1331. We agreed \u201cthat \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B) does not confer automatic refugee status on an individual merely because his or her spouse (or unmarried partner) underwent ... sterilization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1332. Accordingly, we held that \u201cpersecution, or the fear thereof, must be personally endured by the applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">In <em>Yu, </em>we further held the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B) did not change the law, but rather explained \u201cwhat the law had always meant\u201d because it simply \u201cclarified the correct interpretation of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and emphasis omitted). Thus, application of the Attorney General\u2019s decision to an open case pending on direct review was not an impermissible retroactive application of a new law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\"> First, contrary to Jiang\u2019s argument, the BIA accurately stated that <em>Matter of J-S- </em>was decided after the first IJ issued his order. Next, to the extent Jiang relies on an alleged stipulation regarding the grant of withholding of removal, Jiang appeals to misconstrue the record. Further, Jiang fails to argue the BIA erroneously interpreted the law when it concluded the New York IJ\u2019s grant of withholding of removal was not a final order in his case and that <em>Matter of J-S-</em>was therefore fully applicable to his case. Instead, Jiang concludes his argument with a perfunctory statement the BIA\u2019s termination of his grant of withholding of removal was unfair. Jiang\u2019s unelaborated contention is devoid of citations to statutory or case law, the Due Process Clause or due process jurisprudence, or to the record. It is therefore insufficient to raise a due process challenge to the BIA\u2019s action. <em>See Lapaix, </em>605 F.3d at 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility finding. Substantial evidence also supports that Jiang did not demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Further, the BIA did not err in terminating Jiang\u2019s grant of withholding of removal. Thus, we deny Jiang\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\">. Where, as here, the BIA issues its own opinion, we review only that opinion, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ's reasoning. <em>Todorovic v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>621 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\">. Jiang also states in two places, without elaboration, that he established \"other resistance\u201d to China\u2019s family-planning policy. Because \u201d[p]assing reference to issues are insufficient to raise a claim for appeal,\u201d <em>Lapaix v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1145 (11th Cir.2010), Jiang has not properly raised his \"other resistance\u201d claim on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b734-6\">. To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an applicant must show that, if returned to his country, it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). \"Where an applicant is unable to meet the well-founded fear standard of asylum, he is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of removal.\" <em>Kazem</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number><em>zadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1352 (quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
