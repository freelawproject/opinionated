Nance generally argues on appeal that the district court had jurisdiction to direct the government to file a substantial-assistance motion because (1) the government\u2019s refusal was premised on an unconstitutional motive, in that both his attorney and the government failed to detail the extent of his cooperation during sentencing, and that the government acted arbitrarily and in bad faith; and (2) the government breached the plea agreement by enticing him to cooperate and failing to file the requisite motion, to which he was \u201centitled.\u201d After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s authority under Rule 35(b) to reduce a sentence. <em>See United States v. Orozco, </em>160 F.3d 1309, 1310, 1312-13 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that the district court did not err in finding that it lacked jurisdiction to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under the pre-amendment Rule 35(b)); <em>see also United States v. Dorsey, </em>554 F.3d 958, 960 (11th Cir.2009) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s authority to depart downward from the defendant\u2019s guideline range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, in the absence of a motion by the government).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Pursuant to Rule 35(b), \u201c[ujpon the government\u2019s motion made within one year of sentencing, the court may reduce a sentence if the defendant, after sentencing, provided substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(1). As the language of the rule indicates, the district court may only reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to Rule 35(b) upon the government\u2019s motion. <em>United States v. Howard, </em>902 F.2d 894, 897 (11th Cir.1990). The Supreme Court has held that this rule gives the government \u201ca power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u201d <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (considering motions filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1); <em>see also United States v. McNeese, </em>547 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir.2008) (applying <em>Wade </em>to Rule 35(b) motions).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">The Supreme Court elaborated that the government\u2019s discretion is such that federal district courts may review the government\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion only if the defendant first makes a \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d that the refusal was based upon an unconstitutional motive, such as the defendant\u2019s race or religion, or that the refusal was not rationally related to any legitimate government end. <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-87, 112 S.Ct. 1840 (quotation omitted). Further, the Supreme Court held that mere claims that a defendant provided substantial assistance and generalized allegations of the government\u2019s improper motive do not \u201centitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">In addition, if the defendant makes a threshold showing that the government\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion was a breach of the express terms of the plea agreement, an evidentiary hearing and relief may be appropriate. <em>See United, States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1500-03 <em>&amp; </em>nn. 2, 5 (11th Cir.1993) (holding that judicial review of the government\u2019s refusal to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion is appropriate where the plea agreement contained a specific agreement by the government to file a substantial-assistance motion). However, where a plea agreement states only that the government will file a Rule 35(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>motion if it determines, in its \u201csole\u201d discretion, that the defendant\u2019s cooperation qualifies as substantial assistance, the government does not breach the agreement by failing to file such a motion, and the district court has no jurisdiction to review the claim of breach. <em>Id. </em>at 1500-02 &amp; n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Here, the district court did not err in finding that it lacked jurisdiction to compel the government to file a Rule 35(b) motion because Nance failed to make a substantial showing that the government either breached the terms of his plea agreement or acted with an unconstitutional motive. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-87, 112 S.Ct. 1840; <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1500-02 &amp; n. 2. First, the government did not breach the terms of the plea agreement because the agreement specifically stated that (1) the government only \u201cagree[d] to consider\u201d Nance\u2019s post-sentencing cooperation in deciding whether to file a Rule 35(b) motion; (2) the determination regarding substantial assistance rested solely within the discretion of the government; and (3) he could not challenge that determination in a direct appeal or collateral attack. Therefore, because the government did not breach Nance\u2019s plea agreement by failing to file a Rule 35(b) motion, the district court had no jurisdiction to review his breach-of-plea claim. <em>See Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1500-02 &amp; n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Second, Nance failed to make a substantial showing that the government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion was based on an unconstitutional motive or was unrelated to a legitimate government end. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-87, 112 S.Ct. 1840. Specifically, Nance\u2019s conclusory statements\u2014that the government acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d and exhibited an \u201cunconstitutional motive\u201d in failing to reward him for his cooperation\u2014are contradicted by the record, which shows that the government filed a presentence \u00a7 5K1.1 motion that accounted for his pre-trial assistance in disclosing the existence of a cellular telephone and \u201cother matters\u201d at his correctional facility, and that the government asserted that it had considered all of his previous cooperative attempts and concluded that none were substantial. Further, the district court commented that Nance was actually \u201cextraordinarily fortunate\u201d that the government filed a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion because another prosecutor may not have done so based on the same information. In addition, even assuming that the government actually failed to reward Nance for his cooperation, he still failed to make a substantial showing that the government\u2019s refusal was based on an impermissible ground such as his race or religion. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840. Accordingly, the district court lacked jurisdiction to review the government\u2019s decision not to file such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Because the district court correctly found that it lacked jurisdiction to review Nance\u2019s motions, we do not address his substantive claims on appeal detailing the extent of his cooperation and asserting that the government failed to consider his substantial assistance. Nor do we consider Nance\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel argument because he raised that issue for the first time in his reply brief. <em>See United States v. Maghita, </em>418 F.3d 1166, 1185-86 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201can appellant may not raise an issue for the first time in a reply brief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
