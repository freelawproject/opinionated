On appeal, Guitterez-Gonzalez argues that the court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights in calculating his recommended guidelines sentence by imposing a 16-level enhancement on the basis of prior convictions that were neither alleged in the indictment nor proved to a jury, citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960 (11th Cir.2005), but he asserts the issue to preserve it for possible review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">This Court reviews constitutional sentencing issues <em>de novo. United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008). We will reverse the district court only if it committed a harmful error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held the government need not allege prior convictions in its indictment, nor prove these convictions beyond a reasonable doubt, for a district court to use the convictions to enhance a sentence by increasing the maximum available sentence as allowed under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). 523 U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. at 1222. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court declined to revisit <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>ruling that, \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63; <em>see also United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (\u201cAny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). This Court has explained that it remains bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless the Supreme Court expressly overrules it. <em>United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 979-80 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-76 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246-47 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. Guitterez-Gonzalez\u2019s argument that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence based on convictions not alleged in the indictment nor found by a jury is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Toms, </em>which explained that a prior conviction need not be alleged in the indictment nor proved to a jury even if the conviction serves as the basis for enhancing a sentence by increasing the maximum available term of imprisonment. <em>See Almendarez-Toms, </em>523 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. at 1222. Because Guitterez-Gonzalez challenges only the use of a prior conviction in calculating his guidelines range, and does not challenge the use of the conviction to increase his maximum possible sentence (as the petitioner in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>did), the holding that the government need not allege the prior convictions nor prove them to a jury applies with even greater force here. Guitterez-Gonzalez misplaces his confidence in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>which left <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cundisturbed.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The district court did not err by imposing the 16-level enhancement under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) based on Guitterez-Gonzalez\u2019s prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
