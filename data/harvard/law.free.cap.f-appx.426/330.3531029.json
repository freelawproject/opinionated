Even though Flores had expressly pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>that the amount in controversy was less than $75,000, Union Pacific nevertheless based its assertion of federal jurisdiction on the fact that Flores had retained three expert witnesses. Union Pacific argued that \u201ccommon sense\u201d shows that Flores was likely seeking more than $75,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The district court rejected Union Pacific\u2019s contention and remanded the case to state court, noting that \u201cDefendant here has offered no evidence at all, only rank speculation that Plaintiffs damages will exceed $75,000.\u201d The district court subsequently awarded Flores $8,050 against Union Pacific for attorneys fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). The court concluded that Union Pacific, as the removing defendant, lacked \u201cobjectively reasonable grounds to believe the removal was legally proper.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Our de novo review of the record on appeal and of the applicable law, as applied by the district court and as cited by the parties in their appellate briefs, satisfies us that the district court correctly remanded this case to the state court in which it had been filed originally, and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Flores attorneys fees of $8,050. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s orders remanding this case and awarding attorneys fees are, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-9\">. <em>Valdes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>199 F.3d, 290, 293 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
