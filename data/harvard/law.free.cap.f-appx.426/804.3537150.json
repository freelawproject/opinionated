Casillas-Cantero argues (1) that the district court erred in relying on <em>United States v. Padilla-Reyes, </em>247 F.3d 1158 (11th Cir.2001), to determine that his conviction pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(1), for fondling a minor, qualified as \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d and (2) that even if \u00a7 800.04(1) constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d it cannot be considered a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (Nov. 2009), without violating the plain meaning of that term, as defined in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1271, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010); and <em>United States v. Harris, </em>608 F.3d 1222, 1233 (11th Cir.2010). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Casillas-Cantero first argues that <em>Padilla-Reyes </em>was inapplicable to his case because it had been decided before a significant amendment to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Although the Sentencing Guidelines are now advisory after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court is still obligated to calculate the applicable guideline range correctly. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d 1194, 1196 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a 16-level increase in the offense level if the defendant was previously deported after \u201ca conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The commentary to that guideline provision defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as any of the following offenses under federal, state, or local law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABc\">murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses (including where consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary, incompetent, or coerced), statutory rape, <em>sexual abuse of a minor, </em>robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a dwelling, <em>or </em>any other offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iii) (emphasis added). \u201cIt is well settled that a felony conviction for an enumerated offense qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under \u00a7 2L1.2, whether or not the use of physical force is an element of the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1327 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">At the time that Casillas-Cantero was charged, \u00a7 800.04(1) read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-13\">Lewd, lascivious, or indecent assault or act upon or in the presence of child.\u2014A person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-14\">(1) Handles, fondles, or assaults any child under the age of 16 years in a lewd, lascivious, or indecent manner ... without committing the crime of sexual battery, commits a felony of the second degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">Flat. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(1) (1997). In <em>PadillarReyes, </em>we held that a violation of \u00a7 800.04(1), with or without victim contact, constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2. 247 F.3d at 1163-64. We interpreted \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d to mean \u201ca perpetrator\u2019s physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1163. We recognized that violations of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 might not involve any physical contact with the victim, but concluded that all possible violations, even those where \u201cthe only elements are that the child was under the age of sixteen and that the defendant knowingly committed a lewd or lascivious act that the child saw or sensed,\u201d involve the misuse or maltreatment of a child for sexual gratification, and thus constitute \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1162-63 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Nevertheless, Casillas-Cantero argues that <em>Padillar-Reyes </em>does not control, because in that case we analyzed an earlier version of \u00a7 2L1.2. The earlier version of \u00a7 2L1.2 provided for a 16-level increase in offense level based on the commission of an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d which the commentary defined by reference to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). 247 F.3d at 1159; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 (Nov. 1998). That statutory provision, in turn, defined \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Following a significant amendment in 2001, the current version of \u00a7 2L1.2 provides for a 16-level increase in offense level based on the commission of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d which as explained above, is expressly defined in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 to include \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 &amp; cmt. n. l(B)(iii) (Nov. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"Aqf\">We reject Casillas-Cantero\u2019s argument that this amendment renders <em>PadillarReyes </em>inapplicable to his case. <em>PadillctrReyes </em>held that \u00a7 800.04 fell within the plain meaning of the term \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d 247 F.3d at 1163-64. Although that term now appears explicitly in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2, rather than applying by reference to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43), nothing in the amendment has suggested a change in its definition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result, the district court did not err in finding that, under <em>Padilla-Reyes, </em>Casillas-Cantero\u2019s conviction for violating \u00a7 800.04(1) was a conviction for \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">Casillas-Cantero also argues that the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d provided in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 violates the plain meaning of the term, as it has been defined in <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 141-42, 128 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>S.Ct. at 1584, <em>Johnson, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. at 1271, 176 L.Ed.2d 1; and <em>Harris, </em>608 F.3d at 1233. The commentary to the Sentencing Guidelines is \u201cauthoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\"><em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 141-42, 128 S.Ct. at 1584, <em>Johnson, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. at 1271, 176 L.Ed.2d 1, and <em>Harris, </em>608 F.3d at 1232-33, employed a \u201ccategorical approach\u201d to determine whether certain offenses qualified as \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d under the ACCA. The ACCA defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as an offense that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-9\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-10\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). We have explained that \u201c[cjonsidering whether a crime is a \u2018violent felony\u2019 under the ACCA is similar to considering whether a conviction qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) because the definitions for both terms are virtually identical.\u201d <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1253 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted). But <em>Begay, Johnson, </em>and <em>Harris </em>do not necessarily control here because this case involves neither the ACCA nor \u00a7 4B 1.2(a), but instead turns on the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d that applies to \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"AEW\">While the text of \u00a7 2L1.2 itself provides no definition of \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 defines that term very differently from \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and the ACCA. As relevant here, the commentary specifically enumerates \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d as a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2, even though that offense is not enumerated as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) or as a violent felony under the ACCA. We recognize the potential for confusion that might arise from applying two different definitions of crime of violence in two different Guidelines chapters, but this is plainly what the Guidelines contemplate insofar as the two sections provide different definitions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, as we have previously explained, \u201c[i]t is well settled that a felony conviction for an enumerated offense qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under \u00a7 2L1.2.\u201d <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-16\">Because we cannot say that the distinct definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d provided in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 is a plainly erroneous reading of the Guideline, that definition is still \u201cauthoritative.\u201d <em>See Stinson, </em>508 U.S. at 38, 113 S.Ct. at 1915. Thus, the district court did not err by relying on the commentary to the Guidelines in imposing the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. For all of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>reasons, we affirm Casillas-Cantero\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-6\">. To be sure, die amendment potentially changes the consequences of a finding that an offense is a \"sexual abuse of a minor,\u201d by now labeling that offense as a \"crime of violence\u201d instead of an \"aggravated felony.\u201d But, the result is the same in this case because the 16-level enhancement that previously applied to an \"aggravated felony\u201d now applies to a \"crime of violence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-7\">. Casillas-Cantero also argues that the district court erred in failing to conduct a categorical analysis under <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). \"Although <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Shepard </em>were [Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\u201d) ] cases, we have employed their \u2018categorical approach' in determining whether a prior offense qualifies for an enhancement under the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1328. But while <em>Padilla-Reyes </em>may not have fully defined the contours of the generic offense of \"sexual abuse of a minor\u201d to the extent necessary to resolve cases involving offenses under other statutes, that case implicitly defined the generic offense to the degree necessary to conclude that a violation of the then-existing version of \u00a7 800.04\u2014the statute at issue in both that case and this one\u2014qualified as a \"sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d Because we find that <em>Padilla-Reyes </em>continues to control, we are bound by that case\u2019s holding. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>606 F.3d 1303, 1305 (11th Cir.2010) (\"[U]nder the prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow a prior binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b831-12\">. We acknowledge that this Court has previously stated that \"there is no meaningful distinction between the definition of a \u2018crime of violence' under U.S. S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1) ..., the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a) , or the definition of a 'crime of domestic violence' under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9).\u201d <em>Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d at 1197-98. But that observation in <em>LlanosAgostadero </em>was made in the context of analyzing the \u201celements clause\u201d of \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt n. l(B)(iii), which mirrors language in \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) and the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 1197. This case turns not on the \"elements clause,\u201d but instead on the list of enumerated offenses in \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt n. l(B)(iii), which differs markedly from the list of enumerated offenses in \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) and the ACCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
