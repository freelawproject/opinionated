Specifically, Gray disputes the ALJ\u2019s determination that her alleged physical and mental impairments were not sufficiently \u201csevere\u201d to entitle her to disability benefits. After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahe\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"Avu\">Gray first argues that the ALJ applied a more stringent standard than the law allows when determining whether her impairments were \u201csevere\u201d at Step Two of the disability-benefits analysis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She argues that the ALJ misapplied the \u201csignificantly limits\u201d language of the regulations, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520, by requiring a higher showing of severity than that set forth by the case law.</p>\n<p id=\"AcN\">In reviewing the denial of disability benefits, we do not presume that the ALJ \u201cfollowed the appropriate legal standards ... or that the legal conclusions reached were valid.\u201d <em>Miles v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 1397, 1400 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam). Instead, we conduct \u201can exacting examination of these factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). An ALJ\u2019s \u201cfailure to apply the correct legal standards ... [would] mandate[ ] reversal.\u201d <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">To be entitled to disability payments under the Social Security Act, a claimant must prove that she is disabled. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). A person is \u201cdisabled\u201d if she is unable \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which ... has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>\u00a7 428(d)(1)(A). The ALJ must determine whether an impairment is severe, that is, \u201cwhether it significantly limits [a] claimant\u2019s physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d <em>Crayton v. Callahan, </em>120 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.1997) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the claimant bears the burden of showing severity, the burden is mild, such that she need only show that her impairment is \u201cnot so slight and its effect is not so minimal\u201d as to be trivial. <em>McDaniel v. Bowen, </em>800 F.2d 1026, 1031 (11th Cir.1986). In other words, an impairment is not severe \u201cif it is a slight abnormality which has such a minimal effect on the individual that it would not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irrespective of age, education, or work experience.\u201d <em>Brady v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 914, 920 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">We conclude that the ALJ did not apply an incorrect legal standard with regard to Step Two. The ALJ simply used the language of the regulations in stating that Gray\u2019s impairments did not \u201csignificantly limit\u201d her ability to perform basic work activities. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R \u00a7 404.1520(c) (stating that, if the applicant does not have an impairment that \u201csignificantly limits [her] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities,\u201d no severe impairment will be found); \u00a7 404.1521(a) (\u201cAn impairment ... is not severe if it does not significantly limit [an applicant\u2019s] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d). The ALJ found that even though Gray had medically determinable impairments, none had significantly limited or were expected to significantly limit her ability to perform basic work-related activities. <em>See McCruter v. Bowen, </em>791 F.2d 1544, 1547 (11th Cir.1986) (noting that \u201cthe \u2018severity\u2019 of a medically ascertained disability must be measured in terms of its effect upon ability to work, and not simply in terms of deviation from purely medical standards of bodily perfection or normality\u201d). Although a finding that a claimant\u2019s impairments are not \u201csevere\u201d is unusual, the ALJ\u2019s opinion is thorough and addresses the medical evidence in the record. We have no reason to conclude that the ALJ misapplied the legal standard for determining \u201cseverity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOZ1\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"AAQ\">Gray\u2019s second principal argument is that substantial evidence in the record does not support the ALJ\u2019s findings with regard to her hypertension, anxiety, and depression. As to hypertension, Gray contends that the ALJ erred by giving insufficient weight to certain physician statements. Furthermore, Gray argues that medical reports in the record prove that her anxiety and depression were more than merely slight abnormalities.</p>\n<p id=\"A1i\">Where the ALJ applied the correct legal standard, we review whether the decision was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations marks omitted). If substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision, this Court must affirm \u201c[e]ven if the evidence preponderates against the [ALJ]\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1158-59 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings that Gray\u2019s hypertension, anxiety, and depression were not severe impairments. First, the ALJ properly gave little weight to the opinion of Jerry L. Thomas, M.D.\u2014Dr. Thomas did not treat or examine Gray, and though his report mentions her hypertension, it does not suggest that her hypertension was serious enough to impair her ability to work. Nothing else in the record, including documents from Grady Hospital, indicate that Gray\u2019s hypertension caused any significant, long-term limitations in her functioning. Second, although Gray\u2019s medical evidence reflects a history of anxiety and depression, the record considered as a whole does not reveal longterm functional limitations stemming from those impairments. The ALJ did not err by giving weight to such evidence as the report of Brenard Francis, Ph.D., a psychologist who found after a comprehensive, nearly three-hour evaluation that Gray had a \u201chigh probability\u201d of malingering.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Thus, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Gray\u2019s impairments had only a slight effect on her ability to perform basic work activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-9\">. The Social Security Administration applies the following five-step sequential analysis to determine whether an applicant is entitled to disability benefits. First, the ALJ must determine whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). If not, at the second step, the AU must determine whether the impairment or combination of impairments from which the claimant allegedly suffers is \u2018\u2018severe.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id. </em>If there is no severe impairment, the claimant is not deemed to be disabled, and the claim is denied. <em>Id. At </em>the third step, the ALJ must decide whether the claimant\u2019s severe impairment meets or medically equals a listed impairment. <em>Id. </em>If so, the fourth step requires the ALJ to assess the claimant's \"residual functional capacity\u201d and whether she can perform her \"past relevant work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If she cannot perform her past relevant work, then the ALJ moves to the fifth step, considering whether, in light of the claimant\u2019s disability, she can perform other work. <em>Id. </em>Gray\u2019s appeal concerns only the second step\u2014whether her impairment was sufficiently \"severe.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-6\">. Under the regulations, \"basic work activities\u201d include physical functions, such as walking, lifting, pushing, or reaching, and also include mental functions, such as understanding, carrying out, and remembering simple instructions; using judgment; responding appropriately to supervision, co-workers, and usual work situations; and dealing with changes in a routine work setting. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521 (b)(l\u20146).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
