Because the Commissioner applied the correct legal standards and because there is substantial evidence to support the decision, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-27\">In March 2006, Mr. Jack injured his back while lifting heavy tools at work. He had surgery for a herniated disc in August 2006, but continued to have problems. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>underwent a second surgery in February 2007. Unfortunately, he continued to have pain following the surgery, despite participating in a wellness program and undergoing a significant amount of physical therapy. A nerve conduction study was conducted in April 2007, which revealed that Mr. Jack had mild chronic radiculopathy. A psychologist examined Mr. Jack in July 2007, and reported that tests indicated that Mr. Jack was not exaggerating his symptoms and that there was no indication of malingering.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Mr. Jack applied for Social Security disability benefits in March 2007, alleging that he had been disabled since March 2006. The Social Security Administration denied his claim and he requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Mr. Jack testified at the hearing in September 2008 that he suffered from pain every day, although the level of pain varied from day to day. He stated that his pain was relieved by use of his TENS unit and pain medication and muscle relaxers that his doctor had prescribed. He testified that he took pain medication at some point every day, and that the pain medication and muscle relaxers made him drowsy and interfered with his ability to concentrate. He testified that he could not drive after taking the pain medication because it made him drowsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">A vocational expert testified, in response to a hypothetical question posed by the ALJ, that there were a significant number of jobs in the national economy that Mr. Jack could perform. However, the ALJ did not include in the hypothetical question the effect that Mr. Jack\u2019s medication use had on his ability to stay awake and concentrate. When those factors were added during questioning by Mr. Jack\u2019s attorney, the vocational expert testified that Mr. Jack would not be able to work if the medication were taken on a daily basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Following the hearing, the ALJ found that Mr. Jack\u2019s impairments prevented him from working from March 10, 2006, through December 10, 2007, but that he was able to perform sedentary work after December 10, 2007. The ALJ\u2019s decision became the Commissioner\u2019s final decision after the Appeals Council denied Mr. Jack\u2019s request for review. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and affirmed the decision of the Commissioner. Mr. Jack filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Mr. Jack contends on appeal that the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits for the period after December 10, 2007, is not supported by substantial evidence, because the ALJ breached his duty to fully and fairly develop the facts relating to the claim. Specifically, he contends that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the vocational expert was defective because it omitted any mention of Mr. Jack\u2019s testimony that his daily medication makes him drowsy and interferes with his ability to concentrate. He contends further that the ALJ ignored the vocational expert\u2019s testimony that Mr. Jack would not be able to work if he experienced those side effects from the medication on a daily basis. He argues that, by implicitly finding that Mr. Jack does not need the medication, the ALJ effectively substituted his own opinion for that of Mr. Jack\u2019s treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision only to ascertain whether it is supported by substantial evidence and whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standards in evaluating the evidence. <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). We may not re-weigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>of the Commissioner, even if the evidence weighs against the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Mr. Jack argues that the Commissioner\u2019s decision that Mr. Jack was capable of performing sedentary work after December 10, 2007, is not supported by substantial evidence because the ALJ relied on testimony elicited by a defective hypothetical question, and failed to take into account the expert\u2019s testimony that the side effects of Mr. Jack\u2019s medication would prevent him from working. Based on our review of all of the evidence, however, we find that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the vocational expert contained all of the limitations supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The medical evidence contains no mention of any complaints by Mr. Jack about the side effects of his medication. Although a psychological report in July- 2007 mentions Mr. Jack\u2019s problems with concentration and attention, fatigue, and problems in decision making, there is no reference in that report to any association between those problems and any medication that Mr. Jack was taking. Instead, the psychologist stated that Mr. Jack\u2019s psychological stressors resulted from his physical discomfort and his inability to provide for his family. Even assuming that such an association between Mr. Jack\u2019s medication and those problems might be inferred, the psychologist\u2019s report was prepared in July 2007, at a time when the ALJ found Mr. Jack to be unable to work. There is no mention of those problems in the psychologist\u2019s reports after December 10, 2007. There is no evidence that Mr. Jack was ever prescribed muscle relaxers for use during the day, but only at bedtime, and no evidence that they were prescribed after December 2007. In addition, there is no evidence that pain medication was prescribed after December 2007. An \u201cAttending Physician\u2019s Statement\u201d prepared for an insurance company by Mr. Jack\u2019s treating physician on October 2, 2007, lists only one prescription medication\u2014Ambien, a sleep aid. Mr. Jack\u2019s treating neurosurgeon reported on December 10, 2007, that Mr. Jack\u2019s deep tendon reflexes were brisk and symmetrical, straight leg raising was negative on both sides, and that Mr. Jack told him that \u201che has intermittent episodes of pain and paresthesias in his leg, but he can perform most of his activities of daily living without any major discomfort.\u201d Another neurosurgeon from whom Mr. Jack got a second opinion reported in September 2007 that Mr. Jack should be retrained for sedentary or light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">In sum, the medical evidence does not support' Mr. Jack\u2019s contention that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the vocational expert was defective, or that the ALJ substituted his opinion regarding Mr. Jack\u2019s need for medication for that of Mr. Jack\u2019s treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">We conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and resulted from application of the appropriate legal standards. Accordingly, the decision of the district court affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits is</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
