We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). For the reasons detailed below, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">In a perfunctory complaint, Abbott alleged that the defendants (who will be treated collectively in this opinion) miscalculated his criminal sentence. More specifically, he claimed that the defendants improperly failed to credit the first 36 days that he served against his sentence. He asserted his claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and requested money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">A magistrate judge recommended that the District Court dismiss the complaint. The magistrate judge concluded that, to the extent that Abbott sought damages, he could prosecute his \u00a7 1983 action only after showing that his sentence had been called into question, and to the extent that he sought an earlier release, the remedy was available only through habeas corpus proceedings. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 487, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). The District Court approved and adopted the report and recommendation, and dismissed Abbott\u2019s complaint. Abbott then filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">We interpret Abbott\u2019s complaint to seek only money damages, and not an accelerated release from prison. We agree with the District Court that this claim is barred by <em>Heck. </em>Under <em>Heck, </em>as relevant here, a civil-rights plaintiff cannot recover damages for harm caused by actions that implicate the length of his confinement unless he can prove that the erroneous calculation has been reversed, invalidated, or called into question by a grant of federal habeas corpus relief. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>see also Muhammad v. Close, </em>540 U.S. 749, 751, 124 S.Ct. 1303, 158 L.Ed.2d 32 (2004) (\u201cwhere success in a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 damages action would implicitly question the validity of conviction or duration of sentence, the litigant must first achieve favorable termination of his available state, or federal habeas, opportunities to challenge the underlying conviction or sentence\u201d). Abbott challenges the duration of his confinement, but has not shown that his sentence has been reversed or questioned. His claim is therefore not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Williams v. Consovoy, </em>453 F.3d 173, 177 (3d Cir.2006) (challenge to parole board\u2019s decision barred by Heck); <em>Erlin v. United States, </em>364 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir.2004) <em>(Heck </em>applies to \u201cclaim for damages ... for the miscalculation of [plaintiffs] required term of imprisonment under his valid sentences\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">We further discern no error in the District Court\u2019s conclusion that it would be futile to permit Abbott to amend his complaint. <em>See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, </em>515 F.3d 224, 236 (3d Cir.2008). Abbott\u2019s claim fails as a matter of law, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>could not cure its deficiencies with further pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">We will thus summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Abbott\u2019s complaint. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-9\">. It appears that Abbott may have now served this sentence in full. Even assuming that this is true, the rule of <em>Heck </em>remains applicable. <em>See Gilles v. Davis, 427 </em>F.3d 197, 210-11 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
