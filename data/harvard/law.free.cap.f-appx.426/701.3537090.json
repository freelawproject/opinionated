Drayton argues that his sentence should be vacated because the district court failed to provide a written statement to explain why it varied upward from the guideline range, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2), and that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-17\">Even if we assume that the district court erred by failing to comply with section 3553(c)(2), its failure to provide Drayton a written statement is harmless. The record establishes that, at Drayton\u2019s revocation hearing, the district court explained that it was \u201cimposing a two-year sentence\u201d that was \u201clong overdue\u201d to punish Drayton for failing to \u201cappreciat[e] that ... the seven-year sentence\u201d he had faced had been reduced to \u201ctime served\u201d because he had terminal cancer; remaining \u201cin violation of status ... his whole first year of supervised release\u201d; and \u201cdisregarding]\u201d and \u201cflaunting the law\u201d until he was \u201cpushed against the jail cell door.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2). The district court provided a sufficient explanation for its decision to vary upward from the guideline range of 8 to 14 months of imprisonment. Drayton was not harmed by the failure to provide a written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-19\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Drayton to 24 months of imprisonment. The district court considered the guideline range and agreed with Drayton\u2019s probation officer that the circumstances warranted sentencing Drayton to the maximum statutory term of imprisonment, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3583(e)(3). The district court considered the relevant policy statements and sentencing factors and reasonably determined that an upward variance was required to address the seriousness of Drayton\u2019s crimes, his disregard for the law, and his likelihood of recidivism. <em>See United States v. Wiggins, </em>220 F.3d 1248, 1249 (11th Cir.2000) (affirming sentence of 24 months of imprisonment following revocation of supervised release where defendant faced a sentencing range between 3 and 9 months of imprisonment). Drayton argues that he should have received a \u201cshorter prison sentence\u201d followed by \u201csupervision with the strictest conditions of home confinement\u201d because of his cancer, but the district court reasonably concluded that Drayton was not amenable to supervision. Drayton\u2019s probation officer testified that \u201ceven after [Drayton] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>arrested and placed on home detention, he violated home detention that exact same day.\u201d Drayton\u2019s medical condition and limited life expectancy do not provide him a license to flout the law. Drayton\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">We AFFIRM Drayton\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
