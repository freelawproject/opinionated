She contends that the district court erred by denying her motion for a new trial, which was based on her contention that the Government violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) by failing to disclose certain investigative reports before trial. She further contends that the district court erred by denying her an adjustment to her offense level pursuant to the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The investigative reports on which Rodriguez\u2019s new trial and <em>Brady </em>claims rely are not material evidence in that there is no reasonable probability that the outcome of Rodriguez\u2019s trial would have been different had she possessed the reports. <em>See Mahler v. Kayla, </em>537 F.3d 494, 500 (5th Cir.2008). The debriefing reports of Elvia Reyes and Ruben Mendoza would have been of little if any value to corroborate Rodriguez\u2019s theory of the case or to impeach Mendoza\u2019s testimony or the testimony of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent Eduardo Escobar. Rodriguez\u2019s false statements and attempts to distract agents who were searching her car indicated guilty knowledge that she was carrying contraband. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>185 F.3d 465, 472 (5th Cir.1999). In light of the evidence, there was no reasonable probability that the alleged <em>Brady </em>evidence would have given rise to any reasonable doubt about Rodriguez\u2019s guilt. <em>See Mahler, </em>537 F.3d at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">The evidence adduced at trial supported a finding that Rodriguez falsely maintained her innocence, and nothing that came to light after the trial indicated that she provided a true account of events. The district court\u2019s decision to deny a safety valve adjustment is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d 454, 457 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
