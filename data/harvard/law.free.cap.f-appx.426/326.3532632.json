Fabian\u2019s appeal of his sentence is barred by the waiver-of-appeal provision in his plea agreement. The district court\u2019s variance from the guideline range of imprisonment does not fall within either exception to the appeal waiver, as the sentence is not above the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>maximum and it does not result from an upward departure. <em>See United States v. Jacobs, </em>635 F.3d 778, 780-82 (5th Cir.2011); \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Fabian appeals his conviction on the basis that there was no factual basis for the element of commercial advantage or private financial gain. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1324(a)(1)(B)\u00ae. This argument is refuted by Fabian\u2019s statements at the guilty plea hearing that he acted as a coyote and that he did it to reduce the amount of money he owed another coyote.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The district court\u2019s Statement of Reasons for judgment (SOR) incorrectly states that Fabian\u2019s offense level was 24 and that his guideline range of imprisonment was 63 to 78 months. Fabian\u2019s offense level was reduced by an additional two levels based on the \u201cfast track\u201d program. Accordingly, his offense level was reduced to 22, and his guideline range of imprisonment was reduced to 51 to 63 months. Therefore, we affirm the decision of the district court below; but we also remand to the district court with an instruction to correct the SOR to reflect that Fabian\u2019s offense level was 22 and his guideline range of imprisonment was 51 to 63 months. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36; <em>United States v. Powell, </em>354 F.3d 362, 371-72 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED with instruction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
