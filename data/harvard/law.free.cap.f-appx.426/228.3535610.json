On appeal, he raises two issues. First, he contends that an appellate presumption of reasonableness should not apply to his within-guidelines sentence because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not supported by empirieal data. As Garrigos-Diaz concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009), and <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-19\">Second, Garrigos-Diaz argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and is thus substantively unreasonable because it fails to account for his history and characteristics, his benign motive for returning to the United States, his efforts at self-rehabilitation, and the remoteness of his attempted arson conviction. He further argues that use of the remote arson conviction to impose a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) overstates the seriousness of both his instant illegal reentry offense and the arson conviction and that a guidelines anomaly permits classification of the arson conviction as a crime of violence for purposes of the 16-level enhancement but prohibits application of the lesser eight-level aggravated-felony enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-21\">These arguments are likewise unavailing. Garrigos-Diaz has failed to overcome the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence on appellate review. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 530-31. His argument that the mitigating factors presented for the district court\u2019s consideration at sentencing should have been balanced differently is insufficient to disturb the presumption. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Considering the totality of the circumstances, including Garrigos-Diaz\u2019s seven prior illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>reentry offenses and 10 other convictions, only one of which was counted in the calculation of his criminal history, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a downward variance or departure and instead imposing a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Regarding Gamgos-Diaz\u2019s argument that a guidelines anomaly rendered his sentence unreasonable, the Sentencing Guidelines recognize that certain prior convictions may constitute one of the listed offenses under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) but not an aggravated felony under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) and that, under these circumstances, \u201ca downward departure may be warranted.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. nn. 3, 7. After reviewing Garrigos-Diaz\u2019s sentencing memorandum, considering the request and supporting arguments made during the sentencing hearing for a below-guidelines sentence, and engaging in a lengthy discussion with both defense counsel and Garrigos-Diaz, the district court concluded that a sentence at the very bottom of the advisory guidelines range was indicated. We will not vacate a within-guidelines sentence merely because a district could have decided to impose a different sentence. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339 (\u201cAppellate review is highly deferential as the sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d (citing <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586)).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
