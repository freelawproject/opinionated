(J C Penney), alleging retaliation pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Later, Parker filed a motion to stay her case pending arbitration, which the district court granted. The arbitrator found in J C Penney\u2019s favor, and the district court confirmed the award. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">In June 2000, J C Penney demoted Parker from her position as an information and technology supervisor and put her under the supervision of another J C Penney employee. Parker subsequently filed suit in Texas state court, alleging sex and race discrimination. The state court granted J C Penney\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which was upheld on appeal in February 2005. Three months later, Parker\u2019s job performance was rated unsatisfactory. She was eventually terminated on October 31, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Through counsel, Parker filed suit against J C Penney in federal district court, claiming retaliation. The district court later granted Parker\u2019s motion to stay her case pending arbitration. Subsequently, Parker\u2019s counsel filed a motion to withdraw his representation. The district court granted the motion, and Parker proceeded <em>pro se </em>during the arbitration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Applying the well-established <em>McDonnell Douglas\u2014Burdine </em>framework,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the arbitrator determined that Parker established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation. However, the arbitrator concluded Parker failed to rebut J C Penney\u2019s nondiscriminatory reasons for its decision to terminate her. The arbitrator ultimately held that Parker take nothing. Parker then filed a motion, asking the district court to reject the arbitrator\u2019s award. The district court denied Parker\u2019s motion and confirmed the arbitrator\u2019s award. Parker appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-18\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-19\">Judicial review of an arbitration award is significantly limited by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16. <em>See Positive Software Solutions, Inc. v. New Century Mortg. Corp., </em>476 F.3d 278, 280 (5th Cir.2007). Although we review the district court\u2019s confirmation of an arbitration award <em>de novo, </em>our review is \u201cexceedingly deferential.\u201d <em>Am. Laser Vision, P.A. v. Laser Vision Inst., L.L.C., </em>487 F.3d 255, 258 (5th Cir.2007), <em>overruled on other </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>grounds, </em>552 U.S. 576, 128 S.Ct. 1396, 170 L.Ed.2d 254 (2008); 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10. Thus, we will only vacate an arbitration award for limited reasons, namely: (1) \u201cwhere the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means;\u201d (2) \u201cwhere there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators;\u201d (3) \u201cwhere the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced;\u201d or (4) \u201cwhere the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(l)-(4). Moreover, the party moving to vacate an arbitration award under the FAA has the burden of proof. <em>See Matter of Arbitration Between Trans Chem. Ltd. and China Nat\u2019l Mach. Imp. &amp; Exp. Corp., </em>978 F.Supp. 266, 304-06 (S.D.Tex.1997), <em>aff'd and adopted by, </em>161 F.3d 314 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">To this end, Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9) requires that a party\u2019s brief contain an argument with \u201ccontentions and the reason for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d and \u201cfor each issue, a concise statement of the applicable standard of review.\u201d <em>See also Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). On appeal, many of Parker\u2019s arguments are indiscernible and unsupported by case law or specific allegations, likely because Parker is not represented by counsel. However, we have explained that, when applying Rule 28\u2019s principles, we liberally construe a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s brief and generally apply a less stringent standard to parties\u2019 proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel. <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995). Against this framework, as did the district court, we liberally construe Parker\u2019s brief ,to determine whether she has made any allegations that constitute any of the limited reasons for vacatur listed in \u00a7 10 of the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Parker argues that the arbitration award should be vacated for three reasons. First, she argues that the award should be vacated because she was not aware that the arbitration was binding. This argument seems to implicate a violation of \u00a7 10(1) or (4). Assuming that Parker\u2019s alleged lack of awareness could be attributable to misdeeds by J C Penney or the arbitrator, Parker has not provided sufficient evidence to support vacatur on these grounds. We have held that, when a party agrees to submit to arbitration governed by the procedures of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), this implies that the arbitration award will be deemed binding and subject to entry of judgment, unless the parties expressly agree otherwise. <em>See McKee v. Home Buyers Warranty Corp. II, </em>45 F.3d 981, 983 (5th Cir.1995). Our review of the record indicates that this arbitration was governed by AAA procedures. And Parker admits that neither the arbitrator or J C Penney acknowledged her allegation that the district court ordered that the arbitration be non-binding. Moreover, Parker has not provided nor can we find an order from the district court stating that the arbitration would be non-binding. Thus, we conclude that Parker has not established that her alleged lack of awareness, regarding the binding nature of the arbitration, is grounds to vacate the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Parker also argues that she was prejudiced because she was not represented by counsel during the arbitration pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ceedings. This argument is unpersuasive. To begin, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not apply to civil proceedings, such as the arbitration of Parker\u2019s Title VII retaliation claim. <em>See generally Williams v. Wynne, </em>533 F.3d 360, 369 (5th Cir.2008) (acknowledging that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel is a criminal concept with no relevance to administrative or civil proceedings\u201d). Moreover, as previously explained, courts are limited by the statutory grounds for vacatur articulated in \u00a7 10 of the FAA. Parker cites no authority and makes no arguments to support her allegation that her lack of counsel during the arbitration is grounds for vacatur. Therefore, this argument does not establish that the arbitrator\u2019s award should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Finally, Parker claims that the arbitrator did not require J C Penney to produce certain documents that would allow her to establish her case. Liberally construing Parker\u2019s brief, it appears that she alleges that the award should be vacated under \u00a7 10(a)(3) because the arbitrator \u201crefus[ed] to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy.\u201d \u201c[Ajrbitrators have broad discretion to make evidentiary decisions.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Chem. Workers Union, Local 683C v. Columbian Chems. Co., </em>331 F.3d 491, 497 (5th Cir.2003). And this court typically does not review the adequacy of an arbitrator\u2019s evidentiary rulings. <em>Amalgamated Meat Cutters &amp; Butcher Workmen v. Neuhoff Bros., </em>481 F.2d 817, 820 (5th Cir.1973) (explaining that \u201cthe arbitrator has great flexibility and the courts should not review the legal adequacy of his evidentiary rulings\u201d). Parker has not explained why we should overlook this precedent and disturb the arbitrator\u2019s determination. Furthermore, the arbitrator found in J C Penney\u2019s favor because he concluded that Parker failed to rebut J C Penney\u2019s nondiscriminatory reasons for its decision to terminate her. Parker does not articulate why the particular documents, allegedly in J C Penney\u2019s possession, were material to the arbitrator\u2019s decision. Accordingly, Parker has not met her burden of establishing that the arbitrator\u2019s evidentiary decision rises to the level of misconduct described in \u00a7 10(a)(3) or any other ground for vacatur listed in \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">In sum, after carefully reviewing the record, we conclude that Parker has not made any allegations that constitute any of the limited reasons for vacating an arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-11\">. As the district court affirmed the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, for purposes of clarity, our references to the district court's judgment are also references to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-12\">. Title VII unlawful retaliation cases follow the framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) and <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). Thus, once the plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action. <em>Montemayor v. City of San Antonio, </em>276 F.3d 687, 692 (5th Cir.2001). If the defendant introduces evidence supporting a valid, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision, the presumption of retaliation raised by the plaintiff\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case disappears. <em>Id. </em>The burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to prove that the employer's proffered reason is actually a pretext for retaliation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
