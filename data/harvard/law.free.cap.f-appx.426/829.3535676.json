Blage argues that his sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, because it is grossly disproportionate to the offenses he committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">On this record, we find no reversible error. The district court sentenced Blage to the statutory maximum penalty for the offenses he committed-30 years for each count of production of child pornography.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the district court sentenced Blage \u201cwithin the limits imposed by the relevant statutes and guidelines,\u201d we cannot say the sentence imposed is disproportionate to the offenses committed, and thus it does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a 140-year sentence for producing and distributing child pornography was not cruel and unusual, because the sentence was within the statutory limits, and, thus, was not disproportionate to the offense).</p>\n<p id=\"Avl\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-18\">. The district court determined that Blage\u2019s advisory guidelines sentence was life imprisonment, subject to the statutory maximum of 720 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
