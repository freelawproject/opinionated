Osteen argues that her sentence is unreasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors because the district court failed to adequately account for certain factors. She avers that she passed only a minimal amount of counterfeit currency and only to two fast food establishments. She notes her tragic childhood, including witnessing the violent murder of her mother; and points out that she has struggled without child support to care for her own six children, as well as the children of her disabled sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">We review Osteen\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Osteen\u2019s guidelines range sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The district court made an individualized sentencing decision based on the facts of the case in light of the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court noted that, in setting Osteen\u2019s sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range, it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the facts established in the record, the parties\u2019 statements, the Guidelines, and the policies underlying the Guidelines. The district court particularly referenced its concerns regarding the need to balance Osteen\u2019s familial obligations with the nature and circumstances of the offense. The district court\u2019s conclusion that a within-guidelines sentence is appropriate is entitled to deference, and we presume that it is reasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554. We see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s discretionary decision to impose a sentence within the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
