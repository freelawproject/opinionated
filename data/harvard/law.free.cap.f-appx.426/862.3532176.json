Six months later, on petition from the United States Probation Office, the district court issued a warrant for his arrest for alleged violations of his probation. After a hearing the district court found that Comartie had violated the terms of his probation and revoked his probation. Upon revocation, the court sentenced him to a 12-month term of imprisonment, which was the statutory maximum for a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844, and 1 year of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">Comartie appeals the district court\u2019s imposition of the 1-year term of supervised release upon revocation of his probation. He contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h), which applies only to revocations of supervised release, should be applied by analogy to his revocation of probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that if \u00a7 3583(h) is applied to his case the district court lacked jurisdiction upon revocation of his probation to impose the 1-year term of supervised release on top of his term of imprisonment because 12 months imprisonment was the statutory maximum for a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">Because Comartie did not raise that issue in the district court, we review only for plain error, and we will not reverse \u201cunless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, ... (3) that affects substantial rights ... [and] (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291,1298 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(2), which governs revocation of probation, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-16\">If the defendant violates a condition of probation at any time prior to the expiration ... of the term of probation, the court may, after a hearing ... and after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable\u2014... <em>revoke the sentence of probation and resentence the defendant under subchapter A.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-17\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When resentencing upon revocation of probation, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>court \u201ccan order supervised release in addition to the maximum term of imprisonment available by statute [because] \u00a7 3583(a) allows the district court to include supervised release as part of the sentence, not as part of the imprisonment.\u201d <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>42 F.3d 1370, 1371 (11th Cir.1995). Accordingly, a \u201cdistrict court [does] not err in ordering supervised release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(a) in addition to the maximum term of imprisonment available by statute.\u201d Id.; <em>see also United States v. Cenna, </em>448 F.3d 1279, 1280-81 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Comartie\u2019s argument, which is based on his assertion that \u00a7 3583(h) should be applied to his revocation of probation fails because that section governs only the revocation of supervised release originally imposed following a term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(a), (h). Comartie was not originally sentenced to a term of imprisonment with supervised release. Because his original sentence for his 2009 conviction was only for a term of probation, \u00a7 3565(a)(2) is the applicable provision. The district court had the authority to impose a 1-year term of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3565(a)(2) and 3583(a) in addition to the 12-month term of imprisonment available upon resentencing under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844. There was no error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-11\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-12\">When a term of supervised release is revoked and the defendant is required to serve a term of imprisonment, the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment. The length of such a term of supervised release shall not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-19\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-20\">.
