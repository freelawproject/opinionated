On appeal, Spates argues that the district court erred in applying a three-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) based on a finding that Spates acted as a \u201cmanager or supervisor\u201d of criminal activity that involved five or more participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-16\">On this record, we cannot say the district court clearly erred in determining that Spates played a managerial role in the conspiracy for which he was convicted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government presented evidence demonstrating that while Spates was incarcerated for an unrelated offense, and for a period following his incarceration, he directed several of his co-conspirators to sell drugs to his former clients. Spates argues on appeal that the evidence showed only that he suggested to his family and friends that they sell cocaine to one of his clients while he was incarcerated, without managing them in their attempts to do so. However, the record reflects Spates was actively involved in the drug transactions committed by his co-conspirators outside of his presence, that he communicated with them about the transactions, and that they conducted these drug sales on Spates\u2019s behalf. Accordingly, the district court finding that Spates was eligible for a three-level increase as manager of the scheme was not clearly erroneous, and we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-13\">. While we review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines, <em>United States v. Barakat, </em>130 F.3d 1448, 1452 (11th Cir.1997), the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense is a finding of fact that we review for clear error, <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
