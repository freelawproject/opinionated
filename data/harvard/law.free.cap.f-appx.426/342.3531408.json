Glover argued that he was actually innocent of his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act because his prior Nevada conviction for larceny from a person was not a violent felony in light of <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). His \u00a7 2241 petition also challenged the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-18\">As a general rule, a federal prisoner who seeks to collaterally challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence must file a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005). Such claims may be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) only if the prisoner shows that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e). Glover has not made such a showing, as he has not established that his claims are based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establishing that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-19\">Moreover, a claim of actual innocence of a career offender enhancement is not a claim of actual innocence of the crime of conviction and, thus, not the type of claim that warrants review under \u00a7 2241. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213-14 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426-27. Finally, any challenge to the denial of Glover\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion must be raised in the Tenth Circuit, the court of appeals for the circuit in which his \u00a7 2255 proceeding was held. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a). Glover has not shown that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 based on the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
