Lampe, seeks to recover the amount of the loans plus interest from defendants \u2014 Lampe\u2019s other lending bank and its vice president \u2014 under the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, \u00a7 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a)], \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b)], and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Commission [17 CFR \u00a7 240.10b-5], as well as under the state common law of fraud. The questions before us on this appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants First National Bank of Lake Forest (Lake Forest) and James F. Herber are (1) whether the federal securities laws extend to a commercial loan transaction, when the loan is evidenced by promissory notes and secured by stock collateral, and if so (2) whether defendants are liable under the above antifraud provisions. The district court answered the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants without reaching the second issue addressed by the district court as we conclude that Lincoln lacks standing to sue under \u00a7 17(a), \u00a7 10(b), or Rule 10b \u2014 5. Our holding, of course, does not touch on the merits of Lincoln\u2019s cause of action against defendants under the state common law of fraud, which Lincoln is free to pursue in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-20\">Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 prohibit any fraud \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\u201d Section 17(a) prohibits fraud \u201cin the offer or sale of any securi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>ties.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lincoln claims that these provisions apply to a commercial loan such as the one here involved on two separate theories: (1) that the promissory notes evidencing the debt constitute \u201csecurities\u201d which were fraudulently \u201csold\u201d to it by Lampe or, alternatively, (2) that certain stock certificates (later discovered to be counterfeit) which were pledged by Lampe as collateral for the loan were in effect \u201csold\u201d by Lampe to the plaintiff bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">The district court disposed of the first argument on the ground that the promissory notes were of a \u201ccommercial\u201d rather than \u201cinvestment\u201d character and hence were not \u201csecurities\u201d under the 1933 Act or 1934 Act. We adopt the district court\u2019s opinion on this issue, which we believe is in accord with this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>C. N. S. Enterprises, Inc. v. G. &amp; G. Enterprises, Inc., </em>508 F.2d 1354 (7th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">In the second theory advanced for coverage of the securities laws, the district court found merit, according Lincoln standing to sue under the cited antifraud provisions in its capacity as a pledgee of securities. In support of its holding extending the protection of the securities laws beyond the traditional category of purchasers or sellers of securities, see <em>Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., </em>193 F.2d 461 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 U.S. 956, 72 S.Ct. 1051, 96 L.Ed. 1356 (1952) and <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975), the district court cited two recent opinions of the Second Circuit, <em>Mallis </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., </em>568 F.2d 824 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. granted, </em>431 U.S. 928, 97 S.Ct. 2630, 53 L.Ed.2d 243, <em>cert. dismissed as improvidently granted sub nom. Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, </em>435 U.S. 381, 98 S.Ct. 1117, 55 L.Ed.2d 357 (1978), and <em>United States v. Gentile, </em>530 F.2d 461 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 936, 96 S.Ct. 2651, 49 L.Ed.2d 388 (1976). We respectfully disagree with the broad holding of those two cases that any pledge of a security is a \u201csale\u201d for purposes of the antifraud provisions of the securities acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-12\">\n<em>Statutory Language</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-13\">An analysis of the proper scope of the securities laws should begin with the language of the statutes involved. <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. </em>Redington,\u2014U.S\u2014, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979); <em>Teamsters v. Daniel, supra, </em>439 U.S. 551, 99 S.Ct. 790, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979). If a pledge is included within the statutory definition of \u201csale,\u201d the present transaction would literally fall within a prohibition of any fraud in the \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d of a security, since there is no question that even counterfeit securities such as the ones here involved are \u201csecurities\u201d under the 1933 and 1934 Acts. <em>Seeman v. United States, </em>90 F.2d 88, 89, (5th Cir. 1937); <em>Lincoln National Bank v. Lampe, </em>414 F.Supp. 1270, 1277 (N.D.Ill. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-16\">The 1933 Act contains no definition of \u201cpurchase\u201d but states that \u201c[t]he term \u2018sale\u2019 or \u2018sell\u2019 shall include every contract of sale or disposition of a security or interest in a security, for value.\u201d The Securities Act of 1933, \u00a7 2(3). The 1934 Act contains the following definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-17\">(13) The terms \u201cbuy\u201d and \u201cpurchase\u201d each include any contract to buy, purchase, or otherwise acquire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-18\">(14) The terms \u201csale\u201d or \u201csell\u201d each include any contract to sell or otherwise dispose of.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1132-19\">Securities Exchange Act of 1934, \u00a7\u00a7 3(a)(13) and (14). At common law, a pledge would be readily distinguishable from a sale since a pledge involves a transfer of possession only, not of title. But the above-quoted statutory definitions of \u201csale\u201d would appear broad enough to embrace a transfer of a security interest in stock since a \u201csale\u201d under the 1933 Act includes \u201cevery . disposition of a[n] . . . interest in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>security, for value.\u201d The \u201cor otherwise dispose of\u201d language of the 1934 Act definition could also be interpreted to extend to a pledge transaction, and we see no reason not to interpret the definitions of the two acts in the same fashion. <em>National Bank of Commerce of Dallas v. All American Assurance Co., </em>583 F.2d 1295, 1298 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\">The literal inclusion of pledge transactions within the statutory definition of \u201csale\u201d is not dispositive of the question before us, however, in view of the provision in both Acts that the definitions apply \u201cunless the context otherwise requires.\u201d Securities Act \u00a7 2 and Securities Exchange Act \u00a7 3. A \u201ccontext over text\u201d approach to construction of the securities acts has been taken by a number of courts, particularly in determining whether a note constitutes a \u201csecurity,\u201d an issue very similar to the question now before us to the extent that it demands resolution of the proper scope of the securities laws. See, e. <em>g., C. N. S. Enterprises, </em>supra; and <em>McClure v. First National Bank of Lubbock, </em>497 F.2d 490 (5th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 930, 95 S.Ct. 1132, 43 L.Ed.2d 402 (1975). Likewise, the Supreme Court has rejected literal application of the securities laws in favor of an analysis looking to underlying economic realities, see <em>Teamsters v. Daniel, supra, </em>and <em>United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, </em>421 U.S. 837, 849, 95 S.Ct. 2051, 44 L.Ed.2d 621 (1975), and consistency with the purposes for which the legislation was enacted, <em>see, e. g., Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., </em>430 U.S. 1, 35, 97 S.Ct. 926, 51 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-6\">As will be more fully developed below, the reality of the transaction here involved is that Lincoln sought to lend money on the security of certain stocks, not to invest in those stocks; and the purpose of the 1933 and 1934 Acts is to protect investors, not secured lenders such as Lincoln.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-7\">\n<em>The Legislative History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-8\">The 1933 and 1934 Acts were passed by the same Congress and should be considered together as one body of law. See <em>Tcherepnin v. Knight, </em>389 U.S. 332, 342, 88 S.Ct. 548, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967). It is very clear from the legislative history of the Acts that they were passed to protect the <em>investor. </em>The Senate Report on the bill which, with changes, was to become the 1933 Act stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-13\">The purpose of this bill is to protect the investing public and honest business. The basic policy is that of informing the investor of the facts concerning securities to be offered for sale in interstate and foreign commerce and providing protection against fraud and misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-14\">The aim is to prevent further exploitation of the public by the sale of unsound, fraudulent, and worthless securities through misrepresentation; to place adequate and true information before the investor; to protect honest enterprise, seeking capital by honest presentation, against the competition afforded by dishonest securities offered to the public through \u2022 crooked promotion; to restore the confidence of the prospective investor in his ability to select sound securities; to bring into productive channels of industry and development capital which has grown timid to the point of hoarding; and to aid in providing employment and restoring buying and consuming power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-15\">It is the conviction of the committee that these aims may be largely achieved upon the basis of fidelity to truth. Confidence must and may be restored upon the enduring basis of honesty with the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZGW\">S.Rep.No.47, 73d Cong., 1st Sess., to accompany S. 875, April 27, 1933. See also H.R. Rep.No.85, 73d Cong., 1st Sess., to accompany H.R. 5480, May 4, 1933; and 77 Cong. Rec. 2983 (1933) (statement of Sen. Fletcher, who introduced the bill.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1133-16\">The 1933 Act sought to protect the investor from the enormous losses that had been suffered as a result of investing in worthless securities by requiring issuers to furnish prospective investors with full infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>mation concerning the new offering prior to selling it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">The 1934 Act extends the full disclosure policy of the 1933 Act to the subsequent trading of securities in the secondary market. In addition, it regulates the securities markets and a variety of practices affecting the securities markets in order to prevent recurrence of the excesses that were viewed as responsible for the stock market crash of 1929.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> One of the 1934 Act\u2019s concerns is with controlling the amount of the nation\u2019s credit that goes into the securities markets, but there is no evidence that Congress was concerned with the use of credit for other purposes. Lampe borrowed the $842,000 in order to acquire additional operating capital for Spaco, Inc., which he controlled, and to pay down an outstanding loan \"of $625,000 from Lake Forest. Use of the funds for such purposes clearly would not affect the securities m\u00e1rkets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">The legislative history of the provisions defining \u201csale\u201d also reveals no hint of a Congressional intent to regulate transactions involving a pledge of securities although this result could easily have been achieved by including pledges within the definition of \u201csale\u201d as was done in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 79b(a)(23) (definition) and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 797 (d) (antifraud provision). The definition of \u201csale\u201d was not a topic to which much attention was devoted during the course of the hearings on the Acts, but considerable legislative effort was nevertheless expended in drafting the definition, as evidenced by the length of the original definition, which was gradually pared down until it reached its present form.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Though quite comprehensive, the original definition significantly did not contain any reference to pledge transactions. Likewise, a thorough discussion of the term \u201csale\u201d in the House Report on the bill does not mention pledge transactions at all.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-10\">In sum, Congress\u2019s intent was to regulate investment transactions and transactions affecting the securities markets, not commercial loan transactions such as the one here involved which would have no impact on the securities markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-11\">\n<em>\u201cCommercial\u201d v. \u201cInvestment\u201d Risk</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A_V\">In <em>Mallis </em>and <em>Gentile, supra, </em>the Second Circuit reasoned that in conditioning a loan on the taking out of a security interest in stocks belonging to the borrower, a bank is making an investment decision because it is assuming the risk that the stock has value and will continue to have value. We do not dispute the existence of a risk; however the risk is taken for the purpose of making a loan, not for the purpose of investing in the securities. It is true that the bank may acquire title to the securities in the event of default, but the bank enters in to the transaction in the first place upon the calculated risk that default will not occur. The purpose or motive of a transaction has been given controlling weight by the Supreme Court in two recent cases. In <em>United Housing v. Forman, supra, </em>the Court held that shares in a housing cooperative were not \u201csecurities\u201d \u2014 even though the possibility of profit existed from the leasing of commercial and professional space, tax benefits, and government subsidies \u2014 because tenants bought the shares in order to acquire housing, not in order to participate in the profits of the cooperative. In <em>Teamsters v. Daniel, supra, </em>the Court held that an employee\u2019s participation in a noncontributory, compul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>sory pension plan did not constitute a \u201csecurity\u201d or \u201cinvestment contract\u201d because in taking the job the employee seeks to obtain a livelihood, not to make an investment for the future. In both of these cases, the securities laws could have been found to apply in a literal sense, but the Court looked to the underlying economic realities of the transactions. One transaction was primarily a housing transaction, the other was an employment transaction \u2014 neither was entered into as an investment, although that may have been an incidental benefit. Similarly here we have a loan transaction, and the possibility that the lender may end up owning the securities in the event of default does not change the basic character of the transaction. In <em>United Housing </em>the Court recognized that there are different kinds of risk, 421 U.S. at 857 n. 24, 95 S.Ct. 2051, and we hold that the risk here assumed by Lincoln was not an investment risk but the ordinary commercial risk incident to a loan transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"ahp-dedup-1\">Without analyzing the legislative history or placing the definition of \u201csale\u201d within the context of the Congressional concerns addressed by the securities legislation of 1933 and 1934, the <em>Gentile </em>and <em>Mallis </em>decisions adopted a literal reading of the definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-6\">In <em>Gentile, </em>the Second Circuit sustained defendant\u2019s conviction on a number of counts of securities fraud under the 1933 Act, including a count alleging fraud in connection with the pledge of securities as collateral for a bank loan. The pledge transaction was found to be covered by \u00a7 17(a)\u2019s prohibition of fraud in the \u201csale\u201d of a security. The court reasoned, first, that the 1933 Act definition of \u201csale\u201d literally included a pledge of a security and that a court should not go beyond the literal language of the statute in a criminal case. Secondly, it relied on <em>SEC v. Guild Films Company, Inc., </em>279 F.2d 485 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Santa Monica Bank v. SEC, </em>364 U.S. 819, 81 S.Ct. 52, 5 L.Ed.2d 49 (1960), which had held that \u201csale\u201d included pledges in the course of holding that a pledgee could not sell stock collateral to the public, having originally accepted the collateral with the intention of so doing, without becoming a statutory \u201cunderwriter\u201d subject to the registration requirements of the 1933 Act. The case has been much criticized on the ground that its broad holding on the \u201csale\u201d issue was not necessary in view of the court\u2019s finding that the pledgee accepted the stock in bad faith with a view to distributing it. <em>See, e. g., </em>I Loss, Securities Regulation 645-651 (1961 ed.). A decision relating to a bad faith pledge and the registration requirements of the 1933 Act has no bearing in a case involving a pledge accepted in good faith and arising under the anti-fraud provisions of the securities acts. In <em>SEC v. National Securities, Inc., </em>393 U.S. 453, 466, 89 S.Ct. 564, 571-72, 21 L.Ed.2d 668 (1969), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1135-8\">The meaning of particular phrases must be determined in context. . . . Congress itself has cautioned that the same words may take on a different coloration in different sections of the securities laws; both the 1933 and 1934 Acts preface their lists of general definitions with the phrase \u201cunless the context otherwise requires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1135-10\">Finally, the <em>Gentile </em>court reasoned that the risk taken by the holder of securities collateral that the securities will maintain their value is a risk identical to the risk taken by the investor. 530 F.2d at 467. As pointed out above, we disagree with this analysis. Risk there is, but the risk is not an <em>investment </em>risk. It is the ordinary <em>commercial </em>risk taken by any secured lender. The risk that the pledgor does not own the collateral he purports to own exists no matter what the nature of the collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-11\">In <em>Mallis </em>the Second Circuit again held that a pledge of stock constitutes a \u201csale,\u201d this time in a civil action under the anti-fraud provisions of both the 1933 and 1934 Acts. The facts of that case, however, were very different from the facts now before us. Two dentists lent $156,000 to a lawyer and his client in order to enable the latter to purchase shares of Equity National Industries, Inc., owned by the Kates but held in an escrow account by Bankers Trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>Company. In knowing violation of the terms of the escrow agreement requiring return of the shares to Equity National for cancellation, Bankers Trust released the shares so that the Kates could sell them to the lawyer. The latter in turn pledged the shares to the dentists as security for the loan. The lawyer defaulted! ..and it turned out that the shares were worthless since they had been cancelled by Equity National. The dentists theri sued Bankers Trust for fraud in connection with the sale of a security. <em>Mallis </em>is distinguishable from the pres\u00e9nt case because there was a sale of securities, so there is no question that the purchaser could sue under the antifraud provisions. The only question is who the real purchaser was. Although the lawyer was the nominal purchaser, the dentists furnished all the money and are the ones who are \u201cout of pocket\u201d on the transaction. Regardless of the resolution of the latter issue, the fraud in <em>Mallis </em>was \u201cin connection with the . . . sale of [a] security\u201d whereas the very question which must be answered in the present case is whether there was a \u201csale\u201d at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">In rejecting the approach of the Second Circuit, we agree with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s position in <em>National Bank of Commerce of Dallas v. All American Assurance Co., </em>583 F.2d 1295 (5th Cir. 1978), and <em>McClure v. First National Bank of Lubbock, </em>497 F.2d 490 (5th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 930, 95 S.Ct. 1132, 43 L.Ed.2d 402 (1975), that a \u201csale\u201d of the securities does not occur at the time the securities are pledged. It is possible that a sale may occur at a later point if the pledgee in fact forecloses on the stock after default on the loan, for then title actually passes and the pledgee becomes an unwilling purchaser of the stock. We do not address the question of whether a \u201cpurchase\u201d takes place upon foreclosure, however, for here there has been no foreclosure, and we decline to adopt the district court\u2019s doctrine of \u201cconstructive foreclosure.\u201d See 414 F.Supp. at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-7\">\n<em>State Regulation of Secured Transactions Involving Securities Collateral</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">The final consideration counselling against extension of the antifraud provisions of the 1933 and 1934 Acts to the situation where securities are fraudulently pledged as collateral for a bank loan is that state law already extensively occupies the field. This would be a further indication that Congress never intended to extend the antifraud provisions to pledge transactions as well as a sound policy reason not to extend the federal securities laws into this area, as there is no apparent need.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-9\">Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, adopted in Illinois, regulates secured transactions, including those involving securities collateral. See UCC \u00a7\u00a7 9-102(l)(a) (Article applies to security interests in \u201cinstruments\u201d) and 9-105(l)(i) (\u201cinstrument\u201d includes a security). Among other provisions, Article 9 defines the rights, duties, and remedies of a pledgee upon default. \u00a7\u00a7 9-501 to 9-507. Article 8, regulating transfers of investment securities, would also apply. Various provisions of this article would pertain to the rights of a \u201cpurchaser\u201d of counterfeit securities. \u00a7\u00a7 8-301, 8-306, 8-316, 8-320. A \u201cpurchaser\u201d is expressly defined as including a pledgee. \u00a7\u00a7 1-201(32) and (33).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition to any state rights or remedies afforded Lincoln under the UCC, it can pursue its claim against defendants under the state common law of fraud or any other applicable provision of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-10\">State regulation of a field and the availability of remedies under state law have both been considered by the Supreme Court in a number of recent decisions declining to imply a private right of action under various sections of the securities laws. <em>See, e. g., Santa Fe Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>430 U.S. 462, 97 S.Ct. 1292, 51 L.Ed.2d 480 (1977); <em>Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., </em>430 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 926, 51 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977); <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">In sum, the legislative history of the 1983 and 1934 Acts is devoid of any indication of an intent to regulate pledges of securities; the Second Circuit decisions extending the Acts to such transactions ar\u00e9. distinguishable, and to the extent they are not we disagree with their conclusion that a pledgee of stocks takes an \u201cinvestment\u201d \u00a1 risk; state law adequately covers the area; and recent Supreme Court decisions have manifested a reluctance to expand the federal securities laws absent a clear indication of Congressional intent or a need to do so to accomplish the purposes of the legislation. We therefore hold that a pledge of securities is not a \u201csale\u201d for purposes of invoking the antifraud provisions of the 1933 and 1934 Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">The decision of the District Court granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1131-15\">.
