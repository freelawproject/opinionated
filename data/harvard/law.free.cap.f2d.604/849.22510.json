Hence the right to protection was limited to areas where it had been used and the claimant of the mark had carried on business. <em>Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, </em>240 U.S. 403, 412-20, 36 S.Ct. 357, 60 L.Ed. 713 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-27\">After the Lanham Act, nationwide protection was extended to registered marks, regardless of the area in which the registrant actually used the mark, because under 15 U.S.C. 1072 registration constituted constructive notice to competing users. <em>Dawn Donut Co. v. Hart's Food Stores, </em>267 F.2d 358, 362 (C.A.2, 1959). However, as held in that case, the protection is only potential in areas where the registrant in fact does not do business. A competing user could use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>the mark there until the registrant extended its business to the area. Thereupon the registrant would be entitled to exclusive use of the mark and to injunctive relief against its continued use by prior users in that area. <em>Ibid., </em>360, 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">After a mark has become incontestable after five years\u2019 continuous use after registration (15 U.S.C. 1065), registration becomes conclusive evidence of the registrant\u2019s exclusive right to use the mark except where one of seven specified \u201cdefenses or defects is established,\u201d including, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cThat the mark . . . was adopted without knowledge of the registrant\u2019s prior use and has been continuously used . from a date prior to registration . <em>Provided, however, </em>That this defense or defect shall apply only for the area in which such continuous prior use is proved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Registration does not become incontestable with respect to a party whose prior use within a particular area dates from a time prior to publication of registrant\u2019s mark pursuant to the Lanham Act. In such a case the prior user has exclusive use in the area where it has done business before the publication by registrant. 15 U.S.C. 1065; <em>Wrist-Rocket Mfg. Co. v. Saunders Archery Co., </em>578 F.2d 727, 731 (C.A.8, 1978);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Holiday Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inn, </em>364 F.Supp. 775, 785 (D.S.C.1973), aff\u2019d 498 F.2d 1397 (C.A.4, 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">We proceed to application of these rules to the facts in the case at bar, as found by the District Court in a non-jury trial. The evidence adduced was conflicting and far from uniformly clear and credible, but for present purposes we may consider the following facts to have been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Plaintiff first used the mark \u201cSubway\u201d in August, 1968, in connection with its first restaurant in Washington, D. C. Since April 8, 1969, it has used the mark \u201cArmand\u2019s Subway,\u201d not \u201cSubway\u201d <em>simpliciter. </em>Plaintiff holds an incontestable registration, issued September 29, 1970, for the mark \u201cArmand\u2019s Subway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">Defendant began operating in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1965 under the name \u201cPete\u2019s Submarines.\u201d Soon it adopted the name \u201cSubway,\u201d systematically changing all its signs accordingly beginning in August, 1967. Defendant\u2019s business is limited to \u201csubmarine sandwiches;\u201d plaintiff also serves hamburgers and other items. Defendant\u2019s advertising and decor emphasizes the theme of subway transportation, naming sandwiches IRT, BMT, and for other well-known subway systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">Defendant filed an application for registration of \u201cSubway\u201d on May 13, 1974. On December 11, 1974, the Patent Office rejected the application because of conflict with plaintiff\u2019s registration. This was the occasion of defendant\u2019s first knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s use of the mark. Defendant amended its application so as to provide for concurrent use. [See 15 U.S.C. 1052(d)]. The proceeding before the Patent Office is in abeyance pending decision of the instant litigation. Defendant declared its willingness to cease use of the mark in the Washington area. After knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s registration, defendant expanded out of Connecticut, and by means of franchising, operates approximately 125 stores, in many States. Plaintiff has not expanded outside of the Washington area. In 1976 and 1977 (after knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s registration), defendant established several outlets in the Washington area.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">In view of the foregoing facts and legal rules, it would seem that defendant is entitled to exclusive use of the mark \u201cSubway\u201d in the Connecticut area. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>tiff is entitled to exclusive use of the mark \u201cArmand\u2019s Subway\u201d in the Washington area. Plaintiff by virtue of prior registration is also entitled to nationwide use of that mark, unless such use in Connecticut would generate \u201cconfusion\u201d with defendant\u2019s rights based upon prior use of its mark there; but in no case would plaintiff be entitled to injunctive relief<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> except in the area actually penetrated by plaintiff. Defendant\u2019s expansion would be vulnerable if plaintiff should expand (assuming that infringement by reason of \u201cconfusion\u201d were found to arise in the contested area).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The District Court, after correctly pointing out that the statutory test for trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. 1114(1) is whether defendant\u2019s use of a mark is \u201clikely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive,\u201d went on to inquire whether there would be \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d arising from defendant\u2019s use of the mark \u201cSubway\u201d in competition with plaintiff\u2019s mark \u201cArmand\u2019s Subway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">In reaching a negative answer to this question the District Court relied upon the assumption that \u201cin sandwich language \u2018Subway\u2019 really refers to what some call a \u2018Submarine Sandwich\u2019 . . . \u2018Armand\u2019s\u2019 is the name customers refer to. One would not go to \u2018Armand\u2019s\u2019 and ask for an \u2018Armand\u2019s Subway Hamburger\u2019 . but would ask for a hamburger, just as having gone to Armand\u2019s because one liked his subway sandwiches, would ask for a subway . . . \u201d The District Court thus concluded also that plaintiff had \u201cabandoned any right to the name \u2018SUBWAY\u2019 alone \u2014 if it could have established an exclusive right to such a name \u2014 and it cannot now complain of the use by another. In fact, one who had used it prior to plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX7\">The District Court accordingly held:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-13\">1. That the \u00abmark \u201cSUBWAY\u201d is not subject to a registration under the evidence in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-14\">2. That the use of the mark \u201cSUBWAY\u201d does not infringe upon the registered mark \u201cARMAND\u2019S SUBWAY,\u201d and would not confuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-15\">3. That Doctor\u2019s was the first and pri- or use of the mark \u201cSUBWAY.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-16\">4. That even if it be conceded that there was any improper use of the registered mark \u201cARMAND\u2019S SUBWAY\u201d by using the mark \u201cSUBWAY\u201d in the District and Arlington, Doctor\u2019s, having been the first user of the mark \u201cSUBWAY,\u201d plaintiff would only be entitled to injunc-tive relief upon a showing that there is confusion by the use of the mark, or that it interfered with plaintiff\u2019s use and rights, and if and when such is shown, an injunction would only be proper in this case to enjoin use of such mark in Washington and Arlington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-17\">5. The complaint is therefore DISMISSED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-18\">On appeal plaintiff contends that injunc-tive relief should have been granted, upon the ground that defendant\u2019s mark is likely to cause confusion, and hence infringement of plaintiff\u2019s mark.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-19\">Both parties assign as error (and correctly, in our opinion) the trial judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>conclusion that \u201cSubway\u201d refers merely to a \u201csubmarine sandwich.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> From this it would follow that plaintiff\u2019s mark is really merely the name \u201cArmand\u2019s.\u201d It would also follow that defendant can not use \u201cSubway\u201d as a trade mark, because of its generic nature. This prejudges the outcome of defendant\u2019s pending registration proceeding before the Patent Office (which is held in abeyance pending decision of the case at bar). These views of the trial judge prevented appropriate consideration and evaluation of the issue whether there was conflict or confusion between the respective marks \u201cArmand\u2019s Subway\u201d and \u201cSubway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">It seems plain, however, that \u201cSubway\u201d could be (and, defendant urges, is) used in a fanciful<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> manner suitable for trademark protection, based upon the literal meaning of the word as a transportation agency, a theme defendant emphasizes in advertising and decor. This can be demonstrated by assuming that instead of \u201cSubway\u201d a name were taken from another form of transportation, such as \u201cRiverboat\u201d or \u201cStagecoach.\u201d Might there not be possible confusion between the marks \u201cRiverboat\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and \u201cArmand\u2019s Riverboat?\u201d It should be noted that defendant objected to the use of the name \u201cSaratoga Subway\u201d by a competitor in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Accordingly the case must be remanded for appropriate determination of this issue, which is vital to the question of infringement. Perhaps it would be advisable for the District Court to stay its hand entirely with respect to the instant litigation until the Patent Office has determined whether defendant is entitled to registration of its mark \u201cSubway\u201d and if so under what conditions. The decision of the Patent Office, as well as stipulations and admissions by the parties in connection with the proceeding there, might simplify the remaining problems and perhaps entirely eliminate some matters (hopefully the whole litigation) from the necessity of subsequent judicial determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">\n<em>Remanded for appropriate proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-19\">. In No. 78-1616 plaintiff, Armand\u2019s Subway, Inc., is appellant; in No. 78-1617 defendants, Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Robert J. Galliano, have appealed. For simplicity (the Gallianos being franchisees of Doctor\u2019s in the Washington area) we shall speak of \u201cdefendant\u201d in the singular.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-9\">. For an earlier opinion in the same case see 516 F.2d 846 (C.A.8. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b942-10\">. In delineating geographical areas for trademark use, whole States are the usual unit. <em>Wrist-Rocket, supra, </em>578 F.2d at 732; <em>Hanover Star Milling Co., supra, </em>240 U.S. at 416, 36 S.Ct. 357. This may be a historical survival of the origin of trademark protection as part of the law of unfair competition. Perhaps individual areas less than statewide might be appropriate under certain circumstances. The sandwich shops in the instant case draw walk-in trade from a small surrounding area. The manufacture of brick is another local industry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>where high transportation costs limit penetration of a wide market.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b943-10\">. Injunctive relief under 15 U.S.C. 1116 must conform to \u201cthe principles of equity.\u201d Also, infringement requires that use of the mark \u201cis likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d 15 U.S.C. 1114(l)(a). Hence if the District Court, by application of appropriate criteria, finds that use of \u201cSubway\u201d by defendant, in the Washington area does not cause \u201cconfusion,\u201d plaintiff would be entitled to no relief whatever in that area. Future in-junctive relief in other areas to which plaintiff might expand would also be precluded by absence of \u201cconfusion\u201d between the marks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b943-20\">. Subsidiary contentions were advanced, which in view of our disposition of the case, need not be discussed: (1) that injunctive relief should have been granted to enforce defendant\u2019s agreement to abandon use of its mark in the Washington area; (2) that it was error to hold that, if there were any infringement, relief should be confined to the Washington area; (3) that defendant\u2019s conduct was unfair competition and violated 15 U.S.C. 1125(a) prohibiting \u201cfalse designation of origin;\u201d and (4) that plaintiff should have been granted monetary damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b944-6\">. This is the sole issue raised by defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b944-19\">.
