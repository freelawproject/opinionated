This alleged first amendment violation stemmed from the potential application to the plaintiffs\u2019 planned demonstration of a Louisiana statute requiring the posting of a ten thousand dollar bond,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a municipal ordinance prohibiting chanting and the use of amplifiers in public demonstrations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Southern University rules forbidding marches by unrecognized student organizations such as the Iranian Students Association. Fearing possible criminal and disciplinary proceedings by state and university officials, the plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Subsequent to obtaining a temporary restraining order which enjoined the University\u2019s interference with the demonstration and the State\u2019s enforcement of its bond requirement and its prohibition against amplification, the parties entered into a consent agreement with the approval of the district court. This consent decree amended the university rules by deleting official recognition of an organization as a prerequisite to obtaining permission to march and by adding a provision that recognizes the students\u2019 right to engage in peaceful protests.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">After acquiring this relief, the plaintiffs moved to recover attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988 (West Supp.1979) which, in pertinent part, provides that \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section [] . . . 1983 . of this title . . , the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d The district court denied this motion on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 had shown neither probable success on the merits, nor a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d to justify the imposition of attorney\u2019s fees on the defendant. The plaintiffs appeal this denial. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">It is well settled that a plaintiff prevailing in actions subject to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 is ordinarily entitled to attorney\u2019s fees unless special circumstances exist to render such an award unjust. <em>See, e. g., Criterion Club of Albany v. Board of Commissioners, </em>594 F.2d 118, 120 (5th Cir.), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>No. 78-3066 (5th Cir. June 20, 1979); <em>Bunn v. Central Realty of Louisiana, </em>592 F.2d 891, 892 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Morrow v. Dillard, </em>580 F.2d 1284, 1300 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Brown v. Culpepper, </em>559 F.2d 274, 277 (5th Cir. 1977). Furthermore, a plaintiff can be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d even though the relief he has obtained is only preliminary, <em>see, e. g., Howard v. Phelps, </em>443 F.Supp. 374 (E.D.La.1978), or is the result of a consent decree. <em>See, e. g., Criterion Club of Albany v. Board of Commissioners, supra, </em>at 120; <em>Brown v. Culpepper, supra </em>at 277. The proper focus is whether the plaintiff has been successful on the central issue, <em>Howard v. Phelps, supra </em>at 376, as exhibited by the fact that he has acquired the primary relief sought. <em>See Criterion Club of Albany v. Board of Commissioners, supra </em>at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">Applying this standard to the case at bar, the plaintiffs are clearly entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. They both sought and received immunity from the state\u2019s bonding requirement and prohibition against amplification, and they eliminated the university\u2019s requirement of recognition as a prereq<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>uisite to a permissible demonstration. The plaintiffs were thus \u201cprevailing parties\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and since no special circumstances exist, an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs is in order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">In determining the proper amount of this award on remand, the district court should be guided by the factors enunciated in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974), and give due regard to the parties\u2019 stipulation. Furthermore, the district court should award the plaintiffs their costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in prosecuting this appeal. <em>See Morrow v. Dillard, supra </em>at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-9\">. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West 1974) provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b445-15\">.
