(the oil companies) appeal from a district court ruling that it was without jurisdiction to review a determination of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that portions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 7401 <em>et seq. </em>(West Supp.1979), should apply to certain activities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Exxon and Chevron have also filed petitions for review of the same EPA determination. We reverse the district court\u2019s ruling and remand the appealed cases for further proceedings; <em>wo </em>dismiss the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">This controversy arises out of the oil com panies\u2019 joint development of their oil and gas leases on the OCS, 3.2 miles off Santa Barbara County, California. Exxon operates the combined leases, known as the \u201cSanta Ynez Unit.\u201d Under plans for development of the Unit, approved by the Department of the Interior, Exxon has constructed an offshore drilling and production platform (Platform Hondo). Exxon is currently pursuing one of two alternative plans for treatment of the oil produced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This plan calls for construction of a floating offshore storage and treatment facility (OS&amp;T) next to the platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">In September 1976, the EPA requested information concerning estimated emissions from the OS&amp;T. Exxon furnished the information but contested the EPA\u2019s jurisdiction over activities on the OCS. Subsequently, the EPA proposed conditions regulating air emissions from the OS&amp;T as part of a draft water discharge permit to be issued by EPA pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1251 <em>et seq. </em>The water permit was ultimately issued without the air quality conditions. In correspondence beginning the latter part of 1977, however, the EPA claimed that the OS&amp;T was subject to certain provisions of the CAA and stated that the OS&amp;T required an air pollution permit under the CAA. Exxon maintained that the EPA had no jurisdiction over the OS&amp;T. In January 1978, the EPA wrote Exxon that its prior determinations were tentative and that its deliberations on the matter were not yet complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-11\">In February 1978, the oil companies sought review of the EPA position by filing a motion for leave to file a counterclaim in a suit pending in the district court which the State of California had brought against the Department of the Interior and the oil companies to halt operation of the OS&amp;T. The oil companies also sought leave to join the EPA as a party. The district judge denied the motion, ruling, among other things, that the counterclaim was not ripe. He further ruled that, if ripe, the EPA\u2019s determination was reviewable not by the district court but by either this court or the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-12\">On April 18, 1978, the EPA published in the Federal Register a \u201cNotice of final determination of applicability\u201d which concluded in part that the proposed installation of the OS&amp;T is \u201csubject to review under the new source review [NSR] and prevention of significant deterioration [PSD] provisions of the Clean Air Act . . . and EPA\u2019s implementing regulations.\u201d 43 Fed.Reg. 16393 (April 18, 1978) (citations omitted). The EPA concluded that portions of California\u2019s state implementation plan (SIP) for the maintenance of certain air quality standards, required by section 110 of the CAA, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7410 (West Supp.1979), should be applied to the platform, but that in the absence of EPA-approved NSR and PSD provisions in the California SIP, NSR and PSD standards promulgated by the EPA would apply. <em>Id. </em>at 16397. The oil companies again moved for leave to file a counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>claim and for a preliminary injunction. The district judge denied the motions, stating that although the issue was \u201cripe for immediate relief,\u201d it should be resolved in the court of appeals. The oil companies appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, Exxon and Chevron filed petitions for review of the EPA determination in this court, and Exxon, Chevron, and Shell filed petitions for review in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The EPA filed a motion to dismiss or transfer in the Exxon appeal and a motion to dismiss in the Chevron appeal. A motions panel of this court referred these motions to us for decision, and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ordered that the petitions filed in its court be held in abeyance pending our determination of the motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">In September 1978, Congress enacted extensive amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), among other things, directing the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to prescribe regulations \u201cfor compliance with the national ambient air quality standards pursuant to the Clean Air Act.\u201d OCSLA \u00a7 5(a)(8), 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1334(a)(8) (West Supp.1979). In response, the Department of the Interior published a notice of proposed rulemaking \u201cto invite public participation in the identification and selection of a course of action . . . for the control of air emissions on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) that significantly affect the air quality of any State.\u201d 43 Fed.Reg. 60612 (Dec. 28, 1978). In May 1979, the Department announced public hearings and proposed revisions to 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 250 for oil and gas and sulphur operations in the OCS. 44 Fed.Reg. 27448, 27449 (May 10, 1979). With the factual setting complete, we now address the questions before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">We first examine our jurisdiction over these cases. While none of the parties has raised this issue, we observe that we properly have jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), over the appeals from the district court. The district court\u2019s June 7 ruling denied the oil companies leave to file a counterclaim and the preliminary and permanent injunctive relief sought. The court stated that jurisdiction lay not in the district court, but in the court of appeals. <em>General Elec. Co. v. Marvel Rare Metals Co., </em>287 U.S. 430, 53 S.Ct. 202, 77 L.Ed. 408 (1932), held that the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of a counterclaim that sought injunctive relief was appealable because the court in that case \u201cnecessarily decided that upon the facts alleged in the counterclaim defendants were not entitled to an injunction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 53 S.Ct. at 204. In reliance upon <em>General Electric, </em>we have held that the denial of leave to file a counterclaim seeking an injunction is an appealable interlocutory order. <em>In-a-Floor Safe Co. v. Diebold Safe &amp; Lock Co., </em>91 F.2d 341, 342 (9th Cir. 1937). The Supreme Court recently stated that section 1292(a)(1) \u201cdoes not embrace orders that have no direct or irreparable impact on the merits of the controversy,\u201d <em>Gardner v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., </em>437 U.S. 478, 482, 98 S.Ct. 2451, 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 364 (1978), and, in the same opinion, characterized the order in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number><em>General Electric </em>as one which \u201centirely disposed of the defendant\u2019s prayer for injunc-tive relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481, 98 S.Ct. at 2454. Thus, <em>In-a-Floor Safe Co. </em>is still controlling in the circumstances presented by the appeals here, for the district court\u2019s asserted lack of jurisdiction in denying leave to file the counterclaim denied preliminary or permanent injunctive relief in any district court. Although the alleged claim was technically a proposed cross-claim with respect to the EPA, we think the reasoning applicable to this claim is the same as that which is applicable to the proposed counterclaim against California. The district court\u2019s order had the impact required by <em>General Electric </em>and Gardner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">The central jurisdictional question here, however, involves two jurisdictional grants: one in the OCSLA, the other in the CAA. The oil companies claim that their appeals from the district court are based on the jurisdictional grant in section 23 of the OCSLA, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1349(b)(1) (West Supp.1979).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-6\">[T]he district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction of cases and controversies arising out of, or in connection with (A) any operation conducted on the outer Continental Shelf which involves exploration, development, or production of the minerals, of the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf Proceedings with respect to any such case or controversy may be instituted in the judicial district in which any defendant resides or may be found, or in the judicial district of the State nearest the place the cause of action arose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1283-10\">Exxon and Chevron claim that their petitions for review are based on the jurisdictional grant of section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, as amended, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (West Supp.1979), which specifies instances in which jurisdiction lies in the courts of appeals. This section states in part (footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-11\">A petition for review of [certain actions of the Administrator], or any other nationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final action taken, by the Administrator under this chapter may be filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. A petition for review of the Administrator\u2019s action [pursuant to certain sections of the CAA] or any other final action of the Administrator under this chapter (including any denial or disapproval by the Administrator under subchapter I of this chapter) which is locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence a petition for review of any action referred to in such sentence may be filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia if such action is based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action the Administrator finds and publishes that such action is based on such a determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>The EPA, in urging us to stay the direct appeals and dismiss or transfer the petitions for review, argues that we should simply assume that section 7607(b)(1) is applicable and that the EPA\u2019s determination qualifies as a \u201cfinal action\u201d under that section, thus leaving for our determination only the question whether our circuit or the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit should hear this case under that section. But we cannot so easily assume away questions crucial to the basis of our jurisdiction. Even were we to deal solely with the petitions for review, as the EPA suggests, the question whether a petition for review, rather than an action in the district court, is the proper course would, in our view, require initial resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">We begin our jurisdictional analysis by observing that a plain reading of section 1349 demonstrates that it applies in this case. The EPA argues, however, that the jurisdictional grant of the CAA applies exclusively to review of its determination, superseding the OCSLA grant. The oil companies assert, on the other hand, that section 1349 not only applies, but is the controlling jurisdictional grant. We might address this question by asking whether in this. case the EPA\u2019s determination falls within the provisions of section 7607(b)(1), directing court of appeals review. If we were to conclude it did, we would be faced with concurrent jurisdictional grants, each directing action in a different court, and would have to decide which, if either, controls. But we believe that even an inquiry into the applicability of section 7607(b)(1) begs a more fundamental question of congressional intent: whether Congress intended that the latter jurisdictional grant could even potentially apply where section 1349 is implicated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We believe the answer to this inquiry depends not so much on the precise language and legislative history of the grants themselves, but on the broader question of congressional intent with respect to the control of OCS air quality.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If EPA administration of OCS air quality control is inconsistent with that scheme, Congress could not have intended concurrent grants of jurisdiction with respect to regulation of such air quality and section 1349 alone applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-9\">We look first to the language of the 1978 amendments to the OCSLA. These amendments, which were the first major legislation to deal with the OCS since the initial enactment of the OCSLA in 1953, set forth a comprehensive scheme of regulation for the OCS. Congress stated, as part of its findings preceding those amendments, that \u201cthere presently exists a variety of technological, economic, environmental, administrative, and legal problems which tend to retard the development of the oil and natural gas reserves of the Outer Continental Shelf.\u201d OCSLA Amendments of 1978, \u00a7 101(8), 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1801(8) (West Supp. 1979). Language added to section 5 of the OCSLA, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1334 (West Supp. 1979), by the 1978 amendments included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJrq\">(a) The Secretary shall administer the provisions of this subchapter relating to the leasing of the outer Continental Shelf, and shall prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out such provisions. The Secretary may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>at any time prescribe and amend such rules and regulations as he determines to be necessary and proper in order to provide for the prevention of waste and conservation of the natural resources of the outer Continental Shelf, and the protection of correlative rights therein, and, notwithstanding any other provisions herein, such rules and regulations shall, as of their effective date, apply to all operations conducted under a lease issued or maintained under the provisions of this subchapter. In the enforcement of safety, environmental, and conservation laws and regulations, the Secretary shall cooperate with the relevant departments and agencies of the Federal Government and of the affected States. In the formulation and promulgation of regulations, the Secretary shall request and give due consideration to the views of the Attorney General with respect to matters which may affect competition. In considering any regulations and in preparing any such views, the Attorney General shall consult with the Federal Trade Commission. The regulations prescribed by the Secretary under this subsection shall include, but not be limited to, provisions\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-12\">(8) for compliance with the national ambient air quality standards pursuant to the Clean Air Act, to the extent that activities authorized under this subchap-ter significantly affect the air quality of any State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1285-13\">From this language it quite clearly appears that Congress gave the Secretary authority to promulgate air quality regulations for the OCS. The plain meaning provides no suggestion that such authority is to be shared. This reading is further supported by other portions of the amendments in which Congress clearly delineated the roles of agencies with potentially overlapping functions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-14\">We think simultaneous jurisdiction by the EPA over the OCS would impair or frustrate the authority which section 1334 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>grants to the Secretary. We need not compare all aspects of the EPA\u2019s determination and the Secretary\u2019s proposed rules. It suffices to observe that the EPA determined that SIPs are incorporated by the OCSLA and that the NSR and PSD provisions for certain districts in the California plan \u2014 in this case, provisions promulgated by the EPA \u2014 should apply to Platform Hondo. Thus, under the EPA\u2019s view, SIPs are the \u201cbasic mechanisms\u201d for protecting United States air quality. 43 Fed.Reg. at 16397. In contrast, the rules proposed by the Secretary, though designed not to thwart the attainment of standards set by SIPs, do not originate in individual SIPs. Rather, they propose a regulatory scheme wholly independent of them. In addition, the Department\u2019s proposed rule notice acknowledged that the proposed regulations \u201crely heavily on standards, criteria and requirements established by the EPA,\u201d but stated further:</p>\n<p id=\"A44g\">It was necessary, however, to deviate from EPA\u2019s standards, criteria and requirements in some instances. Unlike the sources of air pollutants located onshore, OCS sources are external to the onshore areas whose air quality they may affect and therefore the EPA procedures and criteria are not entirely applicable to the Department\u2019s mandate under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"A6_W\">44 Fed.Reg. at 27450. The potential for conflict and confusion is clear. \u201cIt is our obligation to so construe federal statutes so that they are consistent with each other, as by this means congressional intent can be given its fullest expression.\u201d <em>Get Oil Out! Inc. v. Exxon Corp., </em>586 F.2d 726, 729 (9th Cir. 1978). Under this analysis, we must conclude that EPA authority over OCS air quality control would be inconsistent with that provided to the Secretary, and that the jurisdictional provisions of section 7607(b)(1) therefore cannot apply.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">We are content that our interpretation based upon the statutory language is correct. We are aware, however, that \u201ceven the most basic general principles of statutory construction must yield to clear contrary evidence of legislative intent.\u201d <em>National R. R. Passenger Corp. v. National Ass\u2019n of R. R. Passengers, </em>414 U.S. 453, 458, 94 S.Ct. 690, 693, 38 L.Ed.2d 646 (1974). But we can find nothing in the legislative history of the OCSLA which clearly shows either that Congress intended to limit the Secretary\u2019s authority in any way or contemplated dual jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-10\">In looking first to the OCSLA as originally enacted, it is clear that Congress expressed no concern over air quality on the OCS. In fact, the first major clean air legislation was not enacted until two years after the passage of the OCSLA. Thus, we must look to the 1978 amendments, enacted after the CAA, which set forth a comprehensive regulatory scheme for the OCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-11\">The Secretary\u2019s responsibilities with respect to OCS activities as they affect air quality were first outlined in the House version of the amendments, H.R. 1614;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Senate version contained no comparable provision. The House report on these responsibilities made no mention of EPA jurisdiction over OCS activities. Rather, the report specified that the Secretary was to have responsibility for OCS air quality control, and stated that the Secretary was to \u201cconsult with\u201d federal, state and local officials. Report by the Ad Hoc Select Comm, on the Outer Continental Shelf, H.R.Rep. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>No.95-590, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 133 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 1450, 1539. Although the House report expressly indicated a desire to avoid bureaucratic conflicts<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and suggested resolutions of such potential conflicts,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it was silent with respect to EPA jurisdiction over the OCS for control of air quality.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">In floor debate on H.R. 1614, Congressman Brown (Ohio) questioned the relationship between the EPA and the Secretary for purposes of the regulation of OCS sir quality. Congressman Murphy, chairman of the Ad Hoc Select Committee, replied that the committee had been assured \u201cthat EPA does not have the authority to go offshore. ... In the wisdom of the committee, the present H.R. 1614 gives the Secretary those air pollution control powers.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">Further colloquy several days later is consistent with the view that whatever the House contemplated with respect to application of the Clean Air Act itself, it intended that the Secretary control its administration on the OCS. At that time the proposed air quality provisions were amended to specify that the Secretary would promulgate regulations \u201c[f]or compliance with the national ambient air quality standards or requirements pursuant to the Clean Air Act, to the extent that activities authorized under this Act affect the air quality of any state\u201d and \u201cfor the establishment of air quality standards for operations on the outer Continental Shelf under this Act consistent with standards or requirements under the Clean Air Act.\u201d 124 Cong.Rec. H397, 415-16 (daily ed. Jan. 31, 1978). In an exchange with Congressman Rogers, Congressman Murphy confirmed that the Secretary was to \u201csolicit and give due consideration to the views of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in developing his regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at H416. While ultimately modified in the legislation as enacted, <em>quoted supra, </em>this language would, at most, have specified which laws the Secretary was to implement on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>OCS. Nothing indicates that the EPA administrator was to assert partial or total control over air quality administration on the OCS. While floor debates are entitled to less weight than committee reports, <em>United States v. International Union UAW, </em>352 U.S. 567, 585-86, 77 S.Ct. 529, 1 L.Ed.2d 563 (1957); <em>accord, International Tel. &amp; Tel. Corp. v. General Tel. &amp; Elecs. Corp., </em>518 F.2d 913, 921 (9th Cir. 1975), Chairman Murphy\u2019s remark helps to confirm that the report was silent with respect to the EPA because the committee contemplated no EPA authority over OCS air quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">The subsequent joint explanatory statement of the conference committee for the OCSLA amendments \u2014 perhaps the strongest evidence of congressional intent outside the language of the statute itself \u2014 also placed no apparent limits on the Secretary\u2019s regulatory authority over OCS air quality control. It specified in part that the Seere-tary was to promulgate regulations implementing 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1334(a)(8) (West Supp.1979), and specified the use of Secretarial judgment in determining the effect of future OCS operations on air quality onshore. It also stated that the Secretary was to assure that offshore operations do not prevent attainment of state air quality standards, if state air quality is \u201csignificantly affected\u201d by those operations. H.R. Rep.No.95-1474, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 85 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 1674, 1684.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1288-9\">Although the report of the conference committee did not limit the Secretary\u2019s OCS authority, it did state that it was aware of the EPA\u2019s April determination and that it did not intend to affect \u201cwhatever present authority the Environmental Protection Agency has in applying and enforcing the Clean Air Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86, [1978] U.S.Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 1685.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While the committee clearly touched upon the problem before us, we cannot conclude that it resolved it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">We first observe that this language appears to be facially neutral. We further conclude that no other interpretation other than facial neutrality is satisfactory. Assuming we might have decided the extent of the EPA\u2019s authority differently prior to the 1978 amendments and viewed this statement as an invitation to retain whatever authority that might have been, we could not accept either of the possible results. If the EPA hypothetically had no OCS jurisdiction, the committee language reserves no EPA power at all, and is mere surplusage. On the other hand, if the EPA would have been able to make a better case for its authority before the amendments, this language at best implies that Congress contemplated partially or wholly concurrent authority over the OCS, leading to the danger that we might create bureaucratic conflicts without any assurance that Congress intended either our view of the EPA\u2019s pre-1978 status on the OCS or our retention of that status under the OCSLA as amended. We could not, on the basis of this reading of already uncertain language, insert a new agency into the cast of regulatory characters envisioned by the 1978 amendments. We can only conclude that although Congress had the opportunity to resolve directly the question before us, the language it chose in discussing the question can have no weight in its resolution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-12\">Comments by Senators Muskie and Jackson made prior to action on the conference committee report, not spoken in debate but printed in the Congressional Record, are the only evidence we have found of a contrary intent with respect to EPA jurisdiction, but are not of themselves sufficient to resolve the question in favor of the EPA. Senator Muskie appeared to believe both that the EPA has primary administrative authority on the OCS and that the Secretary\u2019s role is limited, 124 Cong.Rec. S13996-97 (daily ed. Aug. 22, 1978); Senator Jackson concurred.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These remarks, however, conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>with the House colloquy earlier discussed, which indicated just the opposite. They do carry weight because Senator Muskie identified himself as a \u201cprincipal author\u201d of the CAA, while Senator Jackson was both a member of the conference committee and chairman of the committee that submitted the amendments and report in the Senate. <em>See City of Burbank v. Lockheed Air Terminal Inc., </em>411 U.S. 624, 637, 93 S.Ct. 1854, 36 L.Ed.2d 547 (1973). But these views, not spoken in debate, are obviously insufficient to form a clearly stated congressional intent to acknowledge EPA authority over air quality regulation of the OCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-10\">We conclude, therefore, that in the legislative history, Congress simply did not make its intent clear with respect to EPA administrative authority over OCS air quality except in its explicit statutory direction to the Secretary to assume this responsibility. Congress\u2019 consideration of EPA authority fails to provide a reliable resolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>the question before us. We are of the opinion that EPA authority would impair or frustrate the authority that the statute clearly provided to the Secretary. Thus we hold that Congress did not intend that the jurisdictional grants of the OCSLA and the CAA could stand together, and no jurisdictional conflict can arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">We now resolve the question of our jurisdiction. Because section 7607(b)(1) cannot apply, the petitions for review filed under that section must be dismissed. Section 1349 controls, and jurisdiction properly lay in the district court. We return the appealed cases to the district court for the appropriate resolution of the parties\u2019 claims consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">THE APPEALED CASES ARE REVERSED AND REMANDED; THE PETITIONS FOR REVIEW ARE DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1281-9\">. Exxon originally pursued plans for an onshore facility but discontinued them when the California Coastal Zone Conservation Commission imposed certain conditions upon its construction. Events concerning the construction of this onshore facility are in part the basis for California\u2019s claims against the federal government and the oil companies in the original action pending in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">. The district court\u2019s order on the first motion for leave to file a counterclaim was filed April 6, 1978. Following publication of the EPA\u2019s determination on April 18, Chevron, Exxon, and Shell filed a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration; Supplemental and Renewed Motion for Leave to File Counterclaim; Supplemental and Renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction\u201d on April 28. The appeals from the court\u2019s June 7 ruling on the renewed motions were timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\">The oil companies\u2019 notices of appeal also state that they appeal from the April 6 order. They claim in the notices that the finality of the April 6 order was stayed by the April 28 motion for reconsideration. In light of our disposition on the basis of the June 7 ruling, we need not decide whether the appeal from the April 6 ruling was timely taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1282-12\">. Exxon also sought an injunction during the pendency of the direct appeal and a stay during the pendency of the petition for review to enable it to continue construction of the OS&amp;T. The motions panel denied these motions without prejudice to their renewal before us. Though they were renewed at oral argument, we did not rule on them then or during the submission of this case and they are now moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">. The district court did not characterize the counterclaim as permissive or compulsory and neither need we. We think that where, as here, leave to file a counterclaim for injunctive relief, whether permissive or compulsory, is denied because the district judge concludes that relief is not available in any district court, the order falls within the scope of <em>General Electric </em>and <em>Gardner </em>and, hence, is appealable under section 1292(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">. This section was added by the 1978 amendments to the OCSLA.

We would also arrive at this inquiry if we pursued the section 7607(b)(1) analysis first, found that section\u2019s requirements fulfilled, and were then faced with the same apparent jurisdictional conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">In addition, regardless of how we view the counterclaim and cross-claim for jurisdictional purposes, the inquiry remains the same. If the counterclaim requires no jurisdictional ground independent of that of the complaint because the counterclaim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the complaint, this will mean that section 1349 is implicated by the complaint as well. If the counterclaim requires an independent jurisdictional ground, section 1349 supplies that ground. If, as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(g) requires, the cross-claim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the original action or the counterclaim, or relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action, this again will mean that section 1349 is implicated by either the original action or the counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1284-11\">.

The terms \u201cmay have\u201d and \u201cmay prevent\u201d refer to the Secretarial judgment regarding future consideration of exploration plans, or development and production plans, in which the potential for \u201csignificant effect\u201d is analyzed prior to approval and thus commencement of the proposed activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-7\">The conferees agreed that if an approved State implementation plan has ambient air quality standards which are more stringent than the national ambient air quality standards, the Secretary of the Interior shall, with appropriate regulations, assure that offshore operations conducted pursuant to this act do not prevent the attainment of those State standards, if the air quality of that State is significantly affected by such offshore operations. These State standards and any national standards would not, however, apply to the quality of air above the OCS itself, or to OCS activities located in other parts of the country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL0\">The conferees\u2019 intent was that the regulations promulgated by the Secretary not generally require that the air mass above the OCS itself be brought into compliance with national or State ambient air quality standards but that regulations might be appropriate for the air above or near an artificial installation or other device (platform), so that emissions from such source is [sic] controlled to prevent a significant effect on the air quality of an adjacent onshore area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGn0\">Other provisions in the conference report provide that exploration plans, and development and production plans, are to comply with any regulations promulgated pursuant to section 5(a)(8) of the amended OCS Act.
