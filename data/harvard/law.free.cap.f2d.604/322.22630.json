Since the date of the trial court\u2019s order, we have decided <em>Clements Wire &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>589 F.2d 894 (5th Cir. 1979). <em>Clements Wire </em>requires us to reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-20\">The facts are not in dispute. After a representation petition was filed by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO (\u201cthe Union\u201d) seeking certification as a collective bargaining unit for certain employees of appellee, the NLRB duly conducted a representation election. The election was extremely close,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and both sides filed timely objections to it. The NLRB conducted an investigation into the election, during which it interviewed a number of individuals and secured affidavits and statements from some of them. On the basis of this investigation, the Regional Director of the NLRB issued a report ordering that an evidentiary hearing be conducted on certain issues raised by the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-21\">On January 6, 1978, ten days prior to the scheduled hearing, appellee filed with the Regional Director a request under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, seeking copies of all affidavits and written statements of employees of appellee or others taken by or submitted to the regional office of the NLRB in the course of the investigation into the election, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>well as other documents acquired by the regional office in the course of the investigation. The Regional Director denied the request in its entirety, relying on Exemptions 7(A), (C), and (D) of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(A), (C), and (D).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appel-lee appealed this denial to the NLRB\u2019s General Counsel, who denied appellee all requested documents except campaign letters written by appellee. The General Counsel relied on FOIA Exemptions 5 and 7(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">On January 12,1978, appellee filed a complaint in United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas seeking an order compelling the NLRB to provide the requested documents prior to any hearing on the election objections.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court, relying on our opinion in <em>Robbins Tire and Rubber Co. v. N. L. R. B., </em>563 F.2d 724 (5th Cir. 1977), found that the documents were not exempt from disclosure under the FOIA, and entered final judgment ordering the NLRB to provide appellee with any affidavits or written statements acquired in its investigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The NLRB obtained a stay of execution of the judgment and brought this appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-14\">Our decision in Robbins Tire, Interpreting Congresses\u2019 reported desires, Exposed workers to their bosses\u2019 ire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-15\">The High Court, avoiding this sticky quagmire,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-16\">And fearing employers would threaten to fire,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">Sent our holding to the funeral pyre.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au8\">Then along came Clements Wire,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Soon after its venerable sire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-18\">To elections, Wire extended Tire,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-19\">Leaving app\u2019llees arguments higher and drier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-20\">Now to colors our focus must shift,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-21\">To Green wood and stores that are Red.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We hope this attempt at a rhyme, perhaps two,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-22\">Has not left this audience feeling too blue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-23\">Since <em>dements Wire </em>directly controls our decision here, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-24\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-15\">.

The district court issued several orders and judgments in this matter, dated May 9, 1978, May 10, 1978, June 7, 1978, and June 16, 1978. On appellee\u2019s motion to correct the judgment, the description of the documents to be provided appellee was varied somewhat by the several orders. None of the modifications is material to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b415-26\">. <em>N. L. R. B. v. Robbins Tire and Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978) held that the witness statements there sought were exempt from disclosure under Exemption 7(A) because disclosure would interfere with the N.L.R.B.\u2019s pending unfair labor practice proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b415-27\">. <em>Clements Wire &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc. v. N. L. R. B., </em>589 F.2d 894 (5th Cir. 1979). <em>Clements Wire </em>extended <em>Robbins Tire </em>to representation election hearings. It presented the issue in a somewhat different procedural context, involving a request for a preliminary injunction preventing the NLRB from proceeding with a representation election case until final resolution of the employer\u2019s FOIA action seeking certain information from the NLRB\u2019s files. We vacated the district court\u2019s grant of the preliminary injunction, finding it apparent that the employer\u2019s FOIA claim would not succeed on the merits. The FOIA issue presented there was identical to appellee\u2019s claim here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b415-28\">. <em>Red Food Stores v. N. L. R. B., </em>604 F.2d 324, No. 78-3546 (5th Cir.), also decided today, presents a very similar issue to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
