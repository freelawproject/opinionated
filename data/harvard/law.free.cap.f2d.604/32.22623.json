We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-19\">The District Court correctly anticipated, and applied, our decision in <em>M &amp; M Leasing Corp. v. Seattle First National Bank, </em>563 F.2d 1377, 1382-1384 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 956, 98 S.Ct. 3069, 57 L.Ed.2d 1121 (1978), wherein we adopted the approach taken by the First Circuit in <em>Arnold Tours, Inc. v. Camp, </em>472 F.2d 427, 431 \u2014 432 (1st Cir. 1972). Thus, in order to satisfy the <em>Arnold Tours </em>test, a service offered by a national bank, such as the Retail Information Service instituted by Valley National Bank in the present case, \u201cmust be convenient or useful to business <em>expressly </em>authorized by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Seventh).\u201d <em>M &amp; M Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Seattle First National Bank, supra, </em>563 F.2d at 1382 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>We hold that the Valley National Bank, by failing to limit the use of its Retail Information Service to the performance of an express power under the National Bank Act, went beyond the bounds of those incidental powers granted to it by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Seventh). Also, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Comptroller exceeded his authority in rendering the interpretive ruling upon which Valley National Bank relied when it entered the data processing service field.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Accordingly, in Appeals No. 76-1855 and No. 76-2030, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In Appeals No. 76-1850 and No. 76-2339, the appeals are dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-11\">. The Comptroller\u2019s interpretive ruling with respect to the use of data processing equipment and furnishing of data processing services by national banks is found within 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.3500.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-12\">. In Appeals No. 76-1850 and No. 76-2339, the appeals brought by the National Retailers Corporation of Arizona from the District Court\u2019s judgment dismissing its claim against the Valley National Bank, the attorneys for the National Retailers Corporation stated at argument that if their client prevailed in Appeal No. 76-1855, the appeal by the Comptroller of the Currency, they would not be further interested in pursuing their client\u2019s claims against the Valley National Bank in these proceedings. We therefore express no opinion as to the issues raised in those appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
