Levings appeals from the district court\u2019s order of summary judgment in favor of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (Secretary).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ms. Levings brought this action, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3) (1976), for judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s final decision terminating her supplemental security income (SSI) benefits. The district court determined, by adoption of the recommendation of the United States Magistrate, that Ms. Levings was \u201can inmate of a public institution\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(eXl)(A) and, therefore, was not entitled to SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-17\">On appeal Ms. Levings contends that the district court erred in finding that the nursing home at which she resided constituted a \u201cpublic institution\u201d and in finding that Ms. Levings was \u201can inmate\u201d of such \u201cpublic institution.\u201d We agree in part with Ms. Levings\u2019 contentions and reverse the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-18\">On September 26, 1974, Myrtle Levings entered the Monroe Manor Nursing Home (Monroe Manor), a health care facility in Paris, Missouri. Monroe Manor is operated by the Monroe Manor Nursing Home District, organized as a \u201cpolitical subdivision of the state,\u201d under Missouri Law. Mo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 198.200 (1969). The Nursing Home District is authorized to establish and maintain Monroe Manor as a nursing home. Mo. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 198.300. The District does not, however, possess the authority to admit or maintain indigents at the nursing home without charge. During her residence at Monroe Manor, Ms. Levings paid for all charges she incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-19\">Ms. Levings began receiving SSI benefits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381a in January 1974.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In April 1975, Ms. Levings reported to the Social Security Administration (SSA) that she resided at Monroe Manor. On November 4, 1975, the SSA notified Ms. Levings of her ineligibility for SSI benefits because the agency deemed Monroe Manor a \u201cpublic institution\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(e)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-20\">On November 7,1975, Ms. Levings moved to the Pleasant View Nursing Home, a privately operated facility. She received SSI benefits while residing at that facility. On December 30, 1975, Ms. Levings reentered Monroe Manor and has remained there since that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-21\">The SSA notified Ms. Levings on March 30, 1976, that her benefits would be termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>nated because she lived in a public institution. The decision to terminate Ms. Lev-ings\u2019 SSI benefits was upheld first on reconsideration, then by an administrative law judge, and finally by the SSA Appeals Council. The Appeals Council decision constitutes a final decision of the Secretary from which Ms. Levings timely brought this action for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The district court referred the case to a United States Magistrate and, thereafter, adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment be sustained on the ground that Ms. Levings was an inmate of a public institution when she lived at Monroe Manor and, as such, was not entitled to SSI benefits.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(e)(1)(A) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no person shall be an eligible individual * * * for purposes of this sub-chapter with respect to any month if throughout such month he is an inmate of a public institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Although section 1382(e)(1)(A) does not define the phrase \u201cinmate of a public institution,\u201d the Secretary, in its regulations, construes the phrase in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">(1) An \u201cinstitution\u201d is an establishment which furnishes (in single or multiple facilities) food and shelter to four or more persons unrelated to the proprietor and, in addition, provides some treatment or services which meet some need beyond the basic provision of food and shelter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-11\">(2) A \u201cpublic institution\u201d is an institution that is the responsibility of a governmental unit, or over which a governmental unit exercises administrative control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-12\">(3) An \u201cinmate of a public institution\u201d is a person who is living in a public institution and receiving treatment and/or services which are appropriate to the person\u2019s requirements. A person is not considered an inmate when he is in a public educational or vocational training institution, for purposes of securing education or vocational training,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">[20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.231(b)(l)-(3) (1978).]</p>\n<p id=\"b685-16\">We agree with the district court\u2019s determination that Monroe Manor, the nursing home at which Ms. Levings resided, is a public institution. However, because we believe the usage of \u201cinmate\u201d suggests a relationship different than the relationship between Ms. Levings and Monroe Manor, we hold that Ms. Levings is not \u201can inmate of a public institution\u201d within the meaning of section 1382(e)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-17\">Absent a specific statutory definition, words used in a statute should be given their common meaning. <em>See Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers Assn., </em>390 U.S. 459, 465, 88 S.Ct. 1140, 20 L.Ed.2d 30 (1968); <em>Sheehan v. Scott, </em>520 F.2d 825, 829 (7th Cir. 1975). Ordinarily, the term \u201cinmate\u201d is understood to refer to persons confined in institutions under some form of restraint, not to persons who reside at facilities on a purely voluntary basis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-18\">In addition, the Secretary\u2019s regulations state that a person who lives in a public institution and who \u201creceives\u201d treatment and care constitutes an inmate of such public institution. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.231(b)(3). The regulation indicates that persons residing in facilities that provide appropriate treatment and services, regardless of such person\u2019s ability to pay for their care, are inmates. Here, however, Ms. Levings pays the going rate for all services rendered to her at Monroe Manor, and neither the institution nor the state would under any circumstances assume the cost of services provided Ms. Levings or any other resident of the nursing home. Thus, Ms. Levings <em>purchases </em>her treatment requirements, rather than \u201creceiv[es]\u201d treatment and/or services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>within the meaning of the Secretary\u2019s regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">In sum, because Ms. Levings resides voluntarily at Monroe Manor and pays for any services the nursing home provides, she does not meet the definition of an inmate of a public institution and remains eligible for SSI benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-13\">. The court denied Ms. Levings\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-14\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-15\">Every aged, blind, or disabled individual who is determined under part A to be eligible on the basis of his income and resources shall, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this subchapter, be paid benefits by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b685-13\">. Indeed, the only example of the \u201cinmate\u201d exclusion appearing in the legislative history of the SSI program states that \u201c[n]o assistance benefits will be paid to an individual <em>in a penal institution.\u201d </em>H.R. Rep. No. 92-231, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. -, reprinted in [1972] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 4989, 5136 (emphasis added). It is difficult to perceive any similarity between this use of \u201cinmate\u201d in the legislative history and Ms. Levings\u2019 circumstances in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b686-16\">. This case may be distinguished on its facts from <em>Baur v. Mathews, </em>578 F.2d 228 (9th Cir. 1978). In <em>Baur, </em>the petitioner resided at a public institution, an alcoholic treatment center, where public funds would cover the cost of services if the individual were unable to pay for the services provided. Here, to the contrary, the nursing home will not provide care or maintenance to indigents at public expense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-17\">In any event, we disagree with the discussion in <em>Baur, supra, </em>578 F.2d at 234, which broadly construes \u201cinmate\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(e)(1)(A), as including any person residing at any public institution, whether custodial or noncustodial, without regard to the basis on which the institution may provide services.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b686-29\">. On this appeal, neither party contends that the state benefits which Ms. Levings receives in \u25a0 any way affects her eligibility for SSI benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
