Califano, Jr., Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and Blue Cross of Florida, Inc., his fiscal intermediary. St. Mary\u2019s contends on appeal that the district court erred in upholding Blue Cross\u2019 legal authority under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 (1979) to disclose to third parties the cost reports St. Mary\u2019s submitted to HEW.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">St. Mary\u2019s, a Florida not-for-profit corporation, owns and operates a 316 bed hospital in West Palm Beach, Florida. As a participant in the Medicare program, the hospital must file cost reports with the Secretary or Blue Cross to receive reimbursement for the reasonable cost of covered services rendered to eligible beneficiaries. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395g.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-19\">Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, the State of Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services and the Palm Beach Post Times submitted to appellees written requests for copies of the hospital corporation\u2019s 1976 and 1977 cost reports. In compliance with an HEW regulation, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 (1979),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which mandates the public disclosure of cost reports, Blue Cross released the 1976 reports, and would have released the 1977 reports had the district court not granted appellant\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction pending disposition of its case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-22\">St. Mary\u2019s presented three arguments to the district court supporting its contention that despite 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 the disclosure of Medicare providers\u2019 cost reports was illegal. First, it claimed that the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(bX3)&amp;(4),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> exempted the reports. Second, it objected to disclosure under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>TKird, it contended that HEW had abused its discretion under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) and (C),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in promulgating the challenged regulation. The district court rejected all three arguments on cross motions for summary judgment, finding that HEW and Blue Cross have authority to disclose the cost reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">On appeal, St. Mary\u2019s has narrowed its challenge. The contention that the challenged regulation deals with materials exempted by FOIA is no longer asserted as an independent basis for enjoining disclosure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rather, St. Mary\u2019s argues that, because disclosures pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 are not \u201cauthorized by law\u201d within the meaning of the Trade Secrets Act, they violate the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(C). Alternatively, it contends that even if 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306 of the Social Security Act provides the requisite authority for the challenged regulation, promulgating that regulation constituted an abuse of discretion under \u00a7 706(2)(A) in that the regulation was in derogation of \u00a7 1905. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979), these arguments fail, and the district court\u2019s judgment must be affirmed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">In <em>Chrysler </em>the court held that the Trade Secrets Act bars only disclosures not authorized by law. To determine whether a regulation pursuant to which a disclosure has been made has the \u201cforce and effect of law\u201d necessary to provide the authorization contemplated by \u00a7 1905, it must satisfy three requirements. First, the regulation must be a substantive or legislative-type rule. Second, it must be promulgated according to the APA\u2019s rule-making requirements. Third, the regulation must be promulgated pursuant to legislative authority delegated to the agency by Congress. <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. at 294-309, 99 S.Ct. at 1714-1721. When, as here, these three requirements are met, \u00a7 706(2)(A) &amp; (C) is satisfied because the authorization by law required under \u00a7 1905 exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">As defined in <em>Chrysler, </em>a regulation is substantive if it affects individual rights and obligations. Because it governs \u201cthe public\u2019s right to information . . . and the confidentiality rights of those who sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>mit information,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 is a substantive regulation. 441 U.S. at 303, 99 S.Ct. at 1718. <em>Compare </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 (cost reports) <em>with </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306(d) (performance reports).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The Social Security Administration promulgated 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 in accordance with the APA. The Secretary published the proposed regulation in the Federal Register, interested persons were given the opportunity to comment, and the Secretary set forth his reasons for issuing the regulation after explicitly considering these comments. <em>See </em>40 Fed.Reg. 27648-27651 (1975). Since the regulation was authorized by the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306, discussed below, \u00a7 706(2)(C) was not violated. In addition, the trial court correctly found that promulgation of the regulation was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>See Pennzoil Co. v. Federal Power Commission, </em>534 F.2d 627, 631 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">The Secretary promulgated 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 pursuant to legislative authority delegated to him by Congress in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 1306 bars the disclosure of Medicare providers\u2019 costs reports unless the Secretary in his discretion promulgates a regulation like 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 ordering disclosure of these reports. Statutory language, legislative history<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and judicial construction<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> support this interpretation of \u00a7 1306.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At the very least \u00a7 1306 may reasonably be construed to contemplate the promulgation of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435. <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 304, 99 S.Ct. at 1720.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">We conclude that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 was authorized by law within the meaning of the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905, and that this substantive regulation was duly promulgated in accordance with the APA under the authority granted the Secretary in \u00a7 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-11\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 (1979) provides in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">The following shall be made available to the public under the conditions specified: .

In effect, St. Mary\u2019s has decided not to pursue a \u201creverse FOIA\u201d theory of the sort rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979). In that case the court held <em>inter alia </em>that FOIA is \u201cpurely a disclosure statute,\u201d affording no basis for parties to bring \u201creverse FOIA\u201d suits, <em>id. </em>at 285, 99 S.Ct. at 1709:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-17\">FOIA by itself protects the submitters\u2019 interest in confidentiality only to the extent that this interest is endorsed by the agency collecting the information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 293, 99 S.Ct. at 1713.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b501-19\">. St. Mary\u2019s also contends that the district court erred in suggesting as an alternative justification for its decision that the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905, has no application to this cause. As the <em>Chrysler </em>court found, \u00a7 1905 does apply. Though a \u00a7 1905 violation does not give rise to a separate cause of action, \u201cany such violations may have a dispositive effect on the outcome of judicial review of agency action.\u201d 441 U.S. at 317, 99 S.Ct. at 1725. In light of our discussion in the text and the alternative holding of the district court, the court\u2019s erroneous suggestion does not warrant reversal of its decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b502-5\">.
