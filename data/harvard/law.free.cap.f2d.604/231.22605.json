The district court determined that the miner-operators came within the provisions of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-960 (1976). We affirm for the reasons stated by the Honorable Louis Rosenberg, 457 F. Supp. 907 (W.D.Pa.1978), and by Judge Muir in his opinion in <em>Secretary of the Interior v. Shingara, </em>418 F.Supp. 693, 695 (M.D.Pa.1976). Judge Rosenberg explained that although section 802(d) defines an \u201coperator\u201d as one who operates, controls or supervises a mine, section 802(g) provides that a \u201cminer\u201d means <em>\u201cany </em>individual working in a coal or other mine.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(d), (g) (Supp. I 1977) (emphasis added). Like the district court we feel that this statutory language is free from ambiguity and comports with the legislative purpose \u201cto require that . . . every miner in such mine comply with [the] standards.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 801(g)(2) (Supp. I 1977). <em>See Marshall </em>v. <em>Stoudt\u2019s Ferry Preparation Co., </em>602 F.2d 589, (3d Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">Appellants also argue that the Coal Mine Act does not reach them because their mine sells coal only intrastate to the Penn-tech Papers Company. They contend that these sales are insufficient to bring their operation within section 803, which declares that the act covers \u201c[e]ach coal or other mine, the products of which enter commerce, or the operator] or products of which affect commerce.\u201d In enacting the statute, Congress intended to exercise its authority to regulate interstate commerce to \u201cthe maximum extent feasible through legislation.\u201d S.Rep.No.1055, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 1, <em>reprinted in </em>[1966] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2072. We agree with Judge Rosenberg\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe selling by the defendants of over 10,-000 tons of coal annually to a paper producer whose products are nationally distributed enters and affects interstate commerce within the meaning of \u00a7 803 of the Act.\u201d 457 F.Supp. at 911. <em>See also Shingara, </em>418 F.Supp. at 694-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
