The most important question on this appeal is whether plaintiffs have stated a claim over which the district court had jurisdiction. We hold that a claim is stated under the federal common law of nuisance and that the court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-11\">Plaintiffs are Evansville, Indiana, the water works department of that city, and Mount Vernon, Indiana. Defendants are Kentucky Liquid Recycling, Inc., three of its employees, and Louisville and Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewage District. Plaintiffs allege that Kentucky Liquid Recycling discharged toxic chemicals into the sewer system of the sewer district, and that the sewer district'in turn discharged these chemicals into the Ohio River, from which plaintiffs draw water into their treatment plants. As a result of these discharges, it is alleged, plaintiffs incurred unusual treatment expense and other expenses, which they seek to recover as damages. They also seek punitive damages. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of similarly situated municipalities and water treatment facilities, for whom similar relief is asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-16\">Although inartfully stated, several theories of federal jurisdiction are discernible from the amended complaint: (1) jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 over implied rights of action under (a) \u00a7 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 407, (b) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251, <em>et seq., </em>and (c) the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300f, <em>et seq.; </em>(2) jurisdiction under the citizen suit provisions of the latter two statutes; and (3) jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 over a right of action under the federal common law of nuisance. Plaintiffs also assert state law claims, which, diversity of citizenship being lacking, must rest on pendent jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-17\">In dismissing the amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court held that violation of \u00a7 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Act did not give rise to a private right of action. The possibility of implying a right of action under the other two Acts was not discussed; and, viewing the notice requirements for citizen suits to enforce the requirements of the other two Acts as jurisdictional prerequisites, the court found jurisdiction lacking because of plaintiffs\u2019 admitted failure to comply with these requirements. The court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the savings clause of either statute in combination with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 provided an adequate basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>for federal court jurisdiction. In addition, the court held that because plaintiffs were not states, jurisdiction could not be sustained under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and the federal common law of nuisance. Having concluded that it had no. jurisdiction over the federal claims, the court dismissed the pendent state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">\n<em>Rivers and Harbors Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqG\">We agree with the district court that a private right of action should not be inferred under \u00a7 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which does not expressly create one.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">The Supreme Court has recently made it clear that, when Congress does not expressly create a. private cause of action, an intent to do so is not lightly to be inferred. Touche Ross <em>&amp; Co. </em>v. Redington,\u2014U.S.\u2014, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979); <em>Shiffrin v. </em>Bratton,\u2014U.S.\u2014, 99 S.Ct. 3094, 61 L.Ed.2d 871 (1979) (vacating and remanding for further consideration in light of <em>Touche </em>Ross); see <em>Cannon v. University of </em>Chicago,\u2014U.S.\u2014, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1967-1968, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (majority opinion), 1968 (Rehnquist, J., concurring), 1985 (Powell, J., dissenting) (1979); <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 316, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 1725, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979). Referring to the four factors stated in <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975), the Court in <em>Touche Ross </em>explained that although each is \u201crelevant,\u201d they are not necessarily entitled to equal weight, and, moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-20\">[t]he central inquiry remains whether Congress intended to create, either expressly or by implication, a private cause of action. Indeed, the first three factors discussed in <em>Cort </em>\u2014 the language and focus of the statute, its legislative history, and its purpose, see 422 U.S., at 78, 95 S.Ct., at 2088 \u2014 are ones traditionally relied upon in determining legislative intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-21\">\u2014U.S. at\u2014, 99 S.Ct. at 2489. The Court also said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-23\">To the extent our analysis in today\u2019s decision differs from that of the Court in [J. I. <em>Case </em>v.] <em>Borak, </em>[377 U.S. 426, 84 S.Ct. 1555,12 L.Ed.2d 423 (1964)], it suffices to say that in a series of cases since <em>Borak </em>we have adhered to a stricter standard for the implication of private causes of action, and we follow that stricter standard today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-24\"><em>Touche Ross v. Redington, </em>supra,\u2014U.S. at\u2014, 99 S.Ct. at 2490 (citing Cannon).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-26\">Even before these recent Supreme Court decisions, the Third Circuit refused to infer a private right of action from sections of the Rivers and Harbors Act that are analogous for present purposes,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and district courts reached the same conclusion with respect to \u00a7 13.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-27\">The first factor listed in <em>Cort v. Ash </em>is whether the plaintiff is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>\u201cone of the class for whose <em>especial </em>benefit the statute was enacted,\u201d <em>Texas &amp; Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby, </em>241 U.S. 33, 39, 36 S.Ct. 482, 484, 60 L.Ed. 874 (1916) (emphasis supplied) \u2014 that is, does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">422 U.S. at 78, 95 S.Ct. at 2088. Referring to this factor in <em>Cannon, </em>the majority said, the Court has been especially reluctant to imply causes of actions under statutes that create duties on the part of persons for the benefit of the public at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">\u2014U.S. at\u2014, 99 S.Ct. at 1954-1955 n.13; <em>see also Touche Ross v. Redington, </em>supra,\u2014U.S. at\u2014, 99 S.Ct. 2479. The duties created by the provision relied on by plaintiffs in this case are for the benefit of the public at large.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-9\">As for the second <em>Cort v. Ash </em>factor, neither party cites any legislative history that might shed light on Congress\u2019 intent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">The third factor, the consistency of a private right of action with \u201cthe underlying purposes of the legislative scheme,\u201d <em>Cort v. Ash, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 78, 95 S.Ct. at 2088, is not helpful to plaintiffs here. Section 17 of the Act, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 413, expressly delegates enforcement of the provisions of \u00a7 13 to the Department of Justice; and \u00a7 16 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 411, authorizes the district courts to award one-half of any criminal fines imposed on violators of \u00a7 13 to \u201cpersons giving information which shall lead to conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While a private right of action would not be inconsistent with either of these provisions, both suggest that Congress intended to leave primary enforcement of the provision of the Act to the Department of Justice. <em>Cf. Red Star Towing v. Department of Transportation, supra </em>note 5, 423 F.2d at 105 &amp; n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-16\">The fourth <em>Cort v. Ash </em>factor seems to cut both ways, for the cause of action asserted here, although perhaps \u201cone traditionally relegated to state law,\u201d is not \u201cin an area basically the concern of the States.\u201d 422 U.S. at 78, 95 S.Ct. at 2088.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-17\">No one factor is controlling. Here the first, and arguably, the third factors weigh against implication of a private right of action; the second and fourth are at best only neutral. The central inquiry is congressional intent, <em>Touche Ross v. Redington, </em>supra,\u2014U.S. at\u2014, 99 S.Ct. at 2479, and given the \u201cstricter standard for the implication of private causes of action,\u201d <em>id. </em>at\u2014, 99 S.Ct. at 2490, established in the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent decisions in this area, we think the evidence insufficient to support the conclusion that Congress intended to create a private right of action under \u00a7 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-22\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-23\">\n<em>Federal Water Pollution Control Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-24\">Relying primarily on <em>Natural Resources Defense Council v. Callaway, </em>524 F.2d 79 (2d Cir. 1975), plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in holding that jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>tion was lacking under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> be-, cause they had failed to comply with the notice provisions of \u00a7 505.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> More specifically, plaintiffs contend that the district court had jurisdiction of their FWPCA claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 by operation of the \u201csaving clause\u201d contained in \u00a7 505.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-4\">In the cited case and an earlier case<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Second Circuit joined the District of Columbia Circuit, <em>Natural Resources Defense Council v. Train, </em>166 U.S.App.D.C. 312, 318-323, 510 F.2d 692, 698-703 (1975), in holding that an action could be maintained against an administrative official despite the plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with the FWPCA\u2019s 60-day notice requirement. We declined to follow the latter decision in <em>City of Highland Park v. Train, </em>519 F.2d 681, 693 (7th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 927, 96 S.Ct. 1141, 47 L.Ed.2d 337 (1976), a case arising under the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1857a, <em>et seq. </em>In any event, these three decisions of other circuits are inapplicable here. In each, the court\u2019s focus was on whether it had jurisdiction,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> since the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, provided for review of final agency actions. In none of these cases did the court consider the propriety of implying an independent private right of action under the FWPCA. <em>Compare Chrysler v. Brown, supra, </em>441 U.S. at 316, 99 S.Ct. at 1725. In the case at bar the APA is of course inapplicable; any private right of action based oh the FWPCA, other than that conferred by the citizen suit provision, must be inferred from the Act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the notice requirement precludes reliance on \u00a7 505(a) as a basis for the action. <em>E. g., Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. United States Veterans Administration, </em>541 F.2d 119, 121 (1st Cir. 1976). Furthermore, even if the requisite notice had been given, \u00a7 505(a) would not have authorized plaintiffs\u2019 claim. That provision authorizes a civil action against a party \u201calleged to be in violation\u201d of effluent standards or limitations prescribed under the Act or. an order of the Administrator or a state with responsibility under the Act. It does not provide for suits against parties alleged to have violated an effluent standard or limitation in the past or for recovery of damages. The legislative history of the provision leaves little doubt that neither class actions nor actions for damages were contemplated. The Senate Report states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aeo-dedup-0\">Section 505 does not authorize a \u201cclass action.\u201d Instead, it would authorize a private action by any citizen or citizens acting on their own behalf. Questions with respect to traditional \u201cclass\u201d actions often involve: (1) identifying a group of people whose interests have been damaged; (2) identifying the amount of total damage to determine jurisdiction qualification; and (8) allocating any damages recovered. None of these is appropriate in citizen suits seeking abatement of violations of water pollution control requirements. It should be noted, however, that the section would specifically preserve any rights or remedies under any other law. Thus, if damages could be shown, other remedies would remain available. Compliance with requirements under this Act would not be a defense to a common law action for pollution damages.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">Thus, unless plaintiffs can establish some other basis for this claim, the district court properly dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">Failure to comply with the notice provisions of \u00a7 505(b) does not foreclose ariy other right to relief a plaintiff might have.' The saving clause, \u00a7 505(e), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(e), expressly preserves any such rights. <em>Cf. City of Highland Park v. Train, supra, </em>519 F.2d at 691-693; <em>see also Illinois v. Milwaukee, </em>599 F.2d 151 (7th Cir. 1979) (holding that the Federal Water Pollution Control Act does not preclude a federal common law action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331). The saving clause preserves rights \u201cunder any statute or common law\u201d but does not itself create any right. Assuming that the Act itself is within the term \u201cany statute\u201d <em>(but see </em>note 20 and accompanying text, <em>infra), </em>still no right exists under the Act unless it can be inferred, because none is expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">We therefore turn again to the standards discussed in Part I, above, to determine whether such a right should be inferred. Recognizing that \u201c[t]he most accurate indicator of the propriety of implication of a cause of action\u201d is the language of the statute, <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago, </em>supra,\u2014U.S. at\u2014, 99 S.Ct. at 1954-1955 n.13, we shall again proceed through the still relevant <em>Cort v. Ash </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-11\">Plaintiffs cite no particular provision of the Act as supporting their claim for relief, but presumably they rely on \u00a7 301, 83 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311, which proscribes the discharge of any pollutant except in compli-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>anee with the provisions of the Act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> ther that section nor any other section of the Act contains any suggestion that Congress intended to confer a benefit or right on any particular segment of the public. Nei-</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-2\">Moreover, it is significant that the Act contains a section specifically addressed to private rights of action, \u00a7 505, which not only provides for citizen suits but also contains, in subsection (e), a saving clause providing that nothing in the section is to affect any right \u201cunder any statute or common law.\u201d Congress having thus specifically addressed the subject of private remedies, it is reasonable to assume that it said all that it intended on that subject. <em>Cf. Touche Ross v. Redington, </em>supra,\u2014U.S. at\u2014, 99 S.Ct. 2479.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">Section 505 evidences a congressional intent to carefully channel public participation in the enforcement of the Act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Before commencing a citizen suit the plaintiff must give notice not only to the alleged violator but also to the Administrator and the state in which the violation occurs.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> If either the Administrator or the state initiates adequate enforcement proceedings, the private action is foreclosed, although the complainant is authorized to intervene \u201cas of right.\u201d \u00a7 505(b), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">The legislative history of the Act contains no specific answer to the question of whether \u00a7 301 creates a private right of action. The reference to \u00a7 505 in the Senate Report on S.2770, quoted above,, in referring, <em>inter alia, </em>to damage actions, interprets the statutory phrase \u201cunder any statute or common law\u201d as \u201cunder any other law.\u201d Even if this was intended only as paraphrase, it suggests that a right of action for damages must be found outside the Act itself.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> And Congress\u2019 rejection of all but two of the proposed exceptions to the requirement of a 60-day waiting period for a citizen suit, <em>see </em>note 16, <em>supra, </em>reinforces the evidence in \u00a7 505 itself of an intent to circumscribe private rights of action under the FWPCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-9\">What we have said about \u00a7 505 is also applicable with respect to the third factor identified in <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>namely, \u201cis it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff?\u201d 422 U.S. at 78, 95 S.Ct. at 2086. Section 505 expresses Congress\u2019 judgment as to the kind and extent of private enforcement of the FWPCA. In a private suit under \u00a7 505(a) a court, at the behest of a private plaintiff, may enforce compliance with effluent standards and limitations, require the Administrator to per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>form a duty to act, and impose civil penalties under \u00a7 309(d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(d). Implication of a private remedy for damages under \u00a7 301 would be inconsistent with the congressional purpose implicit in the Act of encouraging private participation in the enforcement of the Act within the channels expressly provided. <em>Cf. Touche Ross v. Redington, </em>supra,\u2014U.S. at\u2014, 99 S.Ct. 2479; <em>National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Association of Railroad Passengers, </em>414 U.S. 453, 457-458, 94 S.Ct. 690, 38 L.Ed.2d 646 (1974); <em>T. I. M. E., Inc. v. United States, </em>359 U.S. 464, 470-471, 79 S.Ct. 904, 3 L.Ed.2d 952 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">The enforcement scheme is adequate without an inferred private right of action. The Administrator of the EPA is given broad authority to enforce the provisions of the Act; states assuming discharge permit authority are required to demonstrate adequate state law authority to insure compliance. If a state fails to enforce the Act, the Administrator may do so, and, in the case of repeated failures to enforce the Act, the Administrator may resume direct authority for issuance of permits in that state. These enforcement procedures are reinforced by the citizen suit provisions of \u00a7 505, which also authorizes the award of attorney\u2019s fees and litigation costs to citizen plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">We conclude that plaintiffs have not carried their burden of establishing that Congress intended to create a private right of action for damages against a violator of the FWPCA in favor of a person injured by pollutant discharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-11\">The amended complaint does not state a claim under the FWPCA on which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-13\">\n<em>Safe Drinking Water Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-14\">Plaintiffs recognize in their brief that their assertion of a right of action under the Safe Drinking Water Act is subject to the same analysis as their claim to a right of action under FWPCA.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-15\">We do not, however, even find it necessary to apply that analysis, because defendants\u2019 alleged conduct does not even arguably violate the Safe Drinking Water Act. That Act authorizes the Administrator of the EPA to prescribe maximum contaminant levels in drinking water and specific treatment techniques to reduce the level of contaminants in drinking water.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> With an exception not relevant here,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the Act does not purport to regulate discharges of pollutants. It focuses on \u201cpublic water systems,\u201d <em>see, e. g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300g,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and attempts to insure that such systems provide drinking water that meets minimal safety standards. <em>See generally </em>H.R.Rep. No.93-1185, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 6454, 6456-6462.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Plaintiffs point to no provision of the Act within which defendants\u2019 conduct even arguably falls; we have found none. If this were the only basis asserted for a federal cause of action subject to the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, plaintiffs\u2019 claim would be \u201cwholly insubstantial and frivolous\u201d and therefore within the narrow category of claims that should be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>missed for lack of federal jurisdiction. <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 536-543, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974); <em>Bell v.

Milwaukee, </em>406 U.S. 91, 100, 92 S.Ct. 1385, 31 L.Ed.2d 712 (1972), only a state may file such an action. Plaintiffs do not seek to represent the \u201cquasi-sovereign interest,\u201d <em>Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., </em>206 U.S. 230, 237, 27 S.Ct. 618, 51 L.Ed. 1038 (1907), or the \u201cecological rights,\u201d <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Pankey, </em>441 F.2d 236, 240 (10th Cir. 1971), of the State of Indiana. Because they are not states, they cannot represent the interests of any other state, <em>see </em>Rule 23(a)(3), Fed.R.Civ.P., and they do not seek to do so. They seek only to recover for themselves and other similarly situated municipal bodies damages for expenses they incurred because of defendants\u2019 discharges of toxic chemicals into drinking water supplies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">Since it was the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee </em>that firmly established the existence of a federal common law of nuisance governing interstate water pollution, we take that opinion as our text in determining the content and scope of that law. <em>See also Texas v. Pankey, supra, </em>441 F.2d at 239-242. The Court did not address itself in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee </em>to the question of whether parties other than states were protected by, or could invoke, that law, since the only plaintiff in that case was a state. The Court\u2019s opinion does, however, provide guidance for resolution of the question before us.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-13\">The Court held that \u201claws\u201d in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) includes federal common law as well as statutory law, 406 U.S. at 100, 92 S.Ct. 1385, and declared that there is a federal common law of nuisance applicable to interstate water pollution. <em>Id. </em>at 103, 92 S.Ct. 1385. Referring to the problem of water apportionment, the Court said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"abm-dedup-1\">Rights in interstate streams, like questions of boundaries, \u201chave been recognized as presenting federal questions.\u201d <em>Hinderlider v. LaPlata Co., </em>304 U.S. 92, 110, 58 S.Ct. 803, 811, 82 L.Ed. 1202 [(1938)]. The question of apportionment of interstate waters is a question of \u201cfederal common law\u201d upon which state statutes or decisions are not conclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-14\">406 U.S. at 105, 92 S.Ct. at 1393-94 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s footnote 6 is particularly suggestive of the correct resolution of the issue in the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-15\">Thus, it is not only the character of the parties that requires us to apply federal law. ... As Mr. Justice Harlan indicated for the Court in <em>Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, </em>376 U.S. 398, 421-427, 84 S.Ct. 923, 936-40, 11 L.Ed.2d 804 [(1964)], where there is an overriding federal interest in the need for a uniform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>rule of decision or where the controversy touches basic interests of federalism, we have fashioned federal common law. , . Certainly these same demands for applying federal law are present in the pollution of a body of water such as Lake Michigan bounded, as it is, by four States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"atn-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 105, 92 S.Ct. at 1393-1394 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">Whatever the result should be when the plaintiff is a private party or when no interstate effects are alleged,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> there can be little doubt that the reasons the Supreme Court found compelling for declaring a federal common law of interstate water pollution are applicable here. The plaintiffs are municipal or public corporations, subdivisions of the state, that were required to spend public funds because of pollution of an interstate waterway by acts done in another state. The interests of the state in this interstate pollution dispute are implicated in the same way such interests were implicated in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee.</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">The sewer district asserts that a passage from <em>New Jersey v. New York, </em>345 U.S. 369, 73 S.Ct. 689, 97 L.Ed. 1081 (1953), quoted in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 96-97, 92 S.Ct. at 1389, supports the view that only a state may maintain a suit based on the federal common law. The portion of the passage relied on is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-8\">The City of Philadelphia represents only a part of the citizens of Pennsylvania who reside in the watershed area of the Delaware River and its tributaries and depend upon those waters. If we undertook to evaluate all the separate interests within Pennsylvania, we could, in effect, be drawn into an intramural dispute over the distribution of water within the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">As the rest of the passage quoted in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 97, 92 S.Ct. at 1389, demonstrates, the language will not bear the construction asserted by the sewer district:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-10\">Our original jurisdiction should not be thus expanded to the dimensions of ordinary class actions. An intervenor whose state is already a party should have the burden of showing some compelling interest in his own right, apart from his interest in a class with all other citizens and creatures of the state, which interest is not properly represented by the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5u\">The issue in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York </em>was whether Philadelphia should be permitted to intervene in an original action in the Supreme Court in which Pennsylvania was already a party. What the Court said in addressing that issue has no bearing on whether a party other than a state can maintain a federal common law nuisance action in a district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>So far there is little authority on the question we decide. At least one district court has held that a municipality can state a claim for relief under the federal common law of interstate water pollution. <em>Township of Long Beach v. City of New York, </em>445 F.Supp. 1203, 1214 (D.N.J.1978). Both the Second and Third Circuits have indicated that the United States can state a claim for relief under the federal common law.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">Defendants also contend that plaintiffs\u2019 request for damages rather than injunctive relief someho\\y precludes the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction. None of the defendants cites any authority for that proposition, and we have discovered none.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We have held that plaintiffs are appropriate parties to maintain the cause of action asserted. The question of what relief, if any, they may be entitled to is independent of the court\u2019s power to hear and decide the merits of the claim. <em>See Davis v. Passman, </em>\u2014U.S.\u2014,\u2014, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 2274 n.18, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Whether or not defendants have breached any obligations for which they should be held liable to plaintiffs will be determined by judge-made rules. The consequences of any breach of duty imposed by the courts are necessarily also determined by the courts. <em>Cf. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v. </em>Foust,\u2014U.S.\u2014,\u2014, 99 S.Ct. 2121, 2125, 60 L.Ed.2d 698 (majority opinion), 2128 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (1979) (breach of union\u2019s duty of fair representation). The remedies appropriate for the violation of duties imposed under the federal common law of water pollution will necessarily depend upon the facts in a particular case. <em>E. g., Illinois v. Milwaukee, supra, </em>599 F.2d at 175. We hold only that a request for damages does not preclude the exercise of jurisdiction of a claim arising under the federal common law of interstate water pollution.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-15\">Accordingly, the district court had subject matter jurisdiction of plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the federal common law of interstate water pollution.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">\n<em>Venue and Personal Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1dD\">Since we should affirm a district court judgment on any ground supported by the record on appeal, our disposition of the federal common law claim would ordinarily lead us to consider any other substantial ground urged for affirmance.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Nevertheless, in this case we think it wise to defer consideration of the sewer district\u2019s contention that the Indiana long-arm statute,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> applicable here by force of Rule 4(e), Fed.R. Civ.P.,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> is insufficient to permit the exercise of personal jurisdiction, a contention the trial judge found it unnecessary to reach because of his holding on subject matter jurisdiction. If the issue were governed by Illinois law, our decision in <em>Illinois v. Milwaukee, supra, </em>599 F.2d 151, sustaining in personam jurisdiction, would be controlling. Indiana\u2019s long-arm statute is different from that of Illinois, however. The parties have cited no Indiana decision construing the relevant provisions of the statute, and our research has revealed none. Although federal district courts sitting in Indiana have stated that the \u201cIndiana long-arm statute was intended to extend personal jurisdiction of courts sitting in this state, ., to the limits permitted under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,\" <em>Oddi v. Mariner-Denver, Inc., </em>461 F.Supp. 306, 308 (S.D.Ind.1978),<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> the specific statutory provisions appear to be more limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-20\">Subsection (2) of the Indiana long-arm statute refers to \u201can act or omission done within this state.\u201d We cannot determine whether the Indiana courts will conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>that this phrase includes only acts physically done within the state or also includes acts physically done outside the state but causing some injury within it; either construction is possible.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Subsection (3) of the Indiana statute suggests the narrower construction, since the broader construction would create considerable overlap between the provisions of subsections (2) and (3). Nevertheless, if it is correct that the legislature intended to expand Indiana state court jurisdiction to the limits of the due process clause, a broad construction may be warranted.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> This issue of Indiana statutory law should be decided in the first instance by a district judge sitting in Indiana, who will be more familiar with Indiana law and practice than we are.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-29\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>And it does seem that that was their intent: \u201cThe adoption of this rule will expand the in personam jurisdiction of the courts of this state to the limits permitted under the Due Process Cl\u00e1use of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Civil Code Study Commission, Comments to Rule 4.4, quoted in <em>Valdez v.

Plaintiffs in that case sought equitable relief because of the nature of the claimed injury. <em>See Illinois v. Milwaukee, supra, </em>599 F.2d at 165. The Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of Illinois\u2019 right to maintain the action, therefore, focused on that type of claim.
