In order to avoid any misapprehension, the last sentence of the opinion is revised to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">The trial court\u2019s denial of damages for the expenses incurred in salvaging the barge is reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In computing the amount of damages due the appellant, the sum received for sale of the barge is to be deducted and the appellant is to be awarded only the net costs incurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">While Judge Godbold is of the opinion that this clarification is proper, he adheres to his original dissenting opinion, and continues to hold the view that the district court should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
