Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn.; Washington v. United States; </em>and <em>Puget Sound Gilnetters Assn. v. U. S. D. C., W. D., Washington, </em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 99 S.Ct. 3055, 61 L.Ed.2d 823 (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-19\">The government urges that we should reaffirm the conviction in each of the above six cases. It makes a plausible argument based upon language in the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Washington, et al. </em>v. <em>Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., et al., </em>1979,\u2014U.S.\u2014at\u2014, part VII, n. 32, 99 S.Ct. 3055, 61 L.Ed.2d 823, pointing to the conclusion that the convictions are valid. In spite of the language of note 32, the Supreme Court has vacated our judgments and remanded the matters to us. We think that under these circumstances, the district court should have an opportunity to reconsider the judgments that it entered in each of these six cases. Accordingly, each of the above cases is remanded to the district court for further reconsideration in light of the decision of the Supreme Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
