Curtis Meanor, United States District Judge for the District of New Jersey, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b913-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b913-6\">JAMES HUNTER, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">This case is before the Court on a petition by Monmouth Medical Center (the Hospital) to review, and a cross-application of the National Labor Relations Board (the Board) to enforce, an order issued by the Board against the Hospital.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The order directs the Hospital to bargain collectively with the Hospital Professionals and Allied Employees of New Jersey (the Union). It is predicated on the Board\u2019s decision that the Hospital\u2019s refusal to bargain with the Union constituted an unfair labor practice in violation of section 8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">Whether the Hospital\u2019s refusal to bargain was an unfair labor practice depends on whether the Union was properly certified by the Board as the collective bargaining representative of the Hospital\u2019s employees. The Hospital alleged that the representation election which the Union won was flawed by improper pre-election conduct and that certification of the Union following such an election was therefore invalid. The Board rejected the Hospital\u2019s objection at the initial representation proceeding and declined to reconsider it at the unfair labor practice hearing. We conclude that the Board\u2019s certification decision was inconsistent with case law and with previous decisions of the Board itself and amounted to an abuse of discretion. Since the Union was not properly certified as the bargaining representative, the Hospital committed no unfair practice when it refused to bargain. The Hospital\u2019s petition will be granted, the order will be denied enforcement, and the disputed election will be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">On June 16, 1977, the Board conducted a secret ballot election in a unit consisting of the Hospital\u2019s full-time and regular part-time registered nurses and graduate nurses. Of approximately 320 eligible voters, 284 cast valid ballots. The Union won the election by a vote of 148 for the Union to 136 against the Union \u2014 an effective difference of six votes. The Hospital filed objections to the election, alleging <em>inter alia, </em>that the election should be set aside because the Union \u201cmisused and abused the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s processes to secure a partisan advantage in that it represented to unit employees, directly and indirectly, that the . . . Board endorsed [the Union] in the election\u201d. To support this objection, the Hospital submitted six pieces of literature which had been distributed by the Union during the pre-election campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-17\">The first piece of literature, \u201cExhibit A\u201d, is an official Board-published election pamphlet, entitled \u201cYour Government Conducts an Election\u201d, to which the message \u201cVote <em>Yes </em>June 16 MMC Auditorium\u201d has been added by hand. At least ten of these altered documents were distributed to voters in May, 1977, by the co-chairperson of the Union\u2019s local steering committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>The second piece of literature, \u201cExhibit B\u201d, was mailed to unit employees on or about June 9, 1977. It states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-4\">. On June 13th, there will be a hearing at the National Labor Relations Board regarding the Unfair Labor Practices charged against the Hospital by members of your Steering Committee. <em>The NLRB conducts such hearings only after investigation and rendering merit to such charges. </em>[Emphasis added.] The [Union] has <em>not </em>nor could we be, charged with violating any standard of conduct or representation set to preserve the rights of employees. This hearing proves the Hospital cannot make such a claim. If Mr. Pilla attempted to file such a charge he would realize that he does not stand a chance in a formal hearing as the daily mutilation of the facts would not stand' up as credible evidence at the Labor Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Prior to the distribution of Exhibit B, on March 22, 1977, the Union had mailed a letter, \u201cExhibit C\u201d, which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-6\">. If any misguided friend of the administration, probably unaware that they are putting themselves in <em>criminal </em>jeopardy, threaten to take any negative action against you whatsoever for joining or showing interest in a union, that person has violated a federal law. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-8\">WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO THOSE WHO COMMIT AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-9\">The law provides that those who commit such violations of the Labor Act can be fined up to $5,000.00 and possibly imprisoned up to one year, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">At about the same time that Exhibit B was mailed, the Union mailed another leaflet, \u201cExhibit D\u201d, which states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqu-dedup-1\"><em>Something to think about: </em>The attorneys and agent of the National Labor Relations Board, to whom the hospital and the employees are subject to regarding collective bargaining, ARE UNIONIZED themselves. These people, who are privy to more information than anyone else regarding unions have chosen to unionize years ago. (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-12\">When the experts have chosen this particular method, can it really be the wrong one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-13\">Vote \u201cYes\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-14\">June 16th.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">In early and mid-May, the Union mailed two additional leaflets. The first leaflet, \u201cExhibit E\u201d states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-16\">It is easier for the administrations anti-union campaign, financed with tax deductible hospital funds, to start rumors and spread half-truths than it is for us to send out letters correcting the intentional misinformation many people are being given. WE have nothing to gain by lying to you. When something you hear from the anti-union people contradicts what union organizers have told you, there is any easy way to find out who is telling the truth. Just call the Officer of the Day at the National Labor Relations Board at 645 \u2014 2100. WE have nothing to hide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-17\">The second leaflet, \u201cExhibit F\u201d, which was mailed within the same time period and context as Exhibit E, but to employees voting in an election unit not at issue here, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-18\">If you doubt in any way information given you by the administration or by a representative of the union, we urge you to call the National Labor Relations Board at 645-2100 to verify what you\u2019ve been told.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-19\">The Regional Director of the NLRB conducted an administrative investigation into the Hospital\u2019s objections. In his Report on Objections, he concluded that Exhibits A and B were not objectionable, but that Exhibits C, D, E, and F were. Accordingly, he recommended that the election be set aside and that a new election be directed. Both the Hospital and the Union filed exceptions to the Regional Director\u2019s report. The Board delegated its authority to hear the exceptions to a three member panel. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>panel, in a 2 \u2014 1 decision, overruled the Hospital\u2019s objections, effectively reversing the Regional Director, and certified the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative of the Hospital\u2019s registered and graduate nurses.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">The Hospital refused to bargain with the Union, and an unfair labor practice hearing was commenced.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The proceeding was conducted by the same panel which had overruled the Hospital\u2019s objections to certification. At the hearing the Hospital defended its refusal to bargain by arguing that the Board had improperly overruled the Hospital\u2019s objections to the election and that, therefore, the Board\u2019s certification of the Union was invalid and could not provide the basis for finding an unlawful refusal to bargain. The panel rejected this argument, again by a 2-1 vote, and granted summary judgment in favor of the NLRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Since the Board\u2019s Decision and Order is premised upon its certification of the June 16,1977 election, we must consider the validity of the Board\u2019s certification of the representation election.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are mindful that the Board has \u201cwide discretion\u201d in establishing the procedure and safeguards for conducting representation elections, <em>NLRB v. A. J. Tower Co., </em>329 U.S. 324, 330, 67 S.Ct. 324, 91 L.Ed. 322 (1946). Nevertheless, the Board\u2019s decision must be reasonably consistent with its previous decisions. In <em>Memorial Hospital of Roxborough v. NLRB, </em>545 F.2d 351 (3d Cir. 1976) we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"adl-dedup-0\">In articulating the \u201cbasis for its order\u201d, the Board is free to refer \u201cto other decisions or its general policies laid down in its rules and its annual reports.\u201d <em>[NLRv. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>380 U.S. 438, 443 n.6, [85 S.Ct. 1061, 13 L.Ed.2d 951] (1965)]. However, where the Board has reached different conclusions in prior cases, it is essential that the \u201creasons for the decisions in and distinctions among these cases\u201d be set forth to dispel any appearance of arbitrariness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>[Id. </em>at 442, [95 S.Ct. 1061].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 357. <em>Accord, NLRB v. Saint Francis College, </em>562 F.2d 246, 252 (3d Cir. 1977); <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital v. NLRB, </em>567 F.2d 588, 590 (3d Cir. 1977); <em>NLRB v. Osborn Transportation, Inc., </em>589 F.2d 1275, 1279 (5th Cir. 1979) (\u201cIn exercising the discretion entrusted it in representation matters, the Board must faithfully adhere to the policies and procedures previously announced in its rules and decisions\u201d). In reviewing a Board decision, we may not \u201cabdicate\u201d our responsibility to assure \u201cthat the Board keeps within reasonable grounds\u201d. <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 490, 71 S.Ct. 456, 466, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The gravamen of the Hospital\u2019s complaint is that the literature mailed, distributed, and posted by the Union misrepresented the role of the Board in conducting representation elections and created the impression that the Board favored the Union in the June 16 election. The Hospital\u2019s position is that in thus misleading unit employees the Union compromised the statutory neutrality of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The Board assumes a supervisory role in representation elections. \u201cIt is the Board\u2019s function to provide a laboratory in which an experiment may be conducted, under conditions as nearly ideal as possible to determine the uninhibited desires of the employees.\u201d <em>General Shoe Corp., </em>77 NLRB 124, 127 (1948).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An important aspect of conducting a \u201cfair and free election\u201d has been to prevent the misrepresentation of material facts. In <em>Hollywood Ceramics Company, Inc., </em>140 NLRB 221, 224 (1962), the Board announced its general policy against misrepresentations which might reasonably be expected to have an impact on the election.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Numerous types of misrepresentations can have the impact, under <em>Hollywood Ceramics, </em>to warrant the setting aside of an election. But an area of particular sensitivity,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which has given rise to a body of specialized and rigorous rules, is misrepresentation which creates the impression that the Board favors unions and unionization. Misrepresentation of this sort strikes at the heart of the election process, for the Board\u2019s perceived neutrality is essential to the guarantee of a \u201cfair and free\u201d choice by employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\"> The Board actively guards its neutral status and will intervene to prevent the improper involvement of the Board and its processes in representation elections. The Board \u201cwill not countenance the use of its name in a manner which gives the impression that the Agency has granted a party to an election its imprimatur or support.\u201d <em>GAF Corp., </em>234 NLRB No. 182, slip op. at 4 (1978). \u201cEspecially does [the Board] believe that no participant in a Board election should be permitted to suggest either directly or indirectly to the voters that [the Board] endorses a particular choice.\u201d <em>Allied Electric Products, Inc., </em>109 NLRB 1270, 1272 (1954). If the successful party to an election has misused Board processes to its partisan advantage, the election will be set aside. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">The full Board\u2019s most recent decision in the area of Board neutrality is <em>GAF Corp., </em>234 NLRB No. 182 (1978), which was decided after the representation decision in this case but before the unfair labor practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>hearing. In <em>GAF </em>the Board held that the union had interfered with the election when it mailed a leaflet which contained language similar to that on the Board\u2019s election notice, even though the leaflet was entirely different from that used by the Board. \u201cNational Labor Relations Board an agency of the United States Government\u201d appeared on the top right-hand corner of the leaflet. The top left-hand corner contained a rendering of the United Stat\u00e9s Capitol over which the words, \u201cIt\u2019s the law\u201d had been superimposed. The union had clearly identified itself as the author of the leaflet by placing its name, address and logogram on the bottom. The context of the leaflet revealed that it was election campaign propaganda. Yet, a majority of the Board <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> held that the election should be set aside:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a5v-dedup-0\">As composed, the leaflet at the very least <em>creates an ambiguity </em>in the mind of its reader as to the document\u2019s originator. We have repeatedly held that the Board will not countenance the use of its name in a manner which gives the impression that the Agency has granted a party to an election its imprimatur or support. <em>E. g., J. Ray McDermott &amp; Co., . . </em>.; <em>Rebmar, Inc. . . .; Allied Electrical Products, Inc. . </em>. . As we stated in <em>Rebmar, </em>our concern is not with the substance of the material added to a portion of a Board document, but with the possible impact such propaganda may have on the freedom of choice of the voter. The Board cannot lend its name and prestige to a use which has the <em>tendency to mislead. </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-8\"><em>Id., </em>slip op. at 3 \u2014 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\"><em>GAF </em>and the cases cited therein thus establish the test which is to be applied by the Board when deciding whether the Board\u2019s neutrality has been compromised. We turn to a discussion of whether the Board abused its discretion in applying these principles to the facts of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">Exhibit A is a sample of an official Board document which has been altered by the addition of a hand-printed partisan message. The Board concluded that the partisan message was readily identifiable as emanating from the Union, and that, in any event, a subsequent mailing of identical unmarked documents cured whatever damage the altered document might have caused. This conclusion does not appear to be consistent with previous decisions of the Board. In <em>United States Gypsum Company, </em>124 NLRB 1026 (1959) the Board set aside an election in which the sole objection was that the union had affixed a union button in the \u201cyes\u201d box of a reproduction of an official ballot. The ballots, which were mailed to employees, were clearly stamped \u201csample\u201d, and were not in any other manner altered. In <em>Silco, Inc., Atlas Division, </em>231 NLRB 110 (1977) the Board set aside an election where the employer distributed a hand-printed sample ballot with an arrow pointing to the \u201cno\u201d box. That the partisan message and the ballot itself were hand-printed did not \u201cneutralize\u201d or \u201cjustify\u201d the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">In <em>Allied Electric Products, </em>109 NLRB 1270 (1954), the union distributed what purported to be a sample of the Board\u2019s official ballot, but which had a partisan message appended. The Board concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-15\">The reproduction of a document that purports to be a copy of the Board\u2019s official secret ballot, but which in fact is altered for campaign purposes, necessarily, at the very least, must <em>tend to suggest </em>that the material appearing thereon bears [the Board\u2019s] approval. As there are many legitimate methods available to parties for disseminating campaign propaganda which clearly do not entail an <em>apparent </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number><em>involvement </em>of the Board or its processes, we believe it is unnecessary to permit unlimited freedom to partisans in election cases to reproduce official Board documents for campaign propaganda purposes. (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1272. In <em>Rebmar, Inc., </em>173 NLRB 1434 (1968), the Board applied the <em>Allied Products </em>rule to a Board document which was not a sample ballot. The union had distributed a handbill which in part consisted of a portion of the Board\u2019s election notice, but with a campaign message superimposed thereon.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Board set aside the election, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-5\">Our concern is not with the substance of the material added to the Board\u2019s official notice of election, but with the possible impact such a partisan message added to an official Board document, or copy thereof, might have on the freedom of choice of the voter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-8\">To duplicate a part of the Board\u2019s official notice and then to add to it a personal partisan message that may be interpreted by the employee as an endorsement by the Board of one of the parties to the election, and thus have an impact on the employees\u2019 freedom of choice, is, we think, an undesirable use of Board documents designed for another purpose. <em>That the Union\u2019s message in this case may be arguably innocuous and that there may have been at most a narrow or technical violation of the Allied Electric Products </em>rule, <em>is clearly irrelevant. </em>Whether deliberate or unintentional, such action has a <em>tendency to mislead, </em>and we are of the opinion that the Board should guard against having its prestige put to such possible abuse.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 173 NLRB at 1434. (emphasis added; citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">In <em>GAF, </em>which did not involve a sample ballot, the Board found that mere ambiguity was enough to make a document objectionable, even though the document was clearly identified as emanating from the union, and contained only some language similar to that used by the Board in its election notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">Exhibit A is an actual Board document and the union source of the appended partisan message is nowhere admitted. It would seem that, as in <em>Rebmar </em>and GAF, application of the <em>Allied Electric </em>rule is warranted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-15\">The Board, in its brief, attempts to distinguish <em>Silco </em>and <em>\u00dcnited States Gypsum </em>as \u201cmerely\u201d being cases in which alteration was found objectionable. In reliance on A. <em>Brandt &amp; Co., Inc., </em>199 NLRB 459 (1972), the Board concludes that, in Exhibit A, the \u201ccomments could not reasonably be construed by the employees as part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>[Board\u2019s publication] but were readily identifiable by them as partisan comments emanating from the [Union] in relation to the election campaign\u201d. We are not necessarily persuaded that this conclusion is consistent with the cases discussed above or represents a reasonable application of the principles those cases represent. <em>Silco </em>itself said that alterations have been found permissible only in \u201ca few cases\u201d. 231 NLRB at 110. The Board\u2019s conclusion is especially questionable in light of the fact that the election was close, and considering the emphasis in <em>GAF </em>on mere \u201cambiguity\u201d and \u201ctendency to mislead\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, speaking now only to Exhibit A, we need not decide if the Board abused its discretion in approving this particular campaign material, as the remaining exhibits by themselves are sufficient to make out reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">Exhibit B contains a Union reference to an unfair labor practice hearing and the Union\u2019s declaration that the Board had \u201crender[ed] merit\u201d to the charges. We read it in light of Exhibit C, which was sent out prior to the mailing of B and which incorrectly states that criminal penalties attach to those who have been found guilty of unfair practices. The Board excused Exhibit B as being only \u201cinartfully drafted\u201d and not a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cpatent\u201d mis-characterization of a Board proceeding. Further, to the extent that there was a misleading inference that the Board had already found merit in the unfair practice charges the Board concluded that the harm was mitigated by the references in the letter to \u201chearings\u201d and \u201ccharges\u201d. The Board found Exhibit C permissible because it did not implicate the Board\u2019s documents or proceedings and could not \u201creasonably have had an impact on the election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">The exhibits do implicate a Board proceeding \u2014 the unfair labor practice hearing. Exhibit B refers directly to such proceedings and Exhibit C misrepresents the penalties which attach to being found guilty in such proceedings. Misrepresentation of the import of being charged in an unfair labor practice hearing was condemned in <em>Formco, Inc., </em>233 NLRB No. 5 (1977). There the Board held that the Union interfered with an election when it distributed a letter stating that the employer was guilty of unfair labor practices.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Board reasoned that since only the Board could find an employer \u201cguilty\u201d the Union\u2019s statement drew the Board into the election. In <em>ONA Corp., </em>235 NLRB No. 85 (1978), the Union distributed excerpted copies of a complaint and notice, and added the disclaimer that a hearing had been set and the employer had denied all of the allegations. The Board ruled that the disclaimer did not cure the violation of Board neutrality, since the excerpted document still \u201cgave the appearance\u201d that the Board had already concluded that the employer was guilty. Citing <em>Mallory Capacitor Co., </em>161 NLRB (1510 (1966), the Board held that the practice constituted \u201ca misuse of [the Board\u2019s] processes in that such reproduction was reasonably calculated to mislead employees into believing that the Board had judged the Employer to have violated Federal law, whereas such was not the case.\u201d <em>ONA Corp., </em>235 NLRB No. 85, slip op. at 3 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">The Board\u2019s second justification, that the exhibits could not reasonably have had an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>impact on the outcome of the election, is based in part on an inappropriate test. It is the \u201ctendency\u201d to mislead and the creation of \u201cambiguity\u201d which <em>GAF </em>and <em>Allied Products </em>identify as the critical issues to be weighed. Doubts on the question of whether the misconduct actually had an impact should have been resolved against certification. As the court observed in <em>NLRB v. Trancoa Chemical Corp., </em>303 F.2d 456, 461 (1st Cir. 1962), |t is enough for the election to be set aside because of misrepresentation if the employer shows that \u201cit is sufficiently likely that it cannot be told whether [the employees] were or were not [misled].\u201d To the extent that the Board was concluding that no reasonable person could find the references misleading, the Bo\u00e1rd was directly contradicting its Regional Director without either an apparent or explained reason. The Director had concluded that, \u201cThe investigation revealed that [the Union] made numerous references to the National Labor Relations Board and/or the Act not only in Exhibit C but also throughout many of its campaign leaflets including Exhibits B, D and E. . The <em>unavoidable impact </em>of such repeated references to the Board and the Act had to be the creation of the impression in the minds of the voters that [the Union] had a certain expertise regarding Board processes and the Act and knew what it was saying. Therefore, by misstating the law as discussed above, [the Union], whether unintentional or deliberate, misled the voters to believe that their Employer was possibly guilty of criminal conduct.\u201d (Emphasis added)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">The Board\u2019s reliance on the reference to \u201chearings\u201d are \u201ccharges\u201d as mitigating the tendency to mislead is misplaced. In <em>ONA, </em>235 NLRB No. 85 (1979), reference in the document to a \u201chearing\u201d and to the employer\u2019s denial of the allegations was insufficient to cure the misleading statements. It is not at all clear that mere reference to \u201chearings\u201d and \u201ccharges\u201d in the text of Exhibit B is sufficient to serve as an effective disclaimer, even were disclaimers to be allowed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">Exhibit D appears to strike at the heart of the Board\u2019s neutrality by suggesting that the attorneys and agents of the Board favor unions. It goes so far as to say that the Board favors the \u201cparticular method\u201d of unionization upon which the employees were voting. The Board held, however, that an organization could not be presumed to favor unions simply because its employees were represented by a union and that therefore, there could have been no effect on the Board\u2019s neutrality. This completely misses the point. The question is not whether the unionization of its employees proves that the Board actually favors unions. Rather, the question is whether reference by the campaigning Union to unionization of the Board\u2019s employees would <em>create the impression in the minds of the voters </em>that the Board favors unionization.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">The Board also concluded that if anything, this exhibit was \u201ccampaign propaganda\u201d that employees would recognize and evaluate. We see no reason, and the Board advances none, to conclude that the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>ees would recognize this particular literature as propaganda, or would look behind it and recognize that it misrepresented the Board\u2019s role in conducting elections.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This is especially so since the Board\u2019s finding ignores the conclusion of the Regional Director that \u201c[the Union] cloaked itself throughout the election campaign with the appearance of certain expertise as to the purposes and procedures of the National Labor Relations Act and the Board.\u201d We do not see how the Board could hurdle from this finding, and the Director\u2019s finding quoted at paragraph 21 <em>supra, </em>to the conclusion that the misrepresentations were readily identifiable as propaganda.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Exhibits E and F are letters which referred voters to the Board should they have any questions about the Union. The Regional Director found that these items a <em>lone </em>warranted the setting aside of the election. He concluded that the Union had impermis-sibly injected the Board into the campaign, and had suggested that the Board would respond to the employees\u2019 questions in a manner favorable to the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">The conclusion that these letters constituted impermissible interference in the election appears to be compelled by <em>GAF </em>and by <em>Formco, Inc. </em>in which the Board held: \u201cOur concern is with the protection of- our own processes, lest any voter be left with the impression that [the] Board is in favor of any party in an election. We are unwilling to condone any campaign statement <em>which even implies such bias.\u201d </em>233 NLRB No. 5, slip op. at 5-6 (emphasis added). In this case, the Board held that no document or proceeding was involved, and noted that referring employees\u2019 questions to the Board was allowed. The Board went on to say that anyone calling the Officer of the Day would have been told that he doesn\u2019t answer specific questions. Whether this is in fact the case is sheer speculation. In any event, the dissenting opinion from the Board\u2019s decision in this case effectively questioned the reasonableness of the Board\u2019s conclusion, observing that it was unlikely that employees would actually call the Board, so that the impermissible impression which had been created would remain. Moreover, the dissent noted that even if employees were to call and discover the Union\u2019s misstatement, this would not \u201crender innocuous or justify\u201d the Union\u2019s action.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We agree.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As the court noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>in <em>NLRB v.

The application of <em>Formco, Inc. </em>in <em>Guit\u00f3n </em>cannot be squared with our case, unless the Board\u2019s decision in our case represents an inconsistent application of the law, which applies to the misrepresentation of the import of unfair practice hearings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b920-5\">.

That the Board will not do so is hardly relevant, for it is the likely impact on employees of the [Union\u2019s] misleading campaign propaganda involving this Board that is of concern here. The impact remains unaffected by the truth unless the unrealistic assumption is made that a substantial number of employees will call the Board and learn the truth \u2014 i.e., that the Board will not get involved in partisan matters. But even if the employees did not look behind su.ch campaign propaganda, that would not justify or render innocuous the [Union\u2019s] gratuitous and improper attempt to make the employees believe this Board is not impartial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-16\">234 NLRB No. 50, slip op. at 13-14 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b921-17\">.
