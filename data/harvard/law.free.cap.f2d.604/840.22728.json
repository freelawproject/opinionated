The defendants/appellees are the Virginia State Bar, its president, in his official capacity and in an individual capacity and the Virginia State Bar Ethics Committee and its chairman in his official capacity and as representative of the individual members of the Ethics Committee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Initially the plaintiffs raised claims that the assailed rules were violative of the anti-trust laws but such claims were dismissed. The plaintiffs do not question such dismissal on this appeal. The cause went to trial on the claim of the plaintiffs that the rules represented primarily violations of free speech. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>evidence in support of this constitutional claim was largely directed at the self-laudatory proscription imposed by the rules.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">After trial but before the parties had filed their briefs, the plaintiffs, representing to the district court that the issues in this case were the \u201cidentical issues\u201d involved in <em>Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, </em>then before the Supreme Court on grant of certiorari, moved that briefing be \u201csuspended until such time' as the United States Supreme Court takes final action in the <em>Bates </em>case.\u201d The motion was granted without objection by the defendants. When <em>Bates </em>was decided,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the district court, over objections of the plaintiffs, dismissed the action as moot, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-5\">\u201cDefendants having made it clear they intend to abide by the decision in <em>Bates </em>and that a study is now being made of the language of the regulations under consideration to comport ydth <em>Bates, </em>and to eliminate any unconstitutional provisions of the rules, the issue before the court in this case is now moot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">It, also, denied the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">The plaintiffs have appealed both the dismissal of the action as moot and the disal-lowance of attorneys\u2019 fees. We are of the opinion that the dismissal was improper and that it is premature to consider the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees before the resolution of the validity of the self-laudatory provision of the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">As we have indicated, the main thrust of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was directed at, and most of the testimony taken in the proceedings revolved about, this issue of whether self-laudatory advertising by lawyers is to be classified as \u201ccommercial speech\u201d and as such entitled to First Amendment protection. It may be conceded that such form of advertising, even though engaged in for pecuniary benefit rather than to advance \u201cbeliefs and ideas,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> does qualify as \u201ccommercial speech.\u201d This, however, does not answer the more fundamental question of how extensive and broad are the constitutional protections to which such speech is entitled under the First Amendment.<footnotemark>5a</footnotemark> While some commentators would suggest rather broad constitutional protections for this form of advertising designed as it is to secure \u201cremunerative employment,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Supreme Court, in several recent cases since <em>Bates, </em>has said that \u201c[a] lawyer\u2019s procurement of remunerative employment is a subject only marginally affected with First Amendment concerns\u201d and \u201cfalls within the State\u2019s proper sphere of economic and professional regulation,\u201d subject as such to \u201cprophylactic regulation in furtherance of the State\u2019s interest in protecting the lay public.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It has further declared that such \u201ccommercial speech,\u201d engaged in for pecuniary profit, calls for different standards of scrutiny in which claims of overbreadth have little or no relevancy,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and allows for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>\u201cmodes of regulation that might be impermissible in the realm of non-commercial expression.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">It is true that in <em>Bates </em>the Court sustained the right under the First Amendment for lawyers to engage in \u201cthe truthful advertising of\u201d prices at which \u201c \u2018routine\u2019 legal services\u201d will be performed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The truthfulness of such advertising is generally susceptible to \u201cprecise measurement or verification.\u201d Self-laudatory statements, however, are not so easily verifiable, particularly by lay persons. In <em>Friedman v. Rogers,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decided at the current term, the Supreme Court denied optometrists the right under First Amendment entitlement to use a trade-name in their advertisements, finding that such advertising carries such indicia of quality as to be misleading to the lay public and consequently subject to restraint. It can well be argued that self-laudatory advertising by lawyers would fall under the same ban. But however persuasive we may find this view, it presents a point, which was not addressed by the district court but which has been posed by the plaintiffs. So long as this point has not been resolved, it cannot fairly be said that this action has become moot as a result of the decision in <em>Bates, </em>which very plainly declared it was not addressing \u201cthe peculiar problems associated with advertising claims relating to the <em>quality of </em>legal services,\u201d claims which the Court declared \u201cprobably are not susceptible of precise measurement or verification and, under some circumstances, might well be deceptive or misleading to the public, or even false.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">It is, however, the position of the defendants that the plaintiffs, by representing to the district court that the issues were \u201cidentical\u201d with those in <em>Bates, </em>are no longer in a position to urge that there are issues remaining in this case outside the decision in <em>Bates. </em>Even if the declaration by the plaintiffs on their motion for delayed briefing that the issues in this case were \u201cidentical\u201d with those in <em>.Bates </em>should be considered in the nature of a representation, it would be a representation contrary to fact, since a primary issue as raised by the plaintiffs both in their pleadings and in their proof was not, even though it may have been raised below in the Arizona court, addressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Bates. </em>Whether this was because the plaintiffs were mistaken in their understanding of the issues which the Supreme Court undertook to resolve on its grant of certiorari in <em>Bates </em>or not, it would be unfair to dismiss one of their primary claims because of a misapprehension on the plaintiffs\u2019 part as to the narrow scope of the Supreme Court\u2019s grant of its writ or because, for some reason, the Supreme Court may not have chosen to decide the self-laudatory claim. Nor would it be in the interest of judicial economy to use the plaintiffs\u2019 possible mistake about the issues in <em>Bates </em>as a basis for a dismissal of this action as moot when the only result of such a ruling would be the filing of another action, raising the issue and requiring the re-tracing of the record already made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">The dismissal of this action as moot is accordingly reversed and the cause is remanded to the district court for the disposition of the issues raised by the parties but not settled by <em>Bates. </em>It may be that, on remand, the district court would wish to abstain for a reasonable time in order to allow the Virginia Supreme Court to formulate its revision of the challenged rules, a process which the defendants suggest is now under active consideration by the Virginia Supreme Court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In any event, until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>the issues in the case not resolved by <em>Bates </em>are resolved, any application for the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees in favor of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel for their services in prosecuting this action would, be premature. It is accordingly unnecessary for us to consider now whether in any event the officers and members of the State Bar, charged by statute with the obligation to enforce the challenged rules and regulations as the administrative arm of the Supreme Court, may be rendered personally liable for attorneys\u2019 fees in simply enforcing administratively those rules and regulations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We accordingly express no opinion on the claim of error by the plaintiffs on the denial of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-17\">.
