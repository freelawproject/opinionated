The Commission ordered Wi-scope S.A., a Swiss corporation trading in various physical commodities and commodity futures on international markets, to liquidate all of its open positions in commodity futures on United States markets by April 13, 1979.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission also prohibited Wiscope S.A. from trading on those markets, and at the same time ordered those markets to refuse trading privileges to Wi-scope S.A. and its agents (except for purposes of liquidation). In addition, the Commission prohibited Wiscope S.A. from reentering any contract market subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction \u201cuntil such time as [Wiscope S.A.] demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commission that it can and will comply with Section 21.02 [17 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.02<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] . . . and any other provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>sions of the Act or Commission regulations that require [Wiscope S.A.] to furnish information or reports to the Commission.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we grant the petition and set aside the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">On November 3, 1978, Wiscope S.A. received the following request in a letter from a Commission staff member named Michael P. Charles, the letter having been mailed directly to Wiscope S.A.\u2019s Switzerland office:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-5\">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, at a meeting on October 30,1978, authorized me to issue a special call for information pursuant to Section 21.02 of the Regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act. You are hereby called upon to furnish to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">(a) The name, address and principal occupation of all traders, including house accounts, holding open contracts on your records in Coffee \u201cC\u201d futures on the New York Coffee &amp; Sugar Exchange, Inc. as of November 2, November 16, and November 30, 1978.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">(b) The number of open contracts owned or controlled by such traders in each future as of each of the above listed dates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-8\">(c) The classification of such traders\u2019 open contracts as speculative, spreading (straddling) or hedging, or as \u201cforeign broker\u201d if such trader is another foreign broker.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">The letter specified that the information for November 2 had to be forwarded no later than midnight November 10 and that the information for November 16 and 30 had to be forwarded no later than midnight of the 16th and the 30th. The letter closed with the following warning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-10\">Please be advised that failure to comply with this special call will be considered a violation of the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder, and may lead to formal action which could result in the suspension or denial of your trading privileges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">One week later, Wiscope S.A. responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-15\">We confirm that we act as a foreign broker for our clients on commodity futures markets, which information has already been advised to you on previous occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-16\">You should be aware that this company is resident in Switzerland and is subject to the regulations and laws governing confidentiality and secrecy of our clients and their business. Unless we receive written authority from our clients we are not able to disclose any information about them or their positions with us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-17\">We must inform you that our clients have instructed us to maintain this confidentiality, which means that we are unable to comply with your request for information on our clients[\u2019] positions with us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-18\">Not satisfied with this response, the Commission, through Donald L. Tendriek, its executive director, telexed Wiscope S.A. to again request the information sought in Charles\u2019 November 3rd letter and to again relay the warning that failure to comply with the request would lead to enforcement proceedings. The next day, Wiscope S.A. responded in the following fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-19\">We are attempting to obtain the consent of our clients to provide you with the information that you require. However at present we do not have the necessary consents from our clients to enable us to supply you with this information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6h\">Accordingly we regret that we find ourselves unable to comply with your request as to do so would be a breach of the duty of confidentiality which we owe to our clients under the laws of Switzerland. We are advised that any disclosure concerning the affairs of our clients without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>their specific consent would be in breach of Article 162 of the Swiss criminal code and would make any person making such unauthorized disclosure subject to criminal proceedings under the provisions of the code referred to above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-5\">Please be assured that we are making every effort to obtain for you the information your [sic] require and will revert as soon as we are able.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Within a week, the Commission issued a complaint against Wiscope S.A. charging it, <em>inter alia, </em>with violating 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.02 by failing to comply with a \u201cspecial call.\u201d The hearing commenced on December 6, 1978, and concluded the next day. On December 14 the Administrative Law Judge recommended that Wiscope S.A. be found in violation of \u00a7 21.02, and on December 19 the record was certified to the Commission. Three months later the Commission, ruling that Wiscope S.A. had failed to respond adequately to a \u201cspecial call,\u201d entered the order described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Petitioner\u2019s first claim is that there was not sufficient' competent evidence to support the finding that a \u201cspecial call\u201d had in fact been authorized with regard to Wiscope S.A. An analysis of the record convinces us that petitioner is correct. Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and set aside the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">The Commission\u2019s November 3rd letter to Wiscope S.A. indicated that at the meeting held on October 30, 1978, the Commission had authorized its staff to issue a \u201cspecial call\u201d to Wiscope S.A. The official minutes of that meeting, however, entitled \u201cMinutes of the Surveillance Briefing of October 30, 1978,\u201d contain <em>only </em>the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-9\">The staff proposed that the Commission authorize a special call pursuant to section 21.02 of the regulations to require Pacol Ltd. and Wiscope Trading Ltd. to furnish to the Director of the Eastern Region all information specified under that regulation with respect to Coffee \u201cC\u201d futures on the New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange. The Commission voted 3 to 0 to approve this call (Commissioner Seevers, Dunn and Gartner voting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">The minutes, prepared by Commission staff economist John Mielke, contain no reference whatsoever to Wiscope S.A. The minutes mention only a separate, sister corporation by the name of Wiscope Trading Ltd., located in London, England. Wiscope S.A. argues that these minutes support the view that no \u201cspecial call\u201d <em>to Wiscope S.A. </em>had ever been authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">At the December 6th hearing, Mielke testified that \u201c[o]n October 30th, 1978, . . . the Commission authorized that a special call be issued to Wiscope S.A. under Section 21[.]02 of the Regulations . . . .\u201d When asked to explain why the minutes of that meeting referred only to Wiscope Trading Ltd., Mielke testified that as of the October 30th meeting the Commission\u2019s staff knew only that there were two separate entities whose title included the name \u201cWiscope\u201d and that they were somehow related. He also testified that it had been the Commission\u2019s \u201cfull intention\u201d to call for information from both entities. The Administrative Law Judge found this to be sufficient to support a finding that a \u201cspecial call\u201d had been issued to Wiscope S.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">On January 26, 1979, well after the record had been certified by the Administrative Law Judge, the Commission, <em>sua sponte, </em>announced that it had discovered a tape recording of the October 30th meeting and had ordered a transcript made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commission acknowledged that the transcript was \u201cunquestionably, privileged material\u201d and that \u201c[u]nder normal circumstances, [it] simply would not place the transcript of the October 30 meeting, which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>in its entirety, involved a discussion of highly sensitive market information and confidential information concerning Wiscope and other entities in the public domain.\u201d Nevertheless, \u201cwith great reluctance,\u201d it ordered an edited or \u201csanitized\u201d version of the transcript made part of the public record, in order to evaluate Mielke\u2019s testimony at the hearing<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and so that \u201cthe ends of justice\u201d would be served. Having placed the transcript in the public record, the Commission then took \u201cofficial notice.\u201d of its contents \u201cfor the purpose of determining whether the Commission authorized its staff to issue a special call for information upon Wiscope S.A.\u201d This \u201cofficial notice\u201d was taken pursuant to \u00a7 556(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556(e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and pursuant to 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.67(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Based on the information then before it, the Commission found that a \u201cspecial call\u201d had been issued to Wiscope S.A.,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the call had not been answered. In our judgment, the Commission in this instance failed to turn the \u201csquare corners\u201d ordinarily required in matters as sensitive as those involved in this case. <em>Cf. Rock Island, Arkansas &amp; Louisiana Railroad Co. v. United States, </em>254 U.S. 141, 143, 41 S.Ct. 55, 65 L.Ed. 188 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">By its very terms, the regulation provides that it is only \u201c[u]pon special call by the Commission\u201d that an entity is responsible for submitting requested information. The requirement that the Commission itself make this decision rather than its staff members, and that it be made with all appropriate formality, is fully justified. As is amply demonstrated by this case, these \u201cspecial calls\u201d require the disclosure of extremely sensitive information and carry with them drastic consequences for failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>to answer satisfactorily. Here, proper formality is entirely lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The official minutes of the October 30th meeting suggest that a \u201cspecial call\u201d was issued only to Wiscope Trading Ltd. The Commission subsequently declined to base its finding on these minutes however. It also declined to base its finding on the testimony of the minutes\u2019 author. Instead, the Commission based its finding on an inference based on the edited transcript of the October 30th meeting. But in our judgment, \u201cofficial notice\u201d should not have been taken of that transcript. It is clearly not a \u201cmaterial fact which might be judicially noticed by a district court of the United States.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.67(b)(i). <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 201(b). Nor do we think it fair to term the transcript \u201cmatter in the public official records of the Commission.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.67(b)(ii). The effect of the Commission\u2019s maneuvering in this case is that an item that was otherwise not an \u201cofficial public record\u201d was made so solely in order for the Commission to \u201cofficially notice\u201d it. As explained by the Commission itself, \u201cthe Commission first made the transcript public and then took official notice of it. Thus, at the time the Commission took official notice of the transcript, it was a public record for purposes of rule 10.67(b).\u201d Brief at 58. This we find not only unacceptable but also well beyond the anticipation and intention of those who authored the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">For these reasons, we grant the petition and set the order aside.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-13\">. This petition was originally filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court stayed the effect of the Commission\u2019s order on March 19, 1979, but subsequently dismissed the petition on grounds of \u201clack of proper venue.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9. The stay was continued by this Court on April 3, 1979, pending disposition of the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b857-14\">.

The Commission\u2019s announcement explained that \u201c[t]his tape must have been overlooked by the Division of Enforcement in its responses to Wiscope\u2019s requests for such material.\u201d The Commission also explained that the tape existed pursuant to the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b, as implemented by Part 147 of the Commission\u2019s Rules, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b860-4\">. In its January 26th order, the Commission suggested that \u201cthe entirety of Mielke\u2019s testimony may no longer be material in view of the tape recording.\u201d In its final decision, the Commission noted that \u201cthe testimony of Mielke, over which much concern has been voiced, is now of little import. . . . [W]e have not based our decision here in any material respect upon Mielke\u2019s testimony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b860-7\">.

Because we believe that the Commission was not authorized to take \u201cofficial notice\u201d of the transcript, we need not describe its contents in detail. We do note, however, that the transcript would seem to support an <em>inference </em>that the Commission meant to issue a special call to both Wiscope Trading Ltd. and Wiscope S.A. James Goodwin, a member of the Commission\u2019s Office of Surveillance and Analysis, described to the Commission the \u201cWiscope in London\u201d account and also referred to activity of \u201ca Swiss affiliate of theirs.\u201d He said that Wiscope S.A. had identified itself as \u201ccommodity dealers\u201d and that Wiscope Trading Ltd. had identified itself as being involved primarily in \u201ccommodity futures trading.\u201d Subsequent conversation related to \u201cWiscope,\u201d without reference to the specific entity being described. At the close of the meeting, the following conversation took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-16\">MR.
