As appellant points out, we failed to note that September 4, 1978, the day on which the filing period would have ended, was a legal holiday. When this happens, the party receives an additional day in which to file. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a). Appellant filed on September 5, 1978. Thus, his appeal was timely filed. Accordingly, we grant the petition for rehearing and reinstate the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL VACATED and APPEAL REINSTATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
