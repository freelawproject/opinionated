Because we believe these findings were not supported by substantial evidence, we set aside the subject order and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A6_A\">A. <em>Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">Petitioner Whitney is the sole proprietor of a business in Fairfield, Connecticut, selling insurance and various types of securities, the latter as a registered representative of CNA Investor Services, Inc. (CNA), a broker-dealer registered with the SEC. In connection with his insurance business, Whitney had on occasion arranged to have retirement pension funds placed under the management of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (CG), a service for which CG compensated him. In 1972 and 1973 Whitney sought to secure for CG the management of such a fund belonging to the Town of Stratford. Although CG had originally proposed to assume management of the entire fund, the Stratford Pension Board chose to place with it only one-half, leaving the remainder with the prior manager. Under this arrangement, one-half of the fund assets, chiefly securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, would be sold at the outset and the cash proceeds, invested by CG. In accordance with an accompanying escrow agreement, CG would conduct the initial liquidation once the securities were delivered by the Town.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">In the course of its deliberations the Pension Board raised the question whether Whitney\u2019s compensation, if any, would be a charge against the fund assets. On two occasions, John Elliot, CG\u2019s area pension fund manager and a friend of Whitney\u2019s, represented to the pension board that Whitney\u2019s fee, billable to the fund, would be $700. However, believing the $700 \u201cfinder\u2019s fee\u201d would be inadequate, Elliot and Whitney began considering other avenues of compensation, among them an arrangement whereby Whitney, as a registered securities representative for CNA, would share in the brokerage commissions generated by CG\u2019s liquidation of the fund assets. The idea required another broker-dealer inasmuch as CNA was not a member of the New York Stock Exchange and could not directly liquidate the fund. For this purpose, Elliot approved the brokerage firm of Thomson &amp; McKinnon, Auchincloss &amp; Kohl-meyer (TM) in August 1973. Thereafter Whitney wrote to TM explaining what was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">In October or November 1973 Elliot told Whitney that senior officers at CG had \u201cfor political reasons\u201d disapproved Whitney\u2019s receiving commissions on the liquidating sales but that Whitney would yet be compensated through commissions on other brokerage. Although in December 1973 Elliot was instructed to tell Whitney that CG would not participate in any arrangement whatever for indirect compensation, it is uncertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>what he conveyed to Whitney.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Then, in January 1974, Elliot died.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Whitney was introduced to Elliot\u2019s successor, Lawrence English, on 3 April, at which time, according to the Commission, Whitney was told that \u201cCG would not permit him to receive compensation from the portfolio liquidation or from any other CG brokerage, and that CG would not utilize TM for the liquidation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After Whitney objected, raising his contrary understanding with Elliot, English again pursued the matter at CG and later telephoned Whitney, confirming what had been said on 3 April.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Thereafter Whitney proposed to English that Whitney earn additional compensation by personally conducting the liquidating of the fund.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> English indicated that CG would be agreeable, but that Whitney would have to prevail on the Town to retain him. At Whitney\u2019s request, Frederick Castellani, an underwriter in CG\u2019s pension department, wrote Whitney on 10 April confirming CG\u2019s approval but noting that the escrow agreement, providing that CG liquidate the fund, would in that event have to be rescinded. Later in April 1974 English spoke with Whitney on the telephone and apparently was told that Whitney and the Town were \u201cmoving along nicely\u201d in the direction of a satisfactory liquidation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">On 16 May the Town\u2019s Director of Finance called Whitney and asked him to pick up the fund securities for CG, whereupon Whitney called Alvin Rapps at TM and told him to expect delivery of the securities. Whitney received the securities on 17 May, signing receipts which recited that the securities were received \u201cfor conveyance to\u201d CG. Then, accompanied by the Town\u2019s pension board chairman, Whitney took the securities to TM\u2019s New York office. While other TM personnel reviewed the securities, Rapps prepared a new account form in the name of the \u201cTown of Stratford Pension Fund Agency,\u201d with a notation that the account was \u201cfor the courtesy\u201d of CNA. After reading the account form Whitney told Rapps that it was unnecessary to send copies of confirmations of the securities sales to CG in addition to the Town and CNA, as was provided in the account form.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">According to the Commission, after delivering the securities to TM Whitney continued his efforts to persuade the Town to liquidate the fund through him. On 29 May, apparently at Whitney\u2019s request, an officer of CG wrote to the pension board chairman recommending that the Town liquidate the fund in the manner proposed by Whitney. On 31 May Whitney wrote to the pension board chairman, enclosing a draft letter which he proposed the board send to TM authorizing the liquidation \u201cto conform with\u201d CG\u2019s letter of 29 May. The Town, however, declined to proceed with the liquidation through TM unless CG would approve the proposed sequence of liquidation, which it refused to do. After apparently fruitless discussions, the Town attorney on 17 July instructed CG to proceed with the liquidation in accordance with the escrow agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">It was learned, however, that in the event TM did not conduct the liquidation it would still charge the Town $5,000 for services it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>had already performed. Consequently, the pension board decided on 6 August to rescind the escrow agreement and to liquidate through TM after all. The securities were then sold in the normal course and Whitney received $3,500 in commissions in accordance with CNA\u2019s agreement with TM.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">B. <em>Course of the Proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Following a five-day evidentiary hearing, the presiding Administrative Law Judge found that Whitney, seeking additional compensation, had engaged in a fraudulent scheme in connection with the sale of securities belonging to the pension fund in violation of section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and the Commission\u2019s Rule 10b-5. The ALJ suspended Whitney for nine months from association with any securities broker or dealer. The Commission, after reviewing the record, agreed that Whitney had \u201cwillfully violated\u201d section 10(b) and rule 10b-5, and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s imposition of a nine-month suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Under section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Commission may suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months any person from being associated with a broker or dealer if the Commission finds, after notice and hearing, that the person has willfully violated any provision of the Act and that the suspension would be in the public interest. The antifraud provisions of the Act, set out in section 10(b),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> make it unlawful for any person directly or indirectly to \u201cuse or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security . any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\u201d in violation of the Commission\u2019s rules. Rule 10b-5 in turn proscribes three categories of conduct. It makes it unlawful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-12\">(a) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-13\">(b) to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a materi- * al fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>cumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-4\">(c) to engage in any act, practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The Commission, after a hearing,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> found that Whitney \u201cdeliberately deceived\u201d CG and the Town pension board in violation of section 10(b) and rule lOb-5.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Commission thought it plain enough that the fraud was in connection with the sale of securities inasmuch as Whitney\u2019s sole purpose was \u201cto obtain compensation by arranging to have those securities sold through an agent of his own choosing.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While we suppose that Whitney\u2019s conduct occurred in connection with the sale of securities for purposes of section 10(b), we neither find the proven conduct fraudulent, nor think that those allegations which arguably do describe fraud were substantiated in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-16\">A. <em>Standard of Proof.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-17\">The Commission recited in a footnote that it found the evidence of Whitney\u2019s fraud \u201cclear and convincing\u201d whether or not such were in fact the relevant standard of proof.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It recalled that this court fairly recently held in <em>Collins Securities Corp. </em>v. <em>SEC</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that factual findings in at least some administrative proceedings brought, like this one, under the broker-dealer provisions in section 15(b) must be sustained by clear and convincing evidence. Evidently, however, the Commission is of the view that <em>Collins </em>is either wrong or inapposite.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We disagree. <em>Collins, </em>which we reaffirm today, plainly governs this case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-18\">In <em>Collins </em>we said that the Commission may not revoke a broker-dealer\u2019s registration upon a finding of fraud without clear and convincing evidence. A mere preponderance, we concluded, was not enough in view of the seriousness of the potential sanction and the frequently ambiguous inferential evidence encountered in fraud cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>The Commission would have us distinguish the instant case from <em>Collins </em>on grounds that (1) Whitney\u2019s nine-month suspension is a less serious deprivation .than the revocation in <em>Collins </em>and (2) the \u201cdirect evidence in this case has a naturally greater pursuasion [s/c].\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> These supposed distinctions do not matter. Even were we for some reason inclined to choose the standard of proof under section 15(b) on a case-by-case basis, a practice which would not have occurred to us, we would not depart from the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard in this case. Like the revocation in <em>Collins, </em>a suspension for nine months imposes a serious loss, both as a short-run matter of forgone business and, perhaps more grievously, as a permanent injury to reputation. Any supposed difference in this respect is one of degree which we think immaterial to the adequate measure of proof. Moreover, despite the presence of some \u201cdirect\u201d testimony in this case, the state of the evidence is hardly unequivocal and we are reluctant to forgo, the added assurance of correctness afforded by a heightened standard of proof.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In any event, the Commission has taken an overly parsimonious view of our rationale in <em>Collins; </em>we hold here that any sanction imposed under section 15(b) which depends on a finding of fraud<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> must be sustained by clear and convincing evidence. Such proceedings inevitably are subject, in varying degrees, to the uncertainties of circumstantial and subjective proof, and result <em>in </em>stigmatizing the defendant irrespective of the formal sentence meted out.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">B. <em>The Scope of Judicial Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">As is frequently observed, the burden of proof and the scope of review in administrative law cases, as in ordinary judicial proceedings, are separate matters.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The former is the measure of belief which legally must exist in the mind of the trier of fact in order to sustain a finding. The scope of review, of course, marks the bounds of a reviewing court\u2019s authority to set aside factual findings, and review is customarily limited to ascertaining whether there is enough evidence of the legally correct sort to save the findings from irrationality.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">The scope of our review in this case is governed by section 25 of the Securities Exchange Act which provides that \u201c[t]he findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, as the Commission correctly notes, petitioner may not try his case <em>de novo </em>before this court and we may not substitute our view of the facts for the Commission\u2019s. We review the Commission\u2019s findings only to ascertain whether, in the cant of appellate court opinions, there is evidence which a reasonable person might find clear and convincing.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> If so, and if the Commission\u2019s action is otherwise in accord with the law, we must affirm. After carefully reviewing the record in this case, we have concluded that it will not support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>finding that petitioner willfully violated the Securities Exchange Act.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">C. <em>The Commission\u2019s Account.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">As reconstructed by the Commission, Whitney intentionally deceived CG and the Town in the course of his efforts to liquidate the fund via TM. The Commission\u2019s view of what occurred is, briefly, as follows: As of 3 April Whitney knew that while CG had no intention to compensate him further, it was agreeable to having the Town conduct the liquidation which, if accomplished through TM, would permit Whitney a commission. However, before Whitney could persuade the Town to liquidate in that fashion, he was called upon to deliver the securities to CG for liquidation in accordance with the escrow agreement. Without authority, Whitney delivered the securities instead to TM in order to \u201cdelay their liquidation\u201d while he attempted to win over the Board.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Then Whitney \u201cmisled CG into believing that it would be relieved of its responsibility for the liquidation,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> presumably so it would be unconcerned with performance of the escrow agreement. And finally, in order to obtain the Town\u2019s authorization to liquidate, Whitney led the pension board to believe, falsely, that CG had chosen TM to conduct the liquidation.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">Thus, while Whitney\u2019s alleged fraud was found to \u201ccomprehend his entire course of conduct,\u201d there were, in the Commission\u2019s view, three somewhat distinct deceptions. First, Whitney accepted the securities from the Town on 16 May without disclosing his intention to divert them to TM for liquidation. Second, both before and after diverting the securities, Wt\u00editney led CG to believe the Town would liquidate the fund directly. And third, Whitney misled the Town itself about what was going on.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">There is, concerning the diversion of the securities to TM, appreciable evidence that Whitney knew on 16 May that in the event CG conducted the liquidation, TM would not participate. Although testimony on the point was contradictory, the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>was plainly entitled to resolve the matter of credibility as it did. Moreover, we are least inclined to second <em>guess </em>such findings where, as here, the Commission affirmed the ALJ who, of course, heard the testimony in question.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Still, the fact at most suggests that Whitney\u2019s conduct on the 16th may have been <em>ultra vires. </em>Without some accompanying deception, whatever violation of state law, if any, may have resulted, there was no violation of rule 10b-5.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> And the record is quite clear that CG was not deceived, at least concerning the initial delivery of the securities to TM. By all accounts, CG knew three days later that TM had the securities and apparently was so informed in a telephone call from Whitney.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The Commission reasons that CG did not object to the delivery of securities to TM because it believed that the Town would conduct the liquidation, presumably through TM. The only evidence that Whitney mislead CG in this regard is English\u2019s somewhat vague recollection that in April, prior to delivery, Whitney had said something to the effect that he and the Town were \u201cmoving in that direction\u201d or \u201cmoving along nicely,\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> from which English inferred that Whitney had been retained by the Town. English also testified to conversations, occurring in May or June, in which Whitney indicated that liquidation through TM was being delayed by \u201cpaper work.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Setting aside whether anything said by Whitney could, in other circumstances, have been misleading, it is clear from the record that CG was not misled. English later testified that CG\u2019s 29 May letter to the Town, in which CG recommended outside liquidation, was sent at Whitney\u2019s request because it was needed \u201cto solidify the arrangement he was working on with the Town.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Moreover, by all accounts, for the Town to proceed without CG it would have been necessary to rescind the escrow agreement. This, of course, as was recalled in CG\u2019s 29 May letter, had not been done. In light of these undisputed facts, it would appear wholly unsupportable to conclude that CG in fact believed that the Town had agreed to conduct the liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">Since the Commission erroneously concluded that CG was misled, it is somewhat uncertain whether it viewed Whitney\u2019s conduct as misleading simply on its face, and thus violative of rule 10b \u2014 \u00f3.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Assuming that it did, we regard the evidence as insufficient to sustain the finding. However sanguine Whitney may have appeared to CG, by the Commission\u2019s own account he conveyed to them that the arrangement was unsettled as late as 29 May. Degrees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>of candor beyond this, at least in these circumstances, are beyond the purview of rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Finally, according to the Commission, Whitney led the Town to believe, falsely, that CG had chosen TM to conduct the liquidation. As the Commission recited its view of the facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">At the same time, Mr. Whitney created the impression with the Town that the liquidation was proceeding under CG\u2019s direction. Thus, he asked TM to prepare a plan of liquidation of the Town\u2019s securities portfolio [J.A. 354-55]; following preparation of the plan he drafted a proposed letter of instructions from the Town to TM authorizing the liquidation [J.A. 85-87, 355]; and then he urged Mr. Caraglior to sign and deliver these instructions to TM approving TM\u2019s liquidation plan [J.A. 85-87, 120-21], When Mr. Caraglior raised questions as to whether he should sign the letter, Mr. Whitney falsely stated that the plan had been approved by CG [J.A. 121, 125-26].<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">, In our view the record does not nearly support the inference that Whitney deliberately misled the Town. According to the Commission, after Whitney delivered the securities to TM he \u201ccontinued his efforts to induce the Town to use his services\u201d for the liquidation.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> That is why, according to the ALJ, Whitney requested the letter of 29 May in which CG recommended to the Town that it handle the liquidation directly. Whitney thus procured a letter which on its face disclosed to the Town (1) that CG was not in possession or control of the securities and (2) that CG preferred that the securities be liquidated without its involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">When the Town asked Whitney about CG\u2019s letter of 29 May, Whitney did seek advice from TM concerning the advisable sequence of liquidation, as was only natural if he expected to arrange the liquidation. Thereafter, in a letter to the pension board referring to CG's letter of 29 May, Whitney proposed draft instructions to be sent to TM authorizing liquidation, again as would occur in the course of the \u201coutside\u201d liquidation. At this point, according to the Commission, Whitney falsely stated that the sequence had been approved by CG. Whitney did in fact say something of the sort,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> but apparently he was more or less correct. It is evident from the record that CG had no objection to the proposed sequence.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The difficulty arose because CG would not commit to writing anything likely to make it accountable for the choice. The accountability which existed under the escrow agreement was apparently what most mattered to the Town, and we suspect that had CG formally approved the proposed sequence the Town would have been otherwise indifferent to \u201coutside\u201d liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">It is fairly obvious that the Town was unaware that the terms of its bargain with CG were shifting in the manner they were. We have no occasion, however, to speculate whether more diligence or prudence in various quarters would have eliminated the misunderstanding. We merely hold that the Town\u2019s ignorance may not be laid to any deliberate deceit by Whitney. The evidence on this point is so contradictory and ambiguous that we think no reasonable person would find it clear and convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">The Commission cast petitioner as an ingenious schemer, deliberately spreading misimpressions and confusion throughout this affair, and so, in violation of the securities laws. The record simply does not yield substantial evidence to support a finding, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that petitioner willfully violated the antifraud provisions. Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s order, depending as it does on such a finding, is</p>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-11\">. <em>In the matter of Stanton L.

The Chief Justice, speaking for a unanimous Supreme Court in <em>Addington, </em>approvingly noted the usage of the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard in fraud cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-15\">The intermediate standard, which usually employs some combination of the words \u201cclear,\u201d \u201ccogent,\u201d \u201cunequivocal\u201d and \u201cconvincing,\u201d is less commonly used, but nonetheless \u201cis no stranger to the civil law.\u201d <em>Woodby v. INS, </em>385 U.S. 276, 285 [, 87 S.Ct. 483, 17 L.Ed.2d 362] (1967). See also McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 320 (1954); 9 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2498 (3d ed. 1940). One typical use of the standard is in civil cases involving allegations of fraud or some other quasi-criminal wrongdoing by the defendant. The interests at stake in those cases are deemed to be more substantial than mere loss of money and some jurisdictions accordingly reduced the risk to the defendant of having his reputation tarnished erroneously by increasing the plaintiffs burden of proof. Similarly, this Court has used the \u201cclear, unequivocal and convincing\u201d standard of proof to protect particularly important individual interests in various civil cases. See, e. <em>g., Woodby </em>v. <em>INS, supra, </em>at 285 [, 87 S.Ct. 483] (deportation); <em>Chaunt v.

As we observed in <em>Collins, </em>183 U.S.App.D.C. at 305, 562 F.2d at 824, a requirement that the evidence be not only \u201cclear and convincing,\u201d but also \u201cunequivocal,\u201d would in the majority of fraud cases make proof all but impossible. We remain satisfied that \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence is the appropriate standard in such cases as this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b772-22\">. <em>See </em>Brief of SEC at 18-20 &amp; n.10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b772-23\">. <em>Collins </em>was decided by a unanimous panel.

In <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976), the Supreme Court held that a private cause of action for damages will not lie under \u00a7 10(b) and rule 10b-5 in the absence of an allegation of \u201cscienter,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud on the defendant\u2019s part. <em>Id. </em>at 193, 96 S.Ct. 1375. The Court expressly pretermitted the question whether scienter was an essential element of injunctive actions under the Act; the Commission is of the view that it is not, at least in actions brought, like this one, under \u00a7 15(b). We have no occasion to decide the relevance of <em>Hochfelder </em>to this case. Section 15(b) by its terms requires that a person have \u201cwillfully\u201d violated the securities laws, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 780(b)(6) (1976), and we think \u201cwill-fullness\u201d in this sense is more or less congruent with <em>Hochfeldef </em>s use of \u201cscienter.\u201d <em>See Arthur Upper Corp. v.
