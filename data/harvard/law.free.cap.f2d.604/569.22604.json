We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Defendant-appellant Alton Moss, also known as John L. Freeman (Freeman), travels throughout the United States giving a speech in which he challenges the constitutionality of the federal income tax laws and describes how to avoid the federal withholding tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Defendants Vanosdall, Gronewold, Lilien-thal, Spencer, and Sanne (principal defendants) are employees of Van\u2019s Electric Company (Van\u2019s).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">In late February 1978, Gronewold, Sanne, and Vanosdall heard Freeman in a radio interview. On March 8, Gronewold attended and recorded a speech given by Freeman at a local hotel. In mid-March, Gronewold played his recording for the principal defendants. On April 8, Freeman came to Van\u2019s and spoke to all the principal defendants except Spencer, and advised them that, were they to run afoul of the law, he would defend them for a stated fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-16\">Motivated by Freeman\u2019s speech, the principal defendants filed falsified W-4 forms. All were charged by information with violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7205 (\u00a7 7205),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and pleaded guilty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each information also charged Freeman in a second count with violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-17\">During his arraignment, Freeman, acting <em>pro se, </em>asked that his case be submitted to a grand jury. When his request was denied, Freeman filed a corresponding motion, which was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-18\">Immediately prior to trial, Freeman moved for, <em>inter alia, </em>reduction of the charges to a single charge and dismissal on grounds of illegal selective prosecution. Those motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-19\">The jury found Freeman guilty on all five counts. The court sentenced him on each count to the custody of the Attorney General for a period of one year, the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-20\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-21\">The issues are whether: (1) Freeman\u2019s actions are protected by the first amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>ment, (2) an indictment is required to charge aiding and abetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and (3) Freeman was illegally selectively prosecuted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">1. Freeman\u2019s actions are not protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Freeman alleges that his speeches \u201c[challenge] the constitutionality of the income tax laws as . enforced in this country . . .that he \u201cespouses a political cause aimed at changing the tax law in the United States . . and that his actions were \u201cabsolutely protected\u201d by the first amendment, any conviction founded on the present record being \u201coutside, the . perview of . the laws of this country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Freeman\u2019s objection was answered by this court in <em>United States v. Buttorff, </em>572 F.2d 619 (8th Cir. 1978), on facts similar to those here, 572 F.2d at 623 \u2014 24:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aey-dedup-0\">[T]he Supreme Court has distinguished between speech which merely advocates law violation and speech which incites imminent lawless activity. <em>See Brandenburg v. Ohio, </em>395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969). The former is protected; the latter is not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-21\">Although the speeches here do not incite the type of imminent lawless activity referred to in criminal syndicalism cases, the defendants did go beyond mere advocacy of tax reform. They explained how to avoid withholding and their speeches and explanations incited several individuals to activity that violated federal law and had the potential of substantially hindering the administration of the revenue. This speech is not entitled to first amendment protection and, as discussed above, was sufficient action to constitute aiding and abetting the filing of false or fraudulent withholding forms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-22\">Freeman also alleges that his conviction must be overturned because \u00a7 7205, on which it is based, is unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Gooding v. Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 92 5. Ct. 1103, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972), on which Freeman bases his argument, requires that the proscribed actions be constitutionally protected.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Because we find Freeman\u2019s actions not so protected, that argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">2. An indictment was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Freeman was charged by information. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(a).3 ***<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because violation of \u00a7 7205 is punishable by \u201ca\u201d prison sentence, and because under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 Freeman may be punished as a principal, he alleges that his crime was infamous. Hence, says Freeman, the government\u2019s failure to obtain a grand jury indictment was a violation of the fifth amendment\u2019s requirement therefor in relation to \u201ccapital or otherwise infamous\u201d crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">An infamous crime is one punishable by death, or by imprisonment in a penitentiary or at hard labor. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>258 U.S. 433, 436-37, 42 S.Ct. 368, 66 L.Ed. 700 (1922); <em>Ex parte Wilson, </em>114 U.S. 417, 426-29, 5 S.Ct. 935, 29 L.Ed. 89 (1885). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4083: \u201cPersons convicted of offenses against the United States . . . punishable by imprisonment for more than one year may be confined in any United States penitentiary. A sentence for an offense punishable by imprisonment for one year or less shall not be served in .a penitentiary without the consent of the defendant.\u201d If punished as a principal under \u00a7 7205, Freeman could not be imprisoned for more than one year. Because he could not therefore be required to serve his sentence in a penitentiary without his consent his crime cannot be deemed infamous<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and an indictment was not required.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">3. Freeman was not illegally selectively prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Freeman alleges that the govermhent\u2019s only purpose in prosecuting the principal defendants was to enable the government to prosecute and \u201cconvict him for exercising his First Amendment rights,\u201d in violation of his rights to due process and equal protection set forth in the fifth and fourteenth amendments. He cites as evidence the guilty pleas of the principal defendants, their light sentences, their promises in writing to testify at Freeman\u2019s trial, and the acquittal of Boruch.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">In <em>Olyer </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>368 U.S. 448, 456, 82 S.Ct. 501, 506, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-17\">Moreover, the conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement is not in itself a federal constitutional violation. Even though the statistics in this case might imply a policy of selective enforcement, it was not stated that the selection was deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Therefore grounds supporting a finding of a denial of equal protection were not alleged. <em>Oregon v. Hicks, supra </em>[213 Or. 619, 325 P.2d 794]; <em>cf. Snowden v. Hughes, </em>321 U.S. 1 [, 64 S.Ct. 397, 88 L.Ed. 497] (1944); <em>Yick Wo v. Hopkins, </em>118 U.S. 356 [, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220] (1886) (by implication).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-18\">This court stated the test in <em>United States v. Catlett, </em>584 F.2d 864, 866 (8th Cir. 1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ary-dedup-0\">To establish the essential elements of a <em>prima facie </em>case of selective discrimination, a defendant must first demonstrate that he has been singled out for prosecution while others similarly situated have not been prosecuted for conduct similar to that for which he was prosecuted. Second, the defendant must demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>that the government\u2019s discriminatory selection of him for prosecution was based upon an impermissible ground, such as race, religion or his exercise of his first amendment right to free speech. <em>United States v. Berrios, </em>501 F.2d 1207, 1211 (2d Cir. 1974). We approved of this two-pronged test of \u201cintentional and purposeful discrimination\u201d in <em>United States v. Swanson, </em>509 F.2d 1205, 1208-09 (8th Cir. 1975). <em>See also United States v. Ojala, supra, </em>544 F.2d [940] at 943.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><em>Catlett </em>involved a Quaker long active in protesting certain government policies by refusing to file federal income tax returns. Upon being prosecuted for willfully and knowingly failing to file income tax returns, Catlett produced evidence that the Internal Revenue Service had adopted a selective approach to its investigations of tax noncomplianee, centering on \u201cindividuals who have achieved notoriety as tax protestors.\u201d 584 F.2d at 865-67. This court concluded, 584 F.2d at 867, that, even assuming the government\u2019s selective policy had been applied to Catlett, he had:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">[F]ailed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination. While the decision to prosecute an individual cannot be made in retaliation for his exercise of his first amendment right to protest government war and tax policies, the prosecution of those protestors who publicly and with attendant publicity assert an alleged personal privilege not to pay taxes as part of their protest is not selection on an impermissible basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Here, Freeman has not shown that he was (1) singled out for prosecution, or (2) selected for prosecution upon the impermissible ground of an exercise of his first amendment rights. \u201cThe prosecution of those [who] publicly and with attendant publicity [encourage people to file fraudulent withholding forms in violation of the law] as part of their protest is not selection on an impermissible basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Finding no error, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-11\">. \u00a7 7205. Fraudulent withholding exemption certificate or failure to supply information.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-12\">Any individual required to supply information to his employer under section 3402 who willfully supplies false or fraudulent information, or who willfully fails to supply information thereunder which would require an increase in the tax to be withheld under section 3402, shall, in lieu of any other penalty provided by law (except the penalty provided by section 6682), upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $500, or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-13\">. A sixth defendant, Boruch, also pleaded guilty, but later withdrew his plea and was acquitted. He did not take part in Freeman\u2019s trial, and the case against Freeman based on Count II of the information charging Boruch was dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b662-14\">. \u00a7 2. Principals</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-22\">(a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-23\">Aiding the filing of fraudulent withholding forms is also a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(2): \u00a7 7206. Fraud and false statements Any person who\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-25\">(2) Aid or assistance\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-26\">Willfully aids or assists in, or procures, counsels, or advises the preparation or presentation under or in connection with any matter arising under, the internal revenue laws, of a return, affidavit, claim, or other document, which is fraudulent or is false as to any material matter, whether or not such falsity or fraud is with the knowledge or consent of the person authorized or required to present such return, affidavit, claim, or document . . . shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not more than 3 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b663-12\">. We decline comment on multiplicity of charges, a matter mentioned in the government\u2019s brief but neither raised nor argued by Freeman on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b663-13\">. Freeman alleges: (1) that \u201ccriminal culpability based upon \u00a7 7205 must rest on . the definition of \u2018liability\u2019 as used on the W-4 forms . . and that \u201cthe absence of a definition of \u2018liability\u2019 in the Internal Revenue Code invalidates the statute;\u201d and (2) that the tax laws are vague because the same figures can be made to yield different results for tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-17\">Both allegations are without merit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-18\">\u201cThe constitutional requirement of definiteness is violated by a criminal statute that fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute. The underlying principle is that no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.\u201d <em>United States v. Harriss, </em>347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S.Ct. 808, 812, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954) (footnotes omitted). There is no doubt that the code sections named in the indictment proscribe the filing of a false or fraudulent withholding form and that defendants were capable of understanding this meaning of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-19\"><em>United States v. Buttorff, </em>572 F.2d at 625.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b663-24\">. Freeman quotes from <em>Gooding, </em>405 U.S. at 520-21, 92 S.Ct. at 1105. In pertinent part that quote reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-25\">At least when statutes regulate or proscribe speech and when \u201cno readily apparent construction suggests itself as a vehicle for rehabilitating the statutes in a single prosecution,\u201d <em>Dombrowski v.

Bullitt, </em>377 U.S. 360, 366 [, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 1319, 12 L.Ed.2d 377] (1964); <em>Coates v.
