CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ano\">Donald M. Gomes, a volleyball enthusiast who had played on an all-male volleyball team at his high school in Pennsylvania, was excluded from interscholastic competition when he transferred to Rogers High School in Newport, Rhode Island, for his senior year. Rogers\u2019 only volleyball team was all-female and played in competition under the auspices of the defendant, the Rhode Island Interscholastic League. The League provides interscholastic volleyball competition only for all-female teams and disqualifies teams on which any male plays. As a result, Rogers High allowed Gomes to join its all-female team but did not use him in League competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-17\">Gomes brought this suit against the League at the beginning of its 1979 volleyball season, alleging that its rule against male participation in volleyball competition violated the fourteenth amendment and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681-1686, which generally prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal funds, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(a). Without reaching the constitutional issues, the district court ruled in Gomes\u2019 favor on the basis of the following regulation promulgated by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare under Title IX:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-18\">\u201c(a) <em>General. </em>No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in . any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-20\">(b) <em>Separate Teams. </em>Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection ... is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. <em>However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for </em>members <em>of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number><em>one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try-out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. . . </em>. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">45 C.F.R. \u00a7 86.41(a), (b) (emphasis added). In the district court\u2019s view, the clause (b) exception for separate-sex teams was made inapplicable by the passage italicized, since defendants sponsored no men\u2019s volleyball teams and opportunities for boys to play volleyball previously had been non-existent. In so interpreting the regulation, the court rejected defendants\u2019 argument that the reference in clause (b) to previously limited athletic opportunities refers to overall athletic opportunities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under defendants\u2019 interpretation, Rogers did not have to allow Gomes to play in all-female volleyball competition because men had always been offered a very comprehensive athletic program \u2014 albeit not one including volleyball. Indeed, Rogers\u2019 own program in particular was said to have been outstanding for men, far exceeding the offerings for women even though women\u2019s opportunities were now improving.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The district court rendered its decision on May 1, in the midst of the volleyball season, and ordered the League to accommodate Gomes as a member of the Rogers team. As defendants persuaded us that the district court\u2019s order would disrupt the remainder of the sports season<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that there existed a probability of success on the merits, we stayed implementation of that order pending appellate review. We also allowed the motions of the United States and the National Federation of State High School Athletic Associations to participate on appeal as amici curiae,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and set the case on an expedited schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">Despite the speed with which this case reached us,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the last interscholastic game of the League\u2019s volleyball season had been played and Gomes was about to graduate from Rogers High School when we heard argument on June 8. Defendants, apparently confident of obtaining a favorable decision on the merits, urged that the case nevertheless was not moot because it involved events \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review,\u201d <em>Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, </em>219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 283, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911). Plaintiff, by contrast, asked that we dismiss the appeal as moot under <em>DeFunis v. Odegaard, </em>416 U.S. 312, 94 S.Ct. 1704, 40 L.Ed.2d 164 (1974). As we conclude that the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>usual definition of a \u201clive\u201d case or controversy necessary for federal adjudication, U.S.Const. art. Ill, sec. 2, does not apply, we agree with plaintiff .that this appeal must be dismissed as moot. We do not, therefore, reach the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">There remains no live controversy between Gomes and defendants: the volleyball season is over and Gomes, having graduated, will never again attempt to play in interscholastic high school competition. These circumstances are similar to those in <em>DeFunis </em>v. <em>Odegaard, supra, </em>416 U.S. 312, 94 S.Ct. 1704, 40 L.Ed.2d 164 (1974), which presented a challenge to allegedly discriminatory admissions policies of the University of Washington Law School. DeFunis had attended the school under a Supreme Court order effective pending appeal and was assured of graduating when the Court heard argument on the case. The Court dismissed the case as moot, noting that federal court jurisdiction \u201c \u2018depends upon the existence of a case or controversy\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018federal courts are without power to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them,\u2019 \u201d 416 U.S. at 316, 94 S.Ct. at 1705-1706, quoting <em>Liner v. Jafco, Inc., </em>375 U.S. 301, 306 n. 3, 84 S.Ct. 391, 11 L.Ed.2d 347 (1964), and <em>North Carolina v. Rice, </em>404 U.S. 244, 246, 92 S.Ct. 402, 30 L.Ed.2d 413 (1971), respectively. In this case, too, since Gomes has not sought any monetary relief, nothing that we might decide now as to the merits would affect his rights vis a vis defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The definition of \u201cmootness\u201d is not inflexible, of course; federal courts may decide cases that present questions \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review,\u201d even though the immediate controversy between the parties may have dissipated. <em>Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, supra, </em>219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 283, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911); <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 125, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973). Defendants here point out that the Interscholastic League divides the school year into three sport seasons \u2014 fall, winter, and spring \u2014 and that each lasts something less than three months. As this case, which began with the beginning of the spring season, reached us with exceptional speed and yet still not before the end of the season, they argue that the question of the validity of their rules as to single-sex teams may recur each year and yet always evade review if we consider this case moot. But our focus must be on whether the question will recur not as to other high school students but as to Gomes, a high school senior, who sued only on behalf of himself and not as a class representative. <em>See Sosna v. Iowa, </em>419 U.S. 393, 398-400, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975). Just as the <em>DeFunis </em>case did not present a question capable of repetition as to DeFunis, who also sued individually, because he never again would go through the Law School\u2019s admission process, 416 U.S. at 218-19, 94 S.Ct. 1704, so this case does not present such a question as to Gomes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See County of Los Angeles v. Davis, </em>440 U.S. 625, 99 S.Ct. 1379, 59 L.Ed.2d 642 (1979); <em>Weinstein v. Bradford, </em>423 U.S. 147, 96 S.Ct. 347, 46 L.Ed.2d 350 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">The district court\u2019s judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s complaint. <em>See Great Western Sugar Co. v. Nelson,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 99 S.Ct. 2149, 60 L.Ed.2d 735 (1979) (per curiam); <em>Duke Power Co. v. Greenwood County, </em>299 U.S. 259, 267, 57 S.Ct. 202, 81 L.Ed. 178 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-7\">. Under the district court\u2019s interpretation, the requirement that males be allowed to play on an all-female team would not apply if an all-male team were established. Defendants\u2019 represent, however, that there is insufficient interest in volleyball among their male high school students to permit the successful formation of all-male teams.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b827-8\">. There are different rules for women\u2019s and men\u2019s volleyball; most notably, the net is set higher for men than for women. Thus the prospect of mixed-sex competition raised a question as to the rules applicable to the remainder of the season. In addition, a number of the League\u2019s member teams represented private women\u2019s high schools and were unwilling to compete against mixed-sex teams.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b827-9\">. The Department of Justice, speaking on behalf of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which promulgated the Title IX regulation in issue, indicated that HEW interpreted the Title IX regulation in the manner urged by defendants, and disagreed with the district court\u2019s construction. In its view, the focus of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 86.41 was not on whether men had had opportunities to play volleyball in the past, but rather on whether their overall athletic opportunities had been limited. The intervenor National Federation of State High School Athletic Associations took a similar position. Plaintiff, in oral argument, in urging us to uphold the lower court, stressed arguments other than the district court\u2019s rationale based on the regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b827-14\">. The Interscholastic League\u2019s 1979 volleyball season was scheduled from March 27 until approximately May 24. Gomes filed his complaint around March 28 and filed an amended complaint on April 2. The district court held a hearing on Gomes\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction on April 4, issued its opinion on May 1, and entered its order on May 3. We stayed implementation of that order pending appeal and set argument on the merits for the earliest date practicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\">. Had this case been brought as a class action by a freshman, sophomore or junior, it would present a question \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d as to the class or the individual plaintiff. See <em>Sosna v. Iowa, </em>419 U.S. 393, 398-400, 95 S.Ct. 553, 557, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975). Thus we need not be concerned that the validity of the Interscholastic League\u2019s rule may never be subject to full adjudication on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
