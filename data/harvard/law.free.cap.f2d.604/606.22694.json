The Hotel-Motel-Restaurant Employees &amp; Bartenders Union, Local 86, has intervened in favor of enforcement. The Board\u2019s Decision and Order, reported at 231 N.L.R.B. No. 5 (1977), found employer violations of sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(1) and 158(a)(5). We have concluded that the Board\u2019s Order should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">The main issues raised by this appeal have recently been squarely addressed and resolved. <em>See N.L.R.B. v. Tahoe Nugget, Inc., </em>584 F.2d 293 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 99 S.Ct. 2847, 61 L.Ed.2d 290 (1979); <em>Sahara-Tahoe Corp. v. N.L.R.B., </em>581 F.2d 767 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 99 S.Ct. 2837, 61 L.Ed.2d 284 (1979). <em>See also N.L.R.B. </em>v. <em>Carda Hotels, Inc., </em>604 F.2d 605 (9th Cir. 1979). The present Petition and the cited cases all arose from the same general factual setting. Our court plainly held that the Union enjoyed a presumption of majority support arising from voluntary recognition of the Union and that the presumption survived the employers\u2019 withdrawal from a multi-employer bargaining unit in 1974. <em>Tahoe Nugget, supra, </em>584 F.2d at 302-04; <em>Sahara-Tahoe, supra, </em>581 F.2d at 771. Additionally, our decisions rejected the employers\u2019 claims that they had established a good faith reasonable doubt that the Union lacked majority status at the time the companies refused to bargain. <em>Tahoe Nugget, supra, </em>584 F.2d at 305-08; <em>Sahara-Tahoe, supra, </em>581 F.2d at 771-72. Thus, we also here reject the respondent\u2019s arguments that track those previously advanced by the employers in <em>Tahoe Nugget </em>and <em>Sahara-Tahoe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-16\">We have considered the other issues raised herein, but conclude that they have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-17\">The Board\u2019s Order will be</p>\n<p id=\"b699-18\">ENFORCED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
