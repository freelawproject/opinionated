He maintains the court: (1) failed to begin the sentencing analysis at the bottom of the advisory Guidelines sentencing range; and (2) erroneously considered three prior minor convictions that received no criminal history points, and an assault conviction that resulted in a 16-level offense-level increase. Rivera asserts that balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors properly would have resulted in a sentence at the low end of the sentencing range because his offense was only trespassory, he did not resist arrest, and he received shorter sentences for prior offenses. Similarly, he claims his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of correctness because the illegal reentry Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not based on empirical data and national experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Although post <em>-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Rivera\u2019s failure to object at sentencing to the reasonableness of his sentence triggers plain error review. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). (He objects to that limited standard of review only to preserve the issue for possible further review.) Among the factors necessary for plain error, he must show a clear or obvious error. He fails to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">Rivera\u2019s empirical-data contention is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>E.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). He raises the issue only to preserve it for possible future review. Also rejected is the assertion that a sentence under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 is unreasonable because illegal reentry is a mere trespass offense. <em>E.g., United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">Because Rivera\u2019s sentence is within the applicable advisory sentencing range, it is presumed reasonable. <em>E.g., United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008). His disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the weight accorded to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut that presumption. <em>E.g., United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). He challenges the presumption only to preserve the issue for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b781-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
