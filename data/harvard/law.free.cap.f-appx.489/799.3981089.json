Gomez-Herrera, </em>528 F.3d 554, 562-63 (5th Cir.2008), which rejected the argument that fast track programs create unwarranted disparities between defendants in districts that have the programs and defendants in districts that do not have such programs. He also raises arguments that he concedes are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 377-78 (5th Cir.2008), which held that the Government may decline to move for an additional one-level reduction under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3El.l(b) based on the defendant\u2019s refusal to waive his right to appeal. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b825-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
