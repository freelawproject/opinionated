The court sentenced him pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 as a career offender, since he had at least two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, rather than U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, the guideline applicable to crack cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">On February 21, 2012, Grimes moved the District Court to modify his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing that he should receive a sentence reduction in light of Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 to reduce the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. The court denied his motion on the ground that Amendment 750 did not lower Grimes\u2019s Guidelines sentence range because he had been sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.1, not \u00a7 2D1.1, the only guideline the Amendment altered. Grimes now appeals the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>we held that defendants sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 were not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reductions because calculation of their Guidelines sentence ranges did not involve the base offense levels prescribed by \u00a7 2D1.1. 541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008). We noted that a reduction was not permitted where a retroactive amendment lowered only the defendants\u2019 base offense level rather than the applicable sentence range. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">In <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether a defendant who pled guilty pursuant to a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) agreement containing a specific sentencing range was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. 564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2690, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) (plurality opinion). The Court concluded that when the District Court decided to accept a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea based on the sentencing guidelines, the defendant was eligible to request a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if a retroactive amendment later lowered the applicable sentencing range. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2695; <em>see Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 993, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977) (quotation omitted) (holding that, when a Supreme Court decision lacks a majority opinion, \u201cthe holding of the Court may be viewed as the position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds\u201d). <em>Freeman, </em>however, did not involve a defendant sentenced as a career offender. <em>See Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2691-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-20\">In <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.2012), we held that <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent in this Circuit because it was not overruled by <em>Freeman, </em>as that case did not address defendants whose total offense level was calculated according to the career offender provision, so <em>Freeman </em>was not \u201cclearly on point\u201d with <em>Moore. See id. </em>at 6-7 (citing <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2690-2700). Given our <em>Lawson </em>holding, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>obliged to affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
