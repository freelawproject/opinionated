(\u201cGlobeCast\u201d), his former employer, in his age discrimination suit filed under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-16\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"AKH1\">A. Ostrow\u2019s Employment at GlobeCast</p>\n<p id=\"b460-17\"><em>Beginning </em>in 2003, Ostrow worked for GlobeCast as Vice President of Business and Legal Affairs and General Counsel. Ostrow handled litigation, supervised outside counsel, offered legal advice and risk management, prepared corporate documents and sometimes performed other transactional work, such as negotiating and drafting contracts. Ostrow also supervised one other in-house attorney, who primarily prepared customer contracts. By December 2008, however, that in-house attorney position was vacant.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>On June 8, 2009, GlobeCast hired 37-year-old Carlo Carroccia to be the new in-house attorney without consulting Ostrow. Carroccia had experience as a contracts attorney with telecommunications companies, and his duties at GlobeCast were to include preparing contracts and assisting the sales department in New York. Car-roccia\u2019s offer letter indicated, however, that there was a possibility of promotion to the general counsel position depending on his performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In November 2009, GlobeCast\u2019s new CEO, David Justin, informed Ostrow, then 60 years old, that his employment contract would not be renewed when it expired on December 31, 2009. In January 2010, Carroccia was promoted into Ostrow\u2019s former job.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">B. Magistrate Judge\u2019s Summary Judgment Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">For purposes of summary judgment, GlobeCast conceded that Ostrow established a prima facie case of age discrimination. Applying the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the magistrate judge found that GlobeCast had put forth two legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for CEO Justin\u2019s decision not renew Ostrow\u2019s employment contract: (1) Justin wanted to restructure the legal department to save costs due to GlobeCast\u2019s poor financial condition; and (2) Justin believed that Os-trow\u2019s performance had been deficient. The magistrate judge concluded that Os-trow presented evidence of pretext as to Ostrow\u2019s performance, but not as to Globe-Cast\u2019s decision to restructure the legal department for financial reasons. <em>See Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1037 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc) (explaining that the plaintiff must present evidence that each of the employer\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons is pretextual to avoid summary judgment). Thus, the district court granted GlobeCast\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to the ADEA claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ayo\">A. ADEA Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">\u201cThe ADEA makes it \u2018unlawful for an employer ... to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual ... because of such individual\u2019s age.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1024 (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1)); <em>see also </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 631(a) (\u201cThe prohibitions in this chapter shall be limited to individuals who are at least 40 years of age.\u201d). Where, as here, the plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence of age discrimination, this Court has applied the burden-shifting framework articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1024 (applying framework to ADEA claim). Under this framework, if the plaintiff presents a prima facie case and the employer offers legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the adverse employment action, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the stated reasons were mere pretext for unlawful discrimination. <em>Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1264 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">The Supreme Court recently clarified that a plaintiff must prove that age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause for the adverse em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ployment action in order to prevail on a disparate treatment claim under the ADEA. <em>Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>557 U.S. 167, 177-78, 129 S.Ct. 2343, 2351, 174 L.Ed.2d 119 (2009); <em>see also Mora v. Jackson Mem\u2019l Found., Inc., </em>597 F.3d 1201, 1204 (11th Cir.2010) (stating that in <em>Gross </em>the Supreme Court \u201cruled out the idea of a \u2018mixed motive\u2019 ADEA claim\u201d). In <em>Gross, </em>the Supreme Court left open the question \u201cwhether the evidentiary framework of <em>[McDonnell </em>Douglas] ... is appropriate in the ADEA context.\u201d <em>Gross, </em>557 U.S. at 175 n. 2, 129 S.Ct. at 2349 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Accordingly, in light of <em>Gross, </em>we apply the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework to determine whether Ostrow presented sufficient evidence that age was the \u201cbutfor\u201d cause of GlobeCast\u2019s decision not to renew his employment contract. We do so because <em>Gross </em>did not explicitly overrule use of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework in ADEA cases involving circumstantial evidence and the but-for causation standard of <em>Gross </em>is consistent with the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, in which the burden of persuasion remains with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In addition, given that Ostrow\u2019s appeal challenges only the third step of the magistrate judge\u2019s <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis, we assume <em>arguendo </em>that Os-trow established a prima facie case of age discrimination and that GlobeCast proffered a legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason, and address only whether Ostrow presented evidence from which a jury reasonably could find that GlobeCast\u2019s reason was pretext for age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">A plaintiff may show pretext \u201ceither directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff must demonstrate \u201c\u2018such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alvarez, </em>610 F.3d at 1265 (quoting <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir.1997)). A reason cannot be \u201cpretext <em>for discrimination </em>unless it is shown <em>both </em>that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason.\u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Brooks, </em>446 F.3d at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The plaintiff cannot \u201crecast an employer\u2019s proffered nondiseriminatory reasons or substitute his business judgment for that of the employer,\u201d but instead must \u201cmeet that reason head on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030. Indeed, in deciding whether the plaintiff has shown pretext, we do not sit as a \u201csuper personnel department,\u201d and must take care not to second-guess the employer\u2019s business judgment. <em>See id. </em>For this reason, \u201c[t]he inquiry into pretext centers on the employer\u2019s beliefs, not the employee\u2019s beliefs, and ... not on reality as it exists outside of the decision maker\u2019s head.\u201d <em>Alvarez, </em>610 F.3d at 1266 (explaining that the question is not whether the employee actually had performance problems, but \u201cwhether her employers were dissatisfied with her for these or other non-discriminatory reasons, even if mistakenly or unfairly so, or instead merely used those complaints ... as cover for\u201d discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">B. Ostrow\u2019s ADEA Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Ostrow did not present evidence from which a jury could conclude that Globe-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Cast\u2019s reason for not renewing his contract \u2014 restructuring its legal department to save costs \u2014 was pretext for age discrimination. Ostrow did not dispute that GlobeCast was struggling financially. GlobeCast had not been profitable for years and operated only because of shareholder support. In recent years, Globe-Cast had reduced its workforce by half and consolidated offices to reduce costs. Yet, in 2008, GlobeCast\u2019s net income was negative $15 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">GlobeCast\u2019s parent company, GlobeCast Worldwide, tasked new CEO Justin with returning GlobeCast to profitability. Justin had previously worked at GlobeCast France and GlobeCast Europe and had most recently been the CEO of GlobeCast Asia. To fulfill his mission at GlobeCast America, Justin, among other things, redistributed responsibilities among Globe-Cast\u2019s employees and let ten employees go, including Ostrow. Justin explained that he believed GlobeCast\u2019s legal department was overstaffed because other GlobeCast corporations did not have two attorneys in their legal departments. GlobeCast also had more active litigation cases than Justin had seen at other Globe-Cast corporations. Meanwhile, Ostrow was GlobeCast\u2019s second-highest paid employee. Based on GlobeCast\u2019s poor results in litigation matters and a need to assist in business generation to improve the bottom line, Justin decided to shift the legal department\u2019s focus to transactional work by reducing staff to one in-house transactional attorney and hiring outside counsel to handle litigation. Justin stated that he \u201cexpected [GlobeCast] to realize significant positive results on the open litigation matters and realize cost savings as a result of this decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Ostrow argues that GlobeCast\u2019s financial reason did not make sense because Globe-Cast had been losing money since 2000 and yet had renewed his two-year contract twice before. Ostrow\u2019s argument ignores the undisputed facts that by June 2009 GlobeCast Worldwide wanted \u201cmajor changes,\u201d and tasked Justin as the new CEO with turning GlobeCast\u2019s fortunes around.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Ostrow also contends that restructuring the legal department in fact cost Globe-Cast money. This argument merely quarrels with the wisdom of Justin\u2019s restructuring decision. The inquiry is whether Justin believed in good faith (even mistakenly) that his restructuring plan would save money, not whether it in fact did so. <em>See Alvarez, </em>610 F.3d at 1266. Ostrow presented no evidence that casts doubt on Justin\u2019s stated good faith belief. By restructuring the legal department, Globe-Cast would go from paying Ostrow\u2019s $219,000 salary and Carroccia\u2019s $155,000 salary, to paying only Carroccia\u2019s new $178,500 salary, a savings of $195,500.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">Ostrow points to Justin\u2019s deposition testimony admitting that he did not know how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>much money was spent on outside counsel after Ostrow\u2019s departure and that the amount spent was not significant to the bottom line. These statements, which are taken out of context, do not show pretext. In context, Justin testified that Globe-Cast\u2019s most significant litigation cost was the Intelsat case, which had been handled by outside counsel even before Ostrow left, that the cost of outside counsel for the remaining, smaller cases, while not negligible, was not significant to the bottom line, but that the real cost of those smaller cases was the risk of being countersued. If anything, this testimony supports Justin\u2019s explanation that he wanted to shift the legal department\u2019s focus away from litigation and toward business generation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Ostrow also failed to show the kind of pattern of older employees being replaced by younger employees that can be circumstantial evidence of a decisionmaker\u2019s discriminatory intent. In <em>Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., </em>a supermarket chain\u2019s district manager terminated or demoted four of seven store managers within a one-year period. All four store managers were over 40 and were replaced by employees who were under 40. 196 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir.1999). This Court concluded that a \u201cpattern of firing or demoting so <em>many </em>older workers and replacing them with younger workers, <em>by the relevant decision-maker during the same time period, </em>constitutes probative circumstantial evidence of age discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Here, Ostrow has not shown that Justin engaged in such a pattern. Beginning in June 2009, Justin (who was himself 43) let go nine other GlobeCast employees (besides Ostrow), none of whom were replaced by new hires. Two of these nine employees, former Vice President of Human Resources, Cathleen Togut, and former Vice President of Engineering and Operations, David Szelag, were in their 50s. The duties of Togut were assumed by her supervisor, Anne Phillipe, Globe-Cast\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, who was in her 30s. The duties of Szelag were divided between two employees, Gus Pu, in his mid-50s, and Brad Smith, in his late 40s. Mary Salih, a third employee in her late 40s, was also let go, but there is no evidence as to who replaced her or assumed her duties. Thus, the record establishes that only two employees Justin let go during his restructuring \u2014 Togut and Os-trow \u2014 had their duties assumed by someone under 40. Moreover, the assumption of Togut and Szelag\u2019s duties by Globe-Cast\u2019s remaining employees was consistent with Justin\u2019s stated desire to reduce staff to cut costs. And, unlike in <em>Damon, </em>there was no evidence that Justin ever made any comments regarding age during this time frame. Cf. <em>id. </em>at 1358-59 (stating that the decisionmaker wanted \u201caggressive, <em>young </em>men\u201d to be promoted).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Ostrow points to other former Globe-Cast employees who left GlobeCast between 2006 and 2008, but these employees were terminated by GlobeCast Worldwide\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Christian Pinion, not by Justin during his restructuring. Given that Ostrow did not show evidence of one decisionmaker in one time period replacing many older workers with younger workers, we cannot say he showed the kind of a firing and hiring pattern found in <em>Damon </em>that is probative circumstantial evidence of age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Based on the above, Ostrow has not shown that GlobeCast\u2019s proffered financial reason for not renewing his contract was pretext for age discrimination and has not shown that his age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of the decision not to renew his contract. For these reasons, we affirm the magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>trate judge\u2019s order granting summary judgment to GlobeCast.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-9\">. The parties consented to proceeding before a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-10\">. We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>\"applying the same legal standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Chapman v.

In making this determination, we view the evidence, and all inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Maniccia v.

Although whether, in fact, Justin's restructuring plan saved GlobeCast money is not the relevant inquiry, the district court noted that the undisputed facts suggest that Justin\u2019s restructuring plan did, in fact, result in a net savings during Carroccia\u2019s first 18 months as General Counsel, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">Between January 1, 2010, and June 2011, GlobeCast expended approximately $100,000 to $125,000 on outside counsel for litigation-related services of the type that Ostrow had previously provided. Thus, the changes to the structure of Globe-Cast\u2019s legal department resulted in a net savings to GlobeCast from January 1, 2010, through June 2011 of, at the very least, $169,250 (1 \u00a16 times Ostrow's annual salary of $219,000 ($328,500), minus the total of $125,000 in outside litigation costs and 1 <em>'k </em>times the increase in Carroccia\u2019s salary beginning January 1, 2010 ($159,250), equals $169,250).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxQ\">(Citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
