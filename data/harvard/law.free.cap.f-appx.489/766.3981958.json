In this consolidated appeal, the appellants raise the same two challenges to their sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-25\">In their first challenge, they argue that the district court erred by imposing two special conditions of supervised release that were not mentioned during the oral pronouncements of their sentences. In the written judgments, the following special conditions were included: (1) \u201cupon completion of his term of imprisonment, the defendant is to be surrendered to a duly-authorized immigration official for deportation in accordance with the established procedures provided by the Immigration and Nationality Act\u201d; and (2) in relation to the approved drug treatment program, \u201c[t]he defendant shall abstain from the use of alcohol and/or all other intoxicants during and after completion of treatment.\u201d We review the imposition of a special condition for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-26\">As conceded by the Government, the deportation condition in the written judgment conflicts with the oral pronouncement of sentence and therefore must be removed from the written judgment. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number><em>United States v. Rodriguez-Barajas, </em>No. 11-10545, 2012 WL 8176219, at *1 (5th Cir. Aug. 6, 2012) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Cruz-Nagera, </em>454 Fed.Appx. 371, 372 (5th Cir.2011). However, the district court expressly orally ordered each defendant to participate in a drug/alcohol dependency program. Thus, pursuant to <em>Rodriguez-Barajas, </em>2012 WL 3176219, at *1, the abstinence conditions may remain because the appellants\u2019 history of alcohol and/or drug abuse substantiates the abstinence condition in each case and the written condition flows from the orally ordered condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">In their second argument, the appellants contend that the upward variances to the statutory maximum terms of imprisonment obviated the adjustments for acceptance of responsibility and accordingly circumvented the congressional intent underlying those adjustments. When reviewing an upward variance, the ultimate question is whether the extent of the variance was an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This court recently rejected the identical argument in <em>United States v. Castillo-Garcia, </em>469 Fed.Appx. 389, 391-93 (5th Cir.2012). Moreover, neither appellant has demonstrated that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Accordingly, we MODIFY the judgments of conviction to excise the provisions requiring each appellant \u201cto be surrendered to a duly-authorized immigration official for deportation\u201d and AFFIRM the judgments of conviction and sentence as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b792-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
