We do have jurisdiction to consider the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-29\">This principle guides us in part: \u201ca party seeking to raise a claim or issue on appeal must plainly and prominently so indicate. Otherwise, the issue \u2014 even if properly preserved at trial-will be considered abandoned.\u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-24\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>A review of the record and case history reveals that the district court could not have considered Blankenship\u2019s \u201cMotion to Set-Aside\u201d as a \u00a7 2255 motion because he did not have the required permission to file a second or successive motion. The district court\u2019s authority to consider the motion was limited by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8582, and none of the exceptions under \u00a7 3582 applied to Blankenship\u2019s motion. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying the motion. Moreover, Blankenship has abandoned the arguments raised in his \u201cMotion to Seb-Aside,\u201d as he has not argued them on appeal. His arguments on appeal are completely apart from the claims he argued in his motion before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\">Based on a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
