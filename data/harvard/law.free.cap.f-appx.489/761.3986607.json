On appeal, Rohden argues that the district court failed to consider evidence showing that the PSR mischarae-terized his prior state convictions as crimes of violence and mistakenly applied the career offender enhancement. We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-24\">Because Rohden\u2019s sentence was based on the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, any offense level reductions resulting from the recent amendments to \u00a7 2D1.1 would have no impact on his total offense level or the applicable guidelines range. Therefore, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in Rohden\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2009). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Rohden\u2019s argument that he has evidence showing that he should not have been deemed a career offender fails, as a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding may not be used to challenge the calculation of the original sentence. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-25\">Rohden has filed at least two other unsuccessful motions to reduce his sentence that purported to be based on amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines. Although the instant motion cites a different amendment, he again raises challenges to his original sentencing proceeding that are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Given Rohden\u2019s repeated efforts to raise the same challenge to his sentence, he is warned that frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings will invite the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b787-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
