The complaint alleged civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 and 1986, as well as Louisiana Civil Code article 2315. Finding no genuine issue of material fact, the district court granted LSUHSC\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Woods\u2019s suit with prejudice. There being no reason to alter the sound reasoning of the court below, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-19\">To begin, Appellant\u2019s woefully inadequate briefing fails to establish any genuine issue of material fact regarding his termination from LSUHSC: this court cannot rule merely on conclusory allegations. But even if we overlook this deficiency, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that no civil rights violation took place. Further, the record shows that the proffered \u201cnew evidence\u201d in this case was both available and apparent prior to the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling; Appellant\u2019s primary argument is thus precluded. <em>See, e.g., Gov\u2019t Fin. Servs. One Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Peyton Place, Inc., </em>62 F.3d 767 (5th Cir.1995). Not only was the new evidence not brought to the attention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>of the district court prior to appeal, <em>it\u2019s not new.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b786-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
