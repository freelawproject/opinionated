The district court sentenced him to 462 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was on the low end of the range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines, and included a statutory minimum sentence of 384 months\u2019 imprisonment. Mr. Gutierrez appeals both his convictions and his sentence, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict and that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2005), and \u201cwe consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, with all inferences and credibility choices drawn in the government\u2019s favor,\u201d <em>United States v. DuBose, </em>598 F.3d 726, 729 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe jury gets to make any credibility choices, and we will assume that they made them all in the way that supports the verdict. It is not enough for a defendant to put forth a reasonable hypothesis of innocence, because the issue is not whether a jury reasonably could have acquitted but whether it reasonably could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>473 F.3d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cA conviction must be upheld unless the jury could not have found the defendant guilty under any reasonable construction of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">With sparse argument, Mr. Gutierrez contends that we must reverse the jury\u2019s verdict because the evidence \u201cwas a morass of contradictions.\u201d Specifically, he argues that the evidence \u201cwas tainted by the inconsistent and incredible testimony [of] the alleged victims.\u201d Mr. Gutierrez does not tell us exactly what portions of the testimony trouble him, but our review of the record discloses several possibilities. For example, one victim testified that he had been driving toward his home when he encountered Mr. Gutierrez, but a police report written just after the carjacking suggested that the victim had been driving away from his home. And an officer testified that Mr. Gutierrez was wearing a black shirt when the officer found him near the wreckage of one of the carjacked vehicles, which had just crashed following a high-speed evasion attempt, but other evidence suggested the shirt was blue.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">This evidence might not be a model of consistency, but it is far from being incredible as a matter of law. <em>See Thompson, </em>422 F.3d at 1291 (noting that testimony must be unbelievable on its face \u2014 by including facts a witness could not possibly have observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature, for example \u2014 to be incredible as a matter of law). The jury considered any inconsistencies in the evidence and credited what it found most believable. We decline Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s invitation to revisit the jury\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>See United States v. Siegelman, </em>640 F.3d 1159, 1165 (11th Cir.2011) (\u201cIn our system, the jury decides what the facts are, by listening to the witnesses and making judgments about whom to believe. This they have done, and, though invited to do so, we shall not substitute our judgment for theirs.\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The evidence as a whole is sufficient to support Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s convictions. The government presented testimony from two victims who averred that Mr. Gutierrez took their cars at gunpoint, from an officer who apprehended Mr. Gutierrez after a high-speed chase (and a collision) involving one of the carjacked vehicles, from other officers who talked to the vie-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tims and collected crime-scene evidence, and from an analyst who matched spent shell casings found at the scene of one carjacking to a gun found in the \u201cdebris field\u201d of the wreckage after Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to evade police in one of the carjacked vehicles. That evidence, when combined with the parties\u2019 stipulation that the carjacked vehicles had moved in interstate commerce, is enough to support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Diaz, </em>248 F.3d 1065, 1096 (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Pounds, </em>230 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Mr. Gutierrez also contends that his 462-month sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. \u201cWe review sentencing decisions only for abuse of discretion, and we use a two-step process.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). We \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as ... failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors ... or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.... \u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We \u201cthen consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed,\u201d taking into account the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although we do not automatically presume that a sentence falling within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect it to be. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s sentence \u2014 which was the lowest within-guidelines option for his convictions \u2014 meets our expectation of reasonableness, as it is neither procedurally nor substantively flawed. First, we disagree with Mr. Gutierrez that the district court failed to explain the sentence adequately. After hearing from Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s counsel and the government, the district court- stated that it had \u201creviewed the presentence report\u201d and had considered the \u00a7 3553 factors and \u201cadvisory guidelines.\u201d The court then imposed the lowest sentence suggested by those guidelines, waiving a fine because of Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s \u201cfinancial status.\u201d The court concluded its statement with a specific finding \u201cthat the sentence complies with the purposes set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Mr. Gutierrez argues that the district court neither specified which \u00a7 3553 factors it considered nor addressed his mitigation evidence regarding his age, abusive childhood, anger issues, and drug problem. He asserts that the court did not give an \u201cindividualized\u201d explanation particular to him but instead simply \u201crobotically opined\u201d that the 462-month sentence was appropriate. As Mr. Gutierrez concedes, however, the district court heard his mitigation arguments just before pronouncing the sentence (in addition to reading about them in the presentence report) and made clear on the record that it had considered the \u00a7 3553 factors. And the court certainly tailored its sentence to Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s particular circumstances, as it declined to impose a fine based on his personal financial status.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">Although the district court could have said more, it said enough on this record. \u201c[W]e have held that a court\u2019s explicit ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>knowledgment that it has considered a defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient to demonstrate that it has adequately and properly considered those factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1278 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have also \u201csquarely h[e]ld that nothing ... requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d for a sentence to be procedurally sound. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The sentence is also substantively reasonable, which, as a within-guidelines sentence, we generally expect it to be. <em>See Hunt, </em>526 F.3d at 746. Although Mr. Gutierrez argues that 462 months is \u201cgreater than necessary to achieve the purpose of sentencing\u201d (and that 384 months \u2014 the statutory minimum \u2014 would have been sufficient), we see nothing unreasonable in the district court\u2019s decision not to sentence Mr. Gutierrez below the advisory guidelines range. First, a sentence of 384 months would have provided no incremental punishment for the carjacking offenses. Second, the seriousness of the crimes \u2014 which involved the discharge of guns and a high-speed car chase through afternoon traffic \u2014 and Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s criminal history (some of it violent) and lack of remorse supported that choice. Although a sentence somewhere between 384 months and 462 months would have been permissible, the sentence imposed is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\">. The government argues that we should review the procedural reasonableness of Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s sentence under the plain-error standard because he failed to object to the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation of his sentence at the time the district court rendered it. But we have not yet adopted such an approach in a published opinion, and we do not need to do so here: Mr. Gutierrez's sentence is reasonable even under the abuse-of-discretion standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-5\">. Citing other circuits' decisions, Mr. Gutierrez suggests to us that our precedent of allowing district courts to sentence defendants without exhaustive explanations of how they reached those sentences does not \"provide for meaningful appellate review.\" Unless and until our precedent is overruled by the United States Supreme Court or by this Court sitting en banc, however, we are bound to follow it. <em>See, e.g., United States v. King, </em>509 F.3d 1338, 1343 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
