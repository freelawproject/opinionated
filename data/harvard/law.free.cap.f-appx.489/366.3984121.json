The district court sentenced him to 12 months and 1 day in prison and. imposed a 3-year term of supervised release. One of the conditions of Rodrigues\u2019 supervised release prohibited him from committing another federal, state, or local crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">While Rodrigues was on supervised release, the probation office determined that he had violated that condition, and the probation office filed a superseding petition for the revocation of his supervised release. The petition alleged that Rodri-gues had violated the terms of his supervised release by committing five Florida crimes: (1) grand theft, (2) conspiracy to traffic in cannabis, (3) cannabis trafficking, (4) theft of utility services, and (5) possession of drug paraphernalia. The district court issued a warrant and held a revocation hearing. At the revocation hearing, the parties and the district court agreed that the government was pursuing revocation based only on the grand theft allegation because, by the time Rodrigues had committed the other four crimes, his supervised release had expired. The district court found that Rodrigues had violated the terms of his supervised release by committing grand theft, and it revoked his supervised release. The court sentenced Rodrigues to 5 months in prison and 31 months of supervised release. This is Rodrigues\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">A district court may revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of that release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The preponderance of the evidence standard is met if it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the defendant violated a condition of his supervised release. <em>See United States v. Cataldo, </em>171 F.3d 1316, 1322 (11th Cir.1999). We review only for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release. <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>607 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2010). That standard of review \u201crecognizes the range of possible conclusions the trial judge may reach.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). For that reason, we will affirm a district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>revocation of a defendant\u2019s supervised release \u201cunless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">In Florida, one way to commit grand theft is by knowingly obtaining another person\u2019s property, valued between $20,000 and $100,000, with intent to deprive that person of a right to the property. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 812.014(1), (2)(b)(l). At the revocation hearing, Raja Abhulson testified that he leased a building to Rodrigues that was outfitted with restaurant equipment worth at least $100,000. The lease provided that no one could remove equipment from the building without Abhulson\u2019s consent. Abhulson testified that (1) he owned the equipment; (2) the county required the owner of the equipment to pay a tangible property tax on it; and (3) while Rodrigues was leasing the building, Abhul-son paid that tax. Abhulson also testified that he evicted Rodrigues from the building and, soon after the eviction, someone removed all of the restaurant equipment from the building. Police officers took Abhulson to Rodrigues\u2019 home, and Abhul-son told the officers that some of his restaurant equipment was sitting in Rodri-gues\u2019 yard. Also, a police officer testified that he executed a search warrant for Rod-rigues\u2019 home and found some of Abhulson\u2019s restaurant equipment. The district court found Abhulson\u2019s and the police officer\u2019s testimony credible, and we \u201cgive particular deference to credibility determinations of a fact-finder who had the opportunity to see live testimony,\u201d <em>United States v. Lebowitz, </em>676 F.3d 1000, 1009 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted). The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Rodrigues violated the terms of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-18\">There is another issue that we must address. The district court\u2019s written order states, \u201cUpon motion by the Government, violations numbered 2, 3, and 4, were dismissed. The hearing proceeded as to violation 1.\u201d The written order does not address the fifth alleged violation\u2014 possession of drug paraphernalia. The transcript of the revocation hearing, however, clearly indicates that the court dismissed the fifth alleged violation and that the omission of that dismissal from the written order is a clerical error. So, although we affirm the court\u2019s judgment in all other respects, we remand the case to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting the written judgment to reflect the court\u2019s oral dismissal of the fifth alleged violation. <em>See United States v. James, </em>642 F.3d 1333, 1343 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">AFFRIMED IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
