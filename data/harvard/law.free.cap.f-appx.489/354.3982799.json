We granted a Certificate of Appealability to decide whether the district court erred in dismissing the section 2254 petition as time-barred; we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-21\">Neither party disputes that, if Petitioner\u2019s filing of his first Rule 3.850 motion began the tolling of the one-year AEDPA statute of limitations, his section 2254 petition would be considered timely filed. But Petitioner\u2019s first Rule 3.850 motion was dismissed without prejudice; Petitioner filed an amended Rule 3.850 motion eighty-eight days later. If Petitioner\u2019s filing of his <em>amended </em>Rule 3.850 motion\u2014 instead of the filing of his first Rule 3.850 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>motion \u2014 establishes the date to begin the tolling of the limitations period, 388 un-tolled days ran between the day Petitioner\u2019s judgment of conviction became final and the day he filed his section 2254 petition in the district court; his section 2254 petition would be time-barred. The timeliness of Petitioner\u2019s section 2254 petition, therefore, turns on whether his first Rule 3.850 motion for postconviction relief was \u201cproperly filed\u201d under AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a federal habeas petition, including the determination that a petition is time-barred under section 2244(d). <em>See Arthur v. Allen, </em>452 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). Under AEDPA, a prisoner serving a sentence for a state conviction has one year from the date his judgment of conviction and sentence becomes final to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). The limitation period is tolled for \u201c[t]he time during which a <em>properly filed </em>application for State postconviction or other collateral review\u201d is pending. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u201c[A]n application is \u2018properly filed\u2019 when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings.\u201d <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 121 S.Ct. 361, 364, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000). The question for us in this case is whether Petitioner\u2019s first Rule 3.850 motion was \u201cproperly filed\u201d in compliance with the Florida Rule 3.850 requirements to toll the AEDPA limitations period; we conclude that it was not properly filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Rule 3.850(c)(6) \u2014 by its very words\u2014 requires a prisoner\u2019s motion for postcon-viction relief to include, among other things, \u201ca brief statement of the facts\u201d supporting the motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Florida post-conviction court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of Petitioner\u2019s first Rule 3.850 motion reads this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">Defendant\u2019s Motion sets forth sixteen claims for post-conviction relief. However, the Defendant\u2019s Motion totals over 250 pages. Under Rule 3.850, Fla. R.Crim. P., a motion shall include \u201ca brief statement of the facts (and other conditions) relied on in support of the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court finds that 250 pages to set forth sixteen claims is excessive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">Petitioner argues that his Rule 3.850 motion was properly filed because no page-limit requirement existed under Florida law when he filed the motion. He says that, after <em>Siebert v. Campbell, </em>334 F.3d 1018, 1025 (11th Cir.2003), a prisoner\u2019s noncompliance with a state\u2019s filing requirements will render his state postconviction petition improperly filed only if the state postconviction filing rule is \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed.\u201d And because no firmly established and regularly followed page-limit requirement existed when he filed his state postconviction motion, Petitioner says his first motion was properly filed, tolling the AEDPA limitations period and preserving his federal habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">We disagree. We accept that \u201cbrief statement\u201d means and must be reasonably understood to have this meaning: short or expressed in a few words. The word \u201cbrief\u2019 might allow for some range, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>250 pages is beyond the edge. And our attention has not been called to instances of other multi-hundred page Rule 3.850 motions being allowed to go forward in Florida. Furthermore, our decision in <em>Siebert </em>addressed a different issue: an Alabama court had dismissed Siebert\u2019s motion for postconviction relief as untimely, and we said that the motion was nonetheless \u201cproperly filed\u201d because the pertinent timeliness requirement was not regularly followed by the Alabama courts. 334 F.3d at 1031. More important, the Supreme Court reversed our decision in <em>Siebert, </em>stressing that \u201c[w]hen a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, that is the end of the matter for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\u201d <em>Allen v. Siebert, </em>552 U.S. 3, 128 S.Ct. 2, 4, 169 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007), (quoting <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005)). Besides, no part of the state court\u2019s decision, in this case, indicates that Petitioner\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion was dismissed by the state court for untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The state court dismissed Petitioner\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion without prejudice for failing to comply with the expressed requirement of Rule 3.850 that his motion include a \u201cbrief statement of the facts.\u201d That a Rule 3.850 motion include a brief statement of the facts is a written requirement of the Rule that must be followed by all litigants: a rule that prescribes the form of Rule 3.850 filings in the Florida courts. <em>See Artuz, </em>121 S.Ct. at 365 (filing requirements \u201cprescribe, for example, the form of the document, the time limits upon its delivery, the court and office in which it must be lodged, and the requisite filing fee.\u201d). As determined by a Florida state court, Petitioner failed to comply with the Rule 3.850 \u201cbrief statement\u201d filing requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Given Florida\u2019s \u201cbrief statement\u201d - requirement, Petitioner\u2019s first Rule 3.850 motion for postconviction relief was improperly filed; the AEDPA one-year limitation period was tolled from the day he filed his amended Rule 3.850 motion. Petitioner\u2019s section 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus was therefore untimely; we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">. After the state court denied Petitioner\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion, the Florida Legislature revised some of Rule 3.850. The rule now includes this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">Motions shall be typewritten or handwritten in legible printed lettering, in blue or black ink, double-spaced, with margins no less than one inch on white 8 1/2-by-l 1 inch paper. No motion, including any memorandum of law, shall exceed 50 pages without leave of the court upon a showing of good cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJi\">Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
