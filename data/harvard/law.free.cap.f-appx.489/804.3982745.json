We review the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determinations that Guzman is not eligible for withholding of removal under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). The substantial-evidence standard requires that the decision be based on the evidence presented and that the decision be substantially reasonable. Carba<em>jal-Gonzalez v. INS, 78 </em>F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an alien must show that \u201c \u2018it is more likely than not\u2019 that his life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of one of the five categories mentioned under asylum.\u201d <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 906 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1)). The protected categories are \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(42)(A); <em>Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994). Judicial review of whether an alien has established persecution \u201con account of\u2019 a protected ground is governed by the substantial evidence standard. <em>See INS. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-84 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-15\">The determination that Guzman has not shown membership in a particular social group or that his past mistreatment was \u201con account of\u2019 such membership is supported by the record and is substantially reasonable. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 482-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez, </em>78 F.3d at 197. Because he has not demonstrated that any protected ground was a central reason for the alleged persecution, Guzman has not demonstrated that the IJ and the BIA erred in denying withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-16\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b831-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
