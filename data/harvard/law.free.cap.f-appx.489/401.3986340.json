Pena raises two arguments: (1) she contends the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred in relying on testimony of a Vocational Expert (VE) about the number of available jobs Pena could perform given her Residual Functional Capacity (RFC); and (2) she claims the ALJ violated her right to due process by limiting her attorney\u2019s cross-examination of the VE. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">When reviewing a decision of the Commissioner of Social Security (Commissioner) about a claimant\u2019s entitlement to disability insurance benefits, we ask whether \u201cit is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). To determine whether a claimant is disabled, the Commissioner conducts a sequential, five-step evaluation process. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). As relevant to Pena\u2019s appeal, in that process the Commissioner bears the burden of establishing that there are sufficient jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform given her age, education, work experience, and RFC. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011). The Commissioner \u201cmay rely solely on the VE\u2019s testimony\u201d in making this decision. <em>Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">\u201cIn order for a vocational expert\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1227 (11th Cir.2002). Pena does not contest that the ALJ\u2019s question to the VE in her case included all of her impairments. Nonetheless, she contends that the ALJ could not rely on the VE\u2019s testimony to find that she was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Specifically, the VE testified that Pena could physically perform the jobs within the categories of sorter and semiconductor assembler. But in testifying to the number of such jobs available, the VE reduced his estimate of the total number of jobs to account for Pena\u2019s limited grasp of English. The crux of Pena\u2019s argument is that, when limiting the total number of available jobs Pena indisputably could physically perform to account for her limited English skijls, the VE was required to specify the formula he used to arrive at the reduced figure and the rationale for that formula for his conclusion to be reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">That level of statistical specificity is not required. In fact, the Social Security regulations clearly provide that a VE\u2019s knowledge and expertise may supply a reasoned basis for his conclusions. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1560(b)(2), 404.1566(e); <em>see also Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1230 (explaining that a VE\u2019s testimony is critical and may be the \u201csole[ ]\u201d basis for the Commissioner\u2019s decision because the VE can supplement the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>with more detailed \u201cemployment information from a personal survey, contact with employers and other VEs, and a survey of literature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">Here, the VE testified that he arrived at his estimates by consulting multiple sources of unquestioned reliability. Then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u201cbased on [his] knowledge of these types of jobs in the economy, [he] did some reductions.\u201d As the ALJ clarified with the VE, that reduced estimate was based upon the VE\u2019s \u201cexperience\u201d and \u201chis personal knowledge of those jobs.\u201d In this ease, the ALJ was entitled to rely upon the VE\u2019s testimony without requiring the VE to provide a comprehensive statistical explanation of how he arrived at the reduced job number figures. Accordingly, the Commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In a social security case, \u201cthe ALJ has a basic obligation to develop a full and fair record.\u201d <em>Graham v. Apfel, </em>129 F.3d 1420, 1422 (11th Cir.1997). But we have indicated that \u201cthere must be a showing of prejudice before we will find that the claimant\u2019s right to due process has been violated to such a degree that the case must be remanded to the Secretary for further development of the record.\u201d <em>Brown v. Shalala, </em>44 F.3d 931, 935 (11th Cir.1995). To make this determination, we ask \u201cwhether the record reveals evidentiary gaps which result in unfairness or clear prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Pena contends<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the ALJ deprived her of the fully and fairly considered decision on her disability claim to which she was entitled and, therefore, that the ALJ violated her right to due process. At her hearing, Pena says, the ALJ cut short her attorney\u2019s cross-examination of the VE about how he arrived at his estimates of available jobs. As a result, she claims that she was not able to expose flaws in the VE\u2019s methodology. She also argues that the ALJ\u2019s interruption indicates that the ALJ had already accepted the VE\u2019s opinion without properly considering her contention that the opinion was speculative and lacked a proper foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">We conclude that Pena has not demonstrated that she was prejudiced because she has not shown there were any unfair or prejudicial evidentiary gaps in the record before the ALJ. Although the ALJ did instruct her attorney to move along, Pena\u2019s attorney fully elicited the sources and the methodology the VE had utilized in arriving at the available employment figures to which he testified. Thus, the ALJ had a full and fair record of the bases for the VE\u2019s opinion and sufficient information to evaluate their reliability. There is no indication that Pena was prejudiced by the ALJ\u2019s management of the hearing. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\">. The Commissioner asks us to deem Pena's due process argument waived because, according to the Commissioner, Pena raises the argument for the first time on appeal. <em>See Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1161. We disagree. In the memorandum of law Pena submitted to the district court, she asserted, among other things, that the ALJ had cut off too quickly her attorney's legitimate questions to the VE about the reliability of the VE\u2019s methods and that the ALJ had not been \u201copen minded\u201d to potential flaws in the VE's testimony. She argued the ALJ had thereby deprived her of the \"full and fair decision\u201d to which she was entitled. Although she did not specifically allege that she was deprived of due process, in this instance we are satisfied that she adequately raised in the district court the due process claim that she advances on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
