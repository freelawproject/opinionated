Ye argues that the adverse credibility finding regarding past persecution did not preclude the IJ and the BIA from finding that he established a well founded fear of future persecution or that it was likely that he would be tortured if returned to China. This is the sole issue for appeal, as Ye does not challenge the adverse credibility finding made by the IJ and affirmed by the BIA. By failing to argue the adverse-credibility-finding issue, Ye has abandoned any claims of error he might have raised regarding the adverse-credibility-finding. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>880 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-25\">With respect to Ye\u2019s argument related to future persecution and torture, the BIA was not afforded an opportunity to address the issue because Ye did not include any reference to it in his brief submitted to the BIA. <em>See Claudio v. Holder, </em>601 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir.2010). Accordingly, Ye failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to this issue, and we lack jurisdiction to consider it in the instant petition. <em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 321 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-26\">Ye\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b785-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
