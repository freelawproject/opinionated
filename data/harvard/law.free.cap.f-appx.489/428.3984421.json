Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of GEICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">GEICO issued an automobile liability insurance policy to the Bells providing non-stacking Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) coverage in the amount of $25,000.00 per person and $50,000.00 per occurrence. The policy\u2019s \u201cpayment of loss\u201d provision states that:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">Any amount due is payable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-14\">(a) to the insured or his authorized representative,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-15\">(b) if the insured is a minor, to his parent or guardian,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-17\">(c) if the insured is deceased, to his surviving spouse; otherwise</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-18\">(d) to a person authorized by law to receive the payment, or to a person legally entitled to recover payment for the damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-19\">[GEICO] may, at [its] option, pay an amount due in accordance with (d) above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-20\">[R. 62-2 at 32-33.]</p>\n<p id=\"b455-21\">On November 30, 2008, the Bells\u2019 son, Erskin, was involved in a very serious automobile accident which left Erskin, in a coma. The accident required Erskin\u2019s transport to and care from Orlando Regional Medical Center (\u201cthe hospital\u201d). GEICO was first notified of Erskin\u2019s injury on December 2, 2008, when it received a call from the hospital requesting information about coverage under the Bells\u2019 policy. GEICO immediately began investigating the loss and contacted Erskin, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-22\">On December 3, 2008, GEICO claims supervisor Karen Hall (\u201cHall\u201d) noted that GEICO would tender its full $25,000.00 UM policy limits to the Bells once she received confirmation from underwriting as to the available amount of coverage under the policy. In accordance with Chapter 57-1644, Laws of Florida and Orange County Code of Ordinances, Part II, Chapter 20, Article IV, the hospital filed a lien on December 12, 2008, which attached to \u201cany and all ... claims ... accruing to [Erskin]\u201d [R. 62-7 at 1.] The same day, Nick Denton (\u201cDenton\u201d), a GEICO claims examiner, contacted Phillipa and told her that GEICO would be issuing a check for the $25,000.00 UM policy limits and that the check would include the hospital as a payee. Denton also wrote Phillipa confirming their conversation and providing her with a cheek for the $25,000.00 UM policy limits, a proposed release of the UM claim, a certified copy of the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>policy, an affidavit of coverage, and the UM selection form showing the Bells\u2019 amount of UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The Bells\u2019 attorney, Nathan Carter, Esq. (\u201cCarter\u201d), wrote GEICO a letter, received on December 15, 2008, advising that he represented the Bells and requesting disclosure of their insurance information. Denton wrote Carter on the same date, provided a certified copy of GEICO\u2019s policy, an affidavit of coverage, the Bells\u2019 uninsured motorist selection form, and advised that GEICO had tendered the $25,000.00 UM policy limits to the Bells by check payable to Erskin Bell and the hospital<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Afterward, the Bells contend that Carter or his paralegal contacted Denton two or three times by phone, stating that Phillipa\u2019s health insurance would cover the hospital expenses and asking GEICO to reissue the check to the Bells, or alternatively, to Carter\u2019s firm trust account. Denton does not remember the substance of each conversation, but claims that if Carter\u2019s paralegal in fact raised the possibility of reissuing the settlement check to the law firm\u2019s trust account, that Denton would have requested confirmation in writing that Carter\u2019s firm would satisfy the hospital\u2019s lien. Carter drafted a letter on January 23, 2009, requesting a check made payable to his firm\u2019s trust account and promising to resolve the hospital lien, but GEICO never received the letter. It is not clear from the record whether the letter was actually mailed. Hall testified that had she been aware of Carter\u2019s request to reissue the check to the firm trust account, GEICO would have done it so long as Carter promised to protect GEICO from any obligation on the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">On January 28, 2009, Carter filed a Civil Remedy Notice (\u201cCRN\u201d) on behalf of Ers-kin, Sr. with the Florida Department of Financial Services. The CRN identified \u201cclaim denial\u201d as the \u201creason for notice,\u201d and described the \u201cfacts and circumstances giving rise to the insurer\u2019s violation\u201d as follows: \u201cCLAIMANT HAS PROVIDED PROOF OF CLEAR LIABILITY ON THE PART OF AN UNDERIN-SURED/UNINSURED MOTORIST, AND DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE POLICY LIMITS, YET GEICO HAS FAILED TO UNCONDITIONALLY TENDER THE INSURED\u2019S UM POLICY LIMITS.\u201d The CRN identified Den-ton as the GEICO employee most responsible for and knowledgeable of the facts surrounding the alleged violation. Upon receipt of the CRN on February 2, Denton claims that he tried to call Carter, but was unable to reach him. On February 6, 2009, Denton responded to the CRN by writing Carter, explaining that GEICO had already tendered payment and that it would reissue the check without the hospital as a payee if GEICO received written notice from Carter explaining how the hospital\u2019s lien would be satisfied. On February 20, 2009, Carter responded by letter to GEICO, refusing any check made payable to the hospital. For whatever reason, Carter did not address GEICO\u2019s request for the firm\u2019s assurance that it would be responsible for satisfaction of the hospital\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">The Bells were also entitled to $10,000.00 in personal injury protection (\u201cPIP\u201d) coverage from GEICO. Another GEICO employee, Veronica Williams (\u201cWilliams\u201d), who had no interaction with Denton, separately processed the PIP claim and allegedly paid the entire $10,000.00 to an ambulance company, rather than paying $5,000.00 to the hospital. GEICO then refused to pay the hospital the $5,000.00 in PIP coverage until GEICO was reimbursed $5,000.00 from the ambu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>lance company. The hospital would not bill Phillipa\u2019s health insurance company or release its lien until receiving notification from GEICO that the Bells\u2019 PIP coverage had been exhausted. The hospital\u2019s lien was released on May 29, 2009, once GEI-CO reissued $5,000.00 for PIP coverage to the hospital. On June 12, 2009, GEICO issued a new $25,000.00 check, payable solely to Erskin Bell. The Bells refused to accept the $25,000.00, as they had already filed a complaint in state court against GEICO alleging first-party bad faith for GEICO\u2019s failure to settle their UM claim within the statutory cure period. After GEICO removed the case to federal court, answered the complaint, and settled some issues in mediation, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on the first-party bad faith claim. The district court decided the motions in GEICO\u2019s favor, and the Bells timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Perry v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>664 F.3d 1359, 1363 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 624.155(l)(b)l, which creates a cause of action for first-party bad faith, provides that an insurer is liable if it does not attempt \u201cin good faith to settle claims when, under all the circumstances, it could and should have done so, had it acted fairly and honestly toward its insured and with due regard for [the insured\u2019s] interests.\u201d An insurer\u2019s simple negligence does not amount to bad faith. <em>See DeLaune v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>314 So.2d 601, 603 (Fla.Ct.App.1975). Before an insured may bring a suit for first-party bad faith, he or she must give the insurer written notice of the alleged violation by filing a CRN. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 624.155(3)(a). If \u201cwithin 60 days after filing [the CRN], the damages are paid or the circumstances giving rise to the violation are corrected,\u201d then no claim for bad faith exists. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 624.155(3)(d). To cure a violation, the insurer must tender \u201cthe amount owed pursuant to the express terms and conditions of the policy.\u201d <em>Talat Enters., Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co., </em>753 So.2d 1278, 1282 (Fla.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">In the instant case, the district court found that the Bells never acquired a claim under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 624.155 because GEICO tendered the full policy coverage, $25,000.00 payable to Erskin, Sr. and the hospital, in compliance with the Bells\u2019 insurance policy providing for payment of loss \u201cto a person authorized by law to receive payment, or to a person legally entitled to recover payment for the damages.\u201d [R. 94 at 6 (quoting R. 62-2 at 33).] On appeal, the Bells allege error on three grounds discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">\n<em>A. GEICO\u2019s responsibility for delay in the release of the hospital lien</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">The Bells first argue that the district court ignored GEICO\u2019s errors in processing their PIP claim that created and prolonged the hospital\u2019s lien on their $25,000.00 in UM funds. They allege that by erroneously paying their PIP funds entirely to an ambulance company, and then delaying a $5,000.00 payment to the hospital until receiving reimbursement from the ambulance company, GEICO\u2019s action (and later, inaction) kept the hospital lien in place. Absent the existence of the hospital lien, GEICO would have issued the check to the Bells as payees, as they demanded. The Bells\u2019 position is without merit for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">First and foremost, as the district court held, GEICO\u2019s payment of loss did not amount to bad faith since the \u201cexpress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>terms and conditions of the [Bells\u2019] policy\u201d allowed for payment to the hospital, a person entitled by law to receive payment. <em>See Talat, </em>758 So.2d at 1282. Thus, we conclude that the district court correctly reasoned that GEICO\u2019s error and delay in routing $5,000.00 from the Bells\u2019 PIP claim to the hospital did not change the fact that GEICO was contractually entitled to render payment to the hospital so long as the hospital held its valid lien. <em>See Dade Cnty. v. Pavon, </em>266 So.2d 94, 96 (Fla.Ct.App.1972) (holding that upon admission to a hospital, the hospital\u2019s lien \u201cattached to the proceeds of all [insurance] claims accruing to the patient or his legal representative as a result of the patient\u2019s hospitalization\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Second, we conclude that while GEICO\u2019s error and delay in the handling of the separate PIP claim may constitute negligence, it does not rise to the level of a bad faith failure to settle the UM claim. Third, in the CRN \u2014 the statutory vehicle for curing an insurer\u2019s bad faith denial of a claim \u2014 Carter gave GEICO no facts explaining the connection between the delayed PIP payment to the hospital and the hospital\u2019s unresolved lien on the UM claim payment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Bells respond that GEICO never asked Carter for more information about the vague complaint. Further, they claim that they could not address the PIP issue in the CRN because they were unaware of the connection between the mishandled PIP claim and the lien on UM proceeds until after filing the CRN. Even so, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 624.155(3)(b) requires the insured to explain in the CRN the \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d surrounding the insurer\u2019s bad faith in order to allow the insurer to remedy the problem. The Bells\u2019 CRN did not afford GEICO the opportunity to correct \u201cthe circumstances giving rise to the [alleged] violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 624.155(3)(d); <em>see also Lane v. Westfield Ins. Co., </em>862 So.2d 774, 779 (Fla.Ct.App.2003) (reasoning that \u201c[t]he purpose of the [CRN] is to give the insurer one last chance to settle a claim with its insured and avoid unnecessary bad faith litigation \u2014 not to give the insured a right of action to proceed against the insurer even after the insured\u2019s claim has been paid or resolved.\u201d) For all these reasons, we conclude that the Bells have failed to show how GEICO\u2019s conduct amounted to a bad faith refusal to settle their UM claim. Thus, we hold that the district court correctly found that no cause of action for first-party bad faith ever came into existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\n<em>B. The Bells\u2019additional arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Additionally, the Bells argue that the \u201cpayment of loss\u201d provision in the insurance policy, quoted <em>swpra, </em>requires GEI-CO to remit payment to <em>either </em>the insured or the hospital, but not both. They posit that GEICO should not have issued a check payable to both the insured and a lienholder, and that to justify this action, the district court improperly supplied the word \u201cand\u201d in the place of an implied \u201cor\u201d between the policy\u2019s descriptions of the persons to whom GEICO was entitled to tender payment. Alternatively, they argue that the \u201cpayment of loss\u201d provision is ambiguous, and therefore, the insurance policy should have been interpreted in their favor. This contractual interpretation argument was not raised in the district court. Normally, we will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal. Access <em>Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004). The Bells <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>urge us to consider this argument because (1) contract interpretation is a purely legal issue, rather than a factual question; and (2) our refusal to consider the argument would result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See Garcia v. Pub. Health Trust of Dade Cnty., </em>841 F.2d 1062, 1066 (11th Cir.1988) (explaining exceptions to our custom of refusing consideration of arguments raised for the first time on appeal). We recognize that Florida courts have long held that an insurer faced with competing demands for payment from the insured and a hospital has the option to \u201cma[k]e a check for the limits [of the policy] payable to both of the competitors, the hospital and the insured.\u201d <em>Gov\u2019t Emp. Ins. Co. v. Gonzalez, </em>512 So.2d 269, 270-71 (Fla.Ct.App.1987) (citing <em>Fernandez v. S.C. Ins. Co., </em>408 So.2d 753, 755 (Fla.Ct.App.1982)). Thus, we decline to consider the Bells\u2019 argument because our refusal to do so could not result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Finally, the Bells argue, also for the first time, that GEICO\u2019s defense based on the policy\u2019s \u201cpayment of loss\u201d provision should be estopped by the \u201cmend the hold\u201d doctrine, which prohibits a party from taking inconsistent positions during litigation. The Bells allege that when Carter disputed the UM settlement check\u2019s listing of the hospital as payee, GEICO never relied on the \u201cpayment of loss\u201d provision in the policy. Even if the \u201cmend the hold\u201d argument has merit, it requires us to consider factual questions regarding GEICO\u2019s consistent or inconsistent behavior. We therefore decline to entertain this argument as well. <em>See Garcia, </em>841 F.2d at 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">The circumstances surrounding Erskin\u2019s car accident and incapacitation are very unfortunate. However, the facts of this case, even when considered in the light most favorable to the Bells, do not require resolution by a jury. As a matter of law, we conclude that GEICO did not act unfairly or dishonestly toward the Bells by refusing to settle their UM claim on the Bells\u2019 terms. GEICO promptly responded to the Bells\u2019 claim, settled for the full amount available under the policy, and acted within its rights under the policy to issue a check payable to both the Bells and the hospital. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Geico.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-6\">. The check was presumably payable to Ers-kin, <em>Sr., </em>as he was the GEICO policy holder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b458-5\">. Similarly, the CRN is devoid of facts explaining how GEICO acted in bad faith by failing to cooperate with Carter to issue the check to his law firm's trust account upon his assurance that the firm would be responsible for the hospital lien.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
