The probation officer\u2019s presentence investigation report (PSI) attributed to Sumerlin 126 grams of crack cocaine and noted his status as a career offender. Accordingly, the PSI indicated that Sumerlin faced a mandatory life sentence under the then-current version of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Congress enacted the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), Pub.L. No. 111-120, 124 Stat. 2372, 2372 (2010), in order to decrease the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses. The Act, which lowered the mandatory minimum sentences that applied to crack-cocaine offenses, including those under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), became effective on August 3, 2010. At Sumerlin\u2019s sentencing hearing two days later, however, the district court did not sentence Sumerlin under the FSA\u2019s new sentencing structure, instead imposing the mandatory life sentence under the old version of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Sumerlin appealed, arguing that, because the FSA went into effect before he was sentenced, he was entitled to a sentence in accordance with the Act. Sumerlin contended that, under the new law, he would be subject to only a 10-year mandatory minimum, rather than a mandatory life sentence. <em>Compare </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2006) <em>with </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (2006 &amp; Supp. V 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">In April 2011, this court issued an unpublished opinion affirming Sumerlin\u2019s mandatory life sentence. <em>United States v. Sumerlin, </em>424 Fed.Appx. 904 (11th Cir.2011) (unpublished). In that opinion, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">Prior to enactment of the FSA, defendants who had two prior felony drug convictions when they committed an offense involving 50 grams or more of crack cocaine faced a mandatory term of life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2009). The FSA did not amend the requirement that, once triggered, statutory mandatory-minimum sentences apply. <em>See United States v. Gomes, </em>621 F.3d 1343, 1346 (11th Cir.2010). The FSA contains no language indicating its application to offenses committed before its enactment. <em>See generally </em>124 Stat. 2372.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">The general savings statute provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty ... incurred under such statute, unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide.\u201d 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109. In <em>Gomes, </em>we held that \u00a7 109 barred the FSA from applying retroactively to the defendant\u2019s punishment because he committed his crimes before the FSA took effect. <em>Gomes, </em>621 F.3d at 1346.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">Under the prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow prior precedent \u201cunless and until it is over-ruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>342 F.3d 1245, 1246 (11th Cir.2003)). Therefore, the district court did not plainly err in sentencing Sumerlin under the pre-FSA version of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 905-06. We denied his petition for rehearing on June 22, but the mandate was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">On July 6, this court decided in a published opinion that the FSA applies to those, like Sumerlin, who committed their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>offenses prior to the FSA\u2019s effective date but were sentenced after that date. <em>United States v. Rojas, </em>645 F.3d 1234, 1236 (11th Cir.2011), <em>reh\u2019gen banc granted, </em>659 F.3d 1055 (11th Cir.2011). Then, on October 4, 2011, this court vacated <em>Rojas </em>for rehearing <em>en banc. Rojas, </em>659 F.3d at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Before this court could hear the <em>Rojas </em>case <em>en banc, </em>however, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in two cases to address whether the FSA should apply to defendants convicted before, but sentenced after, it took effect. See <em>Hill v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 759, 181 L.Ed.2d 480 (2011); <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 759, 181 L.Ed.2d 480 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">The Supreme Court has now resolved the issue, holding that the FSA\u2019s reduced sentences apply to defendants who committed their offenses before the Act\u2019s effective date, August 3, 2010, but were sentenced thereafter. <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2335-36, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). We now address Sumerlin\u2019s appeal in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">At the sentencing hearing, Sumerlin\u2019s counsel did not object to the district court\u2019s sentence based on the FSA, so we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). \u201cUnder that test, ... there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). If these conditions are met, we may then exercise our discretion to recognize the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">Because the mandate has not yet issued, Sumerlin\u2019s appeal remains pending in this court. Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey, </em>decided while Sumerlin\u2019s case remained under our consideration, makes plain that it was error to sentence Sumer-lin under the pre-FSA crack-cocaine sentence structure. <em>Dorsey, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2335-37. In prior cases, we have held that \u201c[although the error was not \u2018plain\u2019 at the time of sentencing, \u2018where the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal \u2014 it is enough that the error be \u2018plain\u2019 at the time of appellate consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1549, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)). Although the error was not plain at the time of the first <em>Sumerlin </em>opinion, the error is plain now and the second prong is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">And there can be no dispute that this error affects Sumerlin\u2019s substantial rights: under the FSA, Sumerlin was subject only to a mandatory 10-year minimum sentence, rather than the mandatory life sentence he received. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>406 F.3d 1261, 1262-63 (11th Cir. 2005) (explaining that an error affects substantial rights when it \u201caffected the outcome of district court proceedings\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). But, at Sumerlin\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court remarked, \u201cthe only sentence that\u2019s provided by law for your situation is life in prison, and there is no lower sentence that I am permitted by law to give you.\u201d Had Sumerlin been sentenced under the FSA\u2019s new sentencing structure, however, the district court could in fact have considered a substantially lower sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-17\">Finally, we conclude that the error in this case seriously affects the fairness, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tegrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings. As the Court in <em>Dorsey </em>made clear, failure to apply the FSA to defendants in Sumerlin\u2019s situation \u201cwould seriously undermine basic Federal Sentencing Guidelines objectives such as uniformity and proportionality in sentencing.\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2326. In this case, Sumerlin received a mandatory sentence far above what he was required to receive under the FSA. If we fail to recognize the error, Sumerlin\u2019s mandatory life sentence, imposed under a sentencing scheme that Congress had already rejected, would deeply offend our shared notions of justice. We therefore hold that Sumerlin has satisfied each element of our plain error standard, and we exercise our discretion to recognize the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the prior opinion of this panel. We also vacate Sumerlin\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Dorsey.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aun\">. Sumerlin's motion to remand is therefore denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
