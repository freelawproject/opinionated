When an inmate refused to stop banging and kicking on his cell door, Jones and two other officers entered the inmate\u2019s cell to calm him down. Although the exact details are unclear, the officers used physical force against the inmate; and the inmate died shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Following the inmate\u2019s death, a lieutenant instructed Jones and three other officers to prepare incident reports. According to two witnesses, Jones \u2014 who was the highest ranking officer involved in the incident \u2014 instructed the other officers to get their stories straight and suggested, either explicitly or implicitly, that the officers omit from their reports that they had had a physical encounter with the inmate before his death. Jones was later convicted based on the misleading information contained in her incident report.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">On appeal, Jones first argues that the district court violated <em>Garrity v. New Jersey, </em>385 U.S. 493, 87 S.Ct. 616, 17 L.Ed.2d 562 (1967), by admitting her incident report into evidence at trial. In <em>Garrity, </em>the United States Supreme Court concluded that, absent a knowing and voluntary waiver, incriminating statements made by law enforcement officers under threat of termination for remaining silent are inadmissible in later criminal proceedings. 87 S.Ct. at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">But we have concluded that, \u201c[although an accused may not be forced to choose between incriminating [her]self and losing [her] job under <em>Garrity, </em>neither <em>Garrity </em>nor the Fifth Amendment prohibits prosecution and punishment for false statements or other crimes committed during the <em>making </em>of Garrity-protected statements.\u201d <em>United States v. Veal, </em>153 F.3d 1233, 1243 (11th Cir.1998) (emphasis in original). \u201cGiving a false statement is an <em>independent </em>criminal act that occurs <em>when </em>the individual makes the false statement; it is <em>separate </em>from the events to which the statement relates, the matter being investigated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Because Jones was prosecuted for making misleading statements in her incident report \u2014 not for the conduct described in her report \u2014 she is unentitled to protection under <em>Garrity </em>or the Fifth Amendment. Thus, the district court\u2019s admission of Jones\u2019s incident report was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">Jones next argues that insufficient evidence exists to support her conviction. In particular, Jones asserts that nothing evidences that she knew that federal authorities would investigate the incident or that her incident report would be transferred to federal officers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">We review a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>ment. <em>Id. </em>at 1253. To prove that Jones violated section 1512(b)(3), the government must show that she \u201cknowingly and willingly (1) engaged in misleading conduct toward another person, (2) with intent to hinder, delay or prevent the communication of information to a federal law enforcement officer ..., (3) about the commission or the possible commission of a federal crime.\u201d <em>See id. </em>On appeal, Jones does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence proving that she engaged in misleading conduct or that the information she provided was pertinent to a federal crime. Thus, we need only address the \u201cintent\u201d element of her offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Jones acknowledges that, under this Court\u2019s current law, the government is not. required to prove that the defendant knew that her misleading information pertained to a federal offense. <em>See id. </em>at 1252; <em>see also United States v. Rondo, </em>455 F.3d 1273, 1285 (11th Cir.2006) (stating that section 1512(b)(3) \u201cdoes not require a specific intent to mislead federal officials\u201d). Instead, the government need only show that \u201cthe misleading information is <em>likely </em>to be transferred to a federal agent.\u201d <em>See Veal, </em>153 F.3d at 1251 (emphasis in original). Because we are bound by our prior precedent, we decline Jones\u2019s invitation to adopt a different approach used in two other circuits. <em>See Gandara v. Bennett, </em>528 F.3d 823, 829 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that \u201cwe are bound by the holdings of earlier panels unless and until they are clearly overruled <em>en bane </em>or by the Supreme Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Although Jones suggests that she was aware only that her statements would mislead state officials, there existed \u201cthe <em>possibility </em>or <em>likelihood </em>that [her] false and misleading information would be transferred to federal authorities irrespective of the government authority represented by the initial investigators.\u201d <em>See Veal, </em>153 F.3d at 1251-52 (emphasis in original). Thus, sufficient evidence exists to support Jones\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\">. Jones was also convicted of making a false statement to a federal agent, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, and obstructing, influencing, or impeding a federal grand jury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503. She does not challenge these convictions on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-14\">. Contrary to Jones\u2019s assertions, the record establishes that, during a recent training course, Jones had been taught that excessive use of force investigations were performed by federal authorities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
