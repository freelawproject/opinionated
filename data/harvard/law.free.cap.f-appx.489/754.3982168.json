Our review is for an abuse of discretion. <em>See James v. Cain, </em>56 F.3d 662, 665 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-22\">A \u00a7 2241 petition is considered to be abusive if it raises \u201cthe same legal issue\u201d addressed and resolved in a prior filing. <em>United States v. Tubwell, </em>37 F.3d 175, 177-78 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also Williams v. Tamez, </em>466 Fed.Appx. 326, 327 (5th Cir.2012) (finding that district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing a \u00a7 2241 petition as an abuse of the writ where the petition raised the same legal issue as a prior petition). Despite Rich\u2019s purported modifications to his second \u00a7 2241 petition which would allow him to bring a <em>Richardson </em>claim under the savings clause, the legal issue remains the same. Moreover, Rich\u2019s arguments that his second petition was not successive, that the district court should not have dismissed his petition sua sponte, and that the district court\u2019s sanction warning was unfair, all are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-23\">The appeal is without arguable merit and therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal as frivolous is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for summary affirmance or an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED. Rich is warned that future frivolous filings will result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and restrictions on his abil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>ity to file pleadings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b780-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
