She also alleged that Convergys failed to promote her and retaliated against her after they learned that (a) she had filed a discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), and (b) she was involved in a lawsuit with a former employer, CSX Corporation (\u201cCSX\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-16\">For her race discrimination and discriminatory discharge claims, Beal alleged that \u2014 despite having ten years\u2019 experience in marketing, as well as various business education and skills \u2014 she was rejected from several internal positions for which she applied, some of which were later filled by candidates who were not black, or were less qualified than Beal. In addition, Beal argued that similarly-situated white employees were treated more favorably and that the covert placement of reprimands in her personnel file before her termination proved pretext and rebutted Convergy\u2019s proffered reasons for her termination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The district court concluded that Beal failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of race discrimination or discriminatory discharge: she did not show that she was treated differently than similarly-situated persons outside her protected class.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of race discrimination under Title VII, the employee must prove (1) that she is a member of a racial minority; (2) that she was subjected to an adverse employment action; (3) that her employer treated similarly-situated employees outside her classification more favorably; and (4) that she was qualified for the job. <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir.1997). To make a comparison of the plaintiffs treatment to that of non-minority employees, the plaintiff must show an employee who is similarly situated to the plaintiff in all relevant respects. <em>Id. </em>If a plaintiff fails to show the existence of such an employee, summary judgment is appropriate where no other evidence of discrimination exists. <em>Id. </em>When a plaintiff alleges discriminatory discipline, we require that the quantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct be nearly identical to the plaintiffs. <em>See Burke-Fowler v. Orange Cnty., Fla., </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In this case, Beal fails to establish that two co-workers, Brenda Daniel and Hans Belanger, are valid comparators. Beal does not dispute that she failed to meet her sales goals, while Daniel excelled in her position. Daniel, therefore, is not a proper comparator for pay raises, promotions, or benefits because she and Beal were not similar in all relevant respects in terms of their job performance. <em>See Holifield, </em>115 F.3d at 1562. With regard to the reduction in work hours, Belanger had his hours reduced even more than Beal; and thus, even assuming that Beal is correct in stating that she and Belanger were functionally equal in terms of job duties, Belanger was not treated more favorably than Neal. Belanger also is not a valid comparator for Beal\u2019s disparate-discharge claim because he was terminated for unsatisfactory performance, while Beal was terminated for recording customer calls in violation of company policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">Because Beal failed to show the existence of a valid comparator in either her race discrimination or discriminatory discharge claims and does not present other evidence of discrimination, she failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>See Burke-Fowler, </em>447 F.3d at 1323 (holding that a plaintiff had not established a <em>prima facie </em>case of race discrimination because she failed to show valid comparators and presented no other circumstantial evidence of discrimination). Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Beal\u2019s race discrimination and discriminatory-discharge claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">Even assuming that Beal could establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of failure to promote, the district court concluded that she had failed to rebut Convergys\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for not selecting her for any of the 67 internal positions for which she applied: she was ineligible for most of the positions, lacked the relevant experience, or was not the most qualified candidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">On appeal, Beal argues that her credentials illustrate she was better qualified than the candidates selected to fill 11 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the positions for which she applied. Beal exclusively relies on a job chart that lists the positions she applied for, the reason (if any) given for her nonselection, and the selected candidates\u2019s race, sex, age, and education. Beal\u2019s chart, however, does not compare her experience, work history, performance at Convergys, or other qualifications to the candidates selected: she included none of that information for the selected candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Beal, she did not present evidence establishing that she was more qualified than any of the candidates selected for the positions she applied for, or that she was eligible for the remaining positions. She failed to show that no reasonable person could have chosen the selected candidates over her. <em>See Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that in the failure-to-promote context, \u201c[a] plaintiff must show that the disparities between the successful applicant\u2019s and her own qualifications were of such weight and significance that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff\u2019) (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Turning to Beal\u2019s retaliation claim, Title VII makes it unlawful \u201cfor an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because [she] has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice\u201d under Title VII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Retaliation under Title VII occurs when an employee engages in protected activity and suffers an adverse employment action that is causally related to that activity. <em>See Harper, </em>139 F.3d at 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In this case, the district court properly concluded that Beal had established a <em>pri-ma facie </em>case for retaliation. She demonstrated a causal link between her protected activity \u2014 namely, her various internal complaints and her filing of the EEOC charge \u2014 and the adverse employment acts (including a reduction in her work hours and her eventual termination) that occurred after March 2009, when Convergys first became aware of Beal\u2019s prior litigation with CSX. But Beal failed to rebut Convergys\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the adverse employment acts, including that Beal performed unsatisfactorily by failing to meet her sales goals and by recording customer calls contrary to company policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Here, Beal does not dispute that she failed to meet her sales goals. Nor does she present evidence supporting her assertion that she received reprimands from Convergys mainly or just to thwart her career advancement. Because Beal did not demonstrate that Convergys\u2019s proffered reasons were not the \u201creal\u201d reasons for the adverse employment acts, or that the real reason was discriminatory animus against her, she failed to establish pretext. <em>See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (holding that \u201ca reason cannot be proved to be a \u2018pretext <em>for discrimination </em>\u2019 unless it is shown both that the reason was false, <em>and </em>that discrimination was the real reason\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Convergys.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's grant of summary judgment. <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir.2007). And we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-11\">. Employment claims brought under the FCRA involve the same analysis as Title VII disparate treatment claims. <em>See Harper v. Blockbuster Entm\u2019t Corp., </em>139 F.3d 1385, 1387 (11th Cir.1998) (FCRA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b448-12\">. Beal also alleged that she was denied tuition reimbursement, was excluded from important team meetings, that her interviews for positions were cancelled, and that her supervisors were changed excessively. We conclude that Beal abandoned these claims because she fails to argue on appeal that the district court erred in denying these claims. <em>See N. Am. Med. Corp. v. Axiom Worldwide, Inc., </em>522 F.3d 1211, 1217 n. 4 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that \u201cissues not raised on appeal are abandoned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b448-18\">.Because this case is a circumstantial evidence case, the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), applies. Under this framework, the plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, which creates a presumption of unlawful discrimination against the employee. The employer may then rebut that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>presumption with legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the adverse employment acts. The employee must then proffer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that the defendant\u2019s articulated reasons are pretextual. <em>See Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 976 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
