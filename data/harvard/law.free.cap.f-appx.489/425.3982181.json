This Court does not have to decide whether the district court abused its discretion by dismissing Hansjurgens\u2019s appeal for want of prosecution because he never received leave to appeal the bankruptcy court\u2019s interlocutory order. And the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying such leave where the bankruptcy court had by then entered a final judgment. The district court did not have jurisdiction to consider Hansjurgens\u2019s claims. We affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing his appeal to that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
