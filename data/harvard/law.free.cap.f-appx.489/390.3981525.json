On appeal, Saucedo argues that the district court erred in admitting evidence seized from his cell phone pursuant to a search warrant because, while the initial seizure of his phone was lawful, there was an unreasonable delay in securing the search warrant for the phone. He further contends that his trial counsel was ineffective due to the failure to file a motion to suppress the evidence of his cell phone records. Sauce-do also challenges his sentence, arguing that it is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court did not properly consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors and imposed an excessive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b) provides that a motion to suppress evidence must be made before trial. Fed. R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(C). Rule 12(e) further provides that \u201c[a] party waives any Rule 12(b)(3) defense, objection, or request not raised by the deadline the court sets under Rule 12(c) or by any extension the court provides.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e). However, \u201c[f]or good cause, the court may grant relief from the waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we have stated that a \u201cfailure to present a suppression motion prior to trial constitutes waiver unless the district court grants relief for good cause shown.\u201d <em>United States v. Ford, </em>34 F.3d 992, 994 n. 2 (11th Cir.1994). Although the district court may grant relief from the waiver for good cause shown, we have declined to address the element of \u201cgood cause\u201d when the defendant did not request relief from the waiver. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 12(e); <em>United States v. Suescun, </em>237 F.3d 1284, 1287 n. 7 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-17\">We conclude from the record that Saucedo waived his argument regarding the admissibility of his cell phone records because he failed to file a pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence, as required by Rule 12(b)(3)(c). Furthermore, he never asked the district court or this court to relieve him from the waiver, and he has not provided any explanation for why he failed to file a motion to suppress the evidence from his cell phone. Accordingly, we affirm this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-19\">Where appropriate, we review claims for ineffective assistance of counsel <em>de novo </em>as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>mixed questions of law and fact. <em>Caderno v. United States, </em>256 F.3d 1213, 1216-17 (11th Cir.2001). In <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 509, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1696, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003), the Supreme Court concluded that failure to raise ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal does not bar such claims from being raised for the first time in a collateral attack. In arriving at this conclusion, the Supreme Court held that, in most cases, the record is inadequate to raise an ineffective-assistance claim on direct appeal because the trial evidence is devoted to guilt-or-innocence issues, as opposed to the reasoning behind counsel\u2019s actions. <em>Id. </em>at 504-05, 123 S.Ct. at 1694. By contrast, it held that the district court, on collateral review, can handle such claims more efficiently. <em>Id. </em>at 506-07, 123 S.Ct. at 1695. It observed that the district court is \u201cthe forum best suited to developing the facts necessary to determining the adequacy of representation during an entire trial,\u201d in part because it provides an opportunity to obtain testimony <em>from the </em>attorney alleged to have rendered ineffective assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 505-06, 123 S.Ct. at 1694.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">As such, as a general matter, \u201can ineffective assistance of counsel claim is properly raised in a collateral attack on the conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255,\u201d as opposed to direct appeal. <em>United States v. Merrill, 513 </em>F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). This rule notwithstanding, the Supreme Court and this court have recognized that there may be cases \u201cin which trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is so apparent from the record\u201d that the issue may be considered on direct appeal. <em>Massaro, </em>538 U.S. at 508, 123 S.Ct. at 1696.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We decline to consider Saucedo\u2019s ineffective assistance challenge on direct appeal. Rather, this claim should be presented in a collateral attack on the conviction under \u00a7 2255, where the district court could better develop a full record.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we must first ensure that the sentence was procedurally reasonable, meaning that the district court properly calculated the guideline range, treated the guidelines as advisory, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally reasonable, we must examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>A sentence may be remanded if we are left with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">The district court must impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>dant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The party who challenges the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 674, 178 L.Ed.2d 502 (2010). Although we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum penalty is an indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">We conclude from the record that the district court adequately considered Saucedo\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. In addition, we conclude that Saucedo\u2019s 360-month sentence was substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances and in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm Saucedo\u2019s conviction and his total sentence of 360 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
