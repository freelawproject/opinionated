In his section 2255 motion, Easton claimed his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge adequately the use of a prior drug conviction to enhance Easton\u2019s sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation that the motion be denied but granted Easton a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on his enhanced sentence as an armed career criminal. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">In reviewing a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). The ACCA requires the court to impose a sentence of at least 15 years if a defendant possesses a firearm or ammunition after 3 previous convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">Easton\u2019s criminal history included a 2003 conviction for possession with intent to sell cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school, in violation of Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) described that Easton was arrested for selling cocaine to an undercover police officer. He later pleaded <em>nolo con-tendere </em>to <em>one count of </em>possession with intent to sell a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">At his change-of-plea hearing, the state court indicated that Easton was entering a plea to the charge of \u201cpossession with intent to sell,\u201d a second-degree felony. Although he filed other objections to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>PSI, Easton did not object to the inclusion of his 2003 drug conviction as a predicate offense under the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 833-34 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that when a defendant fails to object to statements in the PSI despite the opportunity to do so, he is deemed to have admitted those facts). During his sentencing hearing, Easton also did not file objections to his sentence being enhanced under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">On appeal, Easton argues that the <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), documents in his case were ambiguous and failed to indicate the specific part of the Florida statute underpinning his conviction. He maintains that, because his plea was not supported by a factual basis, his conviction could have been for the least prohibited act under the statute \u2014 purchasing a controlled substance \u2014 and did not qualify as a serious drug offense. Easton further argues that <em>United States v. Shannon, </em>631 F.3d 1187 (11th Cir.2011), mandates a finding that his prior state conviction was improperly used to enhance his sentence because that case should be used by analogy to determine that the offense of \u201cpurchase\u201d is not a serious drug offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Eaton\u2019s arguments are without merit. His substantial reliance on <em>Shannon </em>is in-apposite because our decision in that case was premised on the district court\u2019s inability to deduce from the <em>Shepard </em>documents the statutorily-prohibited part of the statute underpinning the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>See Shannon, </em>631 F.3d at 1189-90 (stating that a violation of Florida drug law is not a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under the Guidelines if the conviction is for the \u201cpurchase\u201d of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute and further noting that, if the record is ambiguous, we would assume that the conviction involved a charge for the purchase of drugs, that is, the least prohibited act).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">In this case, the change-of-plea hearing, as well as Easton\u2019s petition to enter a plea of <em>nolo contendere, </em>unambiguously indicates that Easton was convicted of second-degree possession with intent to sell cocaine. None of the pertinent documents make a reference to Easton\u2019s being convicted of a purchase offense. In addition, Easton has failed to provide support for his assertion that the \u201cpossession with intent to sell\u201d language used at his change-of-plea hearing was merely shorthand for his statute of conviction, as opposed to a clear indicator that he was convicted of possession with intent to sell. Because a second-degree felony is punishable by up to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment under Florida law, Easton\u2019s conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to sell constitutes a serious drug offense under the ACCA. <em>See </em>Fla Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 775.082(3)(c), 893.1300(a) (1987); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Accordingly, the district court properly concluded that Easton\u2019s 2003 state conviction was a proper predicate offense under the ACCA; and his trial counsel could not have been ineffective for failing to challenge that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-10\">. In his section 2255 motion, Easton also argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file an appeal on his behalf despite his request to do so. At the evidentia-ry hearing, he withdrew this claim, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\">. Easton originally was charged with possession with intent to sell cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school, a first-degree felony under Florida law. He eventually pleaded <em>nolo con-tendere </em>to a lesser charge of possession with intent to sell cocaine, a second-degree felony under Florida law. The judgment, however, included a scrivener's error referencing the \u201c1,000 feet from a school\u201d part from the original charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
