Delgado argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it sentenced Delgado to 13 months of imprisonment. Delgado admitted violating a term of his supervised release by being arrested and charged in a Florida court for battery. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1107 (11th Cir.2006). The district court sentenced Delgado to a term within the advisory guideline range, which we ordinarily expect to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). The district court reasonably determined that Delgado\u2019s past offenses and inability to comply with the terms of probation required that he serve a term of imprisonment to punish him adequately, deter similar future conduct, and protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Delgado entered the United States in 1994. In 1995, after he was convicted in a Florida court of burglary and grand theft, Delgado failed to complete a deferred prosecution program and then violated his probation. Between 1996 and 2002, Delgado was convicted of burglary, grand theft, criminal mischief, petit theft, resisting a merchant and burglary, and resisting arrest without violence, and he was charged, but not prosecuted, for seven other offenses. Delgado\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">We AFFIRM Delgado\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
