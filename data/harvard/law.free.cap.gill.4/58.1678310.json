A special fund was designated in the act for the payment of interest, the principal being irredeemable for thirty years. Another section of the act referred the claims of <em>P. </em>to the arbitrament of <em>L., </em>and any amount so found due him, should be paid in like manner as the claims of other creditors, <em>\u201c </em>and not otherwise.\u201d Held : that the creditors for whom provision is made, as aforesaid, were to be creditors of the company at that time ; and the fund thereby created, is for the payment of those claims, and none others. All the, then, creditors have an interest in it; and of which they eouldnot be deprived by the board of directors of the company, without their consent.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b66-6\">To entitle <em>P. </em>to an interest in this fund, he must submit his claim to the award of <em>L., </em>which is conclusive, and so of his assigns. The proof of such submission is upon him, and the directors of the company could not authorise their president to issue a bond to the assignee of P., payable out of the fund created by that act, unless <em>P\u2019s </em>claim had been first ascertained by <em>L.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b66-7\">And where the legislature, by a subsequent act, (1843, chap. 188,) submitted the claim of P. to other arbitrators, to proceed <em>de novo, </em>disregarding the act of 1841, and directed the company to issue the bonds mentioned in the <em>first </em>act, to such additional amount as would be sufficient to pay the <em>second award. </em>It was further <em>held, </em>that the creditors of the company, or such of them as had agreed to the law of 1841, and their claims ascertained by the company, have an interest in the fund, and without their consent, no part of it could be applied to the payment of any debt for which the act of 1841 did not provide.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b66-8\">Until creditors to whom bonds were issued under the act of 1841, are satisfied, the fund provided by that act belongs to them, and cannot be taken from them.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b66-9\">Under the charter of the <em>Annapolis and Elkridge Railroad Company, </em>(1836, chap. 298,) many of the provisions of which are borrowed from that of the <em>Baltimore fy Ohio Railroad Company, </em>the directors thereof cannot, by resolution or by-law, deny either to the president of the company or the directors appointed by the State, the same right to vote upon the various questions to be decided by the president and directors, as those who are elected by the stockholders possess.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b66-10\">The president of that company, therefore, cannot by resolution have his right to vote restrained to the mere right of giving a casting vote in case of a tie.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b66-11\">Appeal from <em>Anne Arundel </em>county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-12\">On the 21st April 1846, the appellant filed his petition, alleging, that heretofore, on or about the 14th February 1846, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>the <em>Annapolis and Elkridge Railroad </em>Company, by their resolution duly passed, authorised and directed the president of the said company to issue to <em>Passmore McCullough, </em>or to his order, or to his assignees, if it should appear that any assignment had been made prior to the said resolution, certain bonds which the said company were authorised to issue under an act of the Genera] Assembly of 1841, ch. 168, to the amount of $4227.96, after deducting from said amount whatever interest might be due on the several claims of <em>Robert Welch, of Ben., </em>for which bonds were, on the said day, directed to be issued to the said <em>Welch, </em>provided that before the said bonds should be issued to the said <em>McCullough, </em>he should file with the president of the said company a written obligation, to be approved by the counsel of the said company, discharging the said company of any indebtedness to him on any account whatever. That the said <em>Passmore McCullough </em>had, previously to the passing of the said resolutions, assigned to your petitioner of his claim upon the said company to the extent of $3116.39; and after-wards, that is to say in the month of March in the said year, the said <em>Passmore McCullough </em>presented to the said president, and offered to file witli him his release to the company, duly approved by <em>Thomas </em>/S'. <em>Alexander, Esq., </em>counsel of the said company, wherein he discharged and exonerated the said company from all claims which he had against them, which was duly executed under his seal, and thereby authorised and required the said president to issue to your petitioner bonds directed to be issued under said resolution, to the extent of the sum of $3116.39, all which will more fully appear by a reference to the said release, herewith filed and marked exhibit A. That on the day on which the said <em>Passmore </em>offered to file with the said president his said release, your petitioner, by his counsel, demanded the issue of the said bonds, according to the said resolution, which the said president positively and peremptorily declined and refused to do, alleging, that the said resolution was not properly passed, because he, as president, had not been permitted to vote at the meeting of the president and directors of the said company, at which the said resolution was passed; whereas your petitioner avers, that the majority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the said directors had determined that the said president had no right to vote in the said matter, under an existing by-law of the said company, which prevented his so doing, and that whether he had or had not voted, and the reason of his not voting could not and did not in anywise concern your petitioner, or' affect his right to the said bonds as aforesaid, directed by the said resolution to be issued as aforesaid. That at the time of the passing of the said resolution, and ever since, up to the present time, <em>James Iglehart, </em>of the city of <em>Annapolis, </em>was and still is, president of the said company, and that as such, the said <em>James Iglehart </em>has refused, as aforesaid, to issue the said bonds above demanded by your petitioner, as aforesaid, and that by means of his said refusal to issue the said bonds, your petitioner has suffered great injustice and is without remedy, except by the interposition of your honors by the State\u2019s writ of <em>Mandamus. </em>And he therefore humbly prays, that the State\u2019s writ of <em>Mandamus, </em>may be issued by your honors, to be directed to the said <em>James Iglehart, </em>president of the <em>Annapolis and, Elkridge Railroad Company, </em>commanding him, without any further delay and all excuses set apart, to issue to your petitioner and in his favor, bonds to the extent of $3116.39, as authorised and directed by the said resolution; and the said <em>George McCullough </em>further shews, that it was the duty of the said <em>James Iglehart, </em>as president of the said company, to issue and put the corporate seal of the company to the said bonds, and in proof thereof and of the passage of the said resolution, herewith files as part of his petition, exhibits B and C.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\">This petition was verified by the oath of the petitioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\">Exhibit A. \u2014 Whereas by a resolution of the board of directors of the <em>Annapolis and Elkridge Railroad Company, </em>passed on the 14th day of February 1846, the president is directed to issue bonds to <em>Passmore McCullough, </em>or to his order, or to his assignees, authorised under the act of 1841, ch. 168, to the amount of <em>$4427.96\u2022, </em>and it is further provided, that before the said bonds shall be issued as aforesaid, the said <em>McCullough </em>shall file with the president of the company a written obligation, to be approved by tire counsel of the company, discharging the company of any indebtedness to him on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>any account whatever <em>\u2022, </em>and whereas the said president is about to issue bonds, as aforesaid, to <em>James Murray, </em>of the city of <em>Annapolis, </em>to the amount of $519.79, and to <em>George McCullough </em>to the amount of $3116.39, amounting in the aggregate to the aforesaid sum of $4427.96, after deducting from said last amount the sum of $282.78, for interest due on the claims of <em>Robert Welch, of Ben. </em>Now this obligation witncsseth, that the said <em>Passmore McCullough, </em>in consideration of the delivery of the said bonds to the said <em>James Murray, William Schley </em>and <em>George Me Cullough, </em>and concurrently with the execution of these presents, doth hereby release, acquit, exonerate and discharge the <em>Annapolis and Elkridge Railroad Company </em>from all claims a,nd demands whatsoever, which the said <em>Pass-more McCullough </em>hath or ever had, or might have at any time, against the said <em>Annapolis and Elkridge Railroad Company, </em>founded on or arising out of any dealings or transactions which has ever been had between the said company and the said <em>McCullough. </em>In witness whereof, the said <em>Passmore McCullough </em>hath hereunto set his hand and affixed his seal, on this 24th day of February, in the year 1846.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-5\">Passmore McCullough, (Seal.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AvU\">Signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of <em>II.

This application seems to have been grounded upon a resolution of the board of directors, directing the president of the company to issue bonds to <em>Passmore McCullough, </em>or to his order, or to his assignees, if it should appear that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>assignment of his claim against this company had been made previous to the passage of this resolution, authorised under the act of 1842, chap. \u2014, to the amount of $4427.96, after deducting from said amount whatever interest may be due on the several claims of <em>R. Welch, </em>of <em>Benj., </em>for which bonds are, this day, directed to be issued, with a proviso, that before the bonds are issued, he shall file with the president a written obligation, discharging the company from any indebtedness to him on any account whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">How much is due to <em>Passmore Me Cullough, </em>after making these deductions, does not appear in the record. But the petition of the appellant states, that of this sum the said <em>Passmore </em>had assigned to the petitioner $3116.39, previously to the passage of the resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">He applied to the president, and offered to file with him the release required. Thereupon the petitioner, by his counsel, demanded the issue of said bonds, according to the resolution, which he, (the president,) peremptorily refused to do. He insists that he is entitled to the bonds, and prays that a <em>Mandamus </em>may be issued, requiring him to execute them.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">No such act as that alluded to in the <em>resolution </em>is to be found, but in the release which <em>Passmore McCullough </em>executed, and which accompanies his petition, reference is made to the act of 1841, chap. 168; and certainly there is nothing in that act of Assembly which authorises those proceedings. By a reference to that law it will be found, that the amount of the claim of this individual, if he had any against the company, was to be ascertained by <em>John C. Le Grand, Esq., </em>and that neither the board of directors, nor the president and board of directors, had any authority to issue bonds to him for any amount, not authorised by that gentleman; unless this sum was awarded by <em>Mr. Le Grand, </em>the president of the board could not be bound, in obedience to the resolution, to issue the bonds, as the board of directors was not authorised to issue them, until the amount was certified to them by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">All claims against the company then existing, with the exception of those of <em>McCullough </em>and another, are to be ascertained by the president and directors of the company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>but with the adjustment of the claims of those individuals, the company is not charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">It is obvious, that the creditors for whom provision is made by the act of Assembly, were to be creditors of the company at that time, and the fund thereby created, is a fund for the payment of those claims, and none others. It is a fund in which all the, then, creditors may have an interest, and of which they could not be deprived by the board of directors, without their consent. The assignor of the petitioner is a person who may have a claim against the company. To entitle him to any interest in this fund, he must consent to submit his claim to <em>Mr. Le Grand, </em>and that his award shall be final and conclusive: (see the Act of Assembly.) To this mode of having his claim finally adjusted, he was not bound to consent; but unless <em>be does </em>consent to it, the act of 1841 makes no provision, whatever, for the payment of any claim which he may have against this company. It does not appear in the record that he did consent to such arbitrament. <em>Mr. Le Grand </em>may or may not have awarded, in the premises, No resolution of the board of directors can authorise the president, or any other officer, to issue a bond, (payable out of that fund,) which is not authorised by the law which creates the fund; we certainly cannot infer from that resolution, (even if it was legally passed,) that the sum mentioned in it was the sum, or any part of the sum, ascertained by <em>-Mr. Le Grand </em>to be due to this person. The language of the resolution would lead to a different conclusion, and besides this, the act of 1841 does not authorise a bond or certificate of debt to be issued to any other than the creditor himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We have also been referred to the act of 1843, chap. 180. But the creditors of the company, or such of them as agreed to the law of 1841, and have had the amount of their claims ascertained by the president and directors, have an interest in this fund, and without their consent no part of it must be applied to the payment of any debt for which the act of 1841 does not provide. Now, the claim of <em>McCullough, </em>as ascertained by the persons named in the act of 1843, is not one of the claims for which the act of 1841 provides. If the board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>directors can apply any portion of these funds to procure from <em>McCullough </em>a release of all his claims, it might next attempt to pay debts since contracted, out of the same fund. Until the creditors, to whom bonds were issued in virtue of the act of 1841, are satisfied, these funds belong to them, and cannot be taken from them. But it nowhere appears that the resolution is grounded upon any award, given in virtue of the act of 1843.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">But it is said, that the president of the company, <em>(Mr. Iglehart,) </em>when the application was made to him for the bonds, assigned no reason for refusing to issue them, save this, that he was not allowed by the board to vote on the occasion; and the appellant has furnished us with a copy of the proceedings of the board, whereby it appears, that the directors excluded the president from voting, and thereby obtained a majority in favor of the resolution. These doings, it is insisted, are authorised by the charter of this company, and we are referred to a clause in the charter of the <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad </em>Company, (made a part of this charter,) which says, that the stockholders shall elect a certain number of directors, \u201c to manage the affairs of said company.\u201d To be sure, if <em>this was </em>the only section at which we are to look, in order to decide whether others have not a right to vote with the directors appointed by the stockholders, we might conclude, that the president of the board was not allowed a vote; but for the same reason we should be obliged to deprive of their votes the directors, which, by another clause, are to be appointed by the State. When, however, we examine the different clauses which define the duties of the president and directors, what duties the president and directors, (they, \u201cor a majority of them,\u201d) are to perform, we feel justified in concluding, that the president and the directors appointed by the State, have the same right to vote upon the various questions which are to be decided by the president and directors, as those who are elected by the stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">If then the resolution was such an one as might be passed, the president had a right to vote, and being deprived of his vote, he was not bound to issue the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">ORDER OF THE COURT BELOW AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
