Hanson, Drucilla P., </em>wife of <em>William Hanson, </em>answered the bill, the only material part of which is referred to in the opinion of this court, and is therefore not set forth here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\">On the 1st November 1844, the county court, (0. Dorsey, A. J.,) decreed a sale of the real estate, in the proceedings mentioned, in the usual form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-9\">From that decree <em>John Josias Hanson </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b79-10\">The cause was argued before Archer, C. J., Dorsey, Chambers, Spence, Magruder and Martin, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-11\">By JIeeder for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-12\">By J. Johnson for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b79-13\">Magruder, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aff\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\"><em>Samuel Hanson, senior, </em>by his will, dated 29th September 1817, after devising to his wife and two daughters, for life, the land in the proceedings mentioned, gave the same, in fee, to his son <em>Samuel; </em>and in the next clause, gives to his son, <em>John B. Hanson, </em>twelve hundred and fifty dollars, to be paid him \u201cby my son <em>Samuel, </em>in five annual payments, the first payment to be made at the end of the first year, after he gets possession of the plantation.\u201d The devisees, for life, are dead, and no part of the said legacy being paid, this bill is filed by some of the heirs of <em>Samuel, </em>(the devisee in fee,) and heirs of <em>John B. Hanson, </em>to whom the twelve hundred and fifty dollars are given, asking for a sale of the land, \u201cand the proceeds arising therefrom to be distributed among the parties severally entitled thereto.\u201d The defendants, in their answer, say, that before a sale can bo made, the estate should be divided among the heirs of <em>Samuel, </em>or if incapable of division, the heir entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>should have a right to elect; and it is insisted, that no one could make payment of the legacy until an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">If this was the only objection to the relief which was prayed, it would not hinder an affirmance of the decree; but there are objections to any relief being afforded in this case, and the mention of which, will enable the persons entitled to claim the legacy, to proceed correctly, if in order to recover the money given to <em>John B. </em>Hanson, it should be necessary to file another bill of complaint. The money, when due, is payable to the executors or administrators of the legatee, and the bill must be filed by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Another objection to the decree, which will be noticed, is, that it docs not appear, that the first payment which is to be made, was due at the time that this bill of complaint was filed. The first payment was to be made at the end of the first year, after he, (the devisee in fee,) gets possession of said plantation. The bill, filed on the 14th March 1843, alleges, that one of the devisees for life died, \u201csometime during the year 1842.\u201d The defendants, in their answer, insist, that the money is not due till \u201clate next fall; the tenant for life, <em>Miss Charity </em>Hanson, not having departed this life till the fall of 1842,\u201d and there is no testimony in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">For these reasons, if there be none others, the decree must be reversed, with costs, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">decree reversed and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
