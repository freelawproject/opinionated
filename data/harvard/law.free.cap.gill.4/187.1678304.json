That <em>E. P. </em>and <em>T. J.

T. 8. </em>departed this life; and that after his death, the survivor, <em>E. P., </em>did, during his life, well and truly prosecute said injunction, and did, in all things, stand to, obey, and perform, each and every order and decree of the court of chancery in the premises; that afterwards <em>E. P. </em>died; and that it was afterwards so proceeded in said injunction, that after the death of <em>T. J. 8. </em>and <em>E. </em>P., the said writ of injunction was dissolved by final order of the court of chancery, of 27th March 1840, and this, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-11\">The plaintiff demurred generally to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and specially to the 7th, rejoinders of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-12\">The 5th rejoinder was denied generally, with an assignment of breaches, as in the 1st plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-13\">Issue was joined on the 6th rejoinder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-14\">The defendant joined in demurrer, and also demurred to the surrejoinder to the 5th rejoinder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-15\">After this the defendant prayed leave to amend his 7th rejoinder, and rejoined anew:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-16\">\u201cThat while the said <em>T. J. 8. </em>and <em>E.

J., Dorsey, Spence and Martin, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-9\">By Causin and J. J. Lloyd for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-10\">No counsel appeared for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b199-11\">Spence, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AgN\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">This was an action of <em>debt </em>on a bond: the declaration was in the usual form, to which the defendant pleaded general performance: the plaintiff replied, and assigned breaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">To the plaintiff\u2019s replication, the defendant pleaded seven separate pleas, by way of rejoinder, and to all of the defendant\u2019s pleas, by way of rejoinder, the plaintiff filed demurrers, except the fifth.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">The bond, on which this action is brought, recites, \u201cwhereas the above bound <em>Thomas Joseph Speake </em>and <em>Edward, </em>Pye, have obtained an injunction to stay proceedings at law, and on a judgment rendered against them in <em>Charles </em>county court, by the above named <em>Thomas Janney </em>and <em>John D. </em>Brown,\u201d <em>fyc., </em>and the condition of the bond is, \u201cthat the said obligors shall prosecute the injunction with effect, and satisfy and pay, as well the said sum of money and costs, as all costs, damages and charges, that shall accrue in the chancery court,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">The defendant\u2019s first four pleas, by way of rejoinder, are each of them obnoxious to the same fatal infirmity, namely, they, each of them, deny a fact which the defendant\u2019s intestate has expressly admitted under his hand and seal, in his bond. In the recital of the bond it is said, \u201cthat the obligors, <em>Speaka </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\u00e1nd <em>Pye, </em>have obtained an injunction to stay proceedings at law,\u201d and in each of these pleas, by way of rejoinder, this fact is denied. The law is clearly settled upon authority, that a party is estopped from denying a fact recited in his deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><em>Lord Denman, C. J., </em>in the case of <em>Bowman vs. Taylor and others, </em>29 <em>Eng. Com. Law Rep., p. </em>90, in his opinion, uses this language: \u201cAs to the doctrine laid down in <em>Co. Litt., </em>352 <em>B., </em>that a recital doth not conclude, because it is no direct affirmation: the authority of <em>Lord Coke </em>is a very great one; but still, if a party has, by his deed, recited a specific fact, though introduced by \u2018whereas,\u2019 it seems to me impossible to say, that he shall not be bound by his own assertion, so made under seal.\u201d <em>Vide Fridge vs. State, use of Kirk, 3 G. &amp; J., </em>114. <em>Lainson, ex\u2019tr of Owen Griffiths, vs. Tremere, </em>28 <em>Eng. Com. Law, </em>214. <em>Shelley vs. Wright, Wille's Rep., </em>9.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The defendant\u2019s fifth plea, by way of rejoinder, is nothing more than a repetition of her plea of general performance, and in nearly the same words, and is, therefore, no answer to the plaintiff\u2019s replication; neither does it traverse or avoid the breaches assigned in the replication. This would have been a good ground of demurrer, but the plaintiff, instead of demurring, filed his surrejoinder thereto, and again assigned a breach of the bond, to wit: \u201cthat the said <em>Spealze </em>and <em>Pye </em>did not, nor did either of them, prosecute with effect the said writ of injunction,\u201d &amp;c. To this surrejoinder the defendant demurred, and the court sustained her demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In this, we think, the court erred, and as it is a well established rule, that courts of law will give judgment against the party whose pleading is first bad, and as we think the defendant\u2019s fifth plea was unquestionably defective, therefore the demurrer should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The defendant\u2019s seventh plea, to which the plaintiff also demurred, is neither an answer as to the plaintiff\u2019s replication, or a bar to his action, and the matter which it sets up, by way of defence, shows conclusively the breach of the bond assigned by the plaintiff. It, in substance, avers, that the said <em>Sp'eake </em>and <em>Pye, </em>during their joint lives, and the life of the survivor of them, \u201cdid well and truly prosecute with effect said injunction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>and did, in all tilings, stand to, obey, and perform, each and every order and decree of the chancery court,\u201d &amp;c., until the death of the said <em>Speak </em>and <em>Pye; </em>and \u201cthat it was so proceeded in said injunction, that after the death of the said <em>Speak </em>and <em>Pye, </em>the said injunction was dissolved by a final order of said court, passed on the 27th day of March 1840:\u201d the plea avers, that at the time of the dissolution of the injunction, \u201cthere was no administrator or executor of said <em>Speak </em>or said <em>Pye, </em>in existence.\u201d The matter set up in this plea as a defence, shews clearly the forfeiture of the condition of the bond, and the plaintiff's right of action. The condition of the bond is, that the said <em>Speak </em>and <em>Pye </em>\u201cshall prosecute the said injunction with effect:\u201d the allegation in the plea is, \u201cthat it was afterwards so proceeded in said injunction, that after the death of said <em>Speak </em>and <em>Pye, </em>that said injunction was dissolved by final order of said court, passed,\u201d &amp;c. This court must consider the order of the chancery court as regularly and legally passed in the cause. \u201cThe judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, when coming incidentally in question in any other court, is conclusive upon the question decided, and cannot be impeached, on the ground of informality in the proceedings, or error or mistake of the court in the matter on which they have adj udicated. \u2019 \u2019 This is the language of the court in <em>Raborg vs. Hammond, </em>2 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>G. </em>50. <em>Bowie vs. Jones, </em>1 <em>G. R., </em>214.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">This case is manifestly distinguishable from the cases cited and relied on by the defendant\u2019s counsel. The case in <em>Carthew, </em>519, <em>Duke of Ormond vs. Birely, </em>which seems to be the leading case on this point, shews very clearly the grounds of the decision, namely, \u201cthat the suit abated by the death of the obligor, in the replevin bond, before judgment;\u201d for the court say, there was neither <em>non suit, </em>or verdict against the plaintiff in repletan. The case in <em>14th Mass. R., </em>231, <em>Janney vs. Janney, </em>was decided upon the ground, that the suit abated before judgment in the appellate court. But the plea in this case does not aver that the suit abated, but on the contrary, \u201cthat it was so proceeded in, that said injunction was dissolved by final order of said court, passed on the 27th day of March 1840.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
