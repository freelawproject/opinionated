Turton, </em>who was the father of the plaintiff, <em>told the plaintiff, </em>who was then attending the negroes now in controversy, as a physician, and had been so attending them for a long time before, that if he would cure the said negroes, who were at that time sick, and small children, he might have them for the medical bill; and that he must make no charge against them, from that time: to which proposition the plaintiff assented. The witness also proved, that one of the negroes was not, in his opinion, at that time worth more than five dollars; and that the other was worth nothing, by reason of their then state of sickness. The plaintiff also proved, that he continued to attend said negroes for some time thereafter, and that they recovered from their sickness under his treatment. There was no proof of any memorandum in writing of said agreement, or of any actual delivery of the said negroes; but it was proved, that the said <em>John A. Turton, </em>retained possession of the negroes up to the period of his death, which took place in August 1842, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>they were then taken possession of by the defendant, as his executor; and remained in his possession to the time of the institution of the present suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then, for the purpose of proving the loss of the plaintiff\u2019s accounts, or medical bill against his father, produced the plaintiff himself, and offered to prove by him to the court, that his medical accounts, kept by him against his father and others, from the year 1.839 to 1843, were destroyed by him in the spring of 1843, when, he changed his occupation, supposing they would be of no further use to him, and that he had searched for them last night, supposing that he might find some of the fragments, and could not find them, for the purpose of letting in secondary proof; that during those years he made no charge for medical services against his father, for said negro boys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-6\">The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the suiSciency and admissibility of said proof, on the ground, that the plaintiff had voluntarily destroyed said accounts, by an act of his own; and that he could take no advantage of such act of destruction, but the court overruled said objection, and permitted the plaintiff to be examined for said purpose; the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-7\">The plaintiff then produced by his counsel, the following notice to the defendant\u2019s counsel: \u2014 \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-8\">\u201cTo <em>Francis E. </em>Mudd, executor of <em>John A.

J.,) overruled the objection, and permitted said account to be read to the jury, and were of opinion that it was admissible for that purpose. The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">2nd Exception. After the evidence had been given which is contained in the first bill of exceptions, which, by agreement, is made a part of this bill of exceptions, the defendant then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they find from the evidence, that the negroes in controversy were <em>not delivered </em>to the said plaintiff, at the time of the alleged agreement between the plaintiff and the testator\u2019s defendant, and that no money was paid, either in whole or in part, at that time by the plaintiff to the said testator, on account of said agreement, and that the said agreement was not in writing, that then they must find a verdict for the defendant; but the court refused to grant said prayer, and instructed the jury, if they find from the evidence in the cause, that the defendant\u2019s testator was indebted to the plaintiff for medical services rendered to said negroes, prior to the time of said agreement; and that the plaintiff stipulated to relinquish, and did relinquish said indebtedness for medical services at the time of said agreement, that then this was a part performance of the agreement on his part, and would entitle him to a verdict in the present cause, if said testimony was relieved by the jury; to which opinion of the court, as given by the jury, and to their refusal to grant the instructions as prayed for, the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-7\">The defendant prosecuted this appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The cause was argued before Archer, C.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AO4\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">According to the views which we entertain of this case, we do not consider it necessary to express any opinion in relation to the sufficiency of the oath of the plaintiff, to lay a foundation for the introduction of secondary evidence, because we consider the evidence offered in the first bill of exceptions as primary proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">The defendant having, on notice, produced an account against the testator, rendered to the defendant by the plaintiff, commencing on the 12th November 1841, and terminating on <em>the </em>21st August 1842, with the death of the testator, for medical services, the plaintiff offered the said account as evidence, that during the period embraced in it, ho had not, charged in said account for medical services to the negroes in dispute. The question for consideration is, therefore, whether this account was evidence, admissible for the purpose for which it was offered ?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">The account contains no charges for medicine, and attendance on the negroes in dispute, by name; and the difficulty arises from the entries in the account, from the 20th of March to the 5th of April 1842, in which sundry visits and medicines are charged for a negro child, to whom, no name is given in the account. As to all other items in the account, amounting to $611, and embracing a period of about nine months, the names of the members of the family are given, for whom the services are rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Whether the negro child, not named in <em>the </em>account, to whom services were rendered, was one of the negroes in. dispute, was a question of evidence for the jury; and it was competent for the defendant to have proved the fact, if it were so. The admission of the account, as evidence of the contrary, did not preclude such proof.</p>\n<p id=\"A0P\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The account shows, that the defendant\u2019s testator had a considerable family of negroes, there being charges in the account for attending ten, and it states in every instance, the names of the persons attended, except in the particular instance adverted to. Under such circumstances the presumption would be, that the attendance and medicine was furnished to a child whose name was unknown; or to one who might not have been named. Again, the account contains no charges for attending the negroes in dispute, anterior to 1841, for services which are proved to have been previously rendered. The abandonment of such charges, of which the account is evidence, would naturally lead us to believe, that the charges in question were not against either of the negroes in dispute, when by the agreement the plaintiff was as much bound to abstain from the one charge, as the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We have not deemed it necessary to enquire, on this exception, whether the evidence offered would have been secondary evidence of the contents of the plaintiff\u2019s books, because we consider the account as primary evidence of the fact, which it was offered to establish. The agreement between the parties was, that he should make no charge; or in other words, <em>make no </em>claim, after the date of the agreement, for attending these negroes. If the books had been adduced, and contained charges, they might furnish strong evidence, that no such agreement as the plaintiff relies upon, was ever made; but they would not prove a non-compliance with the agreement; if one had in fact been made. Provided no claim was made on the testator or the defendant for such charges, the agreement, as we have said, being, according to tire true interpretation thereof, that no claim should be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Nor is it any objection to the admissibility of the account in evidence, for the purpose for which it was offered, that the account was made out by the plaintiff. The enquiry is, did the plaintiff claim for services for the negroes, within the dates of the account. The account furnishes the best evidence of what he did, or did not claim. The enquiry is, in relation to an act of the plaintiff, and he can certainly prove what he did do. Had he given a receipt in full, or a release, for every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>service rendered these negroes, as it was rendered, it could not be contended, that such receipt or release would not, although made by himself, be evidence to show, that he made no claim for such services. If this he so, assuming the law to he, that the account furnishes evidence of that for which it was offered, it is equally clear, that no objection could be taken to it, on the ground suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We therefore think the court were right in admitting the account in evidence, for the purpose for which it was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In the second exception, objection is taken to the refusal to grant the prayer offered by the defendant, and in giving the instruction which the court gave.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">It is conceded, and is certainly the law, that if a valuable consideration was given by the plaintiff at the time of the agreement, that such consideration would be as available to pass the title, as if money had been paid; and if there was evidence that such valuable consideration passed from the plaintiff, then the prayer ought not to have been granted, because the plaintiff has excluded from the consideration of the jury, a material fact, upon which the title of the plaintiff depended. Now it is clear to our minds, that there was evidence of sucii valuable consideration, passing from the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">By the obvious construction of the agreement, the medical bill, which was to be surrendered, was the bill which had arisen anterior to the date of the contract. The bill subsequently to be made is not that referred to, for the agreement makes the express provision with regard to that, that he must make no charge against them for that time, which would have been wholly unnecessary if the true construction of the agreement was such as is contended for. The proposition to relinquish this existing medical account, was acceded to by the plaintiff, and by doing so, he gave up all right to recover the same, as effectually as if he had given the defendant\u2019s testator a receipt therefor. By thus surrendering his medical account, he passed to the defendant\u2019s testator a valuable consideration, just as available as if he had paid him in money, the amount of the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>From the above views we are of the opinion, that the court below were right in rejecting the prayer of the defendant, in the second bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The next and last enquiry is, whether the court were in error in granting the instructions ivhich they gave in tins exception ?</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">This instruction makes the right of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery to depend, on the existence of an indebtedness for medical services anterior to the contract, on the agreement to relinquish such claim, and on the finding of such relinquishment. As to each of these facts evidence had been offered. The witness first examined, proved, that the plaintiff had attended these negroes before the date of the contract, and that he agreed to the proposition of the testator of the defendant, to surrender such bill; or in other words, that he should have them for the medical bill: and we have seen, that by such agreement he did abandon his medical bill, as effectually as if he had given an acquittance therefor. We therefore think the court committed no error in their instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
