The legacy by the eleventh Clause, or the first payment of that legacy, is to be made five years from the testator\u2019s death, and to be paid every alternate year, until the daughter, <em>Polly, </em>has received nineteen hundred dollars; that given by the twelfth clause, is to be paid annually from the testator\u2019s death, until the death of the legatees.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The counsel for the appellant relied very much upon <em>C. J. Kent\u2019s </em>opinion, in the case of <em>Dewitt vs. Yates, </em>10 <em>Johns. </em>Rep., 158, but that case differs very widely from this; in the former case/ the same sum of money is given twice, in the same instrument/ to the same legatee. It is true, the learned judge in that opinion says, \u2018\u2018the general rule on this subject, from a review of the numerous cases, appears evidently to be, that where the sum is repeated, in the same'writing/the legatee can take only one of the sums bequeathed. The latter sum is held to be a substitution, and they are not taken cumulatively, unless there be some evident intention that they should b\u00e9 so considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>This case is clearly distinguishable from the one now under consideration; in the former case, the testator, <em>Peter Yates, </em>gave to his daughter <em>Maria's </em>children, of her body, two hundred and fifty pounds, each of them to have fifty pounds when they come of age, or when they, or each of them, should marry.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">In a subsequent part of the will, the testator having devised the half of a farm to his son-in-law, <em>Philip </em>Vanderbergh, and his wife, and the other half to his wife, &amp;c., directs as follows: In consideration of which, it is my will, and I do hereby order, \u201cthat the said <em>Philip </em>Vanderbergh, his heirs, &amp;c., shall pay to the children of my said daughter Maria, to wit, <em>Sarah, </em>(the wife of the plaintiff,) <em>John, Maria, Catalina, </em>and <em>Catharine, </em>the sum of two hundred and fifty pounds, equal to six hundred and twenty-five dollars, to be paid unto them, and each of them, in sums of fifty pounds, as they shall respectively arrive at the age of twenty-one years, or on the day that they, or either of them, shall marry.\u201d The only material variation in the two bequests is, \u201cthat in the latter instance, the legacy was charged upon <em>Philip Vanderbergh, </em>in respect to the real estate to him devised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In the case now under review, <em>John Spickler, </em>the testator, by his will, in the eleventh clause, gives to his son <em>Marlin, </em>and his daughter <em>Elizabeth, </em>the sum of one hundred and eighty dollars, to be paid to them five years after his death, and ninety dollars to each of them, seven years after his death; and so on, ninety dollars each, every alternate year, until his daughter <em>Polly </em>shall have received nineteen hundred dollars. By the twelfth clause, he gives to <em>Martin </em>and <em>Elizabeth </em>each, the interest of fifteen hundred dollars annually, from the death of the testator, until the death of the respective legatees. Can it be imagined, that legacies differing so essentially, as to time of payment, mode of payment, and amount to be paid, were intended by tlxe testator to constitute but one legacy to each of these legatees? Or, can it be gravely contended, that this case falls within the rule which <em>C. Kent </em>states, has the sanction of the numerous cases referred to in his opinion? <em>Roper, </em>in his treatise on legacies, on the authority of <em>Windham </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>vs. Windham, Finch R., </em>267, and <em>Curry against Pile, </em>2 <em>Bro. C. C., </em>225, announces it to be law, that \u201cwhen the legacies given by the same testamentary instrument, to the same person, are of different amounts, the legacy shall be considered accumulative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\"><em>Mr. Justice Aston, </em>in his opinion in <em>Hooley vs. Hatton, </em>reported in a note to the case of <em>Ridges vs. Robinson and others, </em>1 <em>Bro. Ch. Cos., </em>389, where the Lord Chancellor says, the very able opinion of <em>Mr. Justice Aston </em>contains the whole doctrine of the law upon the subject. In that opinion <em>Mr. J. Aston </em>asserts, \u201cthat the law seems to be, and the authorities only go to prove the legacy not to be double, where it is given for the same cause, in the same act, and <em>totidem verbis, </em>or only with small difference.\u201d The same judge, in the same case, uses this expression, \u201cas to a larger sum, after a less, <em>Ricard, </em>421, <em>folio edition, </em>says, where they are in the same instrument, the two sums are not blended, but the legatee has two legacies, and the heir must show, that the one was intended to be blended with the other, the presumption being in favor of what is written.\u201d Decree affirmed without costs, and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">DECREE AFFIRMED AND CAUSE REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
