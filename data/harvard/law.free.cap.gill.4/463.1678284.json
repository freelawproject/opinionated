Brawner </em>and <em>Mary C., his wife, </em>alleged: that the said <em>Mary C. </em>while an infant, and so young as to be entirely incapable to understand in a proper manner, any matters of business appertaining to sale of real estate, and entirely unacquainted with the value of land, and being also without a guardian, was induced, during her minority as aforesaid, by representations made to her by a certain <em>Francis E. Dunnington </em>and others, to agree, that the said <em>F. E. D. </em>should make sale of her interest in said land; that said <em>F. E. D. </em>did sell at private sale said land <em>to </em>a certain <em>George Dunnington, </em>his son; and said <em>G. D. </em>afterwards resold the said land to the said <em>Elkanah Franklin, </em>mentioned in said bill. That said <em>G. D. </em>at the time of the sale of the said land by him to the said <em>E. F., </em>reserved to himself the privilege and right of cutting, and carrying away and disposing of, as he thought proper, all the wood upon said land; selling to said <em>F. </em>the soil alone, and reserving to his own use, the whole of the wood and timber then upon the land. That the said <em>Mary C. </em>received, or the said <em>Bennet Dyson, </em>for her use, from the said <em>F. E. D., </em>the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, for her interest in said land. That said <em>Mary C., </em>while an infant, as aforesaid, signed the bond made a part of complainant\u2019s bill; although so young at the time, and unacquainted with such transactions, as to be entirely ignorant of the character of the instrument she was signing. That these defendants have understood and believe, that said bond remained in the possession of said <em>Francis E. </em>or <em>George Dunnington, </em>up to the time of the institution of the ejectment suit mentioned in said bill; and although said bond was given and executed to <em>E. F. </em>by name, the said <em>Mary C. </em>had no transaction about said sale or land with the said <em>E. F., </em>the whole matter, as far as she was concerned, being transacted with the said <em>F. E.; </em>that the said tract of land, while in the possession of the said <em>Mary O., </em>tenant as aforesaid, and before the sale thereof was made, as aforesaid, was heavily wooded; and that the chief value of said land consisted in the large quantity of wood and timber upon it; that said land lies very near, or borders on the <em>Potomac River, </em>and is very convenient to ship wood to the market of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the <em>District of Columbia; </em>that the said land thus covered with wood, was chiefly valuable on account of the wood thereon; that the interest of said <em>Mary C. </em>in said land, was worth a great \u25a0deal more than the sum received by her, while the land was covered with wood. That the said <em>G. D. </em>in accordance with the right he reserved to himself, at the time of the sale by him to said Franklin, has cut and carried away the greater part of the wood from said land; and these defendants have been informed and believe, that he is still engaged in cutting and carrying away the residue of the said wood still remaining upon the said land; that the value of the wood thus cut and carried away by said <em>G. D. </em>is much more than the whole amount received by said <em>Mary C., </em>and her sister, <em>Margaret F., </em>for their interest in said land. <em>That said E. F. knew^ at the time </em>he purchased said land from said <em>D., </em>that said <em>Mary C. </em>was an infant, and incapable to execute a valid deed; and that said <em>Dunnington </em>had purchased said land, or her interest therein, from said <em>Mary </em>Cwhile an infant, as aforesaid; that these defendants would be willing to refund the $250, received by the said <em>Mary C. </em>if the said land could be restored to them in the same state that it was at the time said <em>Mary C, </em>was induced to consent to the sale aforesaid; but they are not willing to pay back the $250, and take the land as it now stands, since all that made the land valuable, the wood and timber, <em>has </em>been taken off said land. These defendants therefore consider that advantage was taken of the infancy and inexperience of said <em>Mary C., </em>in inducing her to consent to the sale of said land for much less than its real value, and much less than said land would have brought, if put up at public sale, at a time when she was ignorant of the value of said land; and that a large profit was made upon the resale of said land; all which is against equity, and which operated as a fraud upon said <em>Mary G.; </em>that said <em>Mary G. </em>at the time of the sale, as aforesaid, was an infant, and under the age of twenty-one years, that is to say, of the age of seventeen years, or thereabouts; ail which premises these respondents plead, and rely on, as a sufficient bar and answer to the said complainants bill; and they pray that the injunction be dissolved, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>The answer of <em>Bennett Dyson </em>alleged, that the said <em>Mary C., </em>while an infant as aforesaid, was induced, principally by the representations of a certain <em>Francis E.

That this respondent knew nothing of the value of said land at the time of the sale as aforesaid; but supposed from the representations of said <em>jFrancis E. </em>and others, that it would be advantageous to the said <em>Mary C. </em>and <em>Margaret F. </em>that said land should be sold, and he was thereby induced to sign said bond as security, as aforesaid, and as, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">Upon the bill and answers, the defendants, <em>Brawner and wife, </em>moved the county court to dissolve the injunction, and dismiss the complainant\u2019s bill, which that court refused to do; and they appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b476-6\">The cause was argued before Dorsey, Spence and Martin, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-7\">By J.

No executory contract, by him, <em>bona </em>fide, entered into, during his minority \u2014 unless confirmed by him after arriving at years of maturity \u2014 can be decreed to be specifically performed, by a court of equity; or enforced, in a court of law. Nor, in the absence of such confirmation, when pursuing his legal rights, in contravention of such contract, can he be restrained from so doing, by a court of equity interposing a prohibition, by way of injunction. Such an interference, to restrain the violation of a contract, is only warranted, where the contract is susceptible of enforcement in a court of law; or in a court of equity. In the case before us, neither the contract, as disclosed by the bill, or as shewn by the bill and the answer of <em>Brawner and wife, </em>when opposed, as it is, by the defence of infancy, can be of any avail to the complainants, either at law or in equity. It would thence seem to follow, that the injunction, which has issued, ought to be dissolved; and that the bill should be dismissed: no equity appearing, to entitle the complainants to the relief they have sought. But it is insisted, that although the right to a specific performance cannot be established, nor a continuance of the injunction be granted, as ancillary thereto, yet, that the injunction to stay proceedings at law, ought to be continued, until the purchase money paid for the land has been repaid by <em>Brawner and wife. </em>In support of such a position, no sufficient authority has been referred to: and it is believed that none can be found. It would be at war with the whole theory of the law, as respects the invalidity of contracts by infants. The law imputes to an infant, an incapacity to assume responsibilities, or incur debts, unless it be for necessaries; and denies to him a legal capacity to borrow money, because he is incompetent to make of it, an advantageous or judicious application. But establish the doctrine now contended for, and what is the necessary result? Why, that the whole policy of the law, as to infantile incompetency to sell, waste, and dispose of their property and estates, is frustrated and anni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Mated: the alleged guardianship and protection thrown around them by the law, is a mere mockery, existing but in name. An infant may sell his patrimonial estate; prodigally waste the purchase money, in extravagance, gambling, and dissipation; and if, when arrived at years of maturity and discretion, he dis-affirm the contract, and sues at law for the recovery of his property, a court of equity will, by injunction, arrest the arm of the law, and say to him, before you shall further assert your claim to your estate, you must repay to the purchaser all the money you have received from him. And, upon the same principle, an infant who borrows money, and mortgages his estate to secure its repayment, and after arriving at full age, and disaffirming his act, seeks at law the reclamation of his property, in chancery he will be enjoined fiom all other further proceedings at law, in the assertion of his rights. And if there be reason, consistency or justice in the proceedings of a court of equity, whenever he, who when in infancy has contracted a debt, and being sued for it at law, sets up infancy as a defence to the action, a court of equity should interpose by way of injunction, and prohibit his thus defending himself, until he has restored to his creditor, that which he received as the consideration of his indebtedness. Under such a system of equity jurisprudence as this, the only difference between an adult, and an infant mortgagor, seeking a redemption of their property, is this, the former goes into chancery, voluntarily, as a complainant; the latter is dragged in, compulsorily, as a defendant. When there, the protection and relief extended to each, is substantially the same. To such a repudiation of all material discrimination, between the contracts of infants and adults, this court is not prepared to subscribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">In reviewing the decisions upon the subject, <em>Justice Story </em>appears to have arrived at correct results. In page 26, section 42, of <em>Story on Contracts, </em>he states, that \u201cthe true rule seems to be, that when articles are furnished to the infant, which do not come within the definition of <em>\u2018 </em>necessaries,\u2019 and which are consumed or parted with; or when money is lent, which is expended by the infant; that the other party has no remedy to recover an equivalent for the goods, or the money: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>the specific consideration given by him, being parted with, or <em>not </em>being capable <em>of </em>return. But wherever that specific consideration, whatever it be, exists, and remains in the hands of the infant at the time of his disaffirmance of the contract, and is capable of return, the infant is bound to give it up; and he is treated as a trustee of the other party, if the contract be made originally in good faith. The ground of such a distinction is, that in the first case, the goods or money cannot be returned; and to make the infant liable therefor, in damages, merely because they had been used by him, would be to deprive him of his privilege of affirming, or avoiding, his contract.\u201d And in page 27, section 43, of the same book, it is stated, that \u201cevery person deals with an infant at arms length, at his own risk, and with a party for whom the law has a j ealous watchfulness. \u2019 \u2019 But. although an adult cannot enforce an executory contract, upon which, he has advanced the consideration, nor recover it in an action of assumpsit, where the specific and identical consideration has been parted with by the infant; yet this rule operates in some measure reciprocally; for if the infant have already advanced money upon a contract, which is executory on the part of the adult, he cannot, disaffirm it, and sue the other party for the advance, whenever it was paid on a valuable consideration, which has been partially enjoined; and especially, if he had received the benefits of his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The complainants, by the statements in their bill, having failed to shew themselves entitled <em>to </em>an injunction, or any equitable relief whatever; and the defectiveness of their bill being wholly unaided by the admissions in the answer of <em>Brawner and wife, </em>the court, below might, have granted the motion of the appellants to dissolve the injunction, and dismiss the bill filed by the appellees, without giving to them any serious cause of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">That the answer of the co-defendant, <em>Dyson, </em>is no evidence against <em>Braioner and wife, </em>is so conclusively settled by repeated adjudications of this court, that it is unnecessary to refer to them in the decision of such a question. This court, therefore, might content itself with a simple reversal of the decision of the court below, and passing a decree dissolving the injunction, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>dismissing the bill of complaint. But seeing from the answer, that if the case be remanded to the county court, the complainants may, by an amended bill, possibly, nay, probably, shew themselves entitled to an injunction against <em>Brawner and wife, </em>to stay their proceedings at law, during the life of <em>William H. Brawner, </em>this court will sign a decree reversing the decision of the county court, and dissolving the injunction; and remanding the case to the county court as a court of equity, that such further proceedings may be had therein, by way of amendment, or otherwise, as may be necessary to prepare the case for a final decree upon its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND CAUSE REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
