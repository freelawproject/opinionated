At the trial of this cause, the plaintiffs, in support of the issues joined on their part, offered to prove by <em>William B. tSasscer, </em>that the note on which this suit is brought, was made by the firm of <em>Wall Sasscer, </em>the witness, and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>Sam\u2019l T. Wall, </em>being the members of said firm; and that the said note was endorsed by the defendant. But the defendant objected to the testimony of said witness, on the ground that he was one of the makers of the said note, and incompetent as a witness to charge the defendant. The court, (Magbuder, C. J.,) overruled this objection, and permitted the testimony of said witness to go to the jury. The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-5\">2nd Exception. In addition to the testimony contained in the preceding exception, and which is, by agreement, made part of this, the plaintiffs, to prove that the said note had been duly presented for payment to the makers, and that notice of demand and non-payment was duly given to the defendant, offered in evidence the note and protest aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\">And further proved by the said <em>William B. Sasscer, </em>that the defendant, in the spring or summer of the year 1842, requested him, if he had any business with him, the defendant, to address him by letter at <em>Upper Marlborough, </em>and his letters would be sent to him, when he could not call for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">The defendant then proved, that at the time that the said note became due, he resided within a few miles of the <em>Long Old Fields, </em>where a post office was kept; and that <em>Upper Marlborough </em>was four miles further from the residence of the defendant, than the post office at the <em>Long Old Fields.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-8\">The plaintiffs then proved by competent testimony, that <em>Upper Marlborough, </em>the place to which the defendant directed that his letters on business from said <em>Wm.

In addition to the evidence contained in the preceding exceptions, which, by agreement, is made part of this, the defendant proved, that the partnership of <em>Wall &amp;f Sasscer </em>was dissolved in March 1842; that public notice thereof was given in the <em>National Intelligencer, </em>a paper published in <em>Washington, </em>in the <em>District of Columbia, </em>and that the settlement of the partnership concerns devolved on the said <em>William B. Sasscer, </em>who continued to reside in the city of <em>Washington, </em>where the note was made, until after December, in the year 1842. The plaintiffs then proved, that they do now reside, and did reside, in the city of Baltimore, in <em>Maryland, </em>during the whole of the year 1842; and thereupon the defendant prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they find from the evidence, that the partnership was dissolved at the time the said note became due, that public notice was given, as aforesaid, of said dissolution, that the settlement of the business of the firm devolved on the said <em>William B. Sasscer, </em>that he resided in <em>Washington </em>when the note became due, and that the demand was made on <em>Wall </em>alone, that the plaintiffs have failed to prove such a demand and notice to the endorser as entitle them to recover, and their verdict must be for the defendant.

And thereupon the defendant insisted, that the said <em>Sassce?' </em>was incompetent as a witness in this cause, for the plaintiff, because he was interested in pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>curing a judgment against the defendant in this cause; as he was liable to the plaintiffs on the judgment against him; and if he were made to pay the same, he would be entitled to an assignment of the judgment against the defendant, obtained in this cause.

To which opinion of the court, and the refusal of the court to exclude the testimony of said <em>Sasscer, </em>the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-5\">6th Exception. Upon all the testimony in the preceding exceptions, which, by agreement, is made part of this, the defendants insisted, that the plaintiffs could not recover under the pleadings in this cause, because of a variance between the declaration and the proof, in this, that the declaration does not state the note to have been made at <em>Washington </em>city, to wit, at the county aforesaid, and does not aver, that the presentment and demand of payment of the maker, was made in <em>Washington </em>city, to wit, at the county aforesaid. And also, in this, that the presentment and demand is alleged to have been made of Wall <em>\u00a7' Sasscer, </em>whereas no demand is proved to have been made of said <em>Sasscer, </em>but of <em>Wall </em>alone, after the said partnership was dissolved; and prayed the court to instruct the jury accordingly; but the court, (Magruder, C.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALo\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">This, (No. 10, the first appeal,) is a suit by the endorsee of a note against the endorser and payee, and the question arising on the first bill of exceptions is, whether the maker of the note is a competent witness for tire plaintiff, to prove the execution of the note by himself an\u2019d partner, as makers, and the endorsement by the defendant? The witness was answerable, in any possible event of the suit, for the amount of the note, and could therefore have ho interest in its event. He may, indeed, be considered as testifying against his interest, for if the plaintiff should recover, he would he answerable to the defendant for the costs of this suit. It has accordingly been often adjudged, that in the like circumstances the maker of a note is a competent witness. 1 <em>Greenl. Ev., </em>430, <em>note </em>2, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The only question raised in the second exception is, whether the protest offered, was evidence' to prove demand and notice?</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">By the act of 183?, ch. 253, relating to promissory notes and bills' of exchange, a protest by a notary public, duly made, shall <em>ha prima facie </em>evidence, in the case of inland and foreign bills, of non-payment or non-acceptance, and of presentment for payment and acceptance, at the time and in the manner stated in tlie protest; and the act further declares, that when such protest shall state, that notice of such non-payment or non-acceptance has been sent or delivered to the party or parties to such note or' bill, and the manner of such notice, such protest shall b <em>a prima facie </em>evidence, that such notice has been sent or delivered in the manner therein stated. The design of this act of the legislature, as to the mode of proof, of demand and notice, was to place for'eign and inland bills upon the same footing, and as regarded inland bills and notes, to dispense with the necessity of adducing oral proof of demand and notice, by substituting therefor the protest of the notary, duly made. And as in the case of foreign hills, the protest of a notary, duly authenticated by his seal, was, before the act, received as proof of these facts, we should not be carrying out the intention of the law makers, unless we also received the certificate of the notary, authenticated by his seal, as proof of the demand and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>notice stated therein. The act, in its terms, is too imperative to admit of any doubt. When the protest, or an authenticated copy thereof, is offered in evidence, it must be received on the footing of the <em>lex fori, </em>2 <em>Hill N. </em>Y. <em>Rep., </em>230; and the only enquiry, therefore, would seem to be, whether the protest has been duly made? This enquiry involves two considerations, its form, and its mode of authentication. To its form, no available objections could be urged; in substance, it states a demand on the drawer, and notice of non-payment. As to its mode of authentication, it is sufficient that we can perceive a seal to be attached thereto. No proof is necessary, that the seal attached is the notary\u2019s seal, or that the handwriting signed thereto, is the proper signature of the notary. Much ingenious reasoning has been urged before the court, to establish the invalidity of the protest, offered in evidence, upon the ground, that the seal of the notary does not contain the inscriptions pointed out by the act of 1801, ch. 86, sec. 7. Without determining whether this would be important or necessary, had the protest been made by an officer of this State, it is only necessary to say, that the protest was made beyond the limits of the State, by a notary, in no manner bound to provide a seal of the peculiar designation, which might be required for our own officers. In 2 <em>Hill, </em>228, the certificate of the notary was rejected, because it had, according to the common law, no seal attached to it, and because there was no proof of the law of the State where the protest was made, that it was sufficiently authenticated. But we could not reject this protest upon the ground urged, without, at the same time, subjecting all protests, wheresoever made, of even foreign bills, to the same rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">But it is further urged, that the protest is inadmissible and insufficient to prove demand and notice, upon the ground that notice was not sent to the defendant at his nearest post office. The notice was sent to <em>Upper Marlborough, </em>to which office it is in proof, that the defendant had directed the witness to send him letters; at which place, it is proven, he had an agent, who would deliver letters there ariving to him. It is also proven, that he received several letters at a post office four miles nearer his residence. The defendant had, therefore, from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>proof, two post offices, to either of which it would have been sufficient to have sent the notice of protest; he could not say that due diligence had not been, used, when letters were sent to the post office where the defendant had directed letters from his copartner to be sent, and from which direction, it is reasonable to presume, he would, having an agent in the town, more readily and speedily receive them, than if sent to the post office nearest to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The third exception raises the question, whether a demand ought to have been made on both the drawers of the note, who were partners, and who had dissolved their partnership, and given notice of such dissolution in a paper printed in the city of <em>Washington 9 </em>It might be sufficient to say, that this dissolution had, by no evidence in the cause, been brought home to the knowledge of the holder of the note. But we do not desire to determine the question on this ground, because we are clearly of opinion, that a demand on one of the partners was sufficient, as each partner represents the partnership. Before a dissolution, it clearly would not be necessary to make a demand on both; <em>Story Prom. No., </em>285, nor could it be necessary after a dissolution, as the partnership, as to all antecedent transactions, continues until they are closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The above views dispose of all the questions presented for our consideration in the appeal No. 10, and in No. 6, the second appeal; except the questions arising on the fifth and sixth exceptions in No. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">We cannot perceive that the introduction of the agreement, between <em>Sasscer, Wall, Dixon </em>and <em>Crowley, </em>into the case, (by which the latter undertook to pay certain liabilities of <em>Sasscer </em>and <em>Wall, </em>among the rest the note in controversy,) should exclude <em>Sasscer </em>from being a witness. If <em>Sasscer </em>was compelled to pay the amount of the note, his remedy against <em>Crowley, </em>the defendant, would be by an action on the agreement, just adverted to. By paying the judgment, the witness would not be entitled to an assignment of the judgment, as his relation to the plaintiff in such judgment was that of a principal, and not a security for <em>Crowley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The only variance alleged in the sixth exception, to which we need advert, is, that the nar alleges the note upon which the suit was brought, to have been \u201cmade at the county aforesaid,\u201d when the note shows, that it bore date at the city of <em>Washington; </em>and it is insisted, that the declaration should have averred, that the note \u201cwas made at the city of <em>Washington, </em>to wit, at the county aforesaid.\u201d In <em>Robert vs. Harnage, 2 Lord Ray, </em>1043, a bond dated at <em>Fort St. Davids, </em>in the <em>East Indies, </em>was declared upon as a bond made at <em>London. </em>It was decided, that there was a variance. The same decision was made in <em>Mostyn vs. Fabrigas, Cowp., </em>176. These decisions appear to have been followed in <em>New York </em>and <em>Massachusetts. </em>13 <em>John. Rep., </em>450. 5 <em>Pick., </em>412. There have, however, been contradictory decisions. In <em>Houriet, et al., vs. Morris, </em>3 <em>Campb., </em>303, it was decided, that the contract evidenced by a promissory note is transitory, and the place where it purports to be made is immaterial, and it was held to be no variance; and the same doctrine is laid down in 1 <em>Stephen's N. P., </em>773, 774. But that when the place of payment was stated in the body of the note, it made a material part of the instrument. <em>Roche vs. Campb., </em>3 <em>Camp. N. P., </em>248. <em>Chitty, </em>in his forms of pleading, adopts the doctrine of <em>Lord Ellenborough, </em>and his forms conform to those decisions. 2 <em>Chitty's Plead., </em>115, 116, 117, 118; 9 <em>Am. Ed. </em>In <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>582, <em>9th American edition, </em>the decision in <em>3rd Camp, </em>is referred to; and it is there said, that inland bills, although they bear date at a particular place, may be alleged to have been made anywhere in <em>England </em>or <em>Wales. Bailey on Bills, </em>380, is cited by <em>Chitty </em>for this position. In bills drawn and payable in countries where the currency differs from our own, there is much reason for maintaining, that it was necessary to aver the place where the bill was drawn; accordingly, it has been decided, that where a bill was drawn in <em>Dublin </em>in <em>Ireland, </em>for <em>Irish </em>currency, and the declaration stated, that the bill was drawn at <em>Dublin, </em>to wit, at <em>Westminster, &amp;c., </em>without alleging that <em>Dublin </em>was in <em>Ireland, </em>nor stating the bill to be for <em>Irish </em>currency, there was a variance, inasmuch as the bill must be taken to be drawn for <em>English </em>currency. 2 <em>Barr, and Ald., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>301. But <em>Mr. Chitty </em>intimates, that a different decision might be made since the act assimilating the currency between <em>Great Britain </em>and <em>Ireland. </em>1 <em>Chit. Plead., 581.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In this conflict of authority, we feel ourselves justified in adopting as a rule, that authority which occurs to us as the most reasonable. In 13 <em>John., </em>450, although the court say, they might feel themselves bound by the cases, yet they intimate that their opinions were against the position, that such an allegation was a variance. The place where a note is dated is clearly immaterial; and if it be conceded, that in inland bills, no matter where dated, the allegation may be made, that such bill was made in any county where the suit is brought, it is difficult to perceive a reason, why in a foreign bill the same principle should not prevail, unless in consequence of the difference of currency between the currency of the country where the bill is drawn, and where it is sued upon, should render the true statement of the date necessary, to avoid a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We arc of opinion, there is no variance, and believe the court below were right in their decision on the sixth bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The result of the above views is, that the decision of the court, in both appeals, should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
