In 1840, <em>B </em>applied for relief under the insolvent laws. He executed a deed of all his property to <em>M, </em>under that application; but omitted in his schedule of effects to take any notice of rent due him on account of a parcel of land conveyed to <em>P </em>and <em>Y. </em>In 1842, an attachment in virtue of a judgment recovered against <em>B, </em>in 1839, was laid in the hands of the appellee, at the suit of the appellant. The garnishee admitted a balance of rent duo <em>B, </em>arising out of grain grown upon the lands in question, but did not state when he had rented, or when the rent became due. Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AMN\">1.

Price </em>and <em>David G. Yost, </em>on the 11th day of October 1839, for certain real estate situate in <em>'Washington </em>county; and that on the 12th day of May 1840, he, the said <em>Barnes, </em>applied for the benefit of the insolvent laws of <em>Maryland, </em>and on the said last mentioned day, executed the deed of trust also offered in evidence to his insolvent trustee; and that at the time of said application, he returned the schedule of his property, which is also offered in evidence, then all the interest and estate which the said <em>Barnes </em>reserved, by and under said deed of trust, was mentioned and included in said schedule within, to the true intent and meaning of the act of Assembly in such case made and provided; that said interest is not subject to the attachment issued in this case, and that their verdict must be for the defendant, which said instruction the court gave; to which said decisions of the court respectively:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-7\">1st.

Mason </em>was appointed trustee, for the benefit of the creditors of the said <em>Abraham Barnes. </em>The record shews, that the trustee gave bond, and the petitioner executed a deed to him, for all his estate, real, personal and \u00a1nixed, for the benefit of his creditors, on the 12th day of May 1840; and at the same time gave a schedule of his property as follows: \u201cone-seventh of one thousand acres of land in <em>Western Virginia; </em>one-seventh of ten or twelve lots in <em>Washington </em>city; and the reversionary interest in a deed of trust, executed to <em>William Price </em>and <em>David G. Yost, </em>on the 11th of October 1839.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The attachment in this case was issued on the 6th day of August 1842; and the sheriff, in his return, certifies, \u201cthat on the 16th day of August 1842, he attached, of the goods and chattels, rights and credits, of <em>Abraham Barnes, </em>in the hands of <em>Michael Seibert, </em>the sum of money, with interest and costs, for the use of the within named <em>Da,vid Hupe, </em>use of <em>C. D. </em>and <em>J. Slingluff; </em>and that he made known to the said <em>Michael </em>Seibert,\u201d &amp;c. At the return of the writ of attachment, <em>Seibert, </em>the garnishee, appeared, by his attorney, to whom the plaintiff exhibited interrogatories, to which Seibert, the garnishee, filed the following answer: \u201cto the first interrogatory, this garnishee answers and says, that at the time the said attachment was laid in his hands, he had rented a portion of the <em>Montpelier </em>lands, which had been conveyed by said <em>Barnes and others </em>to trustees, and that the following portions of the crop, raised on said lands, and to which the said <em>Barnes </em>was entitled, were in the hands of this garnishee,\u201d a balance due for wheat, com, and oats, of $301.77.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>At the trial of this cause, the defendant, to maintain the issues on his part, offered in evidence the insolvent papers of A. Barnes, and among them the schedule and deed of <em>A. Barnes, </em>the petitioner, to <em>J. T. Mason, </em>his trustee. To the admissibility of which instruments the plaintiff objected, but the court overruled the objection, and the same was given to the jury, as admissible and competent evidence in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">This judgment of the court raises the first question under the exceptions in this cause. It was indispensable on the part of the defendant, in order to maintain the issues on his part, to shew, that <em>A. Barnes </em>had been discharged under the insolvent laws of <em>Maryland; </em>and under the provisions of the act of 1827, chap. 70, sec. 1, it is expressly provided, that no county court, judge of a county court,-or justice of an orphans court, shall grant a personal discharge under an application for the benefit of the insolvent laws of this State, until such applicant shall execute to his trustee a good and sufficient deed of conveyance for all his estate, real, personal and mixed, (except wearing apparel, &amp;c.,) and until the trustee, so appointed, shall certify in writing to the said county court, judge or justice, as the case may be, that <em>he </em>is in possession of all the estate <em>of </em>the applicant, mentioned in his schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Under this act of Assembly, the deed and schedule were admissible to shew the conveyance to his trustee. The insolvent\u2019s deed was, unquestionably, admissible evidence, and the schedule, and other insolvent papers, were necessary to lay a foundation for the introduction of the deed. The deed was evidence, whether the grain or credits attached, were named and described in the deed and schedule, or not, for by (he deed all the estate, real, personal and mixed, of the petitioner, passed to the trustee, and his title -was good against all the world, except a creditor under the act of 1827, chap. 70, sec. <em>7; </em>and if the grain was grown, or the credit accrued, subsequent to the date of the insolvent\u2019s deed, it was the grain, or debt of the trustee, because it was the produce of his interest in the land under the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The instruction asked by the plaintiff\u2019s second prayer, presented, according to the case made by the record, an irrelevant and abstract proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>It does not appear from the proceedings, that the attachment was laid upon any lands, or interest in land, which belonged to <em>Barnes, </em>the debtor, or that any such right or interest was attached. The sheriff\u2019s return to <em>the </em>attachment is, that he had attached in the hands of <em>Michael Seibert </em>goods and chattels, rights and credits, of <em>A. Barnes, </em>the sum of money, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">It certainly is no easy task to determine satisfactorily from the garnishee\u2019s answer, whether he had in his hands the grain mentioned, or owed <em>Barnes the </em>sum mentioned, the proceeds of the grain; neither is it important. It certainly was not land, or any interest in the lands, reserved to <em>Barnes </em>under the deed of the 11th October 1839.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">If this grain, or the debt due for the grain, accrued to <em>Barnes </em>before he executed the deed of the 11th of May 1840, it was not mentioned and included in his schedule, and was, therefore, under the act of 1827, chap. 70, sec. 7, liable to the attachment. But if the grain, or any part of it, was grown on the lands in which <em>Barnes </em>reserved the usufructuary interest, subsequent to the date of said deed, then the grain, or such part of it as was made or grown, subsequent to the date of said deed, or the proceeds thereof, were not subject to the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">There is no evidence iri the record which shews when the grain was made or grown. It is admitted, that the increment accrued subsequent to the deed to <em>Price </em>and <em>Yost, </em>but it is not stated, whether before or after the deed to <em>Mason, </em>the insolvent\u2019s trustee, and as this was a question which should have been left to the jury, the court erred in taking it from them, by instructing them that they must find a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">JUDGMENT' REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
