The rule-days to plead were the first Mondays of March and November. The declaration was filed on the first Monday of February. Before the March rule.day, the defendant\u2019s counsel called at the clerk\u2019s office, examined the papers of the cause, and remarked, there was yet time enough to plead limitations. At the March term, the defendant obtained a rule nisi, to strike out the bail and appearance, upon the ground, that they had been erroneously entered, as he had not offered bail, nor appeared to the'cause. The county court discharged the rule, and no motion being made, or plea offered, by the defendant, entered up judgment upon the cause of action, a promissory note of the defendants. Held, that the defendant, under the circumstances, had recognized the entry of bail and appearance, and as he was- not precluded from pleading to the merits, the rule was properly discharged.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b314-10\">It was the duty of the defendant to have appeared at the return of the writ, and to enforce the rule, would be to let the amercement against the sheriff stand, and enable the defendant to plead limitations; The refusal of the rule, deprived the defendant of no meritorious defence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b314-11\">Under the act of 1825, ch. 117, this court cannot reverse the judgment of the county court, except upon a point decided by the court below, and as no motion was made to that court in relation to it, nor its attention called thereto, no question affecting it is open here for review, even if it were erroneous.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Appeal from <em>Washington </em>county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-5\">This was an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>commenced on the 12th November 1844, by the appellee against the appellants and <em>'David Shovman. </em>The latter was not taken.

E. S. </em>appeared in open court, and offered to become special bail for <em>J. S., </em>one of the above named defendants in said suit; but, at the suggestion of this deponent, he, the said <em>T. E. IS., </em>consented to become, and did become, the special bail of both said defendants in said case, as this deponent believes, and as the record shows; and that if he had become the special bail of but one of said defendants, as is alleged, it would have been so specifically entered. And this deponent further makes oath, that some time after the close of the November term aforesaid, and before the first Monday of March then next, <em>Robert M. Tidball, Esq., </em>came into the clerk\u2019s office, and asked to be shewn the papers in the above case, and after looking at them, and making enquiry as to the rule-day for filing pleas, he handed the papers back to this deponent, or laid them down, remarking, that there was yet time enough, and left the office. That after the lapse of some further time, <em>Mr. Tidball </em>came again into the clerk\u2019s office, and asked for the same papers, stating at the time his intentions to file a plea of the statute of limitations in this case for <em>Mr. Kershner, </em>when this deponent suggested to him, that the rule day for filing pleas had passed, it being then after the said first Monday of March, and showed him the rules of court, of which he made some complaint about their having been changed. That in this case, the nar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>was filed on the first Monday of February, and that the rule-day for pleas, was the first Monday of March; and that said <em>Tidlall </em>was shown the papers in this case, as above stated, before the first Monday of March. And this deponent also remembers, that <em>G. A. B., </em>one of the deponents in this case, appeared in court, at the said November term,.and offered to become the special bail of <em>J K., </em>at the suit of the <em>H.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aa22\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In the court below, application was made by the defendant, <em>Kershner, </em>at the trial term, to strike out the entry of special bail and appearance, for him, upon the ground, that the special bail was for <em>Schleigh </em>alone, and that the defendant, <em>Kershner, </em>had not given bail, in point of fact, or authorised an attorney to appear for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The declaration had been filed, and by the rules of <em>Washington </em>county court, the rule-day to plead had passed; but it was in the power of the defendant, to have pleaded to the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The motion to rectify the proceedings, is not on behalf of the bail, but on behalf of the defendant, who alleges, that the special bail, and the appearance of an attorney, have been entered for him, without his authority; and he insists, that he possesses the right, to have the entries of bail and appearance stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The consequences arising from a gratification of the defendant\u2019s motion, would be an amercement of the sheriff for his failure to appear; and if he did afterwards appear, to let him in to plead any plea to the action, whether to the merits or not. The injury he has sustained, if the facts be true, is, that he is precluded from pleading any dilatory plea; or any plea which is not to the merits of the action. But nothing had occurred at the time of the motion, which prevented him from pleading, whatever plea he might choose to plead, to the merits of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">No doubt, on the application of the proper party, and at the proper time, mistakes may be corrected; but it would be a dangerous exercise of power, to apply the principle to every case which might be presented. It would, no doubt, have been competent for the defendant, <em>Kershner, </em>notwithstanding the alleged mistake, subsequently, so far as he was concerned, to have sanctioned the entry of special bail; and we think he has done so in this case. Before the expiration of the rule-day, his attorney examined the papers in the cause, enquired of the clerk as to the rule-day for filing pleas, and receiving the information, remarked, it was yet time enough; and again, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>afterwards, asking the clerk for the same papers, declared his intention to file the plea of limitations. In this there is a full recognition, that bail had been properly entered, or there would have existed no right to plead to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">To this portion of the evidence we are disposed to give the greater weight in the case before us, because it was the duty of the defendant to have appeared at the return of the writ, and to have entered bail and appearance; because the gratification of his motion would occasion the amercement of the sheriff; would enable him to plead otherwise than to the merits of the case; and because, by the refusal of his motion, he could have been deprived of no meritorious defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">It is apparent from' the evidence, that the defendant had an opportunity to have availed himself of the plea of limitations, notwithstanding these entries. He knew that bail and appearance had been entered for him before the rule-day, as his attorney examined the papers before the rule-day; and if with this knowledge he has failed to avail himself of rights entirely within his power, and of which he has in no manner been deprived by the entries, of which he complains, he cannot expect the aid of this court, to relieve' him from the consequences of his own supineness.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">At March term 1845, this cause' stood regularly for trial, and was under rule-plea, when the rule to shew cause, above referred to, was laid; and on discharging the rule to shew cause, judgment, as for want of a plea, in the then state of the record, would have been properly rendered. That the judgment has not assumed the form of a judgment, <em>nil (licit, </em>is no doubt a clerical error. But whatever may be the character of the error in the judgment, as no motion was made to the court, or its attention in any manner called to the subject, we could not reverse the judgment: the act of 1825, chap. 117, prohibiting the reversal of any judgment, except upon a point decided by the court below. <em>Sasser and Walker's Exs., </em>5 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>102. <em>Boarman vs. Israel and Patterson's Ex., </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>381. We therefore affirm the judgment of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
