Wherefore, inasmuch as there is such variance between the writ aforesaid, and the declaration of the said plaintiff thereon, founded in the name and addition of the said plaintiff, and because there is manifest variance between the original writ aforesaid, and the declaration of the said plaintiff thereon founded, he, the said defendant, prays judgment of the said writ and declaration, and that the same be quashed,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-11\">The plaintiff then prayed, that the said plea be not received, but that the same be stricken out; which prayer was granted, upon the ground that the defendant having failed to plead said plea in abatement heretofore in proper time, and having pleaded the general issue plea, it was now too late for said plea in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>abatement to be filed, and that the filing of said plea had been waived in legal contemplation, by the filing of said general issue plea.

To this opinion of the court, and their refusal to accept the general demurrer, so as aforesaid tendered by the defendant\u2019s counsel, the defendant again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">From these decisions, which constitute the 1st and 2nd exceptions, the defendants appealed, and then withdrew his plea of <em>non assumpsit, </em>and demurred generally to the plaintiff\u2019s declaration; the county court sustained the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">The plaintiff then moved for leave to amend her declaration, which was granted.

At the trial of this cause, the plaintifF to maintain the issues on her part joined, produced and offered to read in evidence to the jury the letters testamentary, granted to her by the orphans court of <em>Charles </em>county, as executrix of the last will and testament of the said <em>Thomas A. </em>Davis, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-6\">The defendant objected to the admissibility of said evidence, and insisted, that it was incumbent on the plaintiff, to enable her to recover in this action, to produce letters of administration on the personal estate of the said <em>Thomas A. Davis; </em>and prayed the court to instruct the jury, that they must find for the defendant, unless said letters of administration were produced, and that tire production of letters testamentary to the plaintiff on the estate of said <em>Thomas A. Davis, </em>was not sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict. The court, (Stephen, O. J., and Key, A. J.,) refused to grant said prayer, but were of opinion, and so instructed the jury, that the letters testamentary, so as aforesaid produced and offered to be read in evidence to the jury, were legally admissible to show the character in which the plaintiff sues in the present action; to which opinion of the court, and their instruction, the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-7\">4th Exception.

Wills, </em>a competent witness, that in 1816,1817, or 1818, the witness could not say which, <em>Samuel Chapman, </em>the defendant\u2019s intestate, applied to <em>John B. Wills, Sr., </em>the father of witness, for a loan of $1200, which he, the said <em>Chapman, </em>stated at the time to <em>John B. Wills, Sr., </em>he wanted to borrow for the use of the vestry of <em>Port Tobacco </em>church, and that he, <em>Chapman, </em>could give him an order on the vestry of said church; the father of witness replied, that he would lend him the money, but on a suggestion from the witness, that he had better not have to do with so many persons, said that he would lend him, <em>Chapman, </em>the money, but would have nothing to do with the vestry. <em>Chapman </em>then offered to give him security, and on his engagement to do so, the said contract of loan was consummated, and the money on a subsequent day paid to <em>Chapman, </em>and a note was drawn by the said <em>Chapman, </em>with a certain <em>William Morris, </em>as security. This note remained so for some time, until the year 1822, when the said <em>John B. Wills, Sr., </em>the obligee, required that the same should be renewed, or some other note substituted in the place of it; the witness was under the impression, that his father\u2019s motive in so requiring, was that he might include the interest due on said note in a new note; that accordingly the said <em>Chapman </em>called on witness, and asked him if he would become his surety, when witness replied, that he had better call on <em>Thomas A. Davis, </em>that he, the witness, did not wish to become surety for a debt due to his father. A short time after this, witness saw <em>Chapman, </em>and asked him whether he got <em>Davis </em>as his surety on the note or not, and <em>Chapman </em>replied lie had. The plaintiff also proved by <em>William </em>Morris, a competent witness, that he was the said <em>Chapman?s </em>security on the first note. The plaintiff also proved by <em>William Thompson, </em>a competent witness, that the plaintiff paid to him, as the administrator of <em>John B. Wills, Sr., </em>the sum of $1400.87, being the one-half of the judgment hereinbefore mentioned, for which he gave her a receipt; the plaintiff here rested her case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-5\">The defendant then proved to the jury, by the said <em>William 'Thompson, </em>that the one-half of said judgment had been paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>to him by the defendant, and the other half, being the sum of $1400.87, by the said plaintiff; and then the defendant, for the purpose of proving to the jury, that on or about the 29th of July 1815, the said <em>Samuel Chapman </em>and <em>Thomas A. Davis </em>were members of the vestry of <em>Port Tobacco </em>church, and that they continued members of said vestry from the 29th of July 1815, to the time of their signing the note or single bill, in 1822, to the said <em>John B. Wills, Sr., </em>so as aforesaid given in evidence to the jury by the plaintiff, offered parol proof, that the said <em>Davis </em>and <em>Chapman </em>were members of the said vestry in 1815, and remained so until the date of the said single bill, signed in 1822, so as aforesaid given in evidence to the plaintiff, and after; but the plaintiff, by her counsel, objected to the admissibility of said parol evidence, and insisted before the court, that the said facts could only be proved by a production of the record of the vestry, making said appointments of vestrymen, or on proof of their loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\">The plaintiff then proved by said witness, that in 1815, before and after <em>John Edelen, </em>late deceased, was the register of said church; and that there was an old r\u00e9cord of said church kept by the said register; that sometimes the proceedings of said vestry were written on separate pieces of paper; that he does not know whether the appointment of vestrymen of said church was entered on said record, or what proceedings were entered thereon; that he, the witness, was not the register, and did not keep the said record: he also proved, that <em>J. C. Layman </em>was the register after the said <em>John Edelen, </em>and that <em>A. Bateman </em>was register after <em>Mr. Layman </em>was, and is register of said church. And the court being of that opinion, rejected the said parol evidence, and refused to suffer it to go to the jury; to which opinion of the court, and on their refusal to suffer said parol evidence to go to the jury, the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-6\">The defendant then, for the purpose of letting in said parol evidence, proved to the juiy, by the testimony of <em>Walter Mitchell, </em>who administered on the estate of <em>John Edelen, </em>in conjunction with <em>Eleanor H. Edelen, </em>the widow of said <em>John, </em>and which said <em>John Edelen, </em>it was admitted, was the register <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>of said vestry in 1815; that uo record or other papers relating to the church or vestry of said <em>Port Tobacco </em>church, were found by him among the papers of his said intestate, but he had made no search for that purpose. And also proved by <em>Aquilla </em>Baieman, the present register of said vestry of the said church, who proved, that he had been and was register of the said vestry since 1826, and that he had made search and inquiries, but never of the register who preceded him, or their administrators, and cannot find, and never has seen or found any record of the proceedings of said vestry in 1815; \u2014 but has inquired of some of the vestry since he was register, \u2014 or any other record of the proceedings of said vestry, prior to the 12th of April 1819. The plaintiff objected to the admissibility of the testimony of the said <em>Mitchell </em>and <em>Baieman, </em>for the purposes aforesaid, of letting in the parol proof, and the court sustained the said objection by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and refused to permit the said parol testimony, or any part of it, to go to the jury aforesaid; to which opinion of the court, and to their refusal as aforesaid, to permit said evidence to go to the jury, for the purposes aforesaid, the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-5\">The defendant then offered in evidence to the court the following original paper, having first proved the handwriting of both the said <em>Davis </em>and <em>Chapman </em>thereto:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\">\u201cSaturday, July 29th, 1815.

And it is necessary to recur to the pleadings, for the purpose of understanding what was the predicament of the defendant below at the time he exhibited this plea in abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">It appears that the writ was issued on the 12th of March 1839. At the August term of the court in the same year, the plaintiff filed her declaration, to which the defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit. </em>The cause was continued, under a general imparlance, until the August term 1841, when leave was obtained by the plaintiff to amend her declaration. This leave was not exercised, and was withdrawn at the March term 1842. At this term, the defendant filed his first plea in abatement, which was rejected by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">At the same term, the defendant tendered a demurrer to the declaration, but which the court refused to receive, unless the general issue was withdrawn. This plea was accordingly withdrawn, and the demurrer renewed and sustained. The plaintiff then, upon leave, amended her declaration, and placed the defendant under a rule to plead. At this point of time, the defendant tendered to the court a plea in abatement, similar to the one which he had before exhibited, and to which the court again entered a <em>ne recipiatur. </em>The plea alleges, as matter in abatement, a variance between the writ and declaration, in this respect: That the plaintiff sued out her writ as administratrix of <em>Thomas A. </em>Davis, and has declared as his executrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">In this condition of the pleadings, the counsel for the appellee have contended, that this plea in abatement came too late, and that the county court committed therefore no error in re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>jecting it. This objection to the plea is, we think, properly taken, and must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In <em>Chamberlin against Hite, 5 Watts, </em>374, the court say: <em>\u201cA </em>plea in abatement cannot be put in after a general imparlance, and if the defendant wish to preserve his right to such plea, he must vary his form of prayer, by making it with the reservation of his right, and asking a special imparlance, which must be entered on the record. Nor can it be pleaded after a plea in bar, and if a plea in abatement is put in after a plea in bar, the plaintiff is not bound to reply to it. It ought to be pleaded within four days after the declaration has been delivered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In <em>Wilson against Hamilton, </em>4 <em>Sarg. &amp; Raw., </em>239, it is declared, that a plea in abatement can never be pleaded after a plea in bar, unless the matter has arisen since the plea in bar, in which case it may, provided it be done the first opportunity that is presented, for a plea in bar waives only matter in abatement, then existing. 1 <em>John. Cas., </em>101.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Passages from these cases have been selected, as containing a clear and distinct statement of the acknowledged principle, that when the party has, by the character of his pleading, waived all objections to the capacity of the plaintiff, or any other abateable matter, then existing, he cannot be allowed to resume the objection. As the variance which the defendant has presented as pleadable in abatement, existed equally between the writ and original declaration, and the writ and the amended declaration, the amendment of the nar, and the rule to plead anew, could not in this respect change the rights of the parties. The matter relied on in abatement existed at the period when the plea in bar was filed, and although the leave granted to plead <em>de novo, </em>gives to the defendant the right to plead any plea to the action which he may select, it does not confer the right to raise dilatory objections, of which the party was aware when he exhibited his plea in bar, and which he had thus surrendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The objection next taken to the validity of this plea, that it was pleaded without demanding oyer of the writ, is equally fatal. This was the established practice in the <em>English </em>courts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>and the right to plead in abatement, a variance between the writ and count, was therefore practically abolished, when <em>Lord </em>Mansfield, in the case of <em>Boats against Edwards, </em>in 1779, announced to the bar, that the practice, for the defendants to pray oyer of the original, which is so much used for delay, was not warranted by any principle of justice, and ought not to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In <em>Holt against Finch, </em>1 <em>Wil., </em>394, the court say: \u201cFormerly, when the whole original writ was spread in the same roll with the count, if a variance appeared between the writ and count, the defendant might take advantage thereof, either by motion in arrest of judgment, writ of error, plea in abatement, or demurrer. But afterwards it was determined, that if the defendant will take advantage of a variance between the writ and count, he must demand oyer of the writ, and shew it to the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">This practice appeal's to have been adopted in several of the <em>American </em>courts, where the first process is, as in <em>Maryland, </em>a <em>capias ad respondendum. </em>In the case of the <em>Bank of New Brunswick against Arrowsmith, </em>4 <em>Hals., </em>284, the Chief Justice, after having examined the learning on this branch of the law, says: \u201cFrom the view which has been taken of the practice in the court of <em>King's Bench, </em>to which the proceedings of this court have most nearly approached, and to which we have been accustomed to resort for precedent, when regulations of our own are wanting, it appears that at, and prior to the year 1776, oyer of the writ was constantly granted; and I am not aware that in this court the practice has since been abrogated or denied. The defendant may therefore avail himself of a variance between the writ and declaration, either by oyer and plea, as has been done in the present case, or by a motion to set aside the proceedings for irregularity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">In <em>Slocum against Slocum, </em>8 <em>Watts, </em>371, the court maintain the proposition, \u201cthat, a variance between <em>the writ </em>and the declaration, could only be taken advantage of by craving and obtaining oyer of the writ, and then pleading the variance in abatement.\u201d The same doctrine is distinctly announced in <em>Chirac against Reinecker, </em>11 <em>Wheal., </em>302, where the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Court declare, that if in any case a variance between the writ and declaration can be taken advantage of by the defendant, it is an established rule, that it cannot be done except upon oyer of the original writ, granted in some proper stage of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">It is certainly true, that in this State the writ is in court, and forms a part of the record, and bears in this respect no analogy to the practice of the <em>English </em>courts. But it is too narrow a view of the subject to suppose, that in demanding oyer of the writ, the only purpose is to place it on the rolls of the court, and to make it a part of the record. The writ, it has been determined is, without oyer, no part of the pleadings, or even the proceedings in the cause. And the object of craving and obtaining oyer of the writ may well be, to bring it to the view of the court, by making it a part of the pleadings, and thus putting the defendant in a situation to plead any variance that may exist between the writ and declaration, in abatement, or to file, according to some of the cases, a special demurrer. Although we consider, that the variance in this case between the writ and count, was a matter which the defendant could have pleaded in abatement, if he had presented the objection in due time, and in a properly constructed plea, the court below could not do otherwise than reject the plea, under the circumstances in which it was exhibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">If this was a case in which the plaintiff could only have maintained an action in her individual capacity, the addition of the word \u201cadministratrix,\u201d might have been treated as a superfluous description. This is the language of the court in <em>Sasscer against Walker\u2019s Ex\u2019ts, 5 G. &amp; J., </em>107. The Chief Justice says, \u201cif the appeal bond, on which the suit was brought, was a contract on which the plaintiffs could sustain an action only in their individual, and not in their representative capacity, then the addition of the word executors, in the writ, might be construed and treated as a superfluous description, and not irregular, the demand being the same.\u201d But the case just referred to establishes the proposition, that upon the cause of action now under consideration, the plaintiff could have maintained an action, either in her personal or representative cha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>racter, and having sued in the latter capacity, she was bound, we think, to sustain it. The result is, that if oyer of the writ had been prayed and granted, the pleadings would have presented a variance, of which the defendant could, at the proper time have availed himself, by plea in abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">It is perceived, from the fact of the court having addressed itself to this plea in abatement, that it is regarded as properly and legally forming a part of the record. The affidavits having shown, that a plea in abatement was tendered by the defendant below, immediately upon the declaration being amended, and a rule to plead laid, and that to this plea a <em>ne recipiatur </em>was directed by the court, it was the duty of the clerk to have entered these proceedings on the record of the court, and having omitted to do so, the record was properly corrected. While we are of opinion, therefore, that the court below, in directing an amendment of the record, in accordance with the fact, committed no error, we desire to be understood as expressing no opinion on the question, whether an order of this kind can be the subject of appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The first and second exceptions have been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">It appears from the question presented by the <em>third </em>bill of exceptions, that after issue was joined, the plaintiff produced, and offered to read <em>in </em>evidence to the jury, the letters testamentary, granted to her by the orphans court of <em>Charles </em>county, ns executrix of the will of <em>Thomas A. Davis. </em>As the issue was joined on the count, we can perceive no just objection to the admissibility of this testimony. The plaintiff declared as executrix, and it was certainly competent to show, by the testamentary letters, that she was entitled to the character she had assumed. We concur, therefore, with the court below in this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The question presented by the <em>fourth </em>exception, relates to the admissibility of the parol evidence offered by the defendant, to prove that <em>Samuel Chapman </em>and <em>Thomas A. Davis, </em>were members of the vestry of <em>Port Tobacco </em>church, about the 29th of July 1815; and that they continued members of the vestry, from the 29th of July 1815, to the time of their signing the note, in 1822, to <em>John B. Wills.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The fact proposed to be proved by the defendant, was material to the issue, as the jury might have found from the position of <em>Davis, </em>as a member of the vestry, in connection with other testimony, that he intended to sign the note in question, not as the surety of <em>Chapman, </em>but as a principal obligor. And the right of the defendant to introduce this testimony, turned on the question, whether it was incumbent on him to produce the record of the vestry as the best evidence, that <em>Thomas A. Davis </em>was, at the period referred to, one of its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The object of the evidence was, to prove a continuing membership by <em>Davis, </em>from 1815 to 1822, and this is a fact which could be established by his acts. The proposition of the defendant must then have been, not to give evidence of the election or appointment of <em>Mr. Davis </em>as a member of the vestry, but to show by his acts and conduct, that he continued for the period referred to, to exercise the functions of a member of the vestry, and was a member. In this aspect of the case, we can perceive no objection to the introduction of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In <em>Bevan against Williams, </em>3 <em>Term., </em>635, <em>note a, </em>the action was for non-residence, against a clergyman; and tire single question was, whether the plaintiff, in order to maintain this action, must prove admission, institution, and induction? The plaintiff did prove several acts done by the defendant, as parson of the parish, such as receiving tithes, serving the church, and acting in other respects as parson. Upon this question <em>Lord Mansfield </em>said, \u201call evidence is according to the matter to which it is applied, and the person against whom it is used. Against a third person there might be some reason for the objection; but as against the man himself, his own letters, receiving tithes, and cutting timber on the glebe, are decisive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">We think, therefore, that it was competent for the defendant to prove, by parol evidence, that <em>Thomas A. Davis </em>acted as a member of the vestry, from 1815 to 1822, and that the court below erred in rejecting the testimony offered for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The instrument of writing, set out in this bill of exception, as the paper.of the 29th of July 1815, was clearly inadmissible. This paper, standing alone, furnished no evidence that <em>Thomas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>J{. Davis </em>was a member of the vestry at its date, and the court below committed <em>no </em>error in rejecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"Arc\">As it is apparent from the record, that the appellant, at the trial below, had not the benefit of the fact which he proposed to establish by parol evidence, that <em>Thomas A. Davis </em>was a vestryman of the <em>Port Tobacco </em>church in 1815, and from thence to 1822, and as we think the court erred in rejecting this testimony, the judgment of the county court will be reversed, and a <em>procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
