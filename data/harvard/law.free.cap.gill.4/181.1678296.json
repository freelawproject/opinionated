The mother married again in 1842; and in 1844, the trustee conveyed the property to the grand-ehildren. In an action of <em>trover </em>for the slave, brought by the grand-children a few days after the conveyance to them, and after demand and refusal, the defendant proved, that ho had been in possession of the slave some five or six years, using and claiming her as his own, and that the trustee was frequently in the county where the defendant resided during that time. Held, that this case was within that class of cases, where not only adverse possession and claim of title for the time limited by the act of Assembly, are necessary to bar the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, but it must be made appear to the jury, that such adverse possession and claim of the defendant, were known to the trustee three years before the institution of the suit.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b189-9\">Where a slave was conveyed in trust for the use of <em>A, </em>for life, and after her death the trustee was directed to convey the same to <em>B, </em>and neither the trustee, nor <em>B, </em>were entitled to the possession during the life of <em>A, </em>there can be no presumption of knowledge on the part of the trustee, that the claim or possession of another party claiming under <em>A, </em>was adverse to his right.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b189-10\">The defendant, by his examination of a witness in chief, proved, that the witness, as a constable, had sold the negro in controversy to him, and so in <em>effect </em>gave evidence of a sale under a <em>Ji.fa., </em>or some process of execution.

And that before suit brought, the plaintiffs demanded the said negro in controversy, and the defendant refused to deliver her up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-7\">The defendant then proved by competent witnesses, that he had been in possession of the said negro since 1838 or 1839, using and claiming her as his own, and that <em>li Beale, </em>the trustee mentioned in the deed, was frequently in the county. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>b\u00e9tween that date and the institution of this suit; and prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they find from the evidence that the defendant in this case had possession of the said slave in controversy, for more than three years next before the institution of this suit, using and claiming her as his own, then the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover; which opinion the court, (Mageuder, C. J.,) gave. The plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\">2nd Exception. After the preceding exception had been taken, (the testimony in which it is agreed shall be taken as part of this,) the plaintiffs, in further support of the issues on their part joined, offered to prove by the cross-examination of <em>John R. Walker, </em>(who had been examined by the defendant, and who had stated, in answer to the defendant\u2019s interrogatory, that he had sold the said negro <em>Mary, </em>as constable, in the year 1837, to one <em>John T. Berry, </em>who had sold her to the defendant in 1838;) that said sale to <em>Berry </em>was made under a writ of <em>fieri facias, </em>in his hands, as constable, against the goods and chattels of <em>Eleanor Berry, </em>mentioned in the said deed, and that said defendant claims title to said negro, under his purchase from said <em>John T. Berry; </em>but the defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the evidence: the court, (Mageuder, C. J.,) sustained the objection, being of opinion that it was not competent to the plaintiffs to establish, by parol proof, any sale of said slave, in virtue of a <em>fieri facias, </em>without producing the said writ, or showing that it was not in his power to produce the same, although he had taken the steps required by law to enable him to produce it, or without accounting for the non-production of said <em>fi. fa. </em>To this opinion of the court, and their refusal to permit the testimony to go to the jury, the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-6\">The plaintiffs appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b192-7\">The cause was argued before Archer, C.

By the express terms of the deed of trust from <em>Benjamin Berry, Eleanor Berry </em>was \u201cto have and enjoy the sole and exclusive use of all the said property, for and during the time in which she shall and may live and remain unmarried, without molestation or hindrance\u201d of the said trustee. <em>Eleanor Berry\u2019s </em>interest in the property conveyed, terminated, by her marriage, in 1842, until when, <em>Beale, </em>the trustee, unless informed to the contrary, might naturally conclude, that the negro girl <em>Mary </em>remained in the possession of <em>Eleanor Berry, </em>or those rightfully claiming under her. A possession in another person, adversary to her rights or his own, he had no reason to anticipate, and his knowledge thereof, without proof, is not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>be presumed. The facts submitted to the finding of the jury by the defendant\u2019s instruction, as granted by the court, might all be true, and yet not be any invasion of the possessory rights of the trustee, for which he could seek any legal redress. The defendant may have acquired, by purchase, the usufructuary possessive right of <em>Eleanor Berry, </em>and in virtue of such title, possessed, used, and claimed, negro <em>Mary </em>as his own. This case, therefore, falls clearly within that class of cases, where not only adverse possession and claim of title, for the time limited by the act of Assembly, are necessary to bar the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, but it must be made appear to the jury, that such adverse possession and claim of the defendant, were known to <em>Robert Beale, </em>the trustee of the plaintiffs, three years before the institution of this suit. It hence follows, that the county court erred in instructing the jury, as they in effect did, that three years possession of negro <em>Mary, </em>by the defendant using and claiming her as his own, before the commencement of the action, barred the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, whether their trustee had knowledge of such possession, user, and claim, or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">In rejecting the testimony offered by the plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s witness, <em>John R. Walker, </em>as stated in the second bill of exceptions, we think the court below also erred. The defendant, by his examination of the witness in chief, having proved, that he, (the witness,) as constable, had sold negro <em>Mary </em>to <em>John T. Berry, </em>in 1837, who, in 1838, sold her to the defendant, thereby, in effect, gave evidence to the jury, that such sale was made under a <em>fieri facias, </em>or some process of execution. The plaintiffs, thus suddenly apprised of the existence of a written paper, \u2014 of which we cannot assume that they had any previous knowledge; or had then any means of producing; or had any reason to expect its being in any way referred to at the trial, and its contents partially given in evidence to the jury, and relied on by the defendant,\u2014 could not be expected to have taken the requisite steps to prove its contents, according to the strict requirements of law; or to enforce its production by a <em>subpoena duces tecum; </em>or if lost, destroyed or mislaid; or if in the possession of the defendant, to have laid a proper foundation for the proof of its contents by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>secondary evidences, and therefore, as well upon principles of reason and justice, as of law, ought to have been permitted to give in evidence the undisclosed part of the contents of the <em>fieri facias, </em>by the same kind of testimony that the disclosed portion of the contents of the writ had, already by the defendant, been laid before the jury. Surprise and injustice would be the result, if a different principle were to prevail in many cases, in some respects similarly circumstanced. We dissent, therefore, from the county court\u2019s opinion, and refusal to permit the testimony offered by the plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination of the witness to go to the jury, as stated in the second bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Dissenting from the county court on both bills of exceptions, their judgment is reversed. Let a procedendo issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
