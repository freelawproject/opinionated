Trundle, </em>was about to purchase the land, for which the present cause of action was given, when the witness was asked, if he would write two notes, at one and two years, for the deferred payments of the land; that the witness declined, but said his brother <em>Thomas </em>would do it, and left the room. That soon after, the witness returned, and saw his brother <em>Thomas </em>writing at a table. Whereupon the defendants objected to the''admissibility of any testimony, shewing the existence of notes, given by the defendants to the said <em>Overton Williams, </em>or the plaintiff, <em>John M. Williams, </em>other than the notes or single bills themselves, without first laying a proper foundation for the introduction of such testimony; and accounting for the absence of the notes spoken of; but the court, (Wilkinson and Brewer, A. J.,) overruled the defendant\u2019s objections, and permitted the said testimony to go to the jury. The defendants excepted to the opinion and direction of the court to the jury, admitting the testimony hereinbefore objected to. The plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b324-8\">The cause was argued before Archer, O.

Alexander for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b324-10\">By J.

Williams, </em>the <em>cestui que use. </em>To the declaration of the plaintiff below, the defendants pleaded specially, certain payments, specifying dates and amounts, which they alleged they had made to <em>John M. Williams, </em>on account of the single bill, long after its assignment to him. These payments being distinctly put in issue in the pleadings in the cause, on the trial, the plaintiff having given in evidence to the jury the note with the assignment thereon, the defendants gave in evidence the receipts of <em>John M. Williams </em>for the disputed payments: which receipts stated the payments, for which they were given, to have been made on account of a note assigned by <em>Overton Williams </em>to <em>John M. Williams. </em>The plaintiff, then, without producing the n\u00f3te; or accounting for its non-production; or laying any foundation for the introduction of secondary evidence in proof of its contents; offered oral testimony to prove, that the defendants, at the time they gave the note already in evidence, had given to <em>Overton Williams </em>another note for the payment of money. The object of which oral testimony was to induce the jury to believe, that the disputed payments, insisted on in the defendants\u2019 plea, rvcre made on the latter note; and not that on which the present action was instituted. To the admissibility of this oral evidence the defendants objected; but the county court overruled the objection, and permitted the testimony to go to the jury. In doing so we think the court were in error. The best evidence, of the existence, character, and contents, of a written instrument, is the instrument itself. Whether there were two notes, for the payment of money, given by the defendants to <em>Overton Williams, </em>is a question, which ought to be determined, by the production of the notes. As administrator of <em>Overton Williams, </em>and <em>cestui que use </em>in this cause, they are presumed to be in the possession of <em>John M. Williams, </em>and for their non-production, he has shewn no cause. If the note, of which oral testimony was offered, had been paid up, and delivered to the defendants, proof thereof should have been adduced; and a notice, to produce it at the trial, served upon the defendants. Of the hardship of his case, in this respect, the plaintiff had no cause to complain. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>not taken by surprise. The necessity of producing the testimony he offered, was not for the first time made known to him \u25a0by the evidence on the part of the defendants. The payments, asserted in the pleadings of the defendants, were made to him; \u25a0he of course knew to what note or account they were intended to be applied; and to have come prepared, with competent .testimony, to resist the defence set up against him, was his .most obvious duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The judgment of the county court is reversed, and <em>e.procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
