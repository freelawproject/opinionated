McCall, hereinafter referred to as the defendant, was indicted for the rape of Barbara Anne McGee, a female child of the age of nine years. Code, \u00a7 18-54. Upon completion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence the defendant moved to strike it as insufficient to establish the crime of rape. The motion was overruled and the defendant stood upon this motion and offered no evidence. .The jury found the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment and fixed his punishment at twenty-five years in the penitentiary. A motion to set aside the verdict was overruled, judgment entered, and the defendant sentenced in conformity with the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">The single question presented to us is whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain the verdict and judgment of -conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">On October 1, 1949, her parents gave Barbara Anne McGee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>a party at their home in Nor view, in Norfolk county, on the occasion of her ninth birthday. Several grownups, including the defendant who had been a friend of the family for some time, attended. While the party was in progress the child\u2019s parents left their home and did not return until about 6:00 p. m. When the party was about over, the defendant, with the permission of Barbara\u2019s grandparents who were left in charge of .the children, took Barbara, Brenda Phelps, aged seven, and Bonnie Marco, aged four, in his automobile to get Coca-Colas at a near-by confectionery.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">When Barbara\u2019s parents returned to their home and found the children absent they went to look for them at the neighboring confectioneries, but were unable to find them. Finally, the defendant drove up to the McGee residence with the three children and put them out there in the presence of Barbara\u2019s grandfather, but without getting out of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">There is a conflict in the evidence as to when the defendant \u25a0 returned with the children to the McGee home. Mr. McGee fixed the time at \u201caround 7:00 o\u2019clock,\u201d while his wife said it was \u201csomewhere between 7:30 and 8:00.\u201d The arresting officer testified that he particularly noted that the complaint was registered with him at 7:00 p. m. At any rate, the children were with the defendant for approximately an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Mrs. McGee testified that as soon as her daughter came into the house she noticed that the child had a \u201cmost peculiar look,\u201d that she \u201casked Barbara what had happened and she told me.\u201d Mrs. McGee then examined the child and found that her vagina was \u201cred and raw and irritated from the outside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The child was taken immediately to DePaul Hospital, in the city of Norfolk, where she was examined by Dr. N. S. Payne. The physician testified that the child was \u201crather pale, crying, very nervous, and she complained of being sore in her privates.\u201d His examination revealed that there had been a penetration of her genital organs within two or three hours of his examination which was approximately at 8:00 p. m. On direct examination he stated that he was unable to say \u201cwhat produced the condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Chemical, physical and microscopic examinations were made of the child\u2019s clothing and no sperm or seminal fluid were found thereon. Nor was any found in her sexual organs or on her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">When the car left the McGee residence the defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the three children occupied the front seat and continued to do so until their return.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">According to Barbara, they drove to a near-by confectionery and had Coca-Colas, after which the defendant drove them behind a church to see the rabbits which were kept there. Bonnie, the little boy, had expressed a desire to see the rabbits, but neither of the girls was interested in them, so they did not get out of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Barbara further testified that the defendant locked the doors of the car and put her on his lap, facing him, while the other two children were seated beside them. Upon being asked, \u201cWhat happened then? Go on and tell us exactly what happened,\u201d her reply was, \u201cThen he went on the first street and then he done it to me and we went on home.\u201d Upon being pressed by both the attorney for the Commonwealth and the court to tell \u201cexactly\u201d what had taken place and what the defendant had done to her, her only reply was, \u201cHe done that to me.\u201d Again she was asked, \u201cCan\u2019t you tell us what he did?\u201d to which she replied, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Upon being asked how she was clothed she said, \u201cI had a slip, my shirt and my pants.\u201d Her pants were not removed, she said. When asked if anything the defendant did to her hurt her, she said, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The testimony of Brenda Phelps, the other little girl, adds nothing to that of the prosecutrix. Bonnie, the little boy, did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Barbara\u2019s father called the defendant by telephone and told him of her condition. The defendant denied that he was responsible for her condition and said that \u201che was coming on out and straighten it out.\u201d The defendant failed to keep this appointment, but this may have been due to the fact that in the telephone conversation the father, as he admitted, had made \u201csome threats\u201d against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Code, \u00a7 18-54, provides in part: \u201cIf any person carnally know a female of sixteen years of age or more against her will, by force, or carnally know a female child under that age * * *, he shall, in the discretion of the court or jury be punished with death, or confinement in the penitentiary for life, or for any term not less than five years. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">The words \u201ccarnally know\u201d or \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d as used in this and similar statutes mean sexual intercourse. <em>King </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 843, 846,183 S. E. 187,189; <em>People </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>400 Ill. 240, 79 N. E. (2d) 488, 489; Webster\u2019s International Dictionary, Unabridged.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Consequently, it is universally held that under an indictment charging statutory rape of a child, as well as one charging the common-law offense of rape of an adult woman, the prosecution must prove that there has been an actual penetration to some extent of the male sexual organ into the female sexual organ. <em>Bailey v. Commonwealth, </em>82 Va. 107, 113, 3 Am. St. Rep. 87; <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, </em>12th Ed., Vol. 1, \u00a7 697, p. 935; <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 698, pp. 936, 937; <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 752, p. 1028; 44 Am. Jur., Rape, \u00a7 3, pp. 902, 903; 52 C. J., Rape, \u00a7 24, p. 1014; <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 124, pp. 1090-1; <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 127, pp. 1093-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">This essential element of the offense must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, 12th Ed., Vol. 1, \u00a7 697, p. 935; <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 698, pp. 936, 937; 52 C. J., Rape, \u00a7 124, pp. 1090-1; <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 127, pp. 1093-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">It is true that the necessary element of sexual intercourse may be proven by circumstantial as well as by direct evidence (44 Am. Jur., Eape, \u00a7 100, p. 965; 52 C. J., Eape, \u00a7 84, p. 1058), but the proof must, go beyond the mere showing of injury to the genital organs of the female and an opporunity on the part of the accused to have committed the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">In the case before us there is no proof that the injury to the child\u2019s genital organs was caused by a penetration of the defendant\u2019s sexual organ. The-family physician frankly said that he did not know the cause of her injury. There is no evidence that the defendant at any time exposed his person, that he had, or even attempted to have, sexual intercourse with this child. The evidence is that her underclothing was not removed or disarranged. The absence of semen in the child\u2019s genital organs or of stains therefrom on her clothing, while not conclusive of the fact, is a strong circumstance indicating that there was no attempted sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The little girl\u2019s only description of the particular act of the defendant was that \u201che done it to me,\u201d or \u201che done that to me.\u201d As shocking as her evidence is, it does not, in our opinion, prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201ccarnally\u201d knew or had sexual intercourse with her. At most, it shows that he was guilty of molesting this child and tampering with her, sexual organs in some perverted but undisclosed manner. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>was not the offense with which he was charged or of which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">It is not sufficient that facts and circumstances proven he consistent with defendant\u2019s guilt. To sustain a conviction they must he inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis of his innocence. <em>Spratley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>154 Va. 854, 861, 152 S. E. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial if the Commonwealth he so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
