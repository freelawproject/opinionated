He raises two issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">First, Smith contends that the district court erroneously attributed 544 kilograms of marijuana to him when he, along with the Government witness, testified that the marijuana was wet when weighed. Smith asserts that the Government never presented evidence concerning the weight of the dry marijuana. Rather, it left the district court to speculate the weight of the marijuana when dried. The Government counters that it weighed the marijuana three times over a five-month period and, on each occasion, the weight had been approximately 1,200 pounds. Moreover, it argues the district court credited the \u201cobjective\u201d evidence of the marijuana weight over Smith\u2019s unsubstantiated testimony that the dampness of the marijuana accounted for one-half the weight the Government had determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">A district court\u2019s determination of the drug quantity used to establish a base offense level is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Carroll, </em>6 F.3d 735, 742 (11th Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 1234, 127 L.Ed.2d 577 (1994). The United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G. or Guidelines) provide that, unless otherwise specified, the weight of a controlled substance, as set forth in the drug/quantity table, refers to the entire weight of any mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the controlled substance. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)., (n*) (Drug Quantity Table) (Nov.1993). Marijuana is not otherwise specified, therefore the relevant weight is the entire weight of any mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana. It is clear from Application Note 1 in the Commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1 of the Guidelines that unusable parts of a mixture or substance should not be used in determining the entire weight of the substance for sentencing purposes. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. , (n. 1). The government must prove the quantity of drugs by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Taffe, </em>36 F.3d 1047, 1050 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"AbDB\">Prior to the effective date of Application Note 1, some courts approved weighing wet marijuana despite the fact that the marijuana was not in a usable condition. <em>See United States v. Pinedo-Montoya, </em>966 F.2d 591, 595-96 (10th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>925 F.2d 170, 172-73 (7th Cir.1991). In light of the holding in these cases, the Sentencing Commission recently proposed amending \u00a7 2D1.1 in order to ensure proper application of the Guidelines. The proposed amendment to the Commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-12\">[I]n the case of marihuana having a moisture content that renders the marihuana unsuitable for consumption without drying (this might occur, for example, with a bale of rain-soaked marihuana or freshly harvested marihuana that had not been dried), an approximation of the weight of the marihuana without such excess moisture content is to be used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-13\"><em>Proposed Amendments to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, </em>56 Crim.L.Rep. (BNA) 2063, 2088, 2090. (Jan. 11, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-14\">Although this Court is not bound by the Sentencing Commission\u2019s proposed amendments to the Guidelines, we may use the proposals as subsequent legislative history to interpret the meaning of prior Application Notes. <em>Cf. United States v. Cruz, </em>805 F.2d 1464, 1471 n. 8 (11th Cir.1986). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s proposal expressly disavows inclusion of the \u201cmoisture content [of marihuana] sufficient to render it unusable without drying\u201d in determining its entire weight because \u201cincluding the moisture in the weight of the marihuana can increase the offense level for a factor that bears no relationship to the scale of the offense or the marketable form of the marihuana.\u201d <em>Proposed Amendments, </em>56 Crim.L.Rep. at 2088. Given the Commission\u2019s clarification of \u00a7 2D1.1, we hold that the district court improperly attributed 544 kilograms of <em>manj\u00faa-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>na, the weight while damp, to Smith.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore remand for resentencing, in order for the district court to approximate the weight of the marijuana without the excess moisture content. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">As to the second issue, that the district court unreasonably found that Smith possessed a dangerous weapon while importing marijuana, the district court did not clearly err when it imposed a three-level enhancement for possessing a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1064-20\">. As Smith was sentenced in August 1993, the district court did not have the benefit of the November 1993 amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, in particular Application Note 1 regarding unusable mixtures. Although we apply the Guidelines Manual in effect at the time of an offender\u2019s sentencing, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.11(a), we also are bound by the Guidelines amended commentary. <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1920, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
