Because the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in denying Appellant\u2019s discharge, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-23\">In September 1990, Appellant Phillip E. Hawley (\u201cAppellant\u201d) .filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, claiming less than $20,000 in assets. In a signed statement dated June 15, 1989, Appellant listed his total assets at $13,-822,477, total liabilities at $1,876,814, and total net worth at $11,945,663. Later in 1990, one of Appellant\u2019s creditors, Cement Industries, Inc., (\u201cAppellee\u201d), filed an adversary proceeding pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(5), urging the court to deny Appellant\u2019s discharge based on his failure to satisfactorily explain the loss of his assets between the filings of his financial statement and his bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-24\">Section 727(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-25\">\u00a7 727. Discharge</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A90\">(a) the court shall grant the debtor a discharge, unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAR1i\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>(5) the debtor has failed to explain satisfactorily, before determination of denial of discharge under this paragraph, any loss of assets or deficiency of assets to meet the debtor\u2019s liabilities;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-4\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(5) (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">At the evidentiary hearing on the matter, Appellant testified that he had previously worked as a mortgage broker, had operated a credit bureau, and had filed between 100 and 150 financial statements during his lifetime. Appellant further testified that in 1987 and 1988 he was involved in a beachfront condominium project known as Bac-Bay Condominiums. Appellant explained that in 1989 he had liquidated many of his assets to service the mortgages in the Bac-Bay project, even though the Bac-Bay mortgage was in foreclosure as of October 1988 and construction of the project had stopped in August 1988. Appellant further stated that he had sold most of his assets for cash and that he had not kept records of the cash sales. Appellant also testified that not all of the values provided in his financial statements were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">Appellant explained that he had been arrested on criminal charges in 1989 and that most of his financial records had been seized by the Florida Attorney General\u2019s Office at that time. Appellant admitted, however, that a state court had ordered that he be given access to most of those records. Neither Appellant nor his attorney offered a legitimate explanation for their failure to procure relevant documentation from the Attorney General\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-7\">The bankruptcy court denied Appellant\u2019s discharge, observing that the Appellant, a \u201csophisticated and experienced businessman,\u201d had been unable to present documentation to explain the discrepancy between the value of his assets as listed in 1989 and the value he had listed in his bankruptcy petition in 1990. The court found a \u201ccomplete lack of documentation to support the Debtor\u2019s loss of assets\u201d and determined that \u201cwhen examining the totality of the circumstances, this Court finds a pattern which leads this Court to conclude that the Debtor has not satisfactorily explained the loss or diminution of his assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-10\">The Appellant appealed to the district court. The district court affirmed and adopted the opinion of the bankruptcy court \u201cas fully as if copied verbatim.\u201d The district court dismissed the appeal and Appellant then appealed to this Court, <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-11\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-12\">A bankruptcy court\u2019s resolution of whether a debtor has satisfactorily explained the loss of assets is a finding of fact. <em>In re Chalik, </em>748 F.2d 616, 619 (11th Cir.1984) (citing <em>Shapiro &amp; Ornish v. Holliday, </em>37 F.2d 407, 407 (5th Cir.1930)). \u201cWe must accept the factual findings of the bankruptcy court unless they are clearly erroneous, particularly when the findings are affirmed by the district court.\u201d <em>Chalik, </em>748 F.2d at 619 (citations omitted). This standard is adhered to because the trial judge is best able to assess the credibility and evidentiary content of the testimony of the witnesses before him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-13\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-14\">In essence, Appellant brings two issues before this Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, Appellant contends that Appellee\u2019s failure to question him about his loss of assets before filing its adversary proceeding barred- it from contending his discharge in such a manner. We find the two cases Appellant cites in support of this contention neither controlling nor persuasive. We find instead that 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(5) does not explicitly require a creditor to call upon a debtor to explain a loss of assets <em>prior to </em>filing an adversary proceeding. A denial of discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(5) requires only that the debtor fail to explain a loss of assets \u201cbefore determination of denial of discharge under this paragraph.\u201d To require a creditor to seek an explanation from the debtor prior to filing an adversary hearing would add an additional and redundant layer of inquiry to \u00a7 727(a)(5). Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>had ample opportunity at hearing to present evidence to explain his loss of assets and he was unable to satisfactorily do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">Second, Appellant argues that Appel-lee failed to carry its burden in showing that Appellant\u2019s explanations for the loss of his assets were unsatisfactory. In its \u00a7 727(a)(5) action, Appellee had the initial burden of proving its objection to Appellant\u2019s discharge. <em>Chalik, </em>748 F.2d at 619. Appel-lee sustained this burden by showing the vast discrepancies between Appellant\u2019s 1989 financial statement and his 1990 Chapter 7 schedules. Once the party objecting to the discharge establishes the basis for its objection, the burden then shifts to the debtor \u201cto explain satisfactorily the loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cTo be satisfactory, \u2018an explanation\u2019 must convince the judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>In re Shapiro &amp; Ornish, </em>37 F.2d 403, 406 (N.D.Tex.1929), <em>aff'd, </em>37 F.2d 407 (5th Cir.1930)). \u201cVague and indefinite explanations of losses that are based on estimates uncorroborated by documentation are unsatisfactory.\u201d <em>Chalik, </em>748 F.2d at 619 (citations omitted). Obviously, Appellant\u2019s explanations did not \u201cconvince the judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The bankruptcy judge clearly found Appellant\u2019s testimony and complete lack of documentation unconvincing. Upon review of the record, we find that the bankruptcy judge did not clearly err in finding that Appellant\u2019s explanation of his loss of more than $13 million in assets over the course of fifteen months was too vague and indefinite to be \u201csatisfactory.\u201d Therefore, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1269-8\">. Appellant also asserts that the loss of assets must occur within a year's time in order to deny a discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(5). At the outset, we find that neither \u00a7 727(a)(5) nor <em>In re Chalik, </em>748 F.2d 616 (11th Cir.1984) support such a contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
