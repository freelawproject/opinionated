The written agreement of purchase provided that $5,000 of the stipulated price should be deposited with the Maryland Title Guarantee Company, pending conveyance of the property, and the balance within forty-five days. The purchase price having been paid in full, the property was conveyed to the purchaser toy deed dated April 29th, and duly recorded on May 8th, 1935. After the payment of the whole consideration, but before the execution of the deed conveying the title, five creditors of the vendor obtained judgments on their claims. In order to restrain the creditors from efforts to enforce their judgments by execution against the property acquired under the contract and deed, the purchaser and grantee brought this suit in equity. The appeal is from an order by which a demurrer to the amended bill of complaint was sustained and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">It is not disputed by the appellees that ordinarily a judgment recovered against a vendor of property after the execution of a valid contract for its sale will not affect the vendee\u2019s right to complete the \"transaction and receive an effective conveyance of the title. That princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>pie was reaffirmed and earlier cases applying it were cited, in <em>Caltrider v. Caples, </em>160 Md. 392, 153 A. 445, and <em>Colonial Building &amp; Loan Assn. v. Boden, </em>169 Md. 493, 182 A. 665. But it is argued for the appellees that the present case is not within the rule applied by those decisions. The contention is that the bill of complaint does not show a right in the plaintiff to have his purchase consummated, inasmuch as certain terms of the contract of sale, exhibited with the bill, are not alleged to have been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">It was provided by the contract that the vendor should furnish the vendee \u201cpromptly with a list of all outstanding indebtedness, secured or unsecured, now due and owing by the Hotel Bayou Company,\u201d and \u201cto convey all real estate and to assign and transfer all personal property and assets free and clear from the claims of all creditors, whether secured or unsecured.\u201d The vendor agreed to comply with the terms of the Sales in Bulk Act (Code, art. 83, secs. 19-21). There was a provision for the release of a second mortgage on the property. It was stipulated that the vendee should not be required to take title to the real estate \u201cunless free from restrictions and easements,\u201d nor unless satisfied that the hotel heating plant was \u201cin serviceable condition,\u201d and that the vendor should furnish the vendee \u201cwith all necessary resolutions which may be required or desired to make transfer of the property herein effective.\u201d The bill states that there was a full compliance with the stipulations in regard to the Sales in Bulk Act, but, because it does not allege distinctly that in other respects the terms of the contract were fulfilled, it is contended that the vendee is not shown to have had a right to its specific enforcement, and hence cannot rely upon it in opposition to the defendants\u2019 judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The demurrer concedes that the consideration for the purchase was fully paid and that the deed to the plaintiff was executed \u201cin consummation\u201d of the contract of sale, and \u201cin furtherance\u201d of its \u201cterms and covenants.\u201d In reference to the agreement that a list of its outstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>indebtedness should be furnished by the hotel company to the plaintiff, and that the property should be transferred \u201cfree from the claims of all creditors, whether secured or unsecured,\u201d the bill avers that \u201cthe provisions of said clause were not intended by the parties! to include or comprehend claims in the nature of those being asserted by the respondents, * * * but only such claims as might properly be asserted under the Sales in Bulk Act, * * * or any claims which would be a lien against the real estate, or for which in any other manner the purchaser under said agreement might be liable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">If it be supposed that a list of creditors was not in fact furnished, that the second mortgage was not released, that the heating plant was defective, and that there were easements, restrictions, or claims affecting the title from which it had not been freed when the plaintiff accepted his deed, we are unable to adopt the view that he could not waive such objections, and upon paying the whole purchase price compel a specific performance of the vendor\u2019s agreement to convey. The covenants relating to assurances of a clear title were evidently designed, solely for the vendee\u2019s protection. They could not properly, in our opinion, be given the effect of enabling the vendor\u2019s creditors to dispute the vendee\u2019s rights under a conveyance in pursuance of a contract of purchase with which he had fully complied. It is therefore our conclusion that the demurrer to the bill of complaint should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">\n<em>Order reversed, with costs, &lt;md cause remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
