Thereafter, in a complaint that was filed in a suit by the husband for divorce from his said wife (the petitioner herein), the following allegation was made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">\u201cThat a property settlement agreement, dated November 18, 1929, was executed and entered into between plaintiff and defendant, which said agreement settles and adjusts satisfactorily the property interests of the respective parties, which said agreement the plaintiff hereby asks the court to approve and confirm.\u201d The wife did not appear in said suit. Included within the interlocutory decree of divorce granted therein, was the following provision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">\u201cIt is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that the property settlement heretofore entered into by and between the parties hereto on November 18th, 1929, and filed in evidence herein as plaintiff\u2019s exhibit A and the same is hereby approved and by reference thereto is adopted and made a part of this judgment.\u201d And such provision purportedly was carried into the final decree of divorce in said suit in the following language:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">\u201cIt is further ordered and decreed . . . that wherein said interlocutory decree relates to the property of the parties hereto, said property be and the same is hereby assigned in accordance with the terms thereof to the parties therein declared to be entitled thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Some years later, the former husband filed a complaint in an action against his former wife, wherein in substance the foregoing facts were alleged, and in addition thereto, that in the course of the said settlement of the property rights of the parties, the wife fraudulently had concealed from the husband the existence of certain assets of the community which were in the possession of the wife; and the husband then prayed for an \u201caccounting\u201d between the' parties, both in- regard to certain of his unfulfilled obligations as created by the said agreement and in regard to- the alleged undisclosed assets of the community that were in the possession of the said wife. In the course of proceedings in said action, the trial court denied a motion interposed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the defendant wife to abate the said action, or to dismiss the same, on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court, which assertedly ensued from the allegation that the judgment theretofore rendered in the divorce suit between the parties was <em>res judicata </em>as to the cause of action or subject matter of the action then before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">In the proceeding before this court, the wife seeks an order by which the lower court will be restrained from proceeding further in the said action for an \u201caccounting\u201d brought against her by her former husband. The respondent herein has demurred to said petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Although it may be that in accord with general principles of law announced in authorities emanating from the appellate tribunals of this state, the situation presented by the facts hereinbefore set forth would warrant the conclusion not only that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>may be applicable, but also that the trial court may lack jurisdiction to hear and determine the action which is the basis for the instant petition,\u2014nevertheless by precedents which are directly in point and by which in substance it is declared that in circumstances such as here are present, the general rule to which reference has been had should not be applied, this court is led to the conclusion that the prayer of the petition should be denied. <em>(Milekovich </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>40 Cal.
