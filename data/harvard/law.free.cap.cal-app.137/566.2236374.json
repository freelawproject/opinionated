Both appeals, by stipulation, are before us on the same record.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-13\">In support of their contentions for a reversal of the judgments appellants urge:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-14\">1st. That the evidence does not support the implied finding of the jury that the defendants were negligent, but does show conclusively as a matter of law that the plaintiffs were guilty of contributory negligence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>2d. That the court committed reversible error in the matter of giving certain instructions requested by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The record clearly shows a marked conflict in the evidence on several material matters. That this court may not, under such circumstances, interfere with the judgment is too well established to require further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Nor is there merit in the point that the trial court committed error in the instructions given. We have examined the instructions given and are satisfied that as a whole they correctly state the law applicable to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Stephens, P. J., and Craig, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
