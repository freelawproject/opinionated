Subsequently the respondents moved to vacate and set aside said writ. The appeal has now been determined on the merits <em>(Beemer </em>v. <em>Roller, ante, </em>p. 293 [30 Pac. (2d) 547]), the judgment being reversed with directions to revise and re-enter the same in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion filed therein. The entry of the revised judgment will supersede the one appealed from, and therefore the questions raised by respondents\u2019 motion to vacate and set aside said writ of <em>supersedeas </em>have become moot. Upon that ground respondents\u2019 motion is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\">Tyler, P. J., and Cashin, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
