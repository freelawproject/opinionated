Rubini was defendant. The record before us reveals that in said divorce action the court found that the parties, at the date of the commencement of said action, owned said property, which was community property and was enumerated therein as \u201cfurniture situate in the premises known as 934 Third Avenue, Los Angeles, California\u201d; and in the conclusions of law following said findings is the following \u201cThat the defendant is entitled to the ownership and possession of . . . together with the furniture and furnishings situated therein, and all of which were in and upon said premises, towit, 934 Third Avenue, Los Angeles, California, at the date of the commencement of this action\u201d. It is too clear for argument that unless in the instant case it appears that the personal property in question is other than that covered by the above finding and conclusion, appellants\u2019 contention must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Referring now to the case before us, the court finds that on the eleventh day of August, 1928, the plaintiff was the owner of certain property enumerated in said finding, \u201call of which was situate and located in the premises known as 934 Third Avenue, in the city of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, State of California\u201d. In the next finding it is said \u201cthat all of said articles above mentioned were situate in the premises known as 934 Third Avenue, Los Angeles, California, at and prior to the commencement of this action\u201d. These are the only findings which in any way bear upon the issues here presented. Obviously the ownership of this property was determined in the first action.  However, we find in the defendants\u2019 answer in the instant case an admission that certain articles, to wit: \u201c1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Large Teakwood Stand; 1 Small Teakwood Stand; 1 Bronze Woman Figure, and 1 Green Marble Pedestal\u201d, are the property of the plaintiff in both actions, but it is alleged that prior to the beginning of the claim and delivery suit the defendant Rubini therein offered to deliver said articles to the plaintiff but that the latter had refused to accept the same. These articles are only a small part of those that were claimed in the last-named suit. We find no finding on the issue presented by this allegation in the answer. This being so, the judgment in favor of the plaintiff is without support in the findings, even as to these specified articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The judgment is reversed and the trial court is directed to enter a judgment in favor of defendants, except that it is directed to find that the articles admitted by defendants\u2019 answer to belong to the plaintiff are the plaintiff\u2019s, and as to them give judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Stephens, P. J., and Arehbald, J., <em>pro </em>fern., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
