It is only necessary that there be proof of a single act of vagrancy. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>189 App. Div. 775 [179 N. Y. Supp. 289] ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>174 Iowa, 748 [156 N. W. 747, 14 A. L. R. 1498, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 239, L. R. A. 1916D, 767].) In this instance it appears that the following facts pertain to petitioner\u2019s conduct in the city of Los Angeles: That he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>was seen on the streets many times by witnesses; that on several occasions he was in the company of a known prostitute; that at one time he was drunk in an automobile, and that he was at all times idle and without means of support other than in a certain illegal trade known as \u201chijacking\u201d, and there is testimony that he was a \u201chijacker\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Under these circumstances it is unnecessary and unprofitable to consider or decide certain legal questions which petitioner urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The writ is discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Stephens, P. J., and Archbald J., <em>pro tem., </em>concurred</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
