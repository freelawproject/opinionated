As in most cases involving offenses of this character, evidence supporting the charge is mainly the testimony of the prosecuting witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">It will serve no useful purpose to rehearse in detail the sordid story as told by the complaining witness. A motherless home, with a fifteen year old girl sleeping in the same bed with her father, furnishes a background for the tragedy which the record unfolds. In addition to the daughter\u2019s own story, a physician who examined the girl testified that in her opinion the prosecutrix had had sexual relations some time prior to the time of the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The ruling of the trial court complained of by appellant occurred when the complaining witness was being interrogated by defendant\u2019s counsel relative to the first act of intercourse she had with defendant in Michigan about two years previous to the occurrences which formed the basis for the charges in the information. She stated that she first resisted her father\u2019s advances. When asked if she struck her father in making this resistance, the court refused to permit her to answer. Again, when being questioned as to her father\u2019s general treatment of her, after she had testified that, other than the acts of intercourse, her father had always been kind to her, she was asked: \u201cAlthough you were poor he did all he could for you?\u201d The objection to this question was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">We observe no serious error in these rulings of the court. While both questions might be regarded as coming within the recognized bounds of cross-examination, the subject matter of both had been fairly covered by other questions and answers. Assuming that answers most favorable to defendant would have been given, we cannot see in what way the result would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">The verdict of the jury and the denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial indicate that both jury and judge believed the story as told by the girl. To the jury is first assigned the duty of determining the credibility of witnesses, and after conviction, upon motion for new trial, the trial judge is given the opportunity to weigh the evidence. When jury and judge have acted, this court must pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>sume that the testimony which amply supports the charge was worthy of belief. The record discloses that defendant had a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Stephens, P. J., and Craig, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
