The order appealed from was made after hearing upon an order to show cause why the sale in question should not be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">Inasmuch as the material facts here involved, as well as the legal questions raised, are similar to those considered and decided in the case of <em>Haish </em>v. Hall, 90 Cal. App. 547 [265 Pac. 1030], in which case a hearing was denied by the Supreme Court, it would seem to serve no useful purpose in this case to reiterate the views and conclusions there expressed upon the same questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">In the interests of economy of time and space we feel that reference to the opinion in that case will meet the needs of our decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-15\">Stephens, P. J., and Craig, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-16\">A petition by appellant to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on May 10, 1934.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
