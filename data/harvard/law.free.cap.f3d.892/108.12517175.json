In 1981, the New York State Legislature enacted the \" 'special traffic options program for driving while intoxicated' (STOP-DWI) whereby a participating county could receive fines and forfeitures collected by courts within that county for alcohol-related driving offenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 990,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=592%20N.Y.S.2d%20646\">\n    592 N.Y.S.2d 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=607%20N.E.2d%20793\">\n    607 N.E.2d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A decade later, the Legislature passed another law that diverted to the state a percentage of\n   the drunk driving funds to which participating counties were entitled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 990-91,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=592%20N.Y.S.2d%20646\">\n    592 N.Y.S.2d 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=607%20N.E.2d%20793\">\n    607 N.E.2d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff counties brought a constitutional challenge to the new law, and the New York Court of Appeals held that their challenge could be heard because, \"STOP-DWI legislation having been neither amended nor repealed, the participating counties ha[d] a proprietary claim to the fines and forfeitures\" to which the later legislation was directed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=607%20N.E.2d%20793\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   There may be cases that fall between\n   <em>\n    Gulotta\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rensselaer\n   </em>\n   , and potentially present a close question on whether the proprietary-interest exception applies. This is not one of them. Jimmy Nolan's Law, at most, has an indirect effect on BPCA's general fund, making the present case an easier one than\n   <em>\n    Gulotta\n   </em>\n   , where the challenged laws actually \"require[d] the [c]ounties to make expenditures.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"371078\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/228/555/\">\n    645 N.Y.S.2d at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And Jimmy Nolan's Law is easily distinguished from the law at issue in\n   <em>\n    Rensselaer\n   </em>\n   . There, the allegedly unconstitutional law itself was aimed at specific funds to which the counties were otherwise entitled. Here, by contrast, the challenged law has nothing to do with any fund, let alone a specific one, and simply removes a procedural obstacle to suits of a type to which BPCA is regularly exposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Indeed, if BPCA's logic were followed, the proprietary-interest exception would permit a public entity to challenge the constitutionality of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   law that could potentially expose it to greater liability, so long as the entity claimed that it had some sort of fund from which a judgment might be paid. That would hardly be a narrow exception to New York's capacity-to-sue rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We have little difficulty concluding that, in this case, BPCA does not qualify for any exception to the general rule that state entities lack the capacity to raise constitutional challenges to state statutes, and its challenge to Jimmy Nolan's Law must therefore be rejected. Accordingly, we need not reach the question whether that law is consistent with the Due Process Clause of the New York State Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the judgment of the district court and REMAND the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
