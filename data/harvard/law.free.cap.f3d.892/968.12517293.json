Customer Data Sec. Breach Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187520\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/608/#p613\">\n    847 F.3d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 613 (8th Cir. 2017). On remand, the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   re-certified the class after conducting a rigorous analysis. Class member Leif Olson again objects to the certification on a number of grounds. In addition, class member Jim Sciaroni objects to the district court's approval of the settlement agreement. We see no error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In 2015, the district court certified a class of \"[a]ll persons in the United States whose credit or debit card information and/or whose personal information was compromised as a result of the data breach that was first disclosed by Target on December 19, 2013.\" As has become common, the class was certified solely for the purpose of entering into a settlement agreement. The parties presented such an agreement to the court in short order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under the terms of this agreement, Target agreed to pay $10 million to settle the claims of all class members and waived its right to appeal an award of attorney's fees less than or equal to $6.75 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For those class members with documented proof of loss, the agreement called for full compensation of their actual losses up to $10,000 per claimant. For those class members with undocumented losses, the agreement directed a pro rata distribution of the amounts remaining after payments to documented-loss claimants and class representatives. Additionally, Target agreed to implement a number of data-security measures and to pay all class notice and administration expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   There were two primary objectors to the court's certification of the class and approval of the settlement agreement: Leif Olson and Jim Sciaroni. In the original appeal of this matter, Olson argued that the court failed to conduct the appropriate pre-certification analysis, and Sciaroni objected to the court's approval of the settlement. We agreed with Olson's argument and therefore remanded to the district court without considering Sciaroni's objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On remand, the court again certified the class. Olson appeals that decision, claiming the district court factually misunderstood the settlement agreement and failed to account for a number of alleged conflicts of interest between class counsel and class members and among competing subgroups\n   of class members. In addition, Sciaroni's original objections to the settlement are before us. We first address Olson's claims before moving to Sciaroni's objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II. Olson\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On appeal, Olson raises two principal challenges to the district court's certification order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, he contends the district court fundamentally misunderstood the structure of the settlement agreement. Next, he argues that there is an intraclass conflict between class members who suffered verifiable losses from the data breach and those, like Olson, who have not, and that this conflict necessitates separate legal counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We address each argument in turn, applying the deferential abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Petrovic v. Amoco Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233124\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/200/1140/#p1145\">\n    200 F.3d 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1145 (8th Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Olson first launches a factual challenge to the district court's order. Under the terms of the settlement, the proceeds are first distributed to those individuals who submit proof of actual loss, up to a total amount of $10,000 per claimant. Next, the class representative awards are paid. Then any remaining proceeds are distributed in equal amounts to those claimants with undocumented losses. The district court accurately presented this structure on page 3 of its order, but it later made two comments which form the basis of Olson's attack:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs who have not suffered any monetary injury likely have no claim to any future payment and thus the equitable relief from the settlement, in addition to the possible pro-rata share of the remaining settlement fund, constitutes all of the relief they could hope to reap from this litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs who have no demonstrable injury receive the benefit of Target's institutional reforms that will better protect consumers' information in the future, and will also receive a pro-rata share of any remaining settlement fund.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Proceeding from these statements, Olson contends the district court fundamentally misunderstood the settlement structure because it apparently believed that those claimants in the zero-loss subclass would\n   receive a share of remaining settlement proceeds. Under Olson's view, \"that error alone warrants reversal.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To be sure, as Olson points out, we have stated that \"[t]he district court ... abuses its discretion if its conclusions rest on clearly erroneous factual determinations.\"\n   <em>\n    Blades v. Monsanto Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9173530\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/400/562/#p566\">\n    400 F.3d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 566 (8th Cir. 2005). But here we have no indication that the district court rested its conclusions on the above statements. In fact, the court had already determined that no intraclass conflict existed four pages prior to making the above statements, so it stretches credulity to assert that its conclusion depended on a statement made thereafter. We need not define at what point an erroneous factual statement constitutes reversible error. In this case, it was obvious that the district court did not rely on an erroneous understanding of the settlement, and thus no abuse of discretion occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Olson next argues that there is an intraclass conflict between class members who suffered verifiable losses from the data breach and those, like Olson, who have not. Olson uses different names for this latter subclass, sometimes referring to it as a zero-recovery subgroup\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and other times calling it a future-damages subclass. In substance, Olson's contention is that under the Supreme Court's asbestos decisions in\n   <em>\n    Amchem\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   , the district court's ruling was legally deficient because, even assuming there were named representatives from the zero-loss subclass, separate legal counsel was required to protect that subclass's interests.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248131\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/815/#p856\">\n    527 U.S. 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 856,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248131\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/815/#p856\">\n    119 S.Ct. 2295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248131\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/815/#p856\">\n    144 L.Ed.2d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) (\"[I]t is obvious after\n   <em>\n    Amchem\n   </em>\n   that a class divided between holders of present and future claims (some of the latter involving no physical injury and attributable to claimants not yet born) requires division into homogeneous subclasses under Rule 23(c)(4)(B), with separate representation to eliminate conflicting interests of counsel.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We need look no further than the language of\n   <em>\n    Amchem\n   </em>\n   itself to refute this assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Describing the then-current state of asbestos litigation, the Court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [This] is a tale of danger known in the 1930s, exposure inflicted upon millions of Americans in the 1940s and 1950s, injuries that began to take their toll in the 1960s, and a flood of lawsuits beginning in the 1970s. On the basis of past and current filing data, and because of a latency period that may last as long as 40 years for some asbestos related diseases, a continuing stream of claims can be expected. The final toll of asbestos related injuries is unknown. Predictions have been made of 200,000 asbestos disease deaths before the year 2000 and as many as 265,000 by the year 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Amchem Prods., Inc. v.

Against this backdrop, the Court was confronted with a class certification and settlement offer that \"proposed to settle, and to preclude nearly all class members from litigating against [certain asbestos] companies, all claims not filed before January 15, 1993, involving compensation for present and future asbestos-related personal injury or death.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n    at 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   After finding that Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement was not satisfied by the proposed class, the Court focused on Rule 23(a)(4)'s adequacy inquiry with the goal of uncovering whether there were \"conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n    at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because \"named parties with diverse medical conditions sought to act on behalf of a single giant class rather than on behalf of discrete subclasses,\" the Court found that such conflicts existed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n    at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More specifically, the Court reasoned that \"for the currently injured, the critical goal is generous immediate payments[,] [and] [t]hat goal tugs against the interest of exposure-only plaintiffs in ensuring an ample, inflation-protected fund for the future.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the context of a nationwide phenomenon involving \"millions of Americans\" and \"a latency period that may last as long as 40 years for some asbestos related diseases,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n    at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted), this conclusion is sound because there was a real expectation that the exposure-only plaintiffs would fall ill after the date specified in the settlement. As a result of the fact that no exposure-only plaintiff could estimate with any certainty the extent of his or her future injury, the settlement offered no assurance that sufficient funds would remain to protect the interests of that group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Olson struggles to analogize the present case to\n   <em>\n    Amchem\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   , asserting that class members with verified losses are attempting to maximize their recovery at the expense of those who \"might only have future ... damages.\" His attempts are futile. As the Supreme Court noted, \"[i]n contrast to mass torts involving a single accident, class members in this case were exposed to different asbestos-containing products, in different ways, over different periods, and for different amounts of time; some suffered no physical injury, others suffered disabling or deadly diseases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n    at 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p598\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Georgine v.

But all class members had the ability to register for credit monitoring, and all of the compromised payment cards undoubtedly were cancelled and replaced by the issuing banks. Any risk of future harm is therefore entirely speculative, which is perhaps best illustrated by Olson's inability to direct the court-even generally-to a concrete type of future harm that the settlement fails to consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Of course, it is hypothetically possible that a member of the zero-loss subclass will suffer some future injury; for example, a line of credit could be opened using the personal information compromised in the breach. But this is just as likely to happen to a member of the subclass with documented losses. Accordingly, the interests of the two subclasses here are more congruent than disparate, and there is no fundamental conflict requiring separate representation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeBoer v.

Sciaroni\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Having found the district court properly certified the class, we now turn to Sciaroni's challenges to the district court's original order concerning the settlement in this case. Sciaroni first launches a two-fold challenge to the court's award of attorney's fees, arguing at the outset that the court erred by considering the costs of notice and administration expenses as a benefit to the class and then challenging the overall reasonableness of the award. Next, Sciaroni contends that the court erred in approving the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Sciaroni first urges us to adopt the Seventh Circuit's approach to determine whether administrative fees and costs are a benefit to the class as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Redman v.

Additionally, the court noted that \"[t]he request amounts to a negative lodestar multiplier of .74, and ... is 29% of the total monetary payout Target is required to make as part of the settlement.\" Both of these figures are well within amounts we have deemed reasonable in the past.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277417\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/395/#p398\">\n    849 F.3d at 399-400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases and noting \"courts have frequently awarded attorneys' fees ranging up to 36% in class actions\" and that a lodestar \"multiplier [of 1.82] is well within the range of multipliers awarded in this and other circuits\").

Indeed, despite the brevity of its reasoning on other questions, the court gave a carefully reasoned and complete analysis of all four\n   <em>\n    Van Horn\n   </em>\n   factors. On the first, it accurately noted the uphill battle facing the plaintiffs if this litigation were to proceed: standing issues being the most prevalent given the glaring fact that most of the plaintiffs suffered no concrete injury as a result of the breach. Weighed against this consideration, the monetary and non-monetary relief offered under the settlement likely offers the plaintiffs \"the only conceivable remedies they could expect.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Uponor, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569247\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1057/#p1063\">\n    716 F.3d at 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It thus is unclear why Sciaroni strenuously argues that the non-monetary relief is inadequate, especially in light of his concession that \"[w]hile some class members filed a claim, the vast majority of the millions of the class members are entitled only to injunctive relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228732\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/502/#p508\">\n    787 F.3d at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e have never required that a settlement agreement specifically provide for a direct financial payment to each class member, and the mere fact that some members of a class may not receive a direct payment is not dispositive.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Discussing the second factor, the court noted that Target has ample means to pay the settlement and therefore considered this neutral in the analysis. The court then discussed the third factor, commenting that \"[f]urther litigation ... would undoubtedly be expensive and complex\" in light of the impending \"voluminous discovery\" and the fact that the plaintiffs' consumer-protection claims arise under state law in nearly every jurisdiction in the country.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275959\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/685/#p701\">\n    862 F.3d at 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Class actions, in general, place an enormous burden of costs and expense upon parties. Here, the application of numerous states' laws made this a particularly complex case.\" (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Finally, the fourth factor weighed in favor of the settlement given that only 11 people out of the 80 million class members objected to the settlement.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275959\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/685/#p701\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[O]ut of a class of approximately 3.5 million households, ... only fourteen class members submitted timely objections[,] [and] none of the named plaintiffs objected to the settlement. Thus, the amount of opposition is minuscule when compared with other settlements that we have approved.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Sciaroni argues the worthless objective relief, combined with the presence of \"clear-sailing\" and \"kicker\" clauses in the agreement, subtly shows that the settling parties are guilty of collusion. A clear-sailing provision is one where \"the defendants agree[ ] not to oppose the request for attorney fees,\"\n   <em>\n    Johnston v. Comerica Mortg. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11641550\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/83/241/#p243\">\n    83 F.3d 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 243 (8th Cir. 1996), and a kicker provision means that unused assets from the settlement are returned to the defendants instead of being distributed to the class,\n   <em>\n    In re Bluetooth Headset Prods. Liab. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825147\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/935/#p947\">\n    654 F.3d 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 947 (9th Cir. 2011). Although Sciaroni's principal brief expressly states that both types of provisions are found in the current agreement, his reply brief substantially backs off of those assertions by conceding that the agreement \"may not have a 'strict' clear sailing provision\" and only \"effectively\" has a kicker clause. At any rate, Sciaroni's position simply voices generalized grievances with these provisions: nowhere does he explain\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the clauses, even assuming they are present, operated to the detriment of the class. Sciaroni directs us to no authority that such provisions are per se unlawful, and he has likewise failed to provide any clear evidence of collusion. Accordingly, because he has not demonstrated that the settlement was unfair or inequitable, we affirm the court's approval of the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   IV.

First, he contends there are no named class representatives from the zero-loss subclass.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) (requiring, as a prerequisite to class certification, that \"the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class\"). This argument is belied by the record. Olson concedes in his brief that, as of the time the suit was filed, there were thirteen named plaintiffs who had not submitted claims for reimbursement. Moreover, as of the moment the district court certified the class, there were four named plaintiffs who had claimed no out-of-pocket losses. Next, Olson claims that there is an intraclass conflict between those individuals who reside in states that offer statutory causes of action and those who do not. On this point, Olson asserts that class members from states such as California, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia are being forced to forego their state-law statutory claims in return for \"marginal compensation\" under the terms of the settlement. But Olson-a resident of Texas, which does not offer a statutory cause of action-has no standing to assert a conflict on behalf of residents from states offering such relief.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re SuperValu, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275352\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/763/#p768\">\n     870 F.3d 763\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 768 (8th Cir. 2017) (\"The requirements for standing do not change in the class action context.\");\n    <em>\n     Huyer v.
