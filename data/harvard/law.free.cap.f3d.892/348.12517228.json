A half-hour after they were taken hostage, the boys were killed by their captors. Naftali's family brought suit in District Court against the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (\"Iran\"), the Iranian Ministry of Information and Security, and the Syrian Arab Republic (\"Syria\") (collectively, \"Appellees\") under the terrorism exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\"FSIA\"), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A, for providing material support to Hamas. The defendants failed to respond to the complaint and the District Court entered a default judgment in favor of the Fraenkels, awarding Naftali's estate $1 million for his pain and suffering and $50 million in punitive damages, and his family $4.1 million in solatium damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fraenkel v. Islamic Republic of Iran\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Fraenkel I\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274316\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/248/21/#p43\">\n    248 F.Supp.3d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43 (D.D.C. 2017). This appeal concerns a challenge by the Fraenkels to the amount of damages awarded them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Fraenkels argue that the District Court erred in failing to determine the solatium damages awards in conformity with the remedial scheme established in\n   <em>\n    Estate of Heiser v. Islamic Republic of Iran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3764897\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/466/229/\">\n    466 F.Supp.2d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2006). We reject this claim. The decision in\n   <em>\n    Heiser\n   </em>\n   may serve as a useful reference point, but it is not binding precedent. District Court judges have discretion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) to grant solatium awards based on the particular facts of each case, subject to abuse-of-discretion review for errors of law, clearly erroneous factual findings, and faulty reasoning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill v. Republic of Iraq\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719904,9133950\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/328/680/\">\n    328 F.3d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 683 (D.C. Cir. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Fraenkels also contend that the District Court erred in awarding solatium damages in amounts less than the damages awarded in\n   <em>\n    Gates v. Syrian Arab Republic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3890249\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/580/53/\">\n    580 F.Supp.2d 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2008). In justifying its decision, the District Court explained that, unlike the victims in\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   -American contractors servicing the U.S. military during the Iraq War-Naftali was not targeted for being an American. Although Naftali was a U.S. citizen, the District Court found that he was captured and killed because he was Jewish-Israeli. The District Court also found that the location of the Fraenkels' home, Naftali's school, and the site of the abduction indicated that Naftali and his family had \"accepted the risk\" of terrorist attacks. Based on these considerations, the District Court awarded solatium damages to Naftali's family members that were lower than the amounts awarded to the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Fraenkels claim that the District Court abused its discretion in awarding solatium damages because the court's judgment was based on impermissible considerations and clearly erroneous findings of fact. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons explained below, we reverse the District Court's judgment on\n   the solatium damages awards and remand for further consideration. We affirm the District Court's punitive damages and pain-and-suffering awards because the judgments with respect to those awards were consistent with the applicable law, adequately reasoned, and supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

His mother, father, and six siblings lived in Nof Ayalon, an Israeli settlement that straddles the Green Line. On the evening of June 12, 2014, Naftali headed home from school accompanied by two classmates, Gilad Shaer and Eyal Yifrach. The boys waited at a junction in Alon Shvut to hail a ride from passing cars.

Inside were two members of Hamas, who abducted the boys at gunpoint. Around 10:30 p.m., Israeli emergency services received a telephone call. The police heard a voice that sounded like Gilad, who said that the boys had been kidnapped; they also heard another voice speaking in Arabic and Hebrew saying \"put your head down.\" The police then heard muffled sounds of gunshots and a person moaning in physical pain. It was later determined that the terrorists had shot and killed each boy. After eighteen days of searching, the boys' bodies were found on land owned by the head of a Hamas cell. On August 20, 2014, Hamas officially took responsibility for the kidnapping and murders of Naftali, Gilad, and Eyal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 9, 2015, the Fraenkels brought this civil action in District Court, alleging that Iran, the Iranian Ministry of Information and Security, and Syria materially supported Hamas in connection with Naftali's kidnapping and murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Because neither Iran nor Syria has entered an appearance in this litigation, the court appointed Georgetown University Law Center's Appellate Litigation Program as\n    <em>\n     amicus curiae\n    </em>\n    to present arguments in support of the District Court's judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

First, they claim that in setting the awards for solatium damages, the District Court relied on improper considerations and clearly erroneous factual findings. Second, the Fraenkels argue that the District Court misapplied\n    <em>\n     Gates\n    </em>\n    . And, finally, they contend that the District Court \"broke from precedent\" in failing to follow\n    <em>\n     Heiser\n    </em>\n    's remedial scheme.

This is particularly true where the death was sudden and violent. How the claimant learned of decedent's death, and whether there was an opportunity to say good-bye or view the body can be a significant factor contributing to the claimant's anguish. ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    The calculations for mental anguish and loss of society share some common considerations. First, the calculation should be based upon the anticipated duration of the injury. Claims for mental anguish belong to the claimants and should reflect anticipated persistence of mental anguish in excess of that which would have been experienced following decedent's natural death. When death results from terrorism, the fact of death and the cause of death can become inextricably intertwined, thus interfering with the prospects for anguish to diminish over time.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    The nature of the relationship between the claimant and the decedent is another critical factor in the solatium analysis. If the relationship is strong and close, the likelihood that the claimant will suffer mental anguish and loss of society is substantially increased, particularly for intangibles such as companionship, love, affection, protection, and guidance. Numerous factors enter into this analysis, including: strong emotional ties between the claimant and the decedent; decedent's position in the family birth order relative to the claimant; the relative maturity or immaturity of the claimants; whether decedent habitually provided advice and solace to claimants; whether the claimant shared interests and pursuits with decedent; as well as decedent's achievements and plans for the future which would have affected claimants.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    Finally, unlike lost wages, which can be calculated with a fair degree of mathematical certainty, solatium cannot be defined through models and variables. ... This is the paradox of solatium; although no amount of money can alleviate the emotional impact of a child's or sibling's death, dollars are the only means available to do so.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1282167\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/999/1/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1282167\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/999/1/\">\n     at 30-32\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citations omitted);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary 1607 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"solatium\" as \"[c]ompensation; ... damages allowed for hurt feelings or grief, as distinguished from damages for physical injury\");\n    <em>\n     Flanagan v.

We also reverse and remand Abraham's damages award for the same reasons as the \u00a7 1605A(c) solatium damages awards. Although Abraham's damages were calculated under Israeli law, we default to the application of federal law when there is a lack of information regarding the proper calculation of damages under foreign law, as there is here.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Thuneibat v.

There are two problems with the District Court's judgment: (1) the court's reliance on the terrorists' intent to target Israelis as a justification for limiting solatium damages awarded to Naftali's survivors; and (2) the court's supposition that solatium damages should be limited because Naftali and his family assumed the risk that he might be abducted and killed by terrorists. These considerations are discussed in turn below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      1. Nationality of the Victim\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The District Court indicated that the Fraenkels should receive solatium damages awards below the amounts awarded to the plaintiffs in\n    <em>\n     Gates\n    </em>\n    because Naftali was targeted for being Israeli while the victims in\n    <em>\n     Gates\n    </em>\n    were targeted for being U.S. nationals.\n    <em>\n     Fraenkel II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273347\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/77/\">\n     258 F.Supp.3d at 84\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This rationale does not withstand scrutiny. We can find no legal basis under the FSIA for limiting a plaintiff's solatium damages award because the victim of an extrajudicial killing was targeted for his affiliation with Israel, rather than the U.S.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Section 1605A does not distinguish between U.S. national victims and dual-citizen victims in authorizing damages under its private right of action.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(c).

Under the statute, Naftali's national affiliation is irrelevant for the purposes of determining the U.S. plaintiffs' entitlement to damages under \u00a7 1605A(c). It is undisputed here that Naftali's mother and siblings are all U.S. nationals.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The reason that Naftali was targeted is likewise irrelevant for purposes of his father Abraham's Israeli law claims. Abrogation of sovereign immunity under \u00a7 1605A(a), on which the court's jurisdiction over his claims depends, requires that the victim is a U.S. national. But that provision contains no qualifier on whether the victim's U.S. citizenship was relevant to the act. Therefore, it does not matter under the FSIA that Naftali was also an Israeli citizen and may have been targeted because of this.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Finally, the District Court's reasoning does not comport with its own interpretation of \"solatium.\" As the court properly recognized, \"solatium\" damages are compensation\n    for \"[m]ental anguish, bereavement and grief resulting from the fact of decedent's death.\"\n    <em>\n     Fraenkel I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274316\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/248/21/#p43\">\n     248 F.Supp.3d at 41\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Flatow\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1282167\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/999/1/\">\n     999 F.Supp. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    30 ).

On this point, the District Court noted that \"[the Fraenkels] accepted the risks of living in a community built across the Green Line in Israel and sending Naftali Fraenkel 40 miles further into the West Bank for high school in Gush Etzion[, which] is about six miles from Hebron, a predominately Palestinian city.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . The District Court obviously took these facts into account in assessing, and limiting, the solatium damages it awarded. We agree with the Fraenkels that the court erred in doing this.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Under common law theory, the doctrine of assumption of risk can be used to bar recovery for a negligent act when a plaintiff has voluntarily incurred a known risk.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Scoggins v.

We therefore reverse and remand the District Court's judgment on the solatium damages awards so that the court may reassess these damages without any suggestion that Naftali and his immediate family \"accepted the risk\" that he might be kidnapped and killed by terrorists.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      3.

According to the Fraenkels, this \"case law\" governing solatium awards is authoritatively summarized in\n    <em>\n     Estate of Heiser v.

In that case, the District Court reviewed prior FSIA decisions and concluded that \"courts typically award between $8 million and $12 million for pain and suffering resulting from the death of a spouse[,] approximately $5 million to a parent whose child was killed[,] and approximately $2.5 million to a plaintiff whose sibling was killed.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3764897\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/466/229/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3764897\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/466/229/\">\n     at 269\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Fraenkels maintain that subsequent District Court decisions have invariably followed the\n    <em>\n     Heiser\n    </em>\n    framework, and that as a result, the court below was obligated to consider these amounts a \"baseline\" from which they could vary only with reasoned justification. We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    We recognize that many FSIA decisions issued by the District Court follow\n    <em>\n     Heiser\n    </em>\n    's solatium damages model.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Estate of Brown v.

However, the District Court in this case was not\n    <em>\n     required\n    </em>\n    to follow\n    <em>\n     Heiser\n    </em>\n    for the simple reason that\n    <em>\n     Heiser\n    </em>\n    is not controlling precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Labow v.

First, the FSIA, and the case law applying the statute, make it clear that the trial judge has discretion in determining solatium damages. The FSIA requires only that a plaintiff \"establish[ ] his claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hill\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719904,9133950\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/328/680/\">\n     328 F.3d at 684\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (requiring plaintiffs to prove the amount of economic damages \"by a reasonable estimate\"). Given this statutory scheme, District Court judges invariably must exercise discretion in determining damages awards under the FSIA. There is no statutory basis for concluding that district courts\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    award solatium damages in the amounts that\n    <em>\n     Heiser\n    </em>\n    found commonly granted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <em>\n     Heiser\n    </em>\n    reflects a reasonable effort to chart solatium award baselines, but the figures merely reflect the summary of\n    judgments in prior cases-many of which, like this case, were not the product of contested litigation.
