We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2010, Ervin was sixteen and living at the home of his grandfather. On June 4, 2010, Ervin's half-brothers, five-year-old T.L.E. and twenty-month-old J.M.E., were dropped off by their mother so that Ervin and his grandfather could watch the boys while she attended school. Prior to dropping the boys off, their mother had changed J.M.E.'s diaper, but did not notice anything unusual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ervin's grandfather and T.L.E. went outside to work, leaving Ervin and J.M.E. alone in the house. T.L.E. came inside and found Ervin and J.M.E. in the kitchen. J.M.E. was not wearing a diaper and had blood running down his leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   J.M.E. and T.L.E.'s mother called to check on the boys. When T.L.E. answered the phone, she could hear J.M.E. screaming in the background. Ervin also spoke to her and told her that J.M.E. was being fussy. Upon arriving to pick up the boys, she asked how the boys had behaved, and Ervin told her that J.M.E. had \"pooped all over him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After arriving home, J.M.E.'s mother noticed that he had blood on his foot. J.M.E.'s father had also left her a voicemail telling her that he had spoken to\n   Ervin, who had said that J.M.E. had a bump on his bottom that they might want to look at. J.M.E.'s mother checked his diaper and saw that J.M.E. \"had stuff dangling from his bottom. It looked like he had been ripped open from the inside out and he had blood all over his diaper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   J.M.E.'s mother took him to the emergency room, after which he was transferred to the children's hospital for treatment. J.M.E. had bruising and swelling around his rectal area. An endoscopy also showed that J.M.E. had mucosal fissures in the lining of his anus. A physician who specializes in child abuse and malnutrition examined J.M.E. and concluded that his \"injuries were consistent with or indicative of penetrating anal trauma.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ervin was interviewed that same day by Detective Brandin Caid, an investigator with the sheriff's department. We recite the facts of the interview as set forth in the Missouri Court of Appeals opinion. Detective Caid read Ervin his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, which Ervin voluntarily waived. Caid asked Ervin about his interactions with J.M.E. that day. Caid explained J.M.E.'s injuries to Ervin, and Ervin initially answered Caid's questions. When Caid asked if Ervin knew how J.M.E. was injured, Ervin did not respond. Caid repeated his question, to which Ervin replied, \"That's what this whole thing is about?\" Detective Caid explained to Ervin that they were trying to figure out how J.M.E. sustained his injuries. Ervin paused and then stated that he did not want to talk anymore. The interview thereafter ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Charges were brought against Ervin in Missouri state court. Ervin filed a motion in limine to preclude the playing of the portion of his video interview in which he remained silent and invoked his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. The trial court denied the motion. During its opening statement, the state referred to the interview, stating in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Detective Caid is explaining the injury that [J.M.E.] has at this point to [Ervin] during the interview, and he tells him, I want to know how these injuries happened to [J.M.E.]. [Ervin] stops, looks at the detective for several seconds, and says, that's what this is about?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defense counsel renewed the objection during the state's examination of Caid, but the objection was again overruled. The video was thereafter played for the jury in its entirety. After the video ended, the state asked Caid, \"Detective, did that conclude your interview of [Ervin]?\" to which Caid responded, \"It did.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The state again referred to the interview in its closing statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Ervin's] statement that he made to Detective Brandin Caid. He admits some things in that statement itself. You can listen to that statement again when you go back there if you like. Any of this evidence that you want to take with you, you can take it with you to look at. [Ervin] tells us he was with [J.M.E.] that day, in the house. [T.L.E.] was outside with grandpa. He even admits that [T.L.E.] walks in the second time when he's changing [J.M.E.]. The defendant admits that the second time when he's changing [J.M.E.] that [J.M.E.] poops on him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following his conviction, Ervin filed a direct appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals, arguing that the trial court had violated his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process in overruling his objection regarding the interview. The court affirmed the conviction, concluding that Ervin's post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence was properly admitted because it did not create an impermissible inference of guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The district court thus did not err in denying Ervin habeas relief on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ervin argues in the alternative that he should be granted habeas relief because the adjudication of his claim involved an unreasonable determination of the facts. Under \u00a7 2254(d)(2), \"habeas relief can be available if the conviction at issue is based on findings of fact that could not reasonably be derived from the state court evidentiary record.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnes v.

In addition to recounting the evidence set forth above, the court noted that Ervin was not wearing a shirt when T.L.E. entered the house and told T.L.E. not to tell anyone what he had seen; that law enforcement discovered J.M.E.'s blood on the kitchen carpet of Ervin's home; and that J.M.E.'s injuries are consistent with penetrating anal trauma.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092864,7092889\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/398/95/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Ervin disputes the court's characterization of the evidence of his guilt as overwhelming. He argues that the court ignored the fact that he had not confessed, that there were no eyewitnesses to the offense, that no evidence of any penetrating object was ever presented, that no blood or semen was detected in his underwear, that T.L.E. said that he poked J.M.E. with a pointer, that there were some inconsistencies in T.L.E.'s statements, and that T.L.E. never told anyone that he saw Ervin harm J.M.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Whatever the force of Ervin's recital of the evidence or the lack thereof, it does not rebut by clear and convincing evidence the presumption of correctness in the state court's factual findings. The determination by the Missouri Court of Appeals that any error was harmless did not constitute an unreasonable determination of the facts, and thus any error in admitting the video did not have a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict, foreclosing any entitlement to habeas relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The Honorable E.
