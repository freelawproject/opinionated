Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 7, 2014, Mario Lee was released from prison in New York, having been convicted for selling crack cocaine to an undercover police officer. Within months of his release, federal and state law enforcement in Maine discovered that Lee was participating in an ongoing conspiracy to distribute heroin there. Lee would obtain heroin from outside Maine and would transport it back to Maine to be distributed by himself and others. On September 3, 2015, Lee was arrested. He was charged with four counts of distribution of heroin, and one count of conspiracy to distribute heroin. Facing a possible life sentence, Lee pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute 100 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing heroin, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and 846. The plea agreement struck by the government and Lee, due to Lee's undisputed career offender status under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, had the effect of setting his guideline range at 120 to 240 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At Lee's sentencing, and in its sentencing memorandum, the government presented and summarized evidence from its investigation to support a 1.3 kilogram drug quantity determination, as recommended by the PSR. This evidence included the grand jury testimony or interviews of nine witnesses who connected Lee to large quantities of heroin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lee objected to the drug quantity estimates in the PSR based on the government's witness statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike other cases where drug\n   quantity comes up as an issue, in this case the district court noted, and counsel for the government and Lee agreed, that Lee's PSR objections would not affect the guidelines calculations because Lee's undisputed status as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 superseded those considerations. However, the district court said that drug quantity could be relevant to the actual sentence imposed under the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To hear Lee tell it, the witnesses' statements, which were not subject to cross-examination in the grand jury or the prosecutor's office, had inconsistencies. These inconsistencies all amounted to arguing either that the witnesses exaggerated the period of time they were acquainted with Lee when he was selling heroin in Maine or the amount of heroin the witnesses knew Lee had possessed. Lee concluded that that made them too unreliable to be considered. While noting these discrepancies, the district court found that the witnesses' statements were credible, corroborating locations, associates, and drugs connected to Lee, and adopted the PSR's recommended 1.3 kilograms as the drug quantity. The district court considered the drug quantity in imposing Lee's 218-month sentence rather than a more lenient one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, Lee complains only about the drug quantity the district court attributed to him. According to Lee, SI-1, SI-2, SI-3, SI-4, and SI-5, whose testimony supported the PSR's drug quantity recommendation, were inherently unreliable. Even worse, Lee says that considering these unreliable statements would risk \"double counting,\" incorrectly ballooning the drug amounts attributable to him by considering the testimony of multiple witnesses that could relate to the same drugs. To Lee, considering this evidence despite the shortcomings he identified was procedural sentencing error. As a part of his argument that the witness statements are unreliable, Lee believes that the witness statements are especially so because they are out-of-court statements from either grand jury testimony or proffer interviews with the government. Thus, Lee concludes, if the district court had required the government to produce these witnesses for live testimony at sentencing, as he requested below, the district court could not have possibly believed them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We must ensure that the sentence imposed by the district court was \"procedurally sound.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    D\u00e1vila-Gonz\u00e1lez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215492\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/42/#p47\">\n    595 F.3d 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47 (1st Cir. 2010) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702229\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/87/#p92\">\n    520 F.3d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 92 (1st Cir. 2008) ).

Lee's argument is way off base. A defendant's rights under the Confrontation Clause do not attach during sentencing.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    D\u00edaz-Arias\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575429\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1/#p26\">\n    717 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26-27 (1st Cir. 2013). And for a while now, we have held that a sentencing court may consider hearsay statements of confidential informants if they otherwise show sufficient indicia of reliability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8913137\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/64/#p66\">\n    426 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   67 ;\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tardiff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519368\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/969/1283/#p1287\">\n    969 F.2d 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1287 (1st Cir. 1992),\n   <em>\n    superseded by amendment to U.S.S.G. on other grounds\n   </em>\n   , U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3,\n   <em>\n    as recognized in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reccko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11709063\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/29/#p33\">\n    151 F.3d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 33 (1st Cir. 1998). We see no error here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The witnesses' statements concerning Lee's heroin distribution were detailed, internally consistent, and mutually corroborative in important ways. In particular, the statements were mutually corroborative about the specific locations where he stashed and sold heroin, including multiple descriptions of a trailer on Essex Street in Bangor, Maine, restaurants in Bangor such as the \"Sea Dog\" and \"Carolina's,\" a residence at Maxim Court in Bangor, and a residence in Old Town, Maine. Multiple witnesses also corroborated the names of Lee's associates and \"runners\" (drug deliverers). We have already held that a sentencing court can rely on evidence with indicia like this.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8913137\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/64/#p66\">\n    426 F.3d at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming sentencing court's reliance on statements corroborating names of associates and locations used by defendant). Some witnesses also personally witnessed Lee possessing and distributing heroin himself. We have affirmed reliance on evidence showing far less.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zapata\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500581\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/475/#p485\">\n    589 F.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 485-86 (1st Cir. 2009) (affirming drug quantity on basis of intercepted phone calls discussing drug quantity in code when defendant was never found in possession of drugs). The alleged inconsistencies\n   Lee identifies-all relating to the witnesses' knowledge of the amount of time Lee was in Maine or how many drugs he was connected to-are not enough to torpedo the district court's findings. In fact, some of the inconsistencies are just mistakes that the witness corrected later.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is not clear error that the sentencing court weighed other indicia of reliability and found them to be more significant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mills\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3551202\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/5/#p15\">\n    710 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   16 &amp; n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Any possibility of a reversible error due to witness reliability or double counting is negated even more by the narrowness of the drug quantity calculation. In an act of lenity to Lee's benefit, the PSR's 1.3 kilogram drug quantity accounted for the possibility of any exaggerations or double counting by the witnesses in its estimate. The PSR: (i) only considered a six-month window of SI-1's transactions with Lee, accounting for when Lee was released from prison in New York and when it was alleged he was not in Maine for eight months; (ii) did not consider the suitcases of heroin Lee's cousin delivered to him as corroborated by SI-4 in order to avoid double counting; (iii) only considered a six-month window of transactions corroborated by SI-5, even reducing the drug quantity per transaction, to ensure lenity; (iv) for no stated reason but to Lee's benefit, did not consider any drug quantities corroborated by SI-6, SI-7, or SI-8; and (v) discounted the \"bundles\" of heroin Lee sold to represent .25 grams each in the calculation, rather than 1 gram as multiple witnesses testified. In sum, the sentencing court adopted the PSR's \"modest and defensible assumptions\" to avoid precisely the errors Lee claims were made.\n   <em>\n    Cintr\u00f3n-Echautegui\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228588\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/604/1/#p6\">\n    604 F.3d at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court's reliance on the witness statements and its adoption of a narrowly tailored drug quantity determination supported by that evidence were reasonable.

While in\n    <em>\n     Carl\n    </em>\n    , the statements of drug addicts who bought crack cocaine from the defendant were subject to cross-examination at trial before being used for drug quantity purposes at sentencing, nothing in that opinion would suggest that cross-examination at trial is dispositive or even considered in our deferential review of the sentencing court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517788\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/593/115/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517788\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/593/115/\">\n     at 122-23\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

As the government points out, SI-1 corrected this belief later in her testimony, amending that she had dealt with Lee for eighteen months to two years. Inconsistencies like these do not compete in weight or relevance with the factors the district court found reliable in the witness testimony, and that we find reliable here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
