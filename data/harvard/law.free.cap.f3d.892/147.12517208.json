ODonnell alleged the County's system of setting bail for indigent misdemeanor arrestees violated Texas statutory and constitutional law, as well as the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. ODonnell moved for a preliminary injunction, and the County moved for summary judgment. After eight days of hearings, at which the parties presented numerous fact and expert witnesses and voluminous written evidence, the district court denied the County's summary judgment motion and granted ODonnell's motion for a preliminary injunction. The County then applied to this court for a stay of the injunction pending appeal, but the motion was denied, and the injunction went into effect. Before this court now is the County's appeal, seeking vacatur of the injunction and raising numerous legal challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For the reasons set forth, we affirm most of the district court's rulings, including its conclusion that ODonnell established a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims that the County's policies violate procedural due process and equal protection. We disagree, however, with the district court's analysis in three respects: First, its definition of ODonnell's liberty interest under due process was too broad, and the procedures it required to protect that interest were too onerous. Second, it erred by concluding that the County Sheriff can be considered a County policymaker under \u00a7 1983. Finally, the district court's injunction was overbroad. As a result, we will vacate the injunction and order the district court to modify its terms in a manner consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We need not conduct an exhaustive review of the facts. The district court's account is expansive: It comprised over 120 pages of factual findings, including not only the specific details of the County's bail-setting procedures, but also the history of bail and recent reform attempts nationwide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Bail in Texas is either secured or unsecured. Secured bail requires the arrestee to post bond either out of the arrestee's pocket or from a third-party surety (often bail bondsmen, who generally require a 10% non-refundable premium in exchange for posting bond). Unsecured bail, by contrast, allows the arrestee to be released without posting bond, but if he fails to attend his court date and/or comply with any nonfinancial bail conditions, he becomes liable to the County for the bail amount. Both secured and unsecured bail may also include nonfinancial conditions to assure the detainee's attendance at future hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The basic procedural framework governing the administration of bail in Harris County is set by the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure and local rules promulgated by County Judges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 75.403(f). When a misdemeanor defendant is arrested, the prosecutor submits a secured bail amount according to a bond schedule established by County Judges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Harris County Criminal Courts at Law Rule 9 (\n   <em>\n    hereinafter\n   </em>\n   , \"Local Rule\"). Bonds are then formally set by Hearing Officers and County Judges. Tex. Code. Crim. Pro. art. 2.09, 17.15. Hearing Officers are generally responsible for setting bail amounts in the first instance. This often occurs during the arrestee's initial probable cause hearing, which must be held within 24 hours of arrest. Tex. Code Crim. Pro. art. 17.033 ; Local Rule 4.2.1.1. County Judges review the Hearing Officers' determinations and can adjust bail amounts at a \"Next Business Day\" hearing. Local Rule 4.3.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Hearing Officers and County Judges are legally proscribed from mechanically applying the bail schedule to a given arrestee. Instead, the Texas Code requires officials to conduct an individualized review based on five enumerated factors, which include the defendant's ability to pay, the charge, and community safety. Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. art. 17.15. The Local Rules explicitly state the schedule is not mandatory. They also authorize a similar, individualized assessment using factors which partially overlap with those listed in the Code. Local Rule 4.2.4. Hearing Officers and County Judges sometimes receive assessments by Pretrial Services, which interviews the detainees prior to hearings, calculates the detainees flight and safety risk based on a point system, and then makes specific recommendations regarding bail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Despite these formal requirements, the district court found that, in practice, County procedures were dictated by an unwritten custom and practice that was marred by gross inefficiencies, did not achieve any individualized assessment in setting bail, and was incompetent to do so. The district court noted that the statutorily-mandated probable cause hearing (where bail is usually set) frequently does not occur within 24 hours of arrest. The hearings often last seconds, and rarely more than a few minutes. Arrestees are instructed not to\n   speak, and are not offered any opportunity to submit evidence of relative ability to post bond at the scheduled amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court found that the results of this flawed procedural framework demonstrate the lack of individualized assessments when officials set bail. County officials \"impose the scheduled bail amounts on a secured basis about 90 percent of the time. When [they] do change the bail amount, it is often to conform the amount to what is in the bail schedule.\" The court further found that, when Pretrial Services recommends release on personal bond, Hearing Officers reject the suggestion 66% of the time. Because less than 10% of misdemeanor arrestees are assigned an unsecured personal bond, some amount of upfront payment is required for release in the vast majority of cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court also found that the \"Next Business Day\" hearing before a County Judge fails to provide a meaningful review of the Hearing Officer's bail determinations. Arrestees routinely must wait days for their hearings. County Judges adjust bail amounts or grant unsecured bonds in less than 1% of cases. Furthermore, prosecutors routinely offer time-served plea bargains at the hearing, and arrestees are under immense pressure to accept the plea deals or else remain incarcerated for days or weeks until they are appointed a lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court further noted the various ways in which the imposition of secured bail specifically targets poor arrestees. For example, under the County's risk-assessment point system used by Pretrial Services, poverty indicators (such as not owning a car) receive the same point value as prior criminal violations or prior failures to appear in court. Thus, an arrestee's impoverishment increased the likelihood he or she would need to pay to be released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The court also observed that Hearing Officers imposed secured bails upon arrestees after having been made aware of an arrestee's indigence by the risk-assessment reports or by the arrestee's own statements. And further, after extensive review of numerous bail hearings, the court concluded Hearing Officers were aware that, by imposing a secured bail on indigent arrestees, they were ensuring that those arrestees would remain detained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court rejected the argument that imposing secured bonds served the County's interest in ensuring the arrestee appeared at the future court date and committed no further crime. The court's review of reams of empirical data suggested the opposite: that \"release on secured financial conditions does not assure better rates of appearance or of law-abiding conduct before trial compared to release on unsecured bonds or nonfinancial conditions of supervision.\" Instead, the County's true purpose was \"to achieve pretrial detention of misdemeanor defendants who are too poor to pay, when those defendants would promptly be released if they could pay.\" In short, \"secured money bail function[ed] as a pretrial detention order\" against the indigent misdemeanor arrestees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court also reviewed voluminous empirical data and academic literature to evaluate the impact of pretrial detention on an arrestee. The court found that the expected outcomes for an arrestee who cannot afford to post bond are significantly worse than for those arrestees who can. In general, indigent arrestees who remain incarcerated because they cannot make bail are significantly more likely to plead guilty and to be sentenced to imprisonment. They also receive sentences that are on average twice as long as their bonded\n   counterparts. Furthermore, the district court found that pretrial detention can lead to loss of job, family stress, and even an increase in likeliness to commit crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court concluded that ODonnell had established a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the County violated both the procedural due process rights and the equal protection rights of indigent misdemeanor detainees. It granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, requiring the implementation of new safeguards and the release of numerous detainees subjected to the insufficient procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This court reviews a \"district court's grant of a preliminary injunction ... for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Women's Med.

Texas law explicitly establishes that the Judges are \"county officers,\" TEX. CONST. art. V \u00a7 24, imbued with broad authority to promulgate rules that will dictate post-arrest policies consistent with the provisions of state law, Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 75.403(f). Here, ODonnell alleged that, despite having this authority, County Judges acquiesced in an unwritten, countywide process for setting bail that violated\n   both state law and the Constitution. In other words, they sue the County Judges as municipal officers in their capacity as county policymakers. Section 1983 affords them an appropriate basis to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We agree with the County that its Sheriff is not an appropriate party for attaching municipal liability, however. The Sheriff does not have the same policymaking authority as the County Judges. To the contrary, the Sheriff is legally obliged to execute all lawful process and cannot release prisoners committed to jail by a magistrate's warrant-even if prisoners are committed \"for want of bail.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Code Crim. Pro. arts. 2.13, 2.16, 2.18 ; Tex. Loc. Gov't Code \u00a7 351.041(a) (noting the Sheriff's authority is \"subject to an order of the proper court\"). State statutes, in other words, do not authorize the County Sheriff to avoid executing judicial orders imposing secured bail by unilaterally declaring them unconstitutional. Accordingly, the County Sheriff does not qualify as a municipal policymaker under \u00a7 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n   Younger\n   <em>\n    Abstention\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The County next argues that\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention precludes our review of ODonnell's claims.

On the other hand, Texas courts have repeatedly emphasized the importance of bail as a means of protecting an accused detainee's constitutional right \"in remaining free before trial,\" which allows for the \"unhampered preparation of a defense, and ... prevent[s] the infliction of punishment prior to conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Anderer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457294\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/61/398/#p404\">\n    61 S.W.3d 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404-05 (Tex.

Under Texas law, judicial officers ... have no authority or discretion to order pretrial preventive detention in misdemeanor cases.\" This is too broad a reading of the law. The Constitution creates a right to bail on \"sufficient sureties,\" which includes both a concern for the arrestee's interest in pretrial freedom and the court's interest in assurance. Since bail is not purely defined by what the detainee can afford,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Charlesworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9934158\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/600/316/#p317\">\n    600 S.W.2d at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the constitutional provision forbidding denial of release on bail for misdemeanor arrestees does not create an automatic right to pretrial release.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Instead, Texas state law creates a right to bail that appropriately weighs the detainees' interest in pretrial release and the court's interest in securing the detainee's attendance. Yet, as noted, state law forbids the setting of bail as an \"instrument of oppression.\" Thus, magistrates may not impose a secured bail solely for the purpose of detaining the accused. And, when the accused is indigent, setting a secured bail will, in most cases, have the same effect as a detention order. Accordingly, such decisions must reflect a careful weighing of the individualized factors set forth by both the state Code of Criminal Procedure and Local Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Having found a state-created interest, we turn now to whether the procedures in place adequately protect that interest. As always, we are guided by a\n   three-part balancing test that looks to \"the private interest ... affected by the official action\"; \"the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedure used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards\"; and \"the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens\" that new procedures would impose.\n   <em>\n    Meza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683888\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/392/#p399\">\n    607 F.3d at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mathews v.

The court's factual findings (which are not clearly erroneous) demonstrate that secured bail orders are imposed almost automatically on indigent arrestees. Far from demonstrating sensitivity to the indigent misdemeanor defendants' ability to pay, Hearing Officers and County Judges almost always set a bail amount that detains the indigent. In other words, the current procedure does not sufficiently protect detainees from magistrates imposing bail as an \"instrument of oppression.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The district court laid out specific procedures necessary to satisfy constitutional due process when setting bail. Specifically, it found that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Due process requires: (1) notice that the financial and other resource information Pretrial Services officers collect is for the purpose of determining a misdemeanor arrestee's eligibility for release or detention; (2) a hearing at which the arrestee has an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence; (3) an impartial decisionmaker; (4) a written statement by the factfinder as to the evidence relied on to find that a secured financial condition is the only reasonable way to assure the arrestee's appearance at hearings and law-abiding behavior before trial; and (5) timely proceedings within 24 hours of arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The County challenges these requirements on appeal.

Our review of the due process right at issue here counsels against an expansion of the right already afforded detainees under the Fourth Amendment by\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   . We note in particular that the heavy administrative burden of a 24-hour requirement on the County is evidenced by the district court's own finding: the fact that 20% of detainees do not receive a probable cause hearing within 24 hours despite the statutory requirement. Imposing the same requirement for bail would only exacerbate such issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The court's conclusion was also based on its interpretation of state law. But while state law may define liberty interests protected under the procedural due process clause, it does not define the procedure constitutionally required to protect that interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wansley v.

Accordingly, although the parties contest\n   whether state law imposes a 24- or 48-hour requirement, we need not resolve this issue because state law procedural requirements do not impact our federal due process analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The district court's definition of ODonnell's liberty interests is too broad, and the procedural protections it required are too strict. Nevertheless, even under our more forgiving framework, we agree that the County procedures violate ODonnell's due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    B. Equal Protection\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The district court held that the County's bail-setting procedures violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because they treat otherwise similarly-situated misdemeanor arrestees differently based solely on their relative wealth. The County makes three separate arguments against this holding. It argues: (1) ODonnell's disparate impact theory is not cognizable under the equal protection clause,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"695061\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/110/299/#p306\">\n    110 F.3d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 306 (5th Cir. 1997) ; (2) rational basis review applies and is satisfied; (3) even if heightened scrutiny applies, it is satisfied. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   First, the district court did not conclude that the County policies and procedures violated the equal protection clause solely on the basis of their disparate impact. Instead, it found the County's custom and practice purposefully \"detain[ed] misdemeanor defendants before trial who are otherwise eligible for release, but whose indigence makes them unable to pay secured financial conditions of release.\" The conclusion of a discriminatory purpose was evidenced by numerous, sufficiently supported factual findings, including direct evidence from bail hearings. This custom and practice resulted in detainment solely due to a person's indigency because the financial conditions for release are based on predetermined amounts beyond a person's ability to pay and without any \"meaningful consideration of other possible alternatives.\"\n   <em>\n    Rainwater\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1234701\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/572/1053/#p1057\">\n    572 F.2d at 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under this circuit's binding precedent, the district court was therefore correct to conclude that this discriminatory action was unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1234701\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/572/1053/#p1057\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1234701\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/572/1053/#p1057\">\n    at 1056-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that pretrial \"imprisonment solely because of indigent status is invidious discrimination and not constitutionally permissible\" under both \"due process and equal protection requirements\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

Because this conclusion is sufficient to decide this case, we need not determine whether the equal protection clause requires a categorical bar on secured money bail for indigent misdemeanor arrestees who cannot pay it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, the district court's application of intermediate scrutiny was not in error. It is true that, ordinarily, \"[n]either prisoners nor indigents constitute a suspect class.\"\n   <em>\n    Carson v.

Reviewing this case law, the Supreme Court\n   later noted that indigents receive a heightened scrutiny where two conditions are met: (1) \"because of their impecunity they were completely unable to pay for some desired benefit,\" and (2) \"as a consequence, they sustained an absolute deprivation of a meaningful opportunity to enjoy that benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    San Antonio Indep.

Both aspects of the\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   analysis apply here: indigent misdemeanor arrestees are unable to pay secured bail, and, as a result, sustain an absolute deprivation of their most basic liberty interests-freedom from incarceration. Moreover, this case presents the same basic injustice: poor arrestees in Harris County are incarcerated where similarly situated wealthy arrestees are not, solely because the indigent cannot afford to pay a secured bond. Heightened scrutiny of the County's policy is appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Third, we discern no error in the court's conclusion that the County's policy failed to meet the tailoring requirements of intermediate scrutiny. In other words, we will not disturb the court's finding that, although the County had a compelling interest in the assurance of a misdemeanor detainee's future appearance and lawful behavior, its policy was not narrowly tailored to meet that interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The court's thorough review of empirical data and studies found that the County had failed to establish any \"link between financial conditions of release and appearance at trial or law-abiding behavior before trial.\" For example, both parties' experts agreed that the County lacked adequate data to demonstrate whether secured bail was more effective than personal bonds in securing a detainee's future appearance. Notably, even after analyzing the incomplete data that were available, neither expert discerned more than a negligible comparative impact on detainees' attendance. Additionally, the court considered a comprehensive study of the impact of Harris County's bail system on the behavior of misdemeanor detainees between 2008 and 2013. The study found that the imposition of secured bail might\n   <em>\n    increase\n   </em>\n   the likelihood of unlawful behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Paul Heaton et al.,\n   <em>\n    The Downstream Consequences of Misdemeanor Pretrial Detention\n   </em>\n   , 69 STAN. L. REV. 711, 786-87 (2017) (estimating that the release on personal bond of the lowest-risk detainees would have resulted in 1,600 fewer felonies and 2,400 fewer misdemeanors within the following eighteen months). These findings mirrored those of various empirical studies from other jurisdictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The County, of course, challenges these assertions with empirical studies of its own. But its studies at best cast some doubt on the court's conclusions. They do not establish clear error. We are satisfied that the court had sufficient evidence to\n   conclude that Harris County's use of secured bail violated equal protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In sum, the essence of the district court's equal protection analysis can be boiled down to the following: take two misdemeanor arrestees who are identical in every way-same charge, same criminal backgrounds, same circumstances, etc.-except that one is wealthy and one is indigent. Applying the County's current custom and practice, with their lack of individualized assessment and mechanical application of the secured bail schedule, both arrestees would almost certainly receive identical secured bail amounts. One arrestee is able to post bond, and the other is not. As a result, the wealthy arrestee is less likely to plead guilty, more likely to receive a shorter sentence or be acquitted, and less likely to bear the social costs of incarceration. The poor arrestee, by contrast, must bear the brunt of all of these, simply because he has less money than his wealthy counterpart. The district court held that this state of affairs violates the equal protection clause, and we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Having largely affirmed the district court's determinations that constitutional violations occurred, we turn to the court's remedy. When crafting an injunction, district courts are guided by the Supreme Court's instruction that \"the scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the violation established.\"\n   <em>\n    Califano v. Yamasaki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531947\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/682/#p702\">\n    442 U.S. 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 702,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531947\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/682/#p702\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531947\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/682/#p702\">\n    61 L.Ed.2d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979).

We agree. There is a significant mismatch between the district court's procedure-focused legal analysis and the sweeping injunction it implemented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The fundamental source of constitutional deficiency in the due process and equal protection analyses is the same: the County's mechanical application of the secured bail schedule without regard for the individual arrestee's personal circumstances. Thus, the equitable remedy necessary to cure the constitutional infirmities arising under both clauses is the same: the County must implement the constitutionally-necessary procedures to engage in a case-by-case evaluation of a given arrestee's circumstances, taking into account the various factors required by Texas state law (only one of which is ability to pay). These procedures are: notice, an opportunity to be heard and submit evidence within 48 hours of arrest, and a reasoned decision by an impartial decisionmaker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   That is not what the preliminary injunction does, however. Rather, it amounts to the outright elimination of secured bail for indigent misdemeanor arrestees. That remedy makes some sense if one assumes a fundamental substantive due process right to be free from any form of wealth-based detention. But, as the foregoing analysis establishes, no such right is in view. The sweeping injunction is overbroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We therefore conclude that the district court abused its discretion in crafting an injunction that was not \"narrowly tailor[ed] ... to remedy the specific action which gives rise to the order.\"\n   <em>\n    Veneman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9213099\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/380/807/#p818\">\n    380 F.3d at 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If a misdemeanor defendant has executed an affidavit showing an inability to pay prescheduled money bail and has not been released either: (1) on an unsecured personal bond with nonfinancial conditions of release; or (2) on a secured money bond for which the defendant could pay a commercial surety's premium, as indicated on the affidavit, then the defendant is entitled to a hearing within 48 hours of arrest in which an impartial decision-maker conducts an individual assessment of whether another amount of bail or other condition provides sufficient sureties. At the hearing, the arrestee must have an opportunity to describe evidence in his or her favor, and to respond to evidence described or presented by law enforcement. If the decision-maker declines to lower bail from the prescheduled amount to an amount the arrestee is able to pay, then the decisionmaker must provide written factual findings or factual findings on the record explaining the reason for the decision, and the County must provide the arrestee with a formal adversarial bail review hearing before a County Judge. The Harris County Sheriff is therefore authorized to decline to enforce orders requiring payment of prescheduled bail amounts as a condition of release for said defendants if the orders are not accompanied by a record showing that the required individual assessment was made and an opportunity for formal review was provided.

If competence is found, the misdemeanor defendant is covered by the relief the court orders, with the exception that the 48-hour period begins to run from the finding of competence rather than from the time of arrest. As under Article 16.22, nothing in this order prevents the misdemeanor arrestee from being released on secured bail or unsecured personal bond pending the evaluation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For the forgoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's findings of fact. We AFFIRM its conclusions of law except its conclusion that the County Sheriff qualifies as a municipal policymaker under \u00a7 1983 and its determination of the specific procedural protections owed under procedural due process. On those issues, we REVERSE the district court's conclusions. Accordingly, we VACATE the preliminary injunction as overbroad and REMAND to the district court to craft a revised injunction-one that is narrowly tailored to cure the constitutional deficiencies the district\n   court properly identified. But we also STAY the vacatur pending implementation of the revised injunction, so as to maintain a stable status quo.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The parties use the term \"County Judges\" to refer to the judges of the County Criminal Courts of Harris County, and we will use that same term. This term does not refer to the County Judge who is the head of the County Commissioners' Court of Harris County.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Individualized assessment is also assured by a preexisting federal consent decree, which requires County officials to make individualized assessments of each misdemeanor defendant's case and adjust the scheduled bail amount accordingly, or else release the defendant on unsecured or nonfinancial conditions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The County also argues that we are precluded from reviewing ODonnell's claims because they should have been raised as a petition for habeas corpus.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Preiser v.

We agree with the district court that this argument has been waived. The County neither mentioned\n    <em>\n     Preiser\n    </em>\n    nor pressed the habeas argument until its motion for a stay of the injunction. The closest the County came to preserving this argument was one sentence in its response to ODonnell's motion for preliminary injunction. This passing reference is insufficient to preserve the argument, especially given that it is dispositive of the case at the threshold stage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    We also note that Texas courts have never sought to eliminate the use of bail bonds.
