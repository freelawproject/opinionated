Petitioners are Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), and its executive director, Melanie Sloan, a registered voter in the District of Columbia. They brought this action\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that the Commission acted \"contrary to law\" in 2015 when it dismissed their administrative\n   complaint against an unincorporated association whose name is too cumbersome to condense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   CREW's charges against the association, filed in 2011, were that the association had violated the federal election laws in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the district court, and now in this court, CREW invoked the judicial review provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act, or \"FECA\" as it is sometimes called. The provision states that the district court \"may declare that the dismissal of the complaint ... is contrary to law,\" and, if the Commission fails to correct the illegality on remand, the \"complainant may bring\" an action in its own name against the alleged violator \"to remedy the violation involved in the original [administrative] complaint.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CREW's petition in the district court also invoked the Administrative Procedure Act. The APA, enacted in 1946, states that a later statute-FECA is one-\"may not be held to supersede or modify ... chapter 7 ... except to the extent that it does so expressly.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20559\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . APA Chapter 7 contains the APA's judicial review provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 706. Rather than \"expressly\" contradicting those provisions, FECA is consistent with them. FECA's \"contrary to law\" formulation, for example, reflects APA \u00a7 706(2)(A), which requires the court to \"hold unlawful and set aside agency action\" that is \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We will have more to say about APA \u00a7 706 later in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Commission's dismissal of CREW's complaint constituted the \"agency action\" supporting the district court's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)(A). After the Commissioners voted 3 to 3 on whether to begin enforcement proceedings, the Commission closed the administrative file on the case. The deadlock meant that the Commission could not proceed: under FECA, the Commission may pursue enforcement only upon \"an affirmative vote of 4 of its members.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), (a)(4)(A)(i), (a)(6)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court held that the Commission's explanation of its failure to prosecute was a \"rational exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. FEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268059\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/378/#p397\">\n    236 F.Supp.3d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 397 (D.D.C. 2017). This raises a question: how can a court attribute to \"the Commission\" any particular rationale when the Commissioners were evenly split? The answer comes from\n   <em>\n    Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee v. FEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1768044,4332527\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/831/1131/\">\n    831 F.2d 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 1987), and its expansion in\n   <em>\n    Common Cause v. FEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10544001,4333797\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/842/436/\">\n    842 F.2d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 1988). Together, these cases establish two propositions of circuit law. The first is that if the Commission fails to muster four votes in favor of initiating an enforcement proceeding, the Commissioners who voted against taking that action should issue a statement explaining their votes.\n   <em>\n    Common Cause\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10544001,4333797\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/842/436/\">\n    842 F.2d at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The second is that, for purposes of judicial review, the statement or statements of those naysayers-the so-called \"controlling Commissioners\"-will be treated as if they were expressing the Commission's rationale for dismissal, a\n   rather apparent fiction raising problems of its own.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10544001,4333797\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/842/436/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Here, the three Commissioners who voted not to begin enforcement proceedings issued a joint statement explaining their votes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   These Commissioners were concerned that the statute of limitations had expired or was about to; that the association named in CREW's complaint no longer existed; that the association had filed termination papers with the IRS four years earlier; that it had no money; that its counsel had resigned; that the \"defunct\" association no longer had any agents who could legally bind it; and that any action against the association would raise \"novel legal issues that the Commission had no briefing or time to decide.\" For these reasons, the \"case did not warrant further use of Commission resources.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In short, these Commissioners would have exercised the agency's prerogative not to proceed with enforcement. There is no doubt the Commission possesses such prosecutorial discretion. Although today \"prosecutorial\" usually refers to criminal proceedings, it was not always so. Under the APA, agency attorneys who bring civil enforcement actions are engaged in \"prosecuting functions,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    3M Co. v.

In a frequently quoted passage, which is set forth in the margin,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Supreme Court recited many of the reasons why an agency's exercise of its prosecutorial discretion cannot be subjected to judicial scrutiny. At this point in its\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   opinion, the Court added a caveat. An agency's decision not to undertake enforcement \"is only presumptively unreviewable; the presumption may be rebutted where the substantive statute has provided guidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers.\"\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p831\">\n    470 U.S. at 832-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p831\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Webster v.

The three naysayers on the Commission placed their judgment squarely on the ground of prosecutorial discretion. Nothing in the substantive statute overcomes the presumption against judicial review. FECA provides that \"the Commission may, upon an affirmative vote of 4 of its members, institute a civil action ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A). To state the obvious, the word \"may\" imposes no constraints on the Commission's judgment about whether, in a particular matter, it should bring an enforcement action. Nor do the adjacent sections directing that the Commission \"shall\" take specific actions after making certain threshold legal determinations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), (a)(4)(A)(i). Neither of those sections constrain the Commission's discretion whether to make those legal determinations in the first instance. The consequence is that the operative \"statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p831\">\n    470 U.S. at 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p831\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rather than confronting\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   and the many other cases applying \u00a7 701(a)(2), CREW sweeps these precedents off the table. With the way thus cleared, it argues that whenever the Commission exercises its prosecutorial discretion to decline an enforcement action, it acts \"contrary to law.\" Implicit is the idea that even if the Commission's exercise of prosecutorial discretion\n   is immune from judicial questioning, this does not close the door. Instead, it triggers FECA's \"citizen-suit\" provision, which entitles a private entity to bring an enforcement action when the Commission has declined to do so.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   CREW's argument contradicts the principle that an agency's exercise of prosecutorial discretion is not subject to judicial review. It contradicts this principle because a court may not authorize a citizen suit unless it first determines that the Commission acted \"contrary to law\" under FECA or under the APA's equivalent \"not in accordance with law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)(C) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). Yet to make this determination, a court necessarily must subject the Commission's exercise of discretion to judicial review, which it cannot do. That is enough to reject CREW's argument, but two other dispositive points deserve mention. While insisting that the Commission's discretionary decisions not to prosecute are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   \"contrary to law,\" CREW never identifies what \"law\" it has in mind. For the reasons already given, the \"law\" cannot be FECA. And it cannot be the APA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   CREW's argument also flies in the face of\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   's holding that \u00a7 701(a)(2) bars judicial review when there is no \"law\" to apply in judging how and when an agency should exercise its discretion,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p831\">\n    470 U.S. at 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p831\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Overton Park\n   </em>\n   , 401 U.S. at 410,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712629\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/402/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Webster v.

The dissent's position contradicts the record, which is doubtless why neither party mentioned it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   But even if\n   some statutory interpretation could be teased out of the Commissioners' statement of reasons, the dissent would still be mistaken in subjecting the dismissal of CREW's complaint to judicial review.

My colleagues do not believe that the Commission made any legal decision, so\n   <em>\n    a fortiori\n   </em>\n   they see nothing \"contrary to law\" and no reason to remand. But the Commissioners voted on a legal recommendation by the General Counsel and explained their rejection of that recommendation: According to the Controlling Commissioners, the facts did not add up to legal \"reason to believe\" that the investigated organization-the Commission on Hope, Growth and Opportunity (CHGO)-may have operated as a \"political committee.\" Because it was, in my view, clearly contrary to FECA to find no \"reason to believe\" on these facts, I would reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment and remand to the Commission. I believe that it is evident from the Controlling Commissioners' finding and reasoning that their dismissal of CHGO's case depended materially on an erroneous legal view of the organization's political-committee status. If, as my colleagues think, the Commissioners did not base their dismissal on a legal interpretation, the agency could readily explain as much on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The majority also makes a broader legal error not teed up by any party. The FEC, defending its action as legally correct and reasonable, nevertheless acknowledged that \"Commission decisions not to prosecute, unlike those of most agencies, remain subject to judicial review.\" FEC Br. 27. The majority, unbidden, departs from that well-established principle. Because this case, properly understood, is an unremarkable subject for judicial review under settled law, I spell out the nature of my disagreement. The court's energetic defense of the FEC's enforcement discretion in rejecting Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)'s particular theory of this case should not be taken to foreclose judicial review in similar cases in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Starting with a few key points of agreement will help to clarify where we differ:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , as the court acknowledges, and in keeping with our precedent, \"[t]he interpretation an agency gives to a statute is not committed to the agency's unreviewable discretion.\" Maj.

In planning documents, CHGO declared its goal to \"make a measurable impact on the election outcome in selectively identified Senate races,\" J.A. 520, \"us[ing] express advocacy in targeted Senate races,\" J.A. 514, and \"focusing on ... key districts to support the election of Republican candidates,\" J.A. 578;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   J.A. 514-15, 652.

In response to questioning from the FEC, CHGO's general counsel represented that he had \"no relevant information or records\" and \"did not know who would have that information\" in spite of repeated notices, previously sent by the Commission, instructing the organization to \"preserve records ... as required by law.\" J.A. 644 &amp; n.9.

The man listed as CHGO's Treasurer in its IRS application for tax-exempt status, J.A.794, reported that he handled some \"accounting and tax work\" for CHGO, but \"probably\" never interacted with the organization's putative president, J.A. 496.

If the Controlling Commissioners had not labored under a view of CHGO's political-committee status that was contrary to law, a majority might well have proceeded with that claim, too, as \"obvious.\" J.A. 769.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The majority miscasts this case in the\n   <em>\n    Heckler\n   </em>\n   mold. CREW admittedly sidestepped any argument on the \"reason to believe\" question-instead framing its case as a direct and wholesale challenge to the agency's enforcement discretion. So it is perhaps understandable that my colleagues turn to FECA Section 30109(a)(6)(A)'s separate provision granting the FEC discretion whether to file suit in federal court. The parties did not focus on, and the court leaves untouched, how the action the Commission took here-a vote keyed to a specific legal question,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"reason to believe\"-calls for judicial review. I trust that, in future cases, the court will continue, consistent with existing law, to review legal determinations that the Commissioners make when they vote on the merits of \"reason to believe\" or \"probable cause\" questions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)-(6) ; R.

There can be no serious claim that FECA equates a \"no reason to believe\" vote to an exercise of unfettered enforcement discretion. To the contrary, the Act explicitly provides for judicial review of dismissals based on those votes. On\n   <em>\n    Heckler\n   </em>\n   's own logic, then, FECA's constrained agency nonenforcement is judicially reviewable and, if contrary to law, subject to remand.\n   <em>\n    Heckler\n   </em>\n   , 470 U.S. at 833-34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p831\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It remains for us to conduct such review in future cases that warrant it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Under the correct standards, undeniable \"reason to believe\" that CHGO operated unlawfully as a political committee should have prompted further investigation and perhaps enforcement by the FEC. The court rests its decision today on its view that the FEC sidestepped the merits wholesale and exercised prosecutorial discretion untainted by an erroneous view of the law. Critically, the majority preserves judicial review where \"the Commission declines to bring an enforcement action on the basis of its interpretation of FECA.\" Maj Op. 441 n.11. I think this is such a case. I read the Controlling Commissioners as having held a clear but incorrect view of the law that informed their dismissal. That decision should have been reviewed, reversed, and remanded to the FEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Absent argument from any party, my colleagues have reached out to suggest that any Commission dismissal guided by discretionary considerations is unreviewable. I have here explained why FECA's statutory scheme-and its various limitations\n   on non-enforcement discretion-place cases like this one outside\n   <em>\n    Heckler\n   </em>\n   's ambit. I believe that, in future cases where the parties tee up this issue,\n   <em>\n    Heckler\n   </em>\n   will not bar our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The end of CHGO's story remains a mystery. The group dissolved within several months of learning that it remained the subject of FEC investigation. Political operatives involved with the group exchanged frantic emails stating that it was urgent to \"shut it down\" and \"[r]eally important ... to get this terminated ASAP.\" J.A. 636. The organization lasted only one federal election cycle and managed to slip into the shadows without the scrutiny FECA requires. But the court's holding today should not be mistaken to mean that other organizations may do the same.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
