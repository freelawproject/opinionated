Appellants point out that, since 1979, \"tens of thousands of peer-reviewed scientific studies have identified the causes and consequences of continued atmospheric warming and showed that coal combustion is the single greatest contributor to the growing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 3.

And the Secretary has not proposed to take any new action respecting the Program. In these circumstances, neither NEPA nor the APA requires the Secretary to update the PEIS for the Federal Coal Management Program. We therefore lack authority to compel the Secretary to do so.

The Secretary argues that the relevant actions here were the 1979 and 1982 final rules, and that they-like the plan in\n   <em>\n    SUWA\n   </em>\n   -were completed when promulgated. Appellants, in turn, argue that the action should be viewed as encompassing the Program broadly, including the leases and orders that the Department issues on an ongoing basis. On this view, there remains sufficient activity to occur as part of the Program to require supplementation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We agree with the Secretary that\n   <em>\n    SUWA\n   </em>\n   controls the disposition of this case. The Program here is functionally identical to the plan the Court evaluated in\n   <em>\n    SUWA\n   </em>\n   . In both cases, the agency established an approach for managing resources in the future. Under both the\n   <em>\n    SUWA\n   </em>\n   plan and the Federal Coal Management Program that is at issue in this case, the agency continued to engage in activities governed by the overarching scheme for which the initial EIS was prepared. As\n   <em>\n    SUWA\n   </em>\n   makes clear, the fact that actions continue to occur in compliance with the Program does not render the original action incomplete. Accordingly, the Department's NEPA obligation for the Federal Coal Management Program terminated with its adoption in 1979.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Appellants argue that because the Program is properly viewed as ongoing, it was not complete when approved. They point out that \"environmentally significant decisions plainly remained\" to be made in carrying out the Program, including in pricing future leases, allocating new leases, and issuing guidance and manuals. Appellants' Br. 34-35. Because \"[t]hese responsibilities ... lead directly to the mining and burning of federal coal,\" Appellants argue, the \"myriad 'environmentally significant' steps the agency continues to take\" demonstrate that there remains ongoing \"major Federal action\" under the Program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   This argument cannot be squared with the governing precedent. Neither\n   <em>\n    Marsh\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    SUWA\n   </em>\n   looked to decisions made pursuant to the relevant action in determining whether the duty to supplement applied. They looked instead to the status of the action itself. Appellants have failed to identify any specific pending action, apart from the Program's continued existence, that qualifies as a \"major Federal action\" under NEPA. So the only pertinent action for purposes of the court's analysis is the one for which that document was prepared-the adoption of the Federal Coal Management\n   Program. That action was completed when the Secretary issued the ROD and promulgated the final rule in 1979.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Appellants urge us to read\n   <em>\n    SUWA\n   </em>\n   narrowly, claiming that its holding applies only where, as there, a regulation specifically indicates that the approval of a plan is the relevant action for NEPA purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/\">\n    542 U.S. at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201601.0-6\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.0-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). They claim that because there is no similar regulation here,\n   <em>\n    SUWA\n   </em>\n   does not control. Appellant's view of the record is mistaken. The Secretary's 1979 Final Rule referred to \"the\n   <em>\n    adoption\n   </em>\n   of the Federal coal management program on June 1 and 2, 1979\" as \"a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment\" for which the 1979 EIS was published. 44 Fed. Reg. at 42,608 (emphasis added). And the PEIS identified the proposed action as \"the\n   <em>\n    adoption\n   </em>\n   of the ... Federal coal management program.\" PEIS at iv, J.A. 119 (emphasis added). Appellants provide no persuasive reason to treat the agency's definition of the action here differently than the regulation in\n   <em>\n    SUWA\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Appellants also assert that by deeming the Program's adoption to be the relevant \"major Federal action,\" we foreclose any challenge to the agency's failure to consider the cumulative climate impacts of federal coal leasing. They argue that doing so allows the Department to avoid its duty to study the impacts of its actions and justify its decision to the public. In Appellants' view, this outcome \"render[s] NEPA review [a] 'paperwork' formality,\" Appellants' Br. 34, and allows the Department to \"hide the ball indefinitely, leaving the public to guess at both the environmental costs of one of the Nation's predominant sources of carbon pollution and the agency's views on what many voting citizens believe to be the defining environmental-protection issue of our time,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We understand that Appellants' claims are not frivolous. As noted above, Appellants have pointed to significant scientific studies that have identified the causes and consequences of continued atmospheric warming and showed that coal combustion is the single greatest contributor to the growing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Given that these studies were not available when the Secretary issued the 1979 PEIS and the 1985 supplement, Appellants raise a compelling argument that the Secretary should now revisit the issue and adopt a new program or supplement its PEIS analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Appellants have several avenues to raise their claims regarding the climate-change implications of coal leasing. First, as the Department points out in its brief,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sec'y's Br. 17, Appellants may petition the Secretary for a rule making, seeking to have the coal management regulations take into account the serious environmental impacts of any coal leasing program. If the Secretary denies the petition for rule making, Appellants may seek judicial review of that determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts v. EPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553859\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/497/#p527\">\n    549 U.S. 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527-28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553859\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/497/#p527\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553859\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/497/#p527\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, Appellants may, when appropriate, challenge specific licensing decisions on the ground that the EIS prepared in support of any such decision fails to satisfy NEPA's mandate to consider the cumulative environmental impacts of coal leasing. Such a claim might challenge any attempt by BLM to rely on (or tier to) the 1979 PEIS on the ground that it is too outdated to support new federal action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.28\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.28\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1502.9(c)(1)(ii).

We are bound by established law holding that NEPA requires an agency to update its EIS only when it has proposed major federal action that is not yet complete. As explained above, the adoption of the Federal Coal Management Program was the relevant action in this case, and it was completed in 1979. Therefore, no \"major Federal action\" remains as part of that action, and NEPA does not provide a legal duty to supplement the PEIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    2.

In the PEIS, the Department stated that the first level of environmental \"analysis would be contained in this [PEIS],\n   <em>\n    updated when necessary\n   </em>\n   .\" PEIS at 3-68, J.A. 328 (emphasis added). And in both the PEIS and ROD, the Department stated that \"[n]ational and interregional impacts of the Federal coal management program are analyzed in [the PEIS, which]\n   <em>\n    would be updated when conditions change\n   </em>\n   sufficiently to require new analyses of those impacts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-9, J.A. 269; ROD at 98, J.A. 1399 (emphasis added). Appellants contend that these statements committed the agency to update the PEIS, even if NEPA does not require it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   These cited statements might have created a binding duty on the agency at one point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201505.3\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1505.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"conditions established in the [EIS] or during its review and committed as part of the decision shall be implemented\");\n   <em>\n    Tyler v.

In 1982, however, as part of its final rule amending the coal leasing regulations, the Department removed the provision explaining the circumstances in which the PEIS should be updated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033%2C114\">\n    47 Fed.
