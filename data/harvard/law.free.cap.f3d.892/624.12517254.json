The women sued Pfizer, Lipitor's manufacturer, asserting various products liability claims. After protracted litigation, the district court granted summary judgment to Pfizer. Plaintiffs now ask us to consider a host of issues, including whether the district court erred in excluding certain expert testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; whether it erred in requiring expert testimony at all; and whether summary judgment was appropriately granted against all plaintiffs in the MDL. Finding no reversible error, we affirm the district court's judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Pfizer manufactures Lipitor (atorvastatincalcium ), a pharmaceutical drug. Lipitor is a member of a class of drugs known as statins, which are broadly indicated to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease. Physicians prescribe Lipitor to lower patients' low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, or \"bad\" cholesterol) and triglycerides in order to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke. In the United\n   States, Lipitor is commercially available in 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg tablets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiffs in this litigation are more than three thousand women who have sued Pfizer, claiming that they developed diabetes as a result of taking Lipitor. Their complaint sets forth various theories of liability, including that Pfizer was negligent in its design and promotion of Lipitor and that Pfizer failed to adequately warn others of the drug's known risks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred these lawsuits to the District of South Carolina for consolidated or coordinated pretrial proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court and the parties then agreed on four plaintiffs whose claims would serve as bellwether cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties engaged in extensive discovery, including the identification of expert witnesses and exchange of expert reports. The plaintiffs enlisted general causation experts, who intended to testify that there was a causal association between Lipitor and diabetes, and specific causation experts, who would testify that Lipitor proximately caused the onset of diabetes in each of the bellwether plaintiffs. The plaintiffs also retained an expert biostatistician, who performed analyses of several clinical trials and studies, and concluded that Lipitor led to a statistically significant increased risk of diabetes among those who took the drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiffs offered other evidence to prove causation. Specifically, they sought to introduce internal Pfizer emails, information from the Lipitor labeling in the United States and Japan, a statement in the New Drug Application (\"NDA\") for Lipitor submitted by its original developer to the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), and information contained on the official Lipitor website. All of these, the plaintiffs contend, evince an association between Lipitor and diabetes-and Pfizer's knowledge of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the close of discovery, Pfizer moved to exclude the plaintiffs' expert witnesses under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Following extensive hearings and an opportunity for the experts to amend their reports, Pfizer's challenge, in large part, succeeded. Relevant to this appeal, the district court excluded the opinions of the plaintiffs' statistician, Dr. Nicholas Jewell; the opinions of their general causation expert, Dr. Sonal Singh, except for his opinions relating to the 80 mg dose of Lipitor ; and the specific causation opinions of Dr. Elizabeth Murphy, which related to the onset of diabetes in one of the bellwether plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court's rulings left the plaintiffs without their bellwether cases, and limited to a subset of patients who had taken an 80 mg dose. Following a hearing, and with agreement of counsel, the district court issued a series of four show cause orders asking whether any plaintiff in the MDL could submit evidence (expert or otherwise) that would enable her claim to survive summary judgment given the court's prior rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In response to the show cause orders, one group of plaintiffs submitted evidence showing only that they were not diabetic before taking Lipitor, that they were diagnosed with diabetes after taking Lipitor, and that they lacked certain risk factors that might make them especially likely to develop the disease. Another group simply \"dumped boxes upon boxes of documents\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   on the district court, including wholly irrelevant records such as \"pictures from colonoscopies, EKGs, and pap smear results,\" with \"no discernment or suggestion as to which documents they claimed precluded summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Lipitor Mktg., Sales Practices and Prods.

The district court, however, deemed itself competent to address the questions that remained and granted summary judgment against all plaintiffs in the MDL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The lion's share of this appeal centers upon the district court's decision to exclude the testimony of three of the plaintiffs' expert witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Expert testimony in the federal courts is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 702. That rule permits an expert to testify where the expert's \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,\" so long as the expert's opinion is \"based on sufficient facts or data,\" \"is the product of reliable principles and methods,\" and the expert \"has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\" Fed.

To reach his conclusion, Dr. Jewell performed a reanalysis of the data used in several clinical trials involving Lipitor, including the Pfizer-sponsored ASCOT-LLA trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as clinical trial data submitted to the FDA in the NDA for Lipitor.

NDA Data\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Before a drug may be sold or marketed in the United States, its manufacturer must submit an NDA to the FDA for review and approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.1\">\n    21 CFR \u00a7 314.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A typical NDA includes a clinical data selection, which contains an overview of clinical investigations of the drug.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 314.50(d)(5). In his initial expert report, Dr. Jewell reviewed data underlying seven clinical trials submitted as part of the NDA for Lipitor. Dr. Jewell examined blood glucose levels of patients in the trials who had taken Lipitor as compared to those who had taken a placebo. Persistently elevated blood glucose levels may, but\n   do not necessarily, indicate that a patient is diabetic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At the outset of his report, Dr. Jewell confessed that the data provided \"less than optimum information about [Lipitor's ] effect on glucose metabolism or new-onset diabetes, because of their short duration, relatively small sample sizes, and the unusual imbalance between the number of participants allocated to placebo and atorvastatin treatment.\" CMO 54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264428\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/145/573/#p577\">\n    145 F.Supp.3d 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577-78 (D.S.C. 2015) (quoting Dr. Jewell's report). Nevertheless, Dr. Jewell proceeded to analyze the data and concluded that it reasonably showed that Lipitor had a statistically significant effect on baseline glucose metabolism. That association, he opined, should have put Pfizer on notice of a possible association between atorvastatin and diabetes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The district court found Dr. Jewell's methodology and application too tainted with potential bias and error to pass\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   muster. First, the court expressed concern about the patients whose data were included in the sample set. In particular, Dr. Jewell included patients who had only a single elevated blood glucose reading and patients who had an abnormally elevated baseline glucose level at the beginning of the trial. Including patients with only a single reading, the district court explained, was contrary to the position the plaintiffs and their experts had taken elsewhere in the litigation (including through testimony from Dr. Jewell himself) that a single elevated glucose reading was not a reliable indicator of a diabetic patient. And including patients with elevated baseline levels risked introducing confounding variables into the analysis and thereby endangered the reliability of the results.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that Dr. Jewell was merely opining as to an increased risk of elevated glucose levels rather than a specific increase in the risk of diabetes. But that argument is at odds with Dr. Jewell's own report, which concludes that the NDA \"should have alerted ... Pfizer to the possibility of increased risk of\n   <em>\n    new-onset diabetes\n   </em>\n   associated with atorvastatin treatment.\" J.A. 2254 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, the district court believed that Dr. Jewell, a statistician, was simply not qualified to make determinations about which patients' data should have alerted Pfizer to a possible association between its drug and diabetes. Given that Dr. Jewell \"readily admitted that he had no expertise in diabetes, did not 'quite know' what new-onset diabetes meant, and was unwilling to testify about the role or use of blood glucose as a surrogate marker for diabetes because he was not a clinician,\" the district court found that he \"by his own testimony ... lacked the expertise to opine about any implications that single glucose readings might have about the possibility of new-onset diabetes.\" CMO 67, MDL No. 2:14-mn-02502-RMG,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20827067\">\n    2016 WL 827067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D.S.C. Feb. 29, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Also casting a specter of unreliability over Dr. Jewell's report was the manner in which he applied otherwise reliable statistical tests to the data. Statisticians rely on a range of mathematical tests to extrapolate meaning from data. Choosing the test to apply is a matter of selecting the appropriate tool for the task, and involves considera\n   tion of a variety of factors including type of data and sample size.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The district court questioned the way in which Dr. Jewell chose to include (and omit) the results from different tests in his report. Specifically, the district court noted that Dr. Jewell originally performed a \"Fisher's exact test\" on the data, which is a \"[w]ell-known small-sample technique\" used to compare two samples.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CMO 54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264428\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/145/573/#p577\">\n    145 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   583 ; Federal Judicial Center, Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 255 n.108 (3d. ed. 2011) (\"RMSE\"). The Fisher's exact test compares all possible outcomes in a distribution against the results actually observed to determine whether there is a statistically significant association. Generally speaking, an association is considered statistically significant if its p-value is less than 0.05. The p-value represents the likelihood that an apparent association observed in a data set is the product of random chance rather than a true relationship. Thus, when a p-value is less than 0.05, there is a less than 5% chance that a discovered association is a false positive result.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   When Dr. Jewell first performed the test, it showed a statistically insignificant association between Lipitor and the onset of diabetes, yielding a p-value of .0654.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CMO 54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264428\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/145/573/#p577\">\n    145 F.Supp.3d at 582-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

They also say that Dr. Jewell didn't cherry-pick his methods but rather performed a variety of calculations on the data. But the district court didn't take issue with the use of the mid-p test itself. Rather, it objected to Dr. Jewell's choice to include in his report the results of some tests he performed (which supported the plaintiffs' argument) but exclude the results of another (which did\n   not). The district court concluded (we think reasonably) that such an approach lacked the hallmark of science properly performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, the district court was skeptical of Dr. Jewell's use of average blood glucose increase as a metric in his analysis. Dr. Jewell calculated the average increase in blood glucose among patients with elevated levels in either arm of the trials (i.e., patients who had taken Lipitor or patients who had taken a placebo). He then reasoned that this average increase could be applied to the group of patients who had taken Lipitor, using his past (potentially flawed) conclusions to support the proposition that patients with glucose elevation were more likely to be in the Lipitor (rather than placebo) groups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The district court found this logic to be \"convoluted, and flawed.\" CMO 54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264428\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/145/573/#p577\">\n    145 F.Supp.3d at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because of the court's other issues with Dr. Jewell's process, it was understandably worried that the assumptions used in this part of the analysis were inherently unsound. Additionally, the court noted that the data actually showed greater increases in blood glucose among placebo-taking patients (who averaged a 37 mg/dL\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   increase) compared to those on Lipitor (27.1 mg/dL).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264428\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/145/573/#p577\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Thus,\" the court explained, \"to the extent one can infer anything from the average glucose increases in this incredibly limited data set of 40, those who experienced meaningful changes in their glucose level had lower increases if taking Lipitor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264428\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/145/573/#p577\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted). Consequently, the district court found that this data was unreliable, and in any event had real potential to confuse jurors. Thus, even if Rule 702 did not bar admission of the opinion, the court would exclude it under Rule 403 because it was more likely to confuse the jury than to impart probative information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CMO 67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20827067\">\n    2016 WL 827067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   These are classic concerns regarding reliability and relevance that district courts should weigh when deciding whether to admit expert evidence. The court here properly discharged its gatekeeping duty by considering-and ultimately excluding-Dr. Jewell's opinions, and explaining in detail its well-reasoned grounds for doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    2. ASCOT-LLA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Dr. Jewell also performed a reanalysis of data Pfizer produced from ASCOT-LLA, a clinical trial of Lipitor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the trial, patients with certain cardiovascular risk factors were randomly assigned to one of two arms: one group of patients was prescribed a dose of Lipitor ; the remaining patients received a placebo. The primary endpoints of ASCOT-LLA (that is, the outcomes for which study investigators were principally monitoring) were nonfatal myocardial infarction (heart attack ) and fatal coronary heart disease. The trial was ultimately terminated early because Lipitor was proving so effective at reducing cardiovascular events that the data safety monitoring board recommended-and the steering committee agreed-to conclude the study ahead of its originally scheduled timeline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Development of diabetes was a tertiary endpoint in ASCOT, which (like all identified endpoints) was monitored through ASCOT's adjudication process. Study investigators sent patient information relevant to\n   any endpoint to a special endpoints committee. That committee applied previously-defined criteria for classifying diagnoses to determine whether a particular endpoint had been reached.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The data the committee received was blinded, meaning that its members weren't told whether an individual patient had been assigned to the atorvastatin or placebo arm of the trial. After it determined whether a patient had reached a designated endpoint, the committee reported its findings to the coordinating center, which in turn communicated them to the study's data safety monitoring board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The ASCOT-LLA authors ultimately reported no statistically significant difference between the rate at which patients who took Lipitor developed diabetes and the rate among the patients who received a placebo. \"In other words,\" the district court summarized, \"the study did not find an association between Lipitor and new-onset diabetes.\" CMO 54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264428\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/145/573/#p577\">\n    145 F.Supp.3d at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dr. Jewell, however, chose to reanalyze the underlying data and reached an entirely opposite conclusion: he found that the data showed that Lipitor use was in fact associated with a significantly increased risk of new-onset diabetes among patients at risk for the disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   How did Dr. Jewell reach this contrary result? The primary juncture where the ASCOT authors and Dr. Jewell part ways involves selection of the proper criteria used to diagnose a patient with diabetes. According to Dr. Jewell, it was unclear from the ASCOT protocol how investigators were identifying diabetic patients. He also quibbled with the criteria for diagnosing patients with diabetes set forth in the ASCOT protocol. Additionally, Dr. Jewell determined that reanalysis was appropriate because he could not reconstruct the study's adjudication process based on the data Pfizer had produced. Analyzing the data anew using his preferred definition of new-onset diabetes\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (and without the advantage of independently adjudicated data), Dr. Jewell concluded that the ASCOT-LLA data indeed showed an association between use of Lipitor and an increased risk of diabetes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The district court again took issue with Dr. Jewell's methodology. First, the court expressed concern with Dr. Jewell's decision to replace the definition of diabetes used by the ASCOT endpoints committee with one of his own. Although Dr. Jewell is well-qualified as a statistician, he's not a medical doctor or professional, nor does he have any particular expertise in diabetes. The court decided that Dr. Jewell lacked the expertise to \"second guess\" the judgments of the endpoints committee, and that it was inappropriate for \"someone with no clinical expertise [to choose] to replace the adjudication committee's determination of new-onset diabetes with particular unadjudicated raw data, namely lab values of his choice.\" CMO 54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264428\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/145/573/#p577\">\n    145 F.Supp.3d at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court\n   stressed the importance of using prespecified diagnostic criteria for identifying endpoints (as the ASCOT endpoints committee had) to \"help[ ] guard against bias.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264428\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/145/573/#p577\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264428\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/145/573/#p577\">\n    at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, Dr. Jewell, who confessed confusion over the precise criteria the ASCOT investigators had used to diagnose diabetes, had the benefit of hindsight when he selected his definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Moreover, despite using an apparently narrower definition of diabetes than the one used by the endpoints committee, Dr. Jewell nevertheless discovered\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   cases of new-onset diabetes. The court expressed skepticism about the way in which Dr. Jewell identified the cases because his decisions-unlike those of the adjudication committee in the ASCOT study-were not blind and thus lacked the same insulation from possible bias. And the endpoints committee (unlike Dr. Jewell) \"had access to medical records and case files and examined and reconciled data to ensure that the inclusion of a case was accurate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264428\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/145/573/#p577\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The plaintiffs say that Dr. Jewell was right to perform a reanalysis given certain \"anomalies\" that he identified in the original study. To be sure, a reanalysis of a clinical trial's data may sometimes be appropriate. But such a reanalysis isn't per se admissible under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   . As with any expert undertaking, a district court must review a reanalysis to ensure it meets\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   's demands of reliable methodologies reliably applied. And when the results of a reanalysis are squarely at odds with the conclusions of a published, peer-reviewed study; the methods of the reanalysis are questionable because of the absence of properly adjudicated data; the expert performing the reanalysis lacks expertise in the portion of the study he's modifying; and that expert offers an unpersuasive rationale for why the original findings are wrong and his correct, then skepticism by the district court is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Here, the district court understandably worried that Dr. Jewell, whose expertise lay in the realm of mathematics rather than medicine, compromised the soundness of his opinions by eschewing the benefits of ASCOT's blinded adjudication process and usurping its predetermined diagnostic criteria with his own without adequate justification. Such a determination is well within the broad discretion we afford district courts in deciding evidentiary questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The plaintiffs make much of a few statements by the district court suggesting that Dr. Jewell substituted his definition of diabetes for that of the ASCOT investigators \"without any explanation.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , CMO 54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264428\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/145/573/#p577\">\n    145 F.Supp.3d at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, Dr. Jewell did express his belief that the definition used in the ASCOT protocol was flawed and risked underestimating the incidence of diabetes. But that's not sufficient to call into question the district court's understanding of Dr. Jewell's approach. Read in context, the court repeatedly opined that Dr. Jewell (1) wasn't qualified to second-guess the clinicians who selected the ASCOT diagnostic criteria; (2) didn't even know what criteria they had used; and (3) hadn't adequately justified his decision to replace their criteria with his own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \"The touchstones for admissibility under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   are two: reliability and relevancy.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, the district court determined that Dr. Jewell's scientific approach was flawed and thus unreliable, and it clearly and cogently explained why.

In\n   some cases, no individual methodological or application discrepancy may be sufficient to independently justify exclusion of an expert's testimony. Nevertheless, courts must look to the entire process that produced an opinion to determine whether the expert's work satisfies\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   's fundamental command: that expert testimony be reliable and relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   That is what the district court did here-it identified and articulated clear (and, we think, reasonable) concerns it had about the manner in which Dr. Jewell reached his conclusions. Even when afforded the opportunity to supplement his report, Dr. Jewell failed to assuage the court's justified worries with his testimony. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's ruling excluding Dr. Jewell's expert opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    B. Dr. Singh (General Causation)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The plaintiffs next ask us to revive the testimony of Dr. Sonal Singh, who offered general causation opinions. Dr. Singh conducted a literature review and performed a meta-analysis of relevant studies. Ultimately, he concluded that there was an association between the use of Lipitor and increased risk of diabetes. Dr. Singh then applied what epidemiologists refer to as the \"Bradford Hill criteria\" to the data to determine whether the association was a causal one; that is, whether use of Lipitor in fact caused patients' increased risk of diabetes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Bradford Hill criteria are a series of factors used by epidemiologists to determine whether an observed association between two variables is causal. Those factors include temporal relationship, strength of the association, dose-response relationship, replication of the findings, biological plausibility, consideration of alternative explanations, cessation of exposure, specificity of the association, and consistency with other knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RMSE at 599-600. No single criterion is dispositive: a true causal relationship may exist where one or more factors are absent; likewise, one or more factors may be present in a dataset where there is no causal relationship at all.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Dr. Singh considered the Bradford Hill criteria and concluded that there was indeed a causal relationship between Lipitor and diabetes. But after Dr. Singh submitted his initial report, the district court ruled that he (and other experts) \"must demonstrate ... that particular doses of Lipitor are capable of causing diabetes,\" and directed him to file a supplemental report \"offering opinions as to whether Lipitor causes diabetes at\" each of the four doses commercially available in the United States (10, 20, 40, and 80 mg).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CMO 49, MDL No. 2:14-mn-02502-RMG,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206941132\">\n    2015 WL 6941132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (D.S.C. Oct. 22, 2015). Dr. Singh prepared a supplemental report, in which he concluded that the data did indeed show a causal association between Lipitor and diabetes at each commercial dose. Nevertheless, the district court excluded Dr. Singh's opinion for each dose except 80 mg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The district court thought it improper for Dr. Singh to apply the Bradford Hill criteria to the data for the 10 mg dose of Lipitor to determine causality because the data did not reveal a sufficiently strong association between the drug and the disease. By Dr. Singh's own admission, his opinions as to the 20 and 40 mg doses were based on his conclusions for the 10 mg dose, and thus without Dr. Singh's opinion as to the 10 mg dose, the district court held that his opinions as to the 20 and 40 mg doses must also be excluded. But the data did show a sufficient relationship between an 80 mg dose of Lipitor and diabetes, and because Dr. Singh's application of the Bradford Hill criteria suggested that\n   the relationship there was a causal one, the district court denied Pfizer's motion to exclude Dr. Singh's opinions with respect to the 80 mg dose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The plaintiffs raise two challenges to these rulings: they argue that the district court erred in requiring Dr. Singh to (1) offer an opinion on causation at each specific dose of Lipitor ; and (2) find a statistically significant association between Lipitor and diabetes before opining as to causation.

Unlike substances in other toxic tort cases (talcum powder, for instance, or asbestos), pharmaceutical drugs are typically prescribed and consumed in measured and knowable quantities. Because patients on Lipitor know their precise dose, and because there is data available on many other patients taking that same dose, pharmaceutical injury litigation may indeed present the \"rare\" case\n   <em>\n    Westberry\n   </em>\n   described in which a patient is exposed to a chemical in a readily quantified way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We do not suggest that every case involving a claim of injury resulting from a pharmaceutical drug will require a dose-by-dose analysis, and an expert witness will not necessarily need to define the precise lower bound of exposure risk. The appropriate level of analysis will depend on the circumstances of the case and the capacity of current scientific methods. But where, as here, each plaintiff took one of only several commercially available doses, clinical data exist that enable an expert to perform a causation analysis at each dose, and experts (including plaintiffs' own) acknowledge that there is some relationship between dosage and harm, the district court doesn't abuse its discretion in asking the expert to produce a dose-by-dose analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Because Dr. Singh failed to find a statistically significant relationship between Lipitor and diabetes (and thereby could not satisfy the first step of the Bradford Hill analysis), he should not have applied the factors at the second step. Doing so, the court reasoned, resulted in an unreliable opinion that warranted exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We pause here to provide a brief overview of the concept of statistical significance and its proper role in the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Statistical significance is a measure of confidence that a trend observed in a dataset is not random. \"A study that is statistically significant has results that are unlikely to be the result of random error....\" RMSE at 573. Statistical significance is typically expressed through a p-value. \"A p-value represents the probability that an observed positive association could result from random error even if no association were in fact present.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 576 (emphasis removed). To determine whether an association is statistically significant, statisticians compare the p-value to a predetermined threshold value (also known as a significance level). If the p-value is smaller than the significance level, then the finding is statistically significant. Otherwise, it is not. \"The most common significance level ... used in science is .05. A .05 value means that the probability is 5% of observing an association at least as large as that found in the study when in truth there is no association.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 577 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The purpose of statistical significance, then, is to indicate a certain level of confidence in the results of an analysis. A significant p-value is not, however, some all-purpose salve, nor is it a get-out-of-\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   -free card. Just as statistically significant evidence won't result in automatic admission, the absence of a p-value that is smaller than .05 (or some other threshold) isn't necessarily fatal to a case. Rather, statistical significance may bear on the question of reliability, and must therefore be subjected to the same inquiry as any other scientific evidence-including whether the expert has applied the \"same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.\"\n   <em>\n    Kumho Tire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/#p152\">\n    526 U.S. at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/#p152\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Supreme Court addressed this issue in\n   <em>\n    Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v.

They are correct that Dr. Murphy's report was not entirely void of explanation. For example, Dr. Murphy explained that the family history factor was likely attenuated given the large size of Ms. Hempstead's family and the limited number of family members who developed the disease. Dr. Murphy addressed the significant risk factors of age and BMI by explaining that studies either adjust for those factors or are randomized to control for them, and that those studies nevertheless show an increased risk of diabetes associated with Lipitor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   But these explanations (even if true) do not accomplish the specific causation expert's task: accounting for the development of the disease in a particular plaintiff. That Lipitor may cause an increased risk of diabetes notwithstanding certain other risk factors is insufficient to conclude that the drug was a substantial contributing factor in an individual patient.

These statements buttressed the district court's conclusion that Dr. Murphy hadn't performed a reliable differential diagnosis because she focused primarily on the fact that the plaintiff took Lipitor close in time to her development of diabetes and also failed to adequately explain the basis for ruling out other contributing factors-including some that she herself described as substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In sum, the court found that Dr. Murphy's report appeared to dismiss other possible causes in favor of Lipitor in a cursory fashion that appeared closer to an ipse dixit than a reasoned scientific analysis. Dr. Murphy's conclusions focused almost exclusively on the fact that Ms. Hempstead took the drug and later developed the disease, rather than explaining what led her to believe that it was a substantial contributing factor as compared to other possible causes. Simply put,\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   requires more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   As with the testimony of Drs.

And although an MDL court may recommend that cases in an MDL be returned to their transferor courts, \"the power to remand a transferred case rests with the [MDL] Panel and not with the transferee district judge.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"577734\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/178/181/#p184\">\n    178 F.3d 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184 (3d Cir. 1999). Here, rather than recommending to the Panel that the many cases in this MDL be resolved individually in their transferor courts by judges largely unfamiliar with the litigation and its complexities, the district court elected instead to resolve Pfizer's summary judgment motion, resulting ultimately in dismissal of the plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   We see no inconsistency between the district court's actions and the MDL statute. The MDL device is intended to allow federal courts to \"conserv[e] judicial resources in situations where multiple cases involving common questions of fact [are] filed in different districts.\"\n   <em>\n    Food Lion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411822\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/73/528/#p532\">\n    73 F.3d at 531-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Transferee courts have broad discretion to determine whether ruling on a particular pretrial motion (such as summary judgment) is appropriate, or whether it would be better to ask the Panel to transfer cases back to their originating districts for individual resolution. Facing a motion for summary judgment, a court must consider whether the issues presented are well suited for the transferee court to deal with in a collective fashion. Where a motion for summary judgment \"pertains to one or few cases, or rests on application of the transferor court's conflicts-of-law and substantive law rules, the transferor judge may be able to decide the motions most efficiently. If the summary judgment motions involve issues common to all the cases centralized before the MDL court, however, the transferee judge may be in the best position to rule.\" Manual for Complex Litigation \u00a7 22.36 (footnote omitted). Principles of efficiency and fairness should guide the district court in deciding whether to resolve the motion or recommend remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Here, it was the district court's prerogative to determine whether it could dispose of the cases before it on the merits. At the time the court granted summary judgment, the plaintiffs were already facing an uphill battle: they were left without a general causation expert as to the majority of Lipitor doses, and their specific causation expert for the bellwether trial had also been excluded. \"[T]he writing,\" as the district court put it, was \"on the wall.\" CMO 100,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269821\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/227/452/#p469\">\n    227 F.Supp.3d at 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After a series of show cause orders, no plaintiff had come forward with alternative evidence of specific causation that would survive review. The court explained that, after dealing with this litigation at great length, it was \"familiar with the science and issues present\n   and can dispose of the issues far more quickly and efficiently than dozens of courts spread across the country.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269821\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/227/452/#p469\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (stressing that it would be \"inefficient, costly, and contrary to the purposes of the [MDL] statute to suggest remand without ruling on summary judgment\"). The court thus declined to \"essentially disregard the entire course of the MDL proceedings\" by recommending remand.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269821\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/227/452/#p469\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   We find no error in the district court's decision to keep these cases and grant summary judgment to Pfizer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   These cases involve difficult questions of mathematics and science, wrapped in a complex form of mass litigation.

The court discharged those duties meticulously and thoughtfully throughout the litigation, including performing careful review of the many expert reports, affording experts the opportunity to amend and revise those reports to ensure their opinions were fully considered, and, after ultimately excluding much of the plaintiffs' expert testimony, allowing them to come forward with any additional evidence that could salvage what remained of their cases before rendering a final decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The district court's judgments are therefore\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    <em>\n     Daubert v.
