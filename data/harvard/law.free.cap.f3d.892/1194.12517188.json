The panel removes the Federal Circuit from jurisdiction over appeals of\n   <em>\n    Walker Process\n   </em>\n   claims, and challenges Federal Circuit jurisdiction of all appeals where the complaint includes non-patent issues.

Rep. No. 97-312, pp. 20-23 (1981) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Precedent has construed the clause \"civil action arising under ... any Act of Congress relating to patents,\" for the creation of the Federal Circuit as a national court raised occasional questions of appellate jurisdiction, as the courts sought to implement the legislative purpose. Precedent considered specific circumstances as they arose: for example, when the district court action included issues in addition to patent issues and the patent issues were not appealed; when the patent issue arose only by counterclaim; when the patent issue arose in a contract dispute; when the patent issue arose in connection with various antitrust claims; when the patent issue arose in a state court action; when the patent issue was later removed from the complaint; when the patent issue arose in a malpractice action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, we and the Supreme Court and the regional circuits have considered the boundaries of \"civil action arising under ... any Act of Congress relating to patents,\" across an array of diverse circumstances. Those boundaries produced helpful guidance in special or complex cases. However, the present case is simple, for the issue of fraud or inequitable conduct in prosecution of the patent application, the foundation of\n   <em>\n    Walker Process\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence, is cemented in its jurisdictional path to the Federal Circuit. If that path is to be changed, such change warrants en banc action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Supreme Court and Federal Circuit Precedent are Contravened by the Panel Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Supreme Court reviewed Federal Circuit jurisdiction early in our existence, in a case where the Seventh Circuit and the Federal Circuit each \"adamantly disavowed jurisdiction\" and insisted that the other was the correct appellate body.\n   <em>\n    Christianson v.

In\n   <em>\n    Christianson\n   </em>\n   , a former employee of Colt asserted Clayton Act and Sherman Act violations by Colt as well as tortious interference with business relationships; the employee requested damages and injunctive and equitable relief. An antitrust allegation related to patent validity. The district court decided for the former employee on both the antitrust and tortious interference claims, and Colt appealed to the Federal Circuit. We held that we did not have jurisdiction because the case did not arise under the patent law, and transferred the appeal to the Seventh Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Seventh Circuit stated that the Federal Circuit was \"clearly wrong,\" and transferred the appeal back to us.

Although the panel cites this case as an example of regional circuit jurisdiction of fraud in the PTO, there was no issue of fraud in the PTO; the asserted fraud was common law fraud based on contract and fiduciary relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The panel further cites\n   <em>\n    MDS (Canada) Inc. v.

In that contract dispute, the court stated that the case was for breach of a license agreement, and that the question of infringement was not substantial because the patent had expired and \"resolution of this issue is unlikely to impact any future constructions of claims.\"\n   <em>\n    MDS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057193\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/833/\">\n    720 F.3d at 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The circuit construed the contract and the licensed patents, considered the asserted breaches such as failure to pay the maintenance fees, and certified other contract issues to the Florida Supreme Court. The appeal before us is not such a complex case-the appeal turns on the issue of patent prosecution conduct in the PTO, for which appellate jurisdiction is in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Another regional circuit case on which the panel relies is\n   <em>\n    Seed Co. Ltd. v. Westerman\n   </em>\n   , a malpractice case that was appealed to the D.C. Circuit.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351831\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/325/\">\n    832 F.3d 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2016). The asserted malpractice was the attorney's failure to successfully prosecute an application before the PTO. The panel correctly states that the D.C. Circuit had \"appellate jurisdiction because the case 'involve[d] no forward looking questions about any patent's validity, but instead solely concern[ed] whether unsuccessful patent applicants can recover against their attorneys.' \" Transfer Order, 882 F.3d at 1079 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Seed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351831\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/325/\">\n    832 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   331 ). The Federal Circuit had several years earlier reviewed the patent questions in\n   <em>\n    Seed\n   </em>\n   , in an interference proceeding. As in\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   , no patent rights were involved in or affected by this malpractice action. This case does not support the panel's holding that the Federal Circuit does not have jurisdiction over cases based on fraud or inequitable conduct in the PTO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Until today, there has been stability in the jurisdictional path of\n   <em>\n    Walker Process\n   </em>\n   appeals. No precedent deprives the Federal Circuit of jurisdiction of appeals that turn on issues of fraud or inequitable conduct in patent prosecution. These issues are not only substantial, but because they determine patent enforceability and validity, they are fundamental.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   To summarize why en banc review of this panel decision is appropriate and necessary:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   1) The panel, at its own initiative, raised the question of our jurisdiction of\n   <em>\n    Walker Process\n   </em>\n   appeals. Although supplemental briefing was requested of the parties, the ramifications of this jurisdictional change were not ex-posed in public debate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   2) Precedent is contrary to the panel's rejection of this appeal. Neither\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   nor any other precedent supports the panel's ruling that claims turning on patent invalidity and unenforceability due to fraud or inequitable conduct in patent prosecution do not \"arise under\" the patent law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   3) The reason for formation of the Federal Circuit as a national court was to stabilize the patent law and provide uniformity throughout the nation. Patent prosecution is a complex and specialized interaction between inventors and examiners. This ruling will require each regional circuit to review patent prosecution in the PTO, creating regional precedent and forum-shopping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   4) Appellate review of cases that arise under the patent law is our assignment and our obligation. The Supreme Court did not silently divest this court of the jurisdiction that was established in 1982.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   If the court now wishes to remove itself from jurisdiction of cases that may involve issues in addition to patent issues, we should make this change en banc.
