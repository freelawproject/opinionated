The police responded to a call about a man behaving erratically and brandishing a pair of scissors at a 7-Eleven. The shooting happened while the police were deciding how to handle the situation, and Vos unexpectedly charged the doorway of the store with what appeared to be a weapon raised above his head. Vos's parents filed this action against the officers and the City, raising claims under federal and state law. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, concluding that the officers' use of force was objectively reasonable. Vos's parents appeal that decision.

Vos became agitated; he ran around the store shouting things like \"[k]ill me already, dog.\" Someone called 911. For approximately the next six minutes, Vos ran around the store cursing at people. Meanwhile, the video footage shows other customers going about their business of shopping and checking out at the cash register. The Newport Beach Police Department dispatch stated that \"the reporting\n   party is advising that the subject is holding a pair of scissors inside the store and there are still people inside.\" At one point, Vos grabbed and immediately released a 7-Eleven employee, yelling \"I've got a hostage!\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At about 8:25 p.m. Officer David Kresge (\"Kresge\") arrived at the scene. Officer Kresge spoke to some bystanders who indicated Vos was still in the store and Officer Kresge signaled to the remaining clerks to exit the building. The clerks said that Vos had armed himself with scissors and one employee had been cut on the hand while trying to disarm Vos before authorities arrived, resulting in a \"half-inch laceration.\" Officer Kresge saw Vos behind the 7-Eleven's glass doors yelling, screaming, and pretending to have a gun. Officer Kresge broadcasted on the police radio that \"the subject is simulating having a hand gun behind his back and is asking me to shoot him.\" Officer Kresge then saw Vos go into the back room and shut the door. Officer Kresge asked for backup and specifically asked for a 40-millimeter less-lethal projectile launcher.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As other officers arrived, Officer Kresge informed them that Vos was agitated and likely under the influence of narcotics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By 8:30 p.m., several more officers arrived, including Defendants Officer Richard Henry (\"Henry\") and Officer Nathan Farris (\"Farris\"). Immediately before the fatal shooting, at least eight officers were present. The police positioned two police cars outside the store's front entrance in a \"v\" formation and used the vehicles' doors for cover. Trainee Officer Andrew Shen (\"Shen\") armed himself with the requested 40 millimeter less-lethal device. The others readied themselves with lethal weapons: Officers Henry and Farris armed themselves with AR-15 rifles,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   while Officer Kresge held a handgun. The police propped open the 7-Eleven doors and Officer Shawn Preasmyer (\"Preasmyer\") set up a public address system, getting ready to communicate with Vos. There was also a canine unit on the scene. The officers knew that Vos had been simulating having a gun and that he was agitated, appeared angry, and was potentially mentally unstable or under the influence of drugs. They also heard Vos yell \"shoot me\" and other similar cries. The police on site talked about using non-lethal force to subdue Vos both over the radio and amongst themselves at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At about 8:43 p.m., Vos opened the door of the 7-Eleven's back room. As he did so, some officers shouted \"doors opening.\" Vos then ran around the front check-out counter and towards the open doors. As he ran, he held an object over his head in his hand. The distance between Vos and the officers at the point he started running was approximately 30 feet. One officer shouted that Vos had scissors. Over the public address system, Officer Preasmyer twice told Vos to \"Drop the weapon.\" Vos did not drop the object and instead kept charging towards the officers. Officer Preasmyer then shouted \"shoot him.\" Officer Preasmyer later testified that this order was directed solely to Officer Shen. Officer Shen fired his less-lethal weaponry and, within seconds, Officers Henry and Farris fired their AR-15 rifles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   No other\n   officers fired. Vos continued to run as he was struck by the bullets, collapsing on the sidewalk in front of the officers. Vos was shot four times and died from his wounds. About eight seconds elapsed from the time Vos came out of the back room to when he was killed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Somewhere around 20 minutes passed from when officers arrived until Vos ran at them. During this time, the officers did not communicate with Vos. Officers Shen and Farris later testified that they did not hear Officer Preasmyer's command to shoot, and Officer Henry testified that he heard it but did not react to it. Neither Henry nor Farris knew that Officer Shen had fired the less-lethal weaponry. They also testified that they saw a metallic object in Vos's hand, which they believed to be scissors. After the shooting, a \"pronged metal display hook was found on the ground a few feet from where [Vos] had collapsed.\" While the officers only suspected the possibility of substance abuse, Vos's blood later tested positive for both amphetamine and methamphetamine. Vos's medical history later revealed that he had been diagnosed as schizophrenic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Vos's Parents brought this suit as Vos's lawful heirs and successors-in-interest against the City of Newport Beach, Officer Henry, Officer Farris, and Officer Kresge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging twelve causes of action: (1) excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012131\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (3) violation of the Rehabilitation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (4) violation of civil rights due to loss of familial relationship,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (5) municipal and supervisory liability,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (6) wrongful death (negligence); (7) wrongful death (negligent hiring, training and retention); (8) battery; (9) assault; (10) violation of civil rights,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052.1\">\n    Cal.

Because no one disputes that the officers used the highest level of force against Vos, the issue is determining whether the governmental interests at stake were sufficient to justify it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Governmental Interests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The strength of the government's interest is measured by examining three primary factors: (1) \"the severity of the crime at issue,\" (2) \"whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,\" and (3) \"whether [the suspect] is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195205\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/1/#p9\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"The 'reasonableness' of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\"\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n    490 U.S. at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As explained below, on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the government's interests were insufficient to justify the use of deadly force under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, the officers were not responding to the report of a crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glenn v. Wash. Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3741494\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/864/#p874\">\n    673 F.3d 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 874 (9th Cir. 2011) (identifying that the \"character of the offense\" is \"an important consideration\" especially when no crime has been identified). Rather, law enforcement was contacted because of Vos's erratic behavior. In fact, the officers discussed at the scene what crime may have been committed, speculating \"false imprisonment\" and stating \"let's get a good crime.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, once the officers were at the scene, there was little opportunity for Vos to flee. While closing himself in the back room could be perceived as an attempt to evade arrest, officers never initially spoke to Vos or gave him any commands as to make his behavior noncompliant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bryan v. MacPherson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053754\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/805/#p830\">\n    630 F.3d 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830 (9th Cir. 2010) (noting that while \"passive resistance\" can support the use of force, \"the level of force an individual's resistance will support is dependent on the factual circumstances underlying that resistance\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The most important factor, however, is whether Vos posed an immediate\n   threat to the safety of officers or others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Longoria v. Pinal Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265737\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/699/#p705\">\n    873 F.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 705 (9th Cir. 2017) (explaining that the second factor, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, is the most important). In considering \"whether there was an immediate threat, a simple statement by an officer that he fears for his safety or the safety of others is not enough; there must be objective factors to justify such a concern.\"\n   <em>\n    Mattos v. Agarano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3848041\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/661/433/#p441\">\n    661 F.3d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 441-42 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, the facts are such that a reasonable jury could conclude that Vos was not an immediate threat to the officers. The officers had surrounded the front door to the 7-Eleven, had established positions behind cover of their police vehicles, and outnumbered Vos eight to one. The officers saw that Vos had something in his hand as he charged them, but they did not believe he had a gun, and the officers had less-lethal methods available to stop Vos from charging. Even though only eight seconds passed between when Vos emerged from the back room and when he was shot, construing the facts as they are presented by the Parents and depicted in the video footage, a reasonable jury could conclude that Vos did not pose an immediate threat such that the use of deadly force was warranted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The defendants argue that Vos \"forced the confrontation\" by charging the officers, and the immediacy of the threat is comparable to that in\n   <em>\n    Lal v.

At approximately 8:15 PM on May 29, 2014, Vos entered a 7-Eleven convenience store in Newport Beach, California. Vos was agitated, and ran around the store shouting \"[k]ill me already\" and other provocations. Someone in the store called 911. At one point Vos grabbed and\n   then released a 7-Eleven employee and shouted \"I've got a hostage.\" The Newport Beach Police Department radio stated that \"the reporting party is advising that the subject is holding a pair of scissors inside the store and there are still people inside.\" At 8:20 PM, Officer Kresge arrived at the scene. He testified at his deposition that when he arrived outside the 7-Eleven Vos was \"yelling and screaming.\" Kresge made eye contact with the clerks and signaled them to get out of the store. One of the clerks told Kresge that Vos had \"armed himself with scissors and that one of them had been stabbed in the hand.\" Kresge saw that Vos had wrapped a garment around his right hand and had begun to pantomime with his hand as if he were holding a gun. Kresge did not enter the store or engage Vos; instead, he waited for backup.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Several other officers arrived, including Defendant-Officers Richard Henry and Nathan Farris, and Officer Andrew Shen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Officers positioned their vehicles outside the store's front entrance and took positions behind the doors of their cars. Officers Henry and Ferris, each positioned behind a car door, armed themselves with AR-15 rifles. Officer Kresge pulled out a handgun. Officer Shen was armed with a non-lethal projectile launcher. The officers propped open the door to the 7-Eleven. Another policeman, Officer Preasmyer, set up a public address system (the bullhorn) and prepared to communicate with Vos. The officers had fully surrounded the entrance to the 7-Eleven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   What followed was captured on video by the police dash-cams and the 7-Eleven surveillance cameras\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   : At approximately 8:43 PM-23 minutes after Kresge first arrived at the scene-Vos opened the door to the 7-Eleven's back room.

As Vos ran, he held a metal object above his head in his left hand. One officer shouted \"he's got scissors.\" Over the public address system, Officer Preasmyer instructed \"Drop the weapon!\" Vos did not drop the object, but instead ran full steam toward the officers. Officer Preasmyer said \"Shoot him.\" Officers Henry and Farris fired their AR-15 rifles, while Shen fired his non-lethal weaponry.

This is clearly incorrect. The Officers responded to a report of Vos running around a 7-Eleven wielding scissors while screaming and harassing the customers and employees. It was apparent not long after Officer Kresge arrived that Vos had injured at least one person. Vos pantomimed to Kresge that he had a gun. At one point Vos grabbed a 7-Eleven employee and called him a hostage.

Again, I respectfully disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   What the majority ignores is the following undisputed fact: the police were presented with a mere two seconds in which to decide to deploy deadly force. Vos had secreted himself into a back room. The officers had just set up a means of communication when Vos suddenly reappeared and charged. In the mere seconds which passed, the officers warned Vos, and ordered him to drop his weapon.

In a fight between Vos and the eight officers, the officers would undoubtedly have come out on top. But at what cost? It is reasonable for an officer, with only seconds to react, to conclude that the person wielding what looks like a knife and charging at him and his fellows would do serious harm to at least one of them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is all the more reasonable when those officers know that the person wielding the weapon has already stabbed somebody with it and heard a police officer yell \"Shoot him!\" To hold otherwise is to ignore the Supreme Court's instruction to remember that \"[t]he calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments-in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving-about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n    490 U.S. at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   To find that the officers' response to the threat they faced was reasonable is not only logical, but is also compelled by our precedent.

In\n   <em>\n    Lal\n   </em>\n   , the officers likely could have retreated to a position far enough away that Lal would have been unable to reach them with the rock. Lal advanced on the officers slowly, and there is no indication that he had any other means of harming the officers than the large rock he held above his head. The slow advance meant that the officers likely had more than two seconds in which to decide on the best course of action as Lal approached. Nevertheless, we made clear that \"even assuming that it might have been possible for the officers to have given Lal a wider berth...there is no requirement that such an alternative be explored.\"\n   <em>\n    Lal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239603\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/1112/#p1115\">\n    746 F.3d at 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Billington v.

It is possible that other means could have brought down Vos without this tragic loss of life.

We noted that \"[t]he problems posed by, and thus the tactics to be employed against, an unarmed, emotionally distraught individual who is creating a disturbance or resisting arrest are ordinarily different from those involved in law enforcement efforts to subdue an armed and dangerous criminal who has recently committed a serious offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Rutherford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1952912\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/272/1272/#p1282\">\n    272 F.3d at 1282-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Bearing that in mind, the\n   <em>\n    Rutherford\n   </em>\n   court stated that \"[e]ven when an emotionally disturbed individual is acting out and inviting officers to use deadly force to subdue him, the governmental interest in using such force is diminished by the fact that the officers are confronted, not with a person who has committed a serious crime against others, but with a mentally ill individual.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Here, Vos had already committed a \"serious crime against others\": he had stabbed a 7-Eleven employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CPC \u00a7 245 (prohibiting assault with a deadly weapon). In the next sentence, the\n   <em>\n    Rutherford\n   </em>\n   panel made clear that \"[w]e do not adopt a per se rule establishing two different classifications of suspects: mentally disabled persons and serious criminals. Instead, we\n   emphasize that where it is or should be apparent to the officers that the individual involved is emotionally disturbed, that is a factor that must be considered in determining, under\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , the reasonableness of the force employed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Rutherford\n   </em>\n   stands for a fairly common-sense and non-controversial result: a mentally disturbed person may respond differently to police intervention than does a person who is not mentally disturbed. Officers should bear this in mind when going about their duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   But nowhere in\n   <em>\n    Rutherford\n   </em>\n   , or in any other case, have we found that an officer's interest in using deadly force is diminished when his life is threatened by a mentally disturbed person. The danger to the officer is not lessened with the realization that the person who is trying to kill him is mentally ill. Indeed, it may be increased, as in some circumstances a mentally ill individual in the midst of a psychotic break will not respond to reason, or to anything other than force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   But the majority instead creates a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule that in\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   circumstances the governmental interest in deadly force is diminished where the subject is mentally ill. While in\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   circumstances that may be true, in circumstances such as our case-where a mentally ill person charged at officers while wielding a metal weapon above his head-it is not. To hold otherwise would be to render meaningless the language in\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   that we will not \"create two tracks of excessive force analysis, one for the mentally ill and one for serious criminals.\"\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053754\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/805/#p830\">\n    630 F.3d at 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

By the majority's logic, so long as an extremely dangerous person \"acts out\" or otherwise evinces mental illness, an officer's interest in self-defense is somehow diminished. The majority's position is simply untenable either as a matter of precedent or logic. Our precedent: in\n   <em>\n    Lal\n   </em>\n   , we noted that Lal had stated that he wished \"suicide by cop.\"\n   <em>\n    Lal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239603\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/1112/#p1115\">\n    746 F.3d at 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In logic: whether the person who charges the officer does so out of a base desire to kill, or does so because, in the midst of a psychotic episode, he thinks the officer is a monster or a ghost, the danger to the officer is the same.

He used the following distances: 27.5 feet from the back of the store to the 7-Eleven's door threshold, 9.1 feet from the door threshold to the white parking block adjacent to the closest police car, and 4.5 feet from the front wheel edge of the closest police car to the location of officers Shen and Farris. He calculated Vos's speed in part by analyzing the frame rate of one of the 7-Eleven surveillance cameras. Plaintiffs did not object to nor did they dispute Fries' evidence as to distances, speed and time of Vos's charge to the police. Plaintiffs presented no evidence contrary to Fries. Plaintiffs argued that the video evidence should not have been admitted, and therefore disputed portions of the Fries expert report as lacking foundation. However, the district court ruled that the video evidence was admissible, a ruling Plaintiffs have not appealed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    California Penal Code (CPC) \u00a7 245 (punishing a person \"who commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or instrument other than a firearm ...).\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    Op. at 1029 (\"The clerks said that Vos had armed himself with scissors and one employee had been cut on the hand ...\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    \"The three elements of felony false imprisonment in California are: (1) a person intentionally and unlawfully restrained, confined, or detained another person, compelling him to stay or go somewhere; (2) that other person did not consent; and (3) the restraint, confinement, or detention was accomplished by violence or menace.\"\n    <em>\n     Turijan v.

The majority's statement is perplexing. As the majority recognizes, it is undisputed that Vos used a weapon to injure a store employee, grabbed a 7-Eleven employee and declared that he had a hostage, and pretended to have a gun. There is no \"inference\" in the Parents' favor which can change these undisputed facts. As a result, prior to Vos's charge at the officers, he could have been charged with a number of\n    <em>\n     severe\n    </em>\n    crimes, including assault with a deadly weapon, making Vos a \"dangerous armed felon threatening immediate violence.\"\n    <em>\n     Deorle v.
