The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   concluded that Swopes was subject to an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). The Act requires a minimum 15-year prison sentence for a felon in possession of a firearm who has sustained three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense. The district court cited Swopes's prior Missouri convictions for unlawful use of a weapon, second-degree robbery, and first-degree robbery as three violent felonies. Without the sentence enhancement, the statutory maximum punishment would have been ten years' imprisonment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Swopes appealed his sentence and argued that the convictions for unlawful use of a weapon and second-degree robbery should not have counted as violent felonies. We vacated the judgment on the ground that second-degree robbery in Missouri was not a violent felony under the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175196\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/963/#p965\">\n    840 F.3d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 965-67 (8th Cir. 2016).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The court then granted rehearing en banc, overruled\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   , and concluded that the district court properly counted Swopes's Missouri robbery conviction as a violent felony.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Swopes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516467\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/668/\">\n    886 F.3d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2018) (en banc). The en banc court returned the case to this panel to resolve the balance of Swopes's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Swopes argues that unlawful use of a weapon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20571.030.1\">\n    Mo.

Swopes argues that\n   <em>\n    Pulliam\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided and also has been superseded by the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Descamps v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    570 U.S. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), and\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    559 U.S. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1265/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1265/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). We considered a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277624\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/807/\">\n    851 F.3d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2017), and concluded that\n   <em>\n    Pulliam\n   </em>\n   was not superseded by\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , or by developments in Missouri law.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 809-10. Swopes also contends that\n   <em>\n    Pulliam\n   </em>\n   is inconsistent with the decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jordan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085338\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1183/\">\n    812 F.3d 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2016), concerning a conviction for aggravated assault in Arkansas. But\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   , of course, involved a different state statute; the\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   panel could not overrule\n   <em>\n    Pulliam\n   </em>\n   's conclusion about the Missouri statute and did not purport to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Pulliam\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that Swopes's conviction for unlawful use of a weapon in Missouri was a conviction for a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e). Swopes therefore had sustained three previous convictions for a violent felony at the time of his offense in this case, and the district court properly applied the sentencing enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    The Honorable Ronnie L.
