In this direct appeal, Welshans raises two claims. First, he argues that his due process right to a fair trial was violated because the prosecution informed the jury, through both evidence and argument, that his child pornography files included deeply abhorrent videos and images of bestiality, bondage, and acts of violence against very young children. Second, Welshans raises a procedural sentencing claim, challenging the application of the obstruction of justice enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Regarding his first claim, we agree with Welshans on two points-that the challenged evidence was inadmissible under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cunningham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522456\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/372/#p391\">\n    694 F.3d 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 391 (3d Cir. 2012), and that the prosecutor's closing argument improperly appealed to the passions of the jury. However, we conclude that the misconduct did not so infect Welshans's trial with unfairness as to violate due process. Therefore, we will affirm his conviction. As to Welshans's sentencing claim, we will reverse and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In February 2014, the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General determined that child pornography was being shared by an Internet Protocol (IP) address associated with a subscriber later identified as Welshans's aunt. Law enforcement agents executed a search warrant on her home on March 21, 2014 at 7:30 a.m. The agents found no child pornography, but learned that Welshans, who lived nearby, used the wireless Internet at his aunt's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Immediately thereafter, half of the agents went to Welshans's house to set up surveillance and to make note of any people leaving or entering. The other agents quickly obtained a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Around the same time, Welshans's aunt called him with a warning that police officers were \"on their way\" to his house, App. 497, and were \"looking for stuff\" involving his computers, App. 495. At 9:30 a.m., Welshans began moving files into his laptop computer's recycling bin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At 10:10 a.m., agents executed a search warrant at Welshans's home. Welshans, who was combative, was \"detained,\" handcuffed, and removed from the house. App. 339. He was held by two agents at the rear of a marked police car, and later detained un-cuffed inside the cruiser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Meanwhile, Welshans's laptop computer continued to move files into the recycling bin. As explained at trial, this process could run automatically because, after a user selects multiple files to drag into the recycling bin, the process runs until all of the selected files are moved. This process was interrupted at 11:05 a.m. by an agent, who discovered Welshans's laptop and pulled out its battery. By this time, approximately seven hundred and fifty files\n   had been moved into the recycling bin. They were easily restored, and none were lost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In total, the Government recovered an extensive collection of child pornography files from both the laptop and from Welshans's desktop computer-over ten thousand images and hundreds of videos. Welshans did not dispute that the recovered material was child pornography. Nor did he dispute that child pornography had been distributed through a file-sharing network from his laptop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Welshans admitted that he was the sole user of his laptop and desktop computers. (A Government expert reached the same conclusion based upon a forensic review of them). Welshans also admitted that he used his aunt's wireless Internet, the IP address that distributed the child pornography. He conceded that he installed and used a file-sharing network on his laptop, and that he was at his aunt's house on March 20, 2014-the last date that child pornography files were added to his laptop and the day before his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   But Welshans disputed whether he\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that there was child pornography on his computers. He testified and denied any such knowledge, but offered \"no explanation\" for how child pornography \"ended up on [them].\" App. 513.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As stated above, the Government recovered an extensive trove of child pornography from Welshans's computers. Exactly what the jury heard about the content of these files is central to this appeal, and so we must describe this content in detail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522456\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/372/#p391\">\n    694 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   377 n.8 (confronting the same problem).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This content, as will become clear, was particularly \"loathsome\" even within the universe of child pornography crimes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522456\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/372/#p391\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 381 n.10. Its particular nature elicits strong responses of disgust and anger. Therefore, for the sake of the reader, we will only summarize the evidence. This summary, it bears noting, should not be taken as a substitute for the actual trial evidence, which was far more explicit and which forms the basis for our Rule 403 analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties addressed the content of the child pornography to be admitted at trial, in part, via pretrial motions. Welshans offered to stipulate that the videos and images recovered constituted child pornography as a matter of law. The Government rejected the proposed stipulation. Instead, it sought to introduce a small subset of the images and videos recovered and promised not to introduce exceedingly violent and graphic ones. The Government went on to explain that, in light of this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522456\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/372/#p391\">\n    694 F.3d at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it had \"specifically excluded bondage\" from the proffered videos to be shown to the jury. App. 52. Providing one deeply disturbing example, the Government specified that it would not introduce videos \"show[ing] a nine-year-old girl bound with yellow rope on her arms and legs being sexually abused by both an adult male and a dog. We're not showing any of that ....\" App. 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As to the two videos to be shown to the jury, the District Court found that they were \"prejudicial\" and \"disturbing,\" but that the unfair prejudice did not outweigh their probative value. App. 58. The District Court found that the selected videos were admissible under Rule 403\"[g]iven that the government is proposing this very limited, highly condensed and representative sample of the total amount of evidence that exists and also given the fact that the government has presented ... limiting instructions.\" App. 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pursuant to this pretrial ruling, the Government showed the jury two video clips, without sound, for approximately two and a half minutes. The District Court gave cautionary instructions both before and after playing the videos and during the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   These two videos, however, were not the only evidence presented to the jury regarding the nature of the child pornography recovered from Welshans's computers. While the Government did not show any videos or images it deemed inadmissible under\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   , it did tell the jury about them-and repeatedly. It introduced both testimony and exhibits that described horrific sexual acts of bestiality, bondage, and violence perpetrated on very young children, including babies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To summarize the evidence at issue we begin with Exhibit 2. This Government Exhibit contained five, detailed, paragraph-length descriptions of abhorrent acts of bestiality, bondage, and violence against children. The descriptions include gruesome references to a young child being sexually victimized by man and a dog, being forcibly bound with rope, strapped with a belt, blindfolded, and forced to wear a choker collar. This Exhibit was sent into the jury room during deliberations. In addition, an agent read portions of Exhibit 2 aloud to the jury, including references to the child victim being subjected to bestiality and bondage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Other exhibits reiterated the message that Welshans possessed deeply abhorrent videos and images of child pornography. The Government introduced disturbing file names and file paths that described, for example, the rape of a one year old baby, the anal rape of a child, and a sexual assault by a dog. These too were sent to the jury room during deliberations. A few of these file names were circled in red before the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. 332 (\"I'll circle it here[.]\"). The prosecutor and witnesses read others aloud to the jury. The jury also heard that the file names were consistent with their content. For example, an agent testified that file names including the terms \"1yo, 2yo are indicative ... of what the subject matter would be\"-child pornography depicting sexual assaults perpetrated on one and two year old toddlers. App. 406.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Emphasizing the point, the Government elicited testimony from three separate agents that the videos shown to the jury were not the worst of the child pornography recovered. One agent told the jury that there were \"worse\" videos depicting \"bondage and bestiality.\" App. 295. Another agent testified that he found \"child pornography involving infants.\" App. 428. He told the jury that one thousand five hundred images \"depict[ed] the rape or molestation of toddlers, babies, and infants.\" App. 430. He told the jury that the videos depicted acts of sexual violence on children, including \"bondage\" and \"penetration of prepubescent children.\" App. 431-32. He testified that what the jury was shown was not \"representative of the full substance\" of the child pornography recovered because there were \"far more violent representations on the computer, far younger victims on this computer.\" App. 442. Another agent testified that there were \"worse images or videos,\" in which a child known to the testifying agent \"is bound by rope and belts and ... forced to have sex with a dog.\" App. 467.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition to this evidence, the Government's opening and closing statements also highlighted the horrific nature of some of the child pornography recovered from Welshans's computers. During its opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that the videos to be shown were \"not nearly the worse [sic] of this selection\" and \"not the most violent.\" App. 252-53. In\n   closing, the prosecutor \"pull[ed] up Exhibit 2\" and asked the jury to \"[r]emember some of the things ... read to us, some of the horrible, disgusting terms ... read to us that the defendant possessed and distributed.\" App. 658. The Government went on to argue that \"[t]here were images and videos of a little girl, a child being forced to do horrible things with dogs, a child being tied up, bound, collar around her neck, naked.\" App. 658. The Government argued to the jury \"[w]hat you saw wasn't the most violent, it wasn't the most horrific, it wasn't the worse of the worse [sic] ... It was a small cleaned-up portion just so you as the jurors would have the evidence ....\" App. 659.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The jury convicted Welshans of distribution and possession of child pornography.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), (b)(1), (a)(4)(B). At sentencing, the District Court applied numerous Sentencing Guideline enhancements for specific offense characteristics, including enhancements for material involving \"a prepubescent minor or a minor who had not attained the age of 12,\" for material portraying \"sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence; or ... sexual abuse or exploitation of an infant or toddler,\" and for the number of files involved. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2), (4), (7)(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The District Court also applied a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. It found that the enhancement applied because Welshans moved files into his laptop's recycling bin in a \"panic\" after receiving a call from his aunt that the police were on their way to his house. App. 1053. This enhancement increased the offense level to 39. Welshans had a criminal history score of zero, which produced a Guideline range of 262 to 327 months. The Court varied downward to offense level 34, resulting in a final Guideline range of 151 to 188 months. It sentenced Welshans to the low end of the Guidelines range: 151 months' imprisonment and 10 years' supervised release. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The District Court had jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There is no dispute as to any of the following facts: his laptop and desktop computers contained child pornography. Welshans was the sole user of the two computers. He installed and used a file-sharing network on his laptop. The laptop's file-sharing network was used to distribute child pornography. Welshans used the Internet account from which the child pornography was distributed. He was at his aunt's house, where the files were shared, on the last day his laptop accessed child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Despite all of this, Welshans asked the jury to find-on the basis of his credibility alone-that he did not know that there was child pornography on his computers. We cannot hold that the Government's misconduct affected this credibility determination.

Welshans provided no plausible explanation for how child pornography could have been amassed and stored on his computers without his knowledge. Child pornography was found on both his laptop and desktop computers. The number of files was immense-over ten thousand images and hundreds of videos. Not only that, Welshans tried to rid himself of the evidence at the last minute-albeit ineptly-when his aunt called to tell him that the police were en route \"looking for stuff\" involving his computers.

Section 3C1.1 does not define \"material hindrance.\" Application Note 6, however, defines a phrase with a common word, \"material evidence.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n.6 (\" 'Material' evidence, fact, statement, or information, as used in this section, means evidence, fact, statement, or information that, if believed, would tend to influence or\n   <em>\n    affect\n   </em>\n   the issue under determination.\") (emphasis added).

But Welshans too was continuing to delete files when the police entered his home. While the dissent would make much of the fact that Welshans was not \"actively\" concealing evidence, Dissenting Op. at 584-85;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 583, the Guidelines make no such distinction between active and passive concealment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Savard\n    </em>\n    , the obstruction was \"contemporaneous\" despite a gap in time between the conduct and arrest. In the face of this holding, the dissent attempts to distinguish the gap in time in\n    <em>\n     Savard\n    </em>\n    from the analogous gap in time in Welshans's case based upon the physical position of the police. Yet in both cases, the police were closing in on the defendants physically. In\n    <em>\n     Savard\n    </em>\n    , the police were knocking at the hatch of the boat. In Welshans's case, agents were surveilling his house and the arresting agents were en route. Indeed, the dissent acknowledges that the surveilling agents had already arrived when Welshans acted, Dissenting Op. at 585, although it elsewhere elides this point by stating that Welshans acted before agents \"arrived\n    <em>\n     to search\n    </em>\n    ,\" Dissenting Op. at 583, 584-85, 585 (emphasis added). Moreover, the impact on Welshans was the same as in\n    <em>\n     Savard\n    </em>\n    -he acted in \"panic,\" as the District Court found. App. 1053.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Welshans's case does not require us to rule on the propriety of these decisions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The dissent characterizes our holding as resting solely on the fact that Welshans acted \"upon learning of an investigation likely to result in arrest,\" and suggests that the result would be the same regardless of the interval between the defendant's conduct and arrest. Dissenting Op. at 585. This is not so. Rather, we rely on the totality of the circumstances, including that Welshans acted in a \"panic,\" App. 1053, when he believed arrest was imminent, as agents were surveilling his house, and shortly before he was detained.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Furthermore, our holding will not produce the consequences invoked by the dissent. Critically, the dissent focuses on one element of the Application Note-obstructive conduct that occurs \"contemporaneously with arrest\"-even though the Guidelines also require that the conduct \"result[ ] in a material hindrance to the official investigation.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n.4(D). This is a conjunctive test: if the conduct occurs contemporaneously with an arrest but does not materially hinder the investigation, it does not qualify for the enhancement. As noted above, the deleted files were easily restored. Thus, our reading is not as far-reaching as the dissent suggests; a defendant is not \"exempt from the ... enhancement\" if he permanently destroys evidence, even if his actions begin as soon as he \"believe[s] he would be arrested.\" Dissenting Op. at 585.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n  <author id=\"p-101\">\n   FUENTES, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   I agree with the majority's prosecutorial misconduct analysis. I disagree, however, with my colleagues' conclusion that the District Court erred in applying a sentencing enhancement for obstruction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 because Welshans' attempted deletion of child pornography files from his laptop computer occurred \"contemporaneously with arrest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   No one disputes that, on the morning Welshans was found in possession of thousands of child pornography images and videos, Welshans' aunt warned him that agents were en route to his home. After being warned, but 40 minutes before agents arrived to search his home, Welshans highlighted incriminating files on his laptop and selected \"delete.\" Each file then sequentially moved to the laptop's recycle bin. Thereafter, Welshans stashed the laptop between couch cushions so it would not be discovered. Importantly, the process of moving files to the recycle bin occurred automatically and outside of Welshans' presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   With this context in mind, it cannot be that Welshans' purposeful conduct-which, again, occurred\n   <em>\n    well before\n   </em>\n   agents arrived to search his home-falls within the \"contemporaneously with arrest\" exception to \u00a7 3C1.1 's obstruction enhancement. By holding otherwise, the majority permits that limited exception to swallow the rule that obstructive conduct triggers an enhanced sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Because Welshans clearly attempted to destroy material evidence, I would affirm the District Court's imposition of the obstruction enhancement. I therefore respectfully dissent from Part IV of the majority's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   As the majority observes, \u00a7 3C1.1 provides for a two-level sentencing enhancement when \"the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.\" The enhancement applies where,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a defendant attempts to destroy or conceal \"evidence that is material to an official investigation or judicial proceeding.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this regard, \u00a7 3C1.1 notes, by way of non-exhaustive example, that\n   \"shredding a document or destroying ledgers upon learning that an official investigation has commenced or is about to commence\" qualifies for an obstruction enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Nevertheless, if otherwise covered conduct \"occurred contemporaneously with arrest,\" that conduct, \"standing alone,\" is insufficient to warrant an obstruction enhancement \"unless it results in a material hindrance to the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense or the sentencing of the offender.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying on this exception, today the majority holds that the obstruction enhancement was improper because Welshans acted \"contemporaneously with arrest\" and the Government was not materially hindered since the files were easily restored. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The majority notes that \"contemporaneous\" is \"a flexible term\" which \"could mean minutes or years.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, \" '[c]ontemporaneous' for purposes of \u00a7 3C1.1 has been construed to encompass obstructive conduct just prior to arrest, as when the police are at the defendant's door.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, \"this limited exception [ ] include[s] only conduct admitting a spontaneous or visceral or reflexive response occurring at the point arrest becomes imminent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"It does not ... apply to [ ] cool and deliberate actions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In finding that Welshans acted \"contemporaneously with arrest,\" the majority relies heavily on the Tenth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Norman\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   However,\n   <em>\n    Norman\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Norman\n   </em>\n   , the defendant caused a car accident and attempted to hide drugs in dirt in front of his car. While it is true that the defendant \"began hiding the [drugs] before the police arrived,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   in concluding that he acted \"contemporaneously with arrest,\" the Court stressed that the defendant was still attempting to conceal evidence when the police arrived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this regard, the Court observed that the defendant \"was [ ] 'kicking at the dirt' in front of his car when the first officer\" arrived and that he \"was arrested within moments of that arrival.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Here, unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Norman\n   </em>\n   , Welshans was not actively engaged in obstructive conduct when the agents arrived to search his home. Rather, 40 minutes before the agents arrived, Welshans chose a large group of files, selected \"delete,\" and hid the laptop between couch cushions. What's more, as the majority observes, after Welshans' conduct, the transfer of files to the recycle bin \"could run automatically\" without his presence at the computer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, in my view, Welshans' conduct was not the type of reflexive action excepted from the enhancement. To the contrary, Welshans' conduct appears calculated and purposeful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The majority also relies on the Eleventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Moreover, while there was a gap between the obstruction and arrest in that case, it was undisputed that agents remained on the boat for that entire period. In contrast, here, Welshans acted 40 minutes before agents arrived to search his home. Further, while it is true that agents were surveilling Welshans' home around the time of his conduct, none of those agents entered his home until the search warrant was executed, 40 minutes after Welshans acted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Finally, on a practical level, interpreting \"contemporaneously with arrest\" to capture Welshans' conduct could produce absurd results. The following hypothetical, of which there are myriad variations, is illustrative. Suppose that, like Welshans, a defendant unsuccessfully tried to destroy evidence after learning that agents were en route. Further suppose that the defendant believed he would be arrested when the agents arrived. However, unlike our case, suppose that the agents had a car accident and were delayed until the next day. Under today's holding, our hypothetical defendant's failed attempt to destroy evidence would have occurred \"contemporaneously with arrest\"-and thus would be exempt from the obstruction enhancement-even though the agents were delayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Simply, today the majority indicates that-so long as there is no material hindrance-obstructive acts taken upon learning of an investigation likely to result in arrest occur \"contemporaneously with arrest.\" I cannot agree with such a result. While our Court has not defined \"contemporaneously with arrest,\" I disagree with the majority that Welshans' obstructive conduct meets this limited exception. I would therefore find that the \"material hindrance\" requirement is inapplicable and the District Court was permitted to apply the obstruction enhancement even though the Government recovered the files before they were permanently erased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, while I join my colleagues in affirming Welshans' conviction, I dissent from the decision to reverse the application of the obstruction enhancement and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n.4(D).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514036\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/506/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514036\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/506/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Maj.
