A jury convicted Stoddard and Woodruff under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 841(b)(1), and 846 for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin, and acquitted Jerome Cobble of the same charges. The jury returned a guilty verdict for Cobble on a separate charge of conspiracy to launder money in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   These prosecutions originated from an investigation the Government began in 2012 that focused on a notorious drug dealer, Jermaine Washington, who had recently been released from prison. After employing traditional surveillance techniques, the Government successfully applied for two wiretaps on Washington's cell phone. The evidence presented at Appellants' trial consisted, primarily, of conversations recorded from the wiretaps and the testimony of Washington interpreting the language in the conversations between Washington and the three defendants. After the Appellants were convicted, the District Court sentenced Stoddard and Woodruff to mandatory-minimum sentences triggered by the drug quantity that the jury had found to be attributable to the conspiracy as a whole. Appellants assert that the District Court committed multiple errors in ruling on pretrial motions, at trial, and at sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, we (1) affirm the District Court's denial of Appellants' motions to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the wiretaps because the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Government had met the \"necessity\" requirement; (2) affirm the District Court's denial of Stoddard's and Woodruff's motions for acquittal; (3) affirm the District Court's denial of Woodruff's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude evidence of a prior conviction if Woodruff had testified in his own defense; and (4) find no plain error in the District Court's jury instructions on the money-laundering charge. But we (5) reverse the District Court's denial of Cobble's motion for acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to sustain his money-laundering conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We also (6) vacate the sentences of Stoddard and Woodruff, remand for resentencing, and hold that, in order for a defendant to be sentenced based on a mandatory minimum triggered by a certain quantity of drugs, a jury must find the drug quantity attributable to the defendant on an individualized basis, not just the drug quantity attributable to the conspiracy as a whole. Finally, we reserve judgment on whether the District Court properly applied the career-offender enhancement before sentencing Woodruff, and instruct the District Court, on remand, to make that assessment based on new briefing from the parties and taking into account the intervening decision in\n   <em>\n    Beckles v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the spring of 2012, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department partnered with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") to investigate the heroin-trafficking activities of Jermaine Washington in the D.C. metro-area. Washington had been released from prison in 2010. The Government used an informant to make controlled drug-buys in Southeast D.C. and, shortly thereafter, identified Washington as a potential source of heroin. Based on an extensive affidavit by FBI Special Agent Joshua Taylor, filed under seal, the District Court granted the Government's application for a wiretap on Washington's cell phone from July 16, 2012, through August 14, 2012. A second 30-day wiretap, also based on a sealed affidavit, was authorized on August 16, 2012. The Government also began surveilling Washington in the D.C. metro-area. The Government recorded several phone calls between Washington and Woodruff and between Washington and Stoddard. In the course of its physical surveillance, the Government observed Woodruff and Stoddard each meet with Washington one time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Jerome Cobble is Washington's cousin. During the course of the Government's investigation, Cobble helped Washington purchase two vehicles. After initial reluctance, Cobble agreed to help Washington finance a Nissan Altima, and Cobble purchased the car in his own name. In the summer of 2012, Washington wrecked the Altima and discussed getting Cobble to help him buy a Lexus SUV, again in Cobble's name. On July 23, 2012, Cobble traded in the wrecked Altima and financed the purchase of the Lexus SUV from an auto dealer in Virginia for $30,000, making a $3,700 cash down payment from money Washington had won gambling in Atlantic City. As with the Altima, Cobble financed the car in his name, but the car would be Washington's to use and possess. Shortly after the purchase, the Lexus SUV was stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Government searched Washington's apartment on December 6, 2012, pursuant to a search warrant, and it recovered 20.1 grams of heroin, a digital scale, and $17,850 in cash. Washington agreed to cooperate, and on April 11, 2013, he pleaded guilty to drug-distribution conspiracy charges, and conspiracy to launder money and commit wire fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging Calvin Stoddard, Jerome Cobble, and Sidney Woodruff with conspiracy to distribute 100 grams or more of heroin in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 846, and aiding and abetting under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The indictment also charged Cobble with conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to commit wire fraud under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h), 1349.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before the trial proceedings began, Appellants filed motions to suppress evidence obtained through the wiretaps on Washington's cell phone, including the recorded\n   conversations between Washington and each Appellant. Appellants argued that the Government's wiretap applications had not met the necessity requirement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The District Court denied the motions, ultimately concluding that the Government had met the necessity requirement and that it had shown in the wiretap application that other investigative techniques were reasonably unlikely to succeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At a status conference the day before trial, the Government informed the District Court that it was uncertain if it could proceed because Washington, its star witness, was acting strange and showing signs of reluctance to testify. After a delay to administer a competency evaluation to Washington, which he passed, the trial began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At trial, the Government presented testimony of three law enforcement officers who had participated in the investigation, testimony from an expert in code words and methods used by drug dealers, and testimony of alleged co-conspirator Sandra Settles. Washington's testimony provided the strongest evidence against all three defendants. Washington interpreted the conversations from wiretapped phone calls, which were played for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Washington testified at trial about drug transactions with Stoddard and Woodruff, and about Cobble's role in helping him purchase a vehicle. The Government presented evidence consisting of audio recordings of conversations between Washington and Stoddard and between Washington and Woodruff, and Washington's testimony interpreting statements in those conversations. Some of this evidence included statements by Appellants that suggest they were negotiating prices and settling accounts from previous transactions with Washington.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A. 356-58 (Woodruff); A. 397-402 (Stoddard). For example, the Government played a conversation in which Woodruff stated: \"I got somebody coming to town, man, that's trying to get 40, man, but he going to be here about 10:00 tonight ....\" A. 363. Washington testified that he understood Woodruff to mean that Woodruff had a customer who \"wanted to come and purchase 40 grams of heroin.\" A. 364. In another recorded conversation played at trial, Stoddard said to Washington, \"[i]nstead of trying to grab for the extra two, I probably need just to leave that, you know, just keep it,\" which Washington testified was part of a discussion between the two men about the cut of heroin Stoddard was going to purchase from Washington and the tolerance of different heroin users. A. 390-91. Another conversation featured a discussion between Stoddard and Washington in which the men appeared again to discuss the discrepancies between, and preferences of, heroin-buyers. During that conversation, Washington stated that \"[e]verybody's clientele is different.\" A. 394. Later in the conversation, Stoddard noted that he \"learn[ed] a lot\" from Washington. A. 395. Washington testified that, from 2011 to 2013, Woodruff purchased heroin from Washington \"[o]ver ten times,\" A. 353, and that Stoddard purchased heroin from Washington between two and four times. A. 378.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Washington also offered testimony against his cousin, Jerome Cobble. Washington testified that Cobble helped him purchase a Lexus SUV from a car dealer in Virginia, and that Washington was dealing heroin during that time period and not otherwise employed. A. 413-16. Cobble \"put the [title of the] vehicle in his name for [Washington] because at the time [Washington] didn't have a driver's license.\" A. 416. Washington recalled that both he and Cobble went to the car dealership together, and were in \"the finance department\" of the dealership together\n   when they purchased the vehicle. A. 418. Washington made the down-payment on the Lexus with over $3,000 he had won placing a $10 bet at a casino in Atlantic City. A. 416-17. Washington took possession of the Lexus and kept it at his residence. A. 418-19. Washington and Cobble planned to make payments on the vehicle from Cobble's bank account, into which Washington would make monthly deposits to cover the payment. A. 418-20. The Lexus was stolen before any payments were made, but Washington testified that he may have used the Lexus to sell heroin during the short time he had the vehicle. A. 419. The Government also played a recorded conversation between Cobble and Washington in which they discussed buying some marijuana. A. 421-22. In that same conversation, Washington told Cobble about Washington's attempt to purchase a gun and some bullets. A. 422-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At various times during his direct and cross examinations, Washington behaved erratically and made statements suggesting his unreliability as a witness. For example, he stated that \"[i]f somebody needed a false statement, and they was trying to pay some money for it, I sell it to them.\" A. 486. He repeatedly suggested he would \"not remember\" anything that was not written down or recorded.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A. 495. His emotional tumult was on display as well. At its apex, he had to be removed from the courtroom when questioned about his relationship with his cousin, Cobble. A. 507-08. After this outburst, all three defendants moved for a mistrial, which the District Court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The lawyers for each defendant rested their cases as soon as the Government had presented its case-in-chief. The defendants each moved for judgments of acquittal. The District Court denied Woodruff's and Stoddard's motions from the bench and reserved ruling on Cobble's motion. After further briefing, the District Court denied Cobble's motion for acquittal as well. In denying Cobble's motion for acquittal, the District Court noted that Cobble had argued only that there was insufficient evidence of \"concealment money laundering\" but that the Government had charged him with both concealment and promotional money laundering. A. 129. In holding that the evidence was sufficient to support a promotional money-laundering theory, the District Court relied on evidence that Washington had \"on various occasions used a vehicle to deliver narcotics to buyers ... along with evidence of Cobble's close relationship with Washington ....\" A. 129-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Government had initially proposed individual verdict forms that would have required the jury to determine the quantity of drugs attributable to each defendant. But the District Court, while recognizing that \"there's a [circuit] split\" on the issue, decided to use a verdict form without individualized drug-quantity determinations. A. 685. The jury found Woodruff and Stoddard guilty of the drug-conspiracy charge and found that the conspiracy, as a whole, involved 100 grams or more of heroin. The jury found Cobble not guilty of the drug conspiracy charge but guilty of the money laundering charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Woodruff and Stoddard each moved for a new trial because, they contended, the jury should have found the amount of drugs attributable to each of them individually rather than the amount attributable to the conspiracy as a whole. The Government opposed the motion but agreed with the defendants that the jury should have been given a verdict form that instructed the jury to find an amount attributable to each defendant, and therefore that the District Court should sentence the defendants based on an indeterminate quantity of heroin, not the 100 grams the jury had\n   found were attributable to the conspiracy as a whole. The District Court denied these motions and ruled that there was no need for individual findings of the drug quantity for each defendant. The District Court explained its reasoning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The fact that subjects the defendants to the enhanced statutory maximum of 40 years is that the conspiracy involved 100 grams or more of heroin. That fact was submitted to the jury and found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. ...\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   did not address whether a jury must find that the amount of drugs that triggers a statutory mandatory minimum penalty in a narcotics conspiracy is attributable to the conduct of a convicted conspirator-or is reasonably foreseeable by him or her as the amount involved in the conspiracy-before that amount's penalties are triggered for that conspirator. The circuits have split on how ... to properly resolve this question. ... The D.C. Circuit has not resolved this question either. ... The instructions provided to the jury here and the corresponding verdict form are consistent with the view that the jury need determine only the amount of drugs attributable to the entire conspiracy, but not to the individual defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A. 109-14 (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Woodruff and Stoddard raised the issue again at sentencing, arguing that the District Court should decline to impose a five-year mandatory minimum or a forty-year statutory maximum, both of which are applicable when a defendant conspires to distribute 100 grams or more of heroin under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B). The Government agreed with this assessment in its initial sentencing memorandum. The District Court overruled the objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Woodruff also objected to other aspects of his PSR, including his career-offender designation resulting from a 1984 armed-robbery conviction and a 1991 drug-distribution conviction in Maryland. The PSR recommended applying a career-offender enhancement under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 with an offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of VI, which would have resulted in a guidelines range of 262 to 327 months. Woodruff objected, but the District Court did not rule on the objection, finding instead that it would not matter because \"[b]oth parties seek a sentence below the guidelines that would apply ....\" A. 732-33, 736.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The District Court determined that a guidelines range of 262 to 327 months applied to Woodruff and departed downward for a sentence of 80 months, followed by 48 months of supervised release. The District Court noted, \"[f]or the record, [it] would have imposed this same sentence if no five-year mandatory minimum had applied here.\" A. 741. The District Court gave Stoddard a 60-month sentence, which it believed to be the appropriate mandatory minimum, along with 48 months of supervised release. Cobble was sentenced to 24 months of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   All Appellants challenge the District Court's denial of their motions to suppress the evidence gathered as a result of the wiretaps, and the District Court's denial of each Appellant's motion for acquittal. In addition, Cobble challenges the District Court's jury instructions on money laundering; Stoddard and Woodruff challenge their sentences because the jury never found that each of them was individually responsible for over 100 grams of heroin; Woodruff challenges the District Court's ruling on a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   that, if he were to testify in his own defense, the Government would be able to introduce his 1984 armed-robbery conviction to impeach him; and Woodruff also challenges the\n   District Court's use of the 1984 armed-robbery conviction as a basis to apply the career-offender sentencing enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, Appellants contend that the District Court erred in denying their motions to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the wiretaps. In evaluating this challenge, \"we review the district court's legal conclusions\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and its factual findings for clear error.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because the District Court \"merely parroted the statutory language,\" Appellants claim there was never \"any specific showing that a wiretap was necessary.\" Appellants' Br. 32-33. They also claim that the affidavit by Special Agent Taylor was defective because he \"used vague and boilerplate language about drug conspiracy investigations\n   <em>\n    in general\n   </em>\n   \" to justify the wiretap.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   None of Appellants' arguments has merit. In fact, the authorizing court based its wiretap authorization on a finding of probable cause that Washington would be communicating via his cell phone concerning \"the nature, scope, extent and methods of operation of the narcotics trafficking activities in which the targeted subjects and others as yet unknown ... are engaged.\" A. 51. Relying on Special Agent Taylor's sealed affidavit, the District Court found that it had been \"established that normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed, reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried, or are too dangerous to employ.\" A. 52. Appellants ignore the significant portion of Special\n   Agent Taylor's wiretap application devoted to the specific information collected and investigative techniques employed up until the point of the wiretap application.

We assume without deciding that a reasonable factfinder could infer that Cobble knew the money Washington planned to pay on the Lexus note was likely to come from drug-trafficking proceeds because the two men were close, and there was sufficient evidence to show that Cobble knew that Washington was a drug dealer. Thus, we analyze whether the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate that Cobble entered a conspiracy either knowing that the transaction was designed to \"conceal or disguise\" the origin of the drug-trafficking proceeds or with the specific intent to \"promote\" Washington's drug-trafficking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Cobble's conviction cannot be sustained under a concealment theory. The evidence was insufficient for a rational trier of fact to find that Cobble violated \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), because no evidence showed that the transaction was designed to conceal the source of the funds, and Cobble's innocent explanation for engaging in the transaction-helping his cousin purchase a car for personal use-was never challenged by the Government through the presentation of evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Law\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570473,3581196\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/528/888/\">\n    528 F.3d at 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Apparently, the District Court agreed with this assessment because, after struggling to find any evidence that Cobble \"joined in an agreement with any intent to promote drug dealing\" or conceal the source of funds, A. 715, it ruled that evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict under a promotional money-laundering theory. A. 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Government unpersuasively attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Law\n   </em>\n   by arguing that sufficient evidence was presented at trial to sustain Cobble's conviction, Appellee's Br. 55-56, but the Government fails to point to any evidence that the transaction was designed to conceal the source of the funds (much less that Cobble had knowledge of any such design). This is because there was no such evidence. Cobble and Washington openly went to the dealership and purchased the car together, both sitting in the finance department as they made arrangements for Cobble to purchase the Lexus in his name and for Washington to take possession of the vehicle. And after the purchase, Washington took possession of the Lexus, keeping it at his house until it was stolen shortly thereafter. Nothing about the transaction to purchase the Lexus SUV shows\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   indicia of a design to conceal the \"nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control\" of the proceeds used to purchase the Lexus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The evidence presented at trial was also insufficient to sustain Cobble's conviction under the Statute's promotion prong. The Government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Cobble intended to promote Washington's drug dealing in order to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trejo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696057\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/610/308/#p314\">\n    610 F.3d at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is not enough to show that a money launderer's actions\n   <em>\n    resulted\n   </em>\n   in\n   promoting the carrying on of specified unlawful activity.

Instead, there must be evidence of\n   <em>\n    intentional\n   </em>\n   promotion.\") (internal citations omitted, emphasis in original). Cobble was acquitted of charges that he was involved in the conspiracy to distribute heroin.

This principle from\n   <em>\n    Law\n   </em>\n   applies with just as much force in the context of promotional money laundering, and the Government's presentation of evidence to prove Cobble's intent to promote the illegal activity was insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Washington testified that Cobble had nothing to do with his heroin-dealing operation, and the jury apparently believed him. The Government proffered no evidence at trial to overcome\n   <em>\n    its own witness's testimony\n   </em>\n   that there was an innocent explanation for Cobble's assistance in purchasing the Lexus SUV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At oral argument, counsel for the Government contended that there was a \"mountain of evidence\" showing that Cobble's knowledge about the drug-conspiracy was so extensive that it could demonstrate to the jury Cobble's intent. Oral Arg. Recording at 31:19-31:30;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:00-32:00. But that \"mountain\" was a molehill. The only evidence the Government could point to merely showed that Cobble and Washington were close, that they talked on the phone at one point about Washington purchasing a gun and bullets and buying a relatively small amount of marijuana together, A. 421-23, 428-29, and that Washington told Cobble that he was doing well enough financially to afford the auto payments. None of that evidence suffices to demonstrate that Cobble even\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   about the heroin-trafficking operation, much less that he\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   to promote Washington's heroin dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This evidentiary showing does not meet the Statute's requirement that the Government put on evidence sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Cobble conducted \"a financial transaction ... with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity.\" Whatever Cobble might have known about Washington, Cobble offered the innocent explanation that he purchased the car in his name to help out his cousin who had bad credit and no driver's license. The Government never offered evidence to rebut Cobble's explanation, and not nearly enough evidence was introduced to support the Government's theory that Cobble intended to promote Washington's illegal activities. We therefore reverse Cobble's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In order to convict Woodruff and Stoddard of a drug conspiracy, the Government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the two men had \"knowingly entered into a conspiracy with the specific intent to further the objective of distributing narcotics.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Appellants point out that the Government presented no direct evidence linking Stoddard or Woodruff to distribution of heroin. In addition to Washington's testimony and the recorded conversations, the evidence included testimony from the Government's cooperating witness-Sandra Settles-and two FBI agents who had listened to the wiretaps and been involved in the investigation.

The jury below was required to determine only whether the defendants had conspired to distribute some amount of a substance containing heroin, and whether the amount of heroin ultimately distributed in connection with the conspiracy exceeded 100 grams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The District Court instructed the jury that \"the government must show the defendant's membership in the narcotics conspiracy,\" but \"[t]he defendant need not know ... all of the details of the narcotics conspiracy, nor the means by which its purposes were to be accomplished.\" Trial Tr., 35, No. 13-CR-200, June 5, 2015 (AM). \"It is necessary [ ] that the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n   defendant was aware of the common purpose, had knowledge that the narcotics conspiracy existed, and was a willing participant with the intent to advance the purpose of the narcotics conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, \"[t]he specific amount of any controlled substance involved is not an element of the offense of conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36. If the jury found that each defendant had entered a conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance containing heroin, they were instructed to \"ask [them]selves whether the government proved that the amount of the mixture or substance containing heroin that was the subject of the conspiracy was 100 grams or more.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A. 92-93 (jury verdict form). Thus, the jury was not required to find that each defendant was individually responsible for entering a conspiracy to distribute 100 grams or more of heroin (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that it was \"reasonably foreseeable\" to each defendant that 100 grams or more would be distributed within the scope of the conspiracy).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The circuits are split on whether an individualized jury finding as to the quantity of drugs attributable to (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , foreseeable by) an individual defendant is required to trigger a mandatory minimum, or if it is sufficient for the jury to find that the conspiracy as a whole resulted in distribution of the mandatory-minimum-triggering quantity. The difference is subtle but important. In\n   <em>\n    Law\n   </em>\n   , we suggested a preference for the former approach. Here, that would require the jury to find that each defendant entered the conspiracy to distribute not just an indeterminate amount of heroin that turned out to be over 100 grams, but that the 100-gram quantity was reasonably foreseeable, or within the scope of the conspiracy entered by a particular defendant.

Similarly, conspiring to violate \u00a7 841(a)(1) is a \"lesser-included offense\" of conspiring to violate \u00a7 841(a)(1) when the drug quantity meets a threshold that triggers an enhanced sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The principle we set forth in\n   <em>\n    Law\n   </em>\n   that \"a defendant convicted of conspiracy to deal drugs ... must be sentenced, under \u00a7 841(b), for the quantity of drugs the jury attributes to him as a reasonably foreseeable part of the conspiracy,\" along with the\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   paradigm supports our conclusion that the individualized approach to determining a mandatory-minimum-triggering drug quantity is correct.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570473,3581196\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/528/888/\">\n    528 F.3d at 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We are also persuaded by the decisions of our sister circuits that have adopted the individualized approach.

Even in circuits that have adopted the conspiracy-wide approach, the Government has at times urged those courts to reconsider, and represented that its charging policy employs the individualized approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186133\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/328/#p366\">\n    847 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   366 &amp; n.3 (6th Cir. 2017) (\"The government also mentions it has adopted a defendant-specific approach to charging future drug conspiracies.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The District Court's error was not harmless here because the evidence was far from overwhelming with respect to the quantity of heroin involved in the conspiracy that was reasonably foreseeable to Woodruff and Stoddard.

Based on the foregoing, we vacate Stoddard's and Woodruff's sentences and remand to the District Court with instructions to re-sentence each Appellant based on the crime for which the jury found each one of them individually liable: entering into a conspiracy to distribute an indeterminate quantity of heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Because we vacate Woodruff's sentence and remand this case for resentencing consistent with our holding in \u00a7 II.E,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , we decline to reach Woodruff's challenge to the District Court's use of the career-offender enhancement to calculate his Sentencing Guidelines range.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On remand, we\n   instruct the District Court to assess anew whether it is appropriate to use the career-offender enhancement to calculate Woodruff's Guidelines Range in light of comprehensive arguments and briefing by both parties, including arguments now open to the Government in light of the Supreme Court's intervening decision in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
