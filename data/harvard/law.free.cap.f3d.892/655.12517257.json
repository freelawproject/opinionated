She is the mother of four children, all of whom are citizens of the United States. Between 2007 and 2016, Martinez was convicted three times in Maryland for petty theft. One conviction involved theft of less than $500; the others involved thefts of less than $100 each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After her third conviction, Martinez was arrested and detained by immigration officials, who sought to deport her because the convictions amounted to crimes involving moral turpitude (\"CIMT\") under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Although Martinez initially conceded removability, she later obtained counsel and contended that the theft offenses did not qualify as CIMTs and that she was entitled to apply for cancellation of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   An immigration judge concluded that the theft convictions qualified as CIMTs and that Martinez therefore was removable and was not entitled to seek cancellation of removal. The BIA affirmed, relying on its decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Diaz-Lizarraga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20847\">\n    26 I&amp;N Dec. 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 2016), to conclude that the offenses were CIMTs.

If all permutations of the conduct proscribed by the elements of the offense involve moral turpitude, then the offense categorically qualifies as a CIMT. \"But if those elements can include behavior that does not involve moral turpitude, the crime is not categorically one\n   involving moral turpitude.\"\n   <em>\n    Sotnikau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12131928\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/731/#p735\">\n    846 F.3d at 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A modification to the categorical approach applies in cases involving \"divisible\" statutes. A divisible statute is one that sets out alternate elements that create multiple forms of the criminal offense and at least one form of the offense qualifies-by its elements-as the generic predicate offense. A statute that lists alternative\n   <em>\n    means\n   </em>\n   of committing a single offense, rather than alternative\n   <em>\n    elements\n   </em>\n   , is not divisible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis v.

If the statute is divisible, then the modified categorical approach applies, which permits the court to consult a limited universe of documents to determine which of the various forms of the offense was the offense of conviction. But even when the modified categorical approach applies, the focus remains on the elements of the offense rather than the offender's conduct. As the Supreme Court has explained, the modified categorical approach does not permit us \"to substitute ... a facts-based inquiry for an elements-based one. A court may use the modified approach only to determine which alternative element in a divisible statute formed the basis of the defendant's conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/#p257\">\n    570 U.S. at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/#p257\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Martinez's theft convictions arise under \u00a7 7-104 of Maryland's criminal code, which consolidated multiple offenses into a single statute.

Thus, a defendant may be convicted under \u00a7 7-104 for a temporary taking that deprives the owner of\n   <em>\n    any portion\n   </em>\n   of the property's value. This standard is lower than the BIA's substantial-erosion standard, and it permits the state to obtain a theft conviction for joyriding, the paradigmatic example of a de minimis and non-morally-turpitudinous taking; if nothing else, a joyrider deprives the vehicle owner of the value of the gasoline, oil, and tire treads that are consumed during the ride. Indeed, as shown by documents attached to the brief of\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   , Maryland prosecuted a defendant for theft under \u00a7 7-104 after he borrowed a piece of construction equipment overnight and returned it with no damage other than scratches consistent with normal wear and tear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because \u00a7 7-104 permits de minimis, temporary takings like joyriding to be prosecuted as theft, the statute is overbroad and does not categorically qualify as a CIMT under the standard spelled out in\n   <em>\n    Diaz-Lizarraga\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The BIA therefore erred in concluding that Martinez had been convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lozano-Arredondo v.

When Martinez first appeared before the immigration judge, she was not represented by counsel, and she admitted the allegations of the Notice to Appear and conceded removability. Less than two weeks later, Martinez had obtained counsel and she appeared again before the immigration judge. Through counsel, Martinez sought to withdraw her concession that the theft convictions qualified as CIMTs and rendered her removable. The immigration judge denied the request, concluded that the convictions qualified as CIMTs, and denied Martinez's\n   application for cancellation of removal.

The immigration judge's refusal appears to have been largely based on his conclusion that the convictions qualified as CIMTs, and the BIA declined to address the withdrawal issue for the same reason. Under these circumstances, we decline to consider this issue on appeal, and we leave it for the BIA to address on remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

Indeed, a major premise underlying\n   <em>\n    Lakeysha P.\n   </em>\n   's analysis was that facts consistent with mere joyriding would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be sufficient to support a conviction for the\n   <em>\n    theft\n   </em>\n   of that automobile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 265.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Despite this, the majority nonetheless speculates that \u00a7 7-104 would treat joyriding as automobile theft because a joyrider intentionally \"deprives the vehicle owner of the value of the gasoline, oil, and tire treads that are consumed during the ride.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 662. But, to be clear, the BIA has never said that the theft of even relatively small amounts of \"gasoline, oil, and tire treads\" is not morally turpitudinous.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Matter of Scarpulla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20139\">\n    15 I&amp;N Dec. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140-41 (BIA 1974) (noting that it is \"well settled\" that petty theft involves moral turpitude). Rather, what it has specified is that a theft statute that allows joyriding to be punished as\n   <em>\n    automobile theft\n   </em>\n   cannot qualify as a crime involving moral turpitude because the intended deprivation involved in joyriding does not substantially compromise the owner's property rights\n   <em>\n    in the vehicle\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diaz-Lizarraga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20847\">\n    26 I&amp;N Dec. at 850-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, here, the majority has done no more than speculate-based on its reading of \u00a7 7-101(c) and contrary to the analysis provided in\n   <em>\n    Lakeysha P.\n   </em>\n   -that joyriding would be punished as the theft of a vehicle under \u00a7 7-104. This is precisely the type of \"application of legal imagination to a state statute's language\" that\n   <em>\n    Duenas-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   prohibits when conducting the categorical approach.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p193\">\n    549 U.S. at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p193\">\n    127 S.Ct. 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Moreover, neither the majority nor Martinez has cited to\n   <em>\n    any case\n   </em>\n   where a Maryland court has applied \u00a7 7-104 to joyriding-type conduct. The best that the majority can do is identify an instance where an individual was\n   <em>\n    charged\n   </em>\n   with theft under \u00a7 7-104 for unauthorized borrowing of property resulting in normal wear and tear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 662. But the existence of such a charge does not amount to case law and is nothing more than the \"theoretical possibility\" that\n   <em>\n    Duenas-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   instructs is insufficient.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p193\">\n    549 U.S. at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p193\">\n    127 S.Ct. 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court has made clear that Martinez \"\n   <em>\n    must at least\n   </em>\n   point to ... cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the statute\" to cover a de minimis, temporary taking.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (emphasis added). Because Martinez and the majority have not shown that there is such a case and therefore a \"realistic probability\" that Maryland courts would apply \u00a7 7-104 to \"de minimis, temporary takings like joyriding,\"\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 662, they fail in their argument that \u00a7 7-104 does not qualify as a crime involving moral turpitude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The BIA held in this case that \" MD Code, Criminal Law \u00a7 7-104 categorically matches the generic definition of a [crime involving moral turpitude] because, viewed in conjunction with the definition of 'deprive' at MD Code, Criminal Law \u00a7 7-101(c), the statute necessarily requires the perpetrator to either engage in fraud or deception, or withhold at least some of the rights and benefits of ownership from the victim with a culpable mental state,\" citing\n   <em>\n    Diaz-Lizarraga\n   </em>\n   . I agree and therefore would affirm the BIA's decision.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
