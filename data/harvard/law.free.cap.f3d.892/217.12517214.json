The district court held that the CBAs were ambiguous and relied on extrinsic evidence for its conclusion that the parties intended retiree healthcare benefits to vest for life. Because we hold that the CBAs are unambiguous, we reverse the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs are retirees who worked at Honeywell's plant in Greenville, Ohio. Honeywell owned and operated the Greenville plant from 1960 until it sold the plant in 2011. While employed at the Greenville plant, plaintiffs were members of a bargaining unit represented by the Fram Employees' Independent Union (\"FEIU\") until 2000, and after 2000 by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (\"UAW\") and UAW Local 2413.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The bargaining unit and Honeywell negotiated a series of CBAs containing the terms that would govern employer-employee relations. Although Honeywell sold the plant in 2011, the final CBA did not expire until May 22, 2014. Honeywell continued to provide healthcare benefits for retirees and their spouses after the CBA expired, but on December 28, 2015, it sent them a letter informing them that it \"intend[ed] to terminate the retiree medical and prescription drug coverage currently provided to you and your covered dependents as of December 31, 2016.\" DE 15-2, Defendant's Ex. B: 12/28/2015 Letter, Page ID 393. Plaintiffs filed suit on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated retirees, retirees' surviving spouses, and eligible dependents\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (\"LMRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Section 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , claiming that Honeywell was obligated under the CBAs to provide retirees with lifetime healthcare benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Honeywell argued that the 2011 CBA's general durational clause, which stated that the agreement remained in effect until\n   May 22, 2014, governed its duty to provide retiree healthcare benefits. Thus, it claimed that plaintiffs had no right to healthcare benefits beyond May 22, 2014. It did promise to continue providing healthcare coverage to certain surviving spouses and dependents since the 2011 CBA expressly promised that \"[u]pon the death of a retiree, the Company will continue coverage for the spouse and dependent children for their lifetime,\" provided that particular conditions were met. JA 18, 2011 CBA, at GR001053.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Honeywell filed a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, arguing that under\n   <em>\n    M &amp; G Polymers USA, LLC v.

Honeywell argued that the Greenville CBAs are legally indistinguishable from those in\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   : they contain no clear language promising to provide lifetime retiree healthcare benefits while explicitly vesting\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   benefits for life, and they are governed by general durational clauses. The district court denied Honeywell's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although the district court acknowledged that the CBAs did not expressly provide for vested retiree healthcare benefits, it pointed to language from this circuit emphasizing that the Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Tackett\n   </em>\n   decision does not mean that \"the\n   <em>\n    absence\n   </em>\n   of such specific language, by itself, evidences an intent\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to vest benefits ....\"\n   <em>\n    Tackett v. M &amp; G Polymers USA, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081447\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/204/#p209\">\n    811 F.3d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209 (6th Cir. 2016). The district court thus found that the lack of express vesting language was not dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court further identified \"critical differences\" between the instant case and\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   . DE 29, Decision and Entry Overruling Mot. to Dismiss, Page ID 953. The most important difference, the court reasoned, was the language in Honeywell's CBA promising lifetime healthcare benefits to retirees' surviving spouses and dependents. Article 33, Section D.5 of the 2011 CBA states: \"[u]pon the death of a retiree, the Company will continue coverage for the spouse and dependent children for their lifetime,\" provided certain conditions are met. JA 18, 2011 CBA, at GR001053. According to the district court, such express vesting of lifetime healthcare benefits for surviving spouses and dependents strongly implied that the parties also intended to vest lifetime healthcare benefits for the retirees themselves. While not dispositive, the court found that the express language vesting healthcare benefits for surviving spouses and dependents was \"highly unusual\" and created ambiguity about the parties' intentions. DE 29, Decision and Entry Overruling Mot. to Dismiss, Page ID 957.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court also noted that the\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   CBA contained a reservation-of-rights clause, while the 2011 Honeywell CBA does not. Furthermore, unlike the\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   CBA, the Honeywell CBA does not have a provision stating that \"\n   <em>\n    continued\n   </em>\n   [healthcare benefits] will be provided ....\"\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087565\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/265/\">\n    813 F.3d at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   , we held that the use of \"continued\" as a modifier suggested that retiree healthcare benefits were not vested because if they were, the CBA would not need to \"continue\" them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lastly, the district court relied on Article 33, Section D.1 of the 2011 Honeywell CBA, which provides: \"[e]mployees ages 50-55 with 30 years of service, who leave the company prior to becoming pension eligible, will be eligible for retiree health care benefits when they commence their pension benefits (age 55 or later).\" JA 18,\n   2011 CBA, at GR001051. The court agreed with plaintiffs that intent to vest could be implied from the fact that eligibility for healthcare benefits could arise years after the CBAs expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Based on its conclusion that the CBAs were ambiguous under ordinary principles of contract law, the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing to resolve the ambiguities. It considered extrinsic evidence from both the pre- and post-2000 CBA negotiations that largely consisted of testimony from various participants in the negotiation process. After the hearing, the district court concluded that plaintiffs proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Honeywell agreed to provide lifetime healthcare benefits to retirees at the Greenville plant. It permanently enjoined Honeywell from terminating healthcare benefits for all putative class members who retired from the Greenville plant before June 1, 2012, and for their eligible spouses and dependents. Honeywell appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After a bench trial, this court reviews the district court's findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    T.

Plaintiffs can succeed on their claims only if they prove one of two things:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) the CBAs unambiguously provide retirees with lifetime healthcare benefits, or (2) the CBAs are ambiguous, and the extrinsic evidence demonstrates that the parties intended to vest retiree healthcare benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Our circuit's law on interpreting CBAs to determine whether retiree healthcare benefits have vested has recently undergone significant changes.

After reviewing the CBAs in light of the applicable case law, we conclude that neither set is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In its order granting plaintiffs a permanent injunction, the district court\n   stated that \"[i]t is undisputed that [the] pre-2000 CBAs contain no language indicating that retiree healthcare benefits were vested, or that Honeywell was obligated to provide lifetime coverage to retirees or their family members.\" DE 58, Op. and Order, Page ID 2993. Despite this finding-which the retirees do not challenge in their brief-the court's injunction applied to all \"putative class members who retired from the Greenville, Ohio, plant before June 1, 2012, and for their eligible spouses and dependents.\" DE 58, Op. and Order, Page ID 3023-24. Thus, its injunction prevents Honeywell from terminating benefits even for those putative class members who retired before 2000, under the unambiguous CBAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Since health benefits are purely contractual in nature,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276908\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/695/\">\n    855 F.3d at 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , if the pre-2000 CBAs are in fact unambiguous in their failure to provide for vested retiree healthcare benefits, the district court's injunction should be modified. A review of the pre-2000 CBAs confirms the district court's statement that they are unambiguous. For example, the 1997 CBA contained only the following two provisions regarding retiree health benefits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   G. Employees retiring on or after January 1, 1985 (except those eligible for deferred vested pension benefits) will be eligible to enroll for the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Gold Standard Comprehensive Health Care Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   H. The Company agrees to pay the premium cost of single coverage for any retiree enrolled for Blue Cross/Blue Shield Health Care Coverage. Retirees enrolled for family coverage will be required to pay the difference in premium costs between single and family coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   JA 14, 1997 CBA, at GR000758-59. The 1997 CBA also had a general durational clause providing that it would remain in effect until May 22, 2000. The other pre-2000 CBAs contain language that is materially the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Nothing in these provisions suggests intent to vest healthcare benefits. They contain no promise to provide benefits for the lifetime of the retiree and no indication that they are exempt from the general durational clause governing the agreement. They simply provide that retirees will be eligible for a particular healthcare plan and that the company will pay the premium costs for that plan. Further, the pre-2000 CBAs do expressly provide for other kinds of vested benefits-for example, the 1997 CBA refers to \"deferred\n   <em>\n    vested\n   </em>\n   pension benefits.\" JA 14, 1997 CBA, at GR000758 (emphasis added). \"[W]e must assume that the explicit guarantee of lifetime benefits in some provisions and not others means something.\"\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087565\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/265/\">\n    813 F.3d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Absent any suggestion to the contrary, both provisions are time-limited by the CBA's general durational clause. The pre-2000 CBAs therefore unambiguously do not provide for vested retiree healthcare benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We also hold that the post-2000 CBAs are unambiguous and do not provide for vested retiree healthcare benefits. The 2011 CBA\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   states: \"Employees ages 50-55 with 30 years of service, who leave the company prior to becoming pension eligible, will be eligible for retiree health care benefits when they commence their pension benefits (age 55 or later).\" JA 18, 2011 CBA, at GR001051. The agreement also contains a provision capping Honeywell's healthcare contributions, not to take effect\n   until 2012. Finally, Honeywell promises to \"continue coverage for the spouse and dependent children for their lifetime\" after the retiree's death.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087565\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/265/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at GR001053. There is no similar promise to provide lifetime healthcare for the retirees themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As an initial matter, the district court was correct when it noted that the absence of specific vesting language does not automatically signify intent to terminate those benefits when the agreement expires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tackett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081447\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/204/#p209\">\n    811 F.3d at 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the absence of such language also does not automatically signify ambiguity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reese\n   </em>\n   , 583 U.S. ----, 138 S.Ct. at 765-766 (2018). After reviewing the CBAs, we conclude that the features of the post-2000 CBAs that the district court used to find ambiguity actually suggest that the CBAs are\n   <em>\n    unambiguous\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In finding the post-2000 CBAs ambiguous, the district court relied primarily on their provision of lifetime healthcare benefits for surviving spouses and dependents. Honeywell argues that contrary to the district court's interpretation, the fact that the agreement explicitly provides lifetime healthcare benefits for surviving spouses and dependents shows that the parties knew how to communicate their intent to vest such benefits for life. In response to the district court's conclusion that providing benefits to surviving spouses and dependents but not the actual retirees is \"inconceivable,\" Honeywell points out that \"limiting [its] lifetime obligation to only surviving spouses and dependents would have made eminent sense,\" because it would be much less expensive than providing lifetime healthcare for all retirees but still protect \"the most vulnerable population in its care.\" CA6 R. 19, Appellant Br., at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We have not yet considered a CBA that grants lifetime healthcare benefits to surviving spouses and dependents but is silent on the duration of healthcare benefits for the retirees themselves. Honeywell refers us to a Second Circuit case,\n   <em>\n    Bouboulis v. Transp. Workers Union of America\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063879\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/55/\">\n    442 F.3d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2006). In\n   <em>\n    Bouboulis\n   </em>\n   , spouses were promised lifetime health benefits \"upon the death of a plan participant.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063879\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/55/\">\n    442 F.3d at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit held that \"the promise to the surviving spouses does not require lifetime benefits for the Retirees, and does not constitute affirmative language that could reasonably be interpreted as creating a promise to vest the Retirees' benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063879\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063879\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/55/\">\n    at 62-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

July 9, 2004) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Honeywell's arguments, and the reasoning of the Second Circuit, are persuasive. If the parties included language expressly granting lifetime healthcare benefits to surviving spouses and dependents in the CBA, this tends to show that they knew how to provide for vested benefits and chose not to for retirees. As we reasoned in\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   , \"we must assume that the explicit guarantee of lifetime benefits in some provisions and not others means something.\"\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087565\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/265/\">\n    813 F.3d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The CBA here explicitly provides for lifetime benefits for surviving spouses and dependents only, and so the retirees cannot claim a contractual right to such benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The cases that plaintiff-appellees cite in support of the district court's conclusion that the surviving-spouse provision creates ambiguity are unavailing. They cite an unpublished decision from this circuit,\n   <em>\n    Winnett v. Caterpillar, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , where we stated that \"there is no reason for the spouses to have thought they would get benefits that\n   <em>\n    exceeded\n   </em>\n   those of the retirees from whom their benefits derive ....\" 510 F.Appx. 417, 421 (6th Cir. 2013). Not only was\n   <em>\n    Winnett\n   </em>\n   decided before the Supreme Court abrogated\n   <em>\n    Yard-Man\n   </em>\n   in 2015,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tackett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594426\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/926/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but the facts of that case are completely different from the facts here-in\n   <em>\n    Winnett\n   </em>\n   , surviving spouses challenged Caterpillar's deduction of healthcare premiums from retirees' pensions, and the issue was whether the statute of limitations had expired for their claim. 510 F.Appx. at 418-19. Nor do the other two cases from this circuit help plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    UAW v.

Dec. 5, 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We acknowledge that the arrangement in the CBA-lifetime benefits for surviving spouses and dependents but not for retirees-is, as the district court put it, \"highly unusual.\" DE 29, Decision and Entry Overruling Mot. to Dismiss, Page ID 957. The average person would find it very strange if her spouse and dependents were to receive lifetime healthcare benefits only after she has died, while prior to her death neither she nor her family is entitled to any benefits. But this strangeness cannot overcome the simple fact that the agreements expressly provide lifetime healthcare for surviving spouses and dependents\n   <em>\n    but not\n   </em>\n   for the retirees themselves. Additionally, as Honeywell points out, CBA terms are often the product of compromise. As a compromise, Honeywell may have decided it would be much cheaper to provide lifetime healthcare benefits only to a limited class rather than to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   retirees and their spouses and dependents. The important point, however, is that the CBA clearly promises lifetime benefits to surviving spouses and dependents but not to retirees. We also find it noteworthy that the 2011 CBA refers to \"deferred vested pension benefits\" several times, but never uses \"vested\" to describe retiree healthcare benefits. Such a distinction points to the conclusion that we reached in\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   -\"[t]he difference in language demands a difference in meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087565\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/265/\">\n    813 F.3d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   There is only one feature of the surviving-spouse provision that arguably raises an ambiguity: it states, \"[u]pon the death of a retiree, the Company will\n   <em>\n    continue\n   </em>\n   coverage for the spouse and dependent children for their lifetime ....\" JA 18, 2011 CBA, at GR001053 (emphasis added). Read naturally, this phrase implies that lifetime healthcare benefits for the spouse of a deceased retiree proceed from the period during which the retiree was receiving healthcare benefits. Thus, if the retiree did not have healthcare when he died, then his spouse's lifetime healthcare would not be a continuation of coverage. Why, then, doesn't this \"continue\" language create ambiguity as to whether the retirees had healthcare for life? Because not all spouses of retirees are guaranteed healthcare for life upon the death of their retiree-spouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The post-2000 CBAs promised to provide lifetime healthcare to a retiree's spouse \"[u]pon the death of a retiree.\" But like the other promises in the CBAs, this promise expired when the CBA expired, on\n   May 22, 2014. Thus, if a retiree died during the term of a CBA that contained the surviving spouse promise, the surviving spouse is entitled to lifetime healthcare benefits. But if a retiree died after the last CBA expired, then Honeywell's promise has expired, and Honeywell is not obligated to provide the surviving spouse with lifetime healthcare benefits. The reality for plaintiffs here is that the CBAs expressly promise to provide lifetime benefits for particular surviving spouses of retirees-those whose retiree-spouse died during the term of a CBA that contained the surviving spouse provision. They do not make that promise to the retirees themselves. In the absence of such a promise, the general durational clause should govern the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Aside from the surviving spouse provision, the district court identified several other features of the post-2000 CBAs that it believed contributed to their ambiguity. These features are insufficient to overcome the presence of a general durational clause. The fact that Honeywell's contribution caps became effective after the CBAs expired has been rejected by this circuit as a justification for finding ambiguity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276908\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/695/\">\n    855 F.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he caps section of the 2000 CBA indicates that the parties contemplated that retiree healthcare benefits would continue ....

The district court's rationale here is erroneous because, as we have held, the fact that Honeywell anticipated providing healthcare benefits in the future does not mean that Honeywell is bound to provide such benefits forever.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276908\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/695/\">\n    855 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   701 ;\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264270\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/321/#p325\">\n    875 F.3d at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While there are minor differences between the Honeywell CBA and the CBA in\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   , such as the absence of a reservation-of-rights clause in the Honeywell CBA, both agreements share one crucial feature: a general durational clause. None of the features to which the district court points are sufficient to overcome that clause here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Under the general durational clause in the 2011 Honeywell CBA, the agreement expired on May 22, 2014. Although \"a contract's general-durational clause will not always apply to a promise to provide healthcare,\"\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264270\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/321/#p325\">\n    875 F.3d at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"ordinary principles of contract law ... dictate that 'contractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course, upon termination of the bargaining agreement.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276908\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/695/\">\n    855 F.3d at 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087565\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/265/\">\n    813 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   279 ). Because the post-2000 CBAs do not contain any features overriding the general durational clauses, the general durational\n   clauses should govern. We therefore hold that the district court erred by finding the CBAs ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The parties devote a great deal of time to disputing the significance of the extrinsic evidence in this case. Because the CBAs in this case are unambiguous, however, the parties' arguments about the extrinsic evidence can no longer be considered.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tackett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594426\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/926/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (\"[W]hen the contract is ambiguous, a court may consider extrinsic evidence to determine the intentions of the parties.\");\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264270\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/321/#p325\">\n    875 F.3d at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We do not look at extrinsic evidence unless the contract is ambiguous.\"). Thus, our finding that the CBAs unambiguously do not provide for lifetime retiree healthcare benefits ends the inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   CLAY, J. (pg. 228), delivered a separate concurring opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Plaintiffs filed their complaint as a class action complaint, but no motion for class certification was filed. However, the district court reasoned that plaintiffs' failure to file a class certification motion would not alter the outcome of the case, since a verdict in plaintiffs' favor would impact all similarly-situated individuals.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The language in the other post-2000 CBAs is the same in all material respects.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The other cases plaintiff-appellees cite are not from this circuit, were decided before the Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Tackett\n    </em>\n    , and are of otherwise limited usefulness.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-67\">\n   CLAY, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCURRENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   I reluctantly concur because I am required to do so by binding case law. However, it is not obvious that the intent of the parties was as clearly expressed as our cases indicate. Indeed, the agreements at issue appear on their face to be ambiguous, and they were drafted prior to the line of cases beginning with the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    M &amp; G Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594426\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/926/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594426\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/926/\">\n    190 L.Ed.2d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), which completely upended the way that our Circuit interprets the vesting of benefits in collective-bargaining agreements. I believe that the Court should permit the admission of extrinsic evidence in this case in order to ascertain the intent of the parties. Nonetheless, our cases preclude us from doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Now, at least, the unions and the retirees that they represent are on notice as to what their agreements must say in order to vest retiree healthcare benefits. Although it seems less than fair to impose this new, heightened standard upon these retirees, that is what the cases require, and I therefore reluctantly concur in the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
