Recent Supreme Court cases like\n   <em>\n    California Democratic Party v. Jones\n   </em>\n   suggest this dicta does not provide the whole truth. So too, do facts on the ground. The behemoth, corrupt party machines we imagine to have caused the progressive era's turn to primaries are now, in many respects, out of commission. In important ways, the party system is the weakest it has ever been-a sobering reality given parties' importance to our republic's stability. And given new evidence of the substantial associational burdens, even distortions, caused by forcibly expanding a party's nomination process, a closer look seems in order. The time appears ripe for the Court to reconsider (or rather, as I see it, consider for the first time) the scope of government regulation of political party primaries and the attendant harms to associational rights and substantive ends.\n  </p>\n  <author id=\"p-18\">\n   EBEL, Circuit Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   These appeals are only the most recent volley in the spate of litigation that has dogged the Utah Elections Amendments Act of 2014, commonly known as SB54, since it was signed into law in March 2014. At issue here, SB54 reorganized the process for qualifying for a primary ballot in Utah, most importantly by providing an alternative signature-gathering path to the primary election ballot for candidates who are unable or unwilling to gain approval from the central party nominating conventions. Prior to the passage of SB54, the Utah Republican Party (\"URP\") selected its candidates for primary elections exclusively through its state nominating convention, and it would prefer to continue to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In this litigation, the URP sued Utah Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox in his official capacity (\"the State\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , alleging that two aspects of SB54 violate the URP's freedom of association under the First Amendment, as applied to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. The two challenged sections (1) require parties to allow candidates to qualify for the primary ballot through either the nominating convention or by gathering signatures, or both (the \"Either or Both Provision\"); and (2) require candidates pursuing the primary ballot in State House and State Senate elections through a signature gathering method to collect a set number of signatures (the \"Signature Requirement\"). In two separate orders, the United States District Court for the District of Utah balanced the URP's First Amendment right of association against the State's interest in managing and regulating elections, and rejected the URP's claims. Re-conducting that balancing de novo on appeal, we AFFIRM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to its constitution and bylaws, the URP's process for nominating a candidate to the general election proceeds along a singular path. Candidates present their candidacy to the delegates at the party convention, and the delegates then caucus for nominees for each office. If a single candidate achieves over 60% of the caucus vote, that candidate is certified to the state for placement on the general election ballot, and no primary is held. If no candidate\n   receives 60% of the convention vote, the top two candidates proceed to a state-administered primary election involving only URP members. The winner of that primary election is then certified to the state for placement on the general election ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2014, the Utah Legislature-comprised of overwhelming Republican majorities in both the State House and State Senate-passed SB54, which addressed this process. Specifically, SB54 created two types of political parties: Registered Political Parties (\"RPPs\") and Qualified Political Parties (\"QPPs\"). Both RPPs and QPPs are eligible to have the name of the party printed next to their candidates on the general election ballot, Utah Code \u00a7 20A-6-301(1)(d) ; the only significant difference being how each is permitted to qualify candidates for its primary election. Members of RPPs who wish to participate in a primary election may do so\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   by gathering the signatures of 2% of the eligible primary voters for the office sought. Utah Code \u00a7 20A-9-403(3)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   If a party chooses to register as a QPP, however, it may still hold a caucus, and may certify the winners of the caucus to the primary ballot as before.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Utah Code \u00a7 20A-9-406\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   But unlike under the previous system, a party may not restrict access to the primary ballot just to candidates who emerge from the party convention. Under SB54, a candidate who is unwilling or unable to gain placement on the primary ballot through the caucus and convention may still qualify for the primary by gathering a set number of signatures by petition from eligible primary voters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, SB54 provides that in order to qualify as a QPP the party must allow its members \"to seek the registered political party's nomination for any elective office by the member choosing to seek the nomination by\n   <em>\n    either or both\n   </em>\n   of the following methods: (i) seeking the nomination through the registered political party's convention process ... or (ii) seeking the nomination by collecting signatures[.]\" Utah Code \u00a7 20A-9-101(12)(c) (\"the Either or Both Provision\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   It is clear from our review of the record that this \"two-path\" system was a compromise crafted between Utah legislators hoping to preserve the URP's caucus system and outside interests pushing a pure primary system. The end result was that a QPP's primary ballot can now include both candidates who qualified through the caucus and candidates who qualified by gathering signatures. Utah Code \u00a7 20A-9-408. As originally passed, it also required parties to allow unaffiliated voters to participate in their primary elections (the \"Unaffiliated Voter Provision\"), but that provision was later invalidated and is not before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURE AND JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The First Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   SB54 was signed into law on March 10, 2014, and the URP filed suit later that year seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment that the law was unconstitutional as applied to the URP (the \"First Lawsuit\"). The Constitutional Party of Utah (\"CPU\") joined the First Lawsuit, challenging\n   the Signature Requirement in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the First Lawsuit, the district court denied the URP and the CPU a preliminary injunction, ruling that none of the alleged constitutional burdens were severe save for the Unaffiliated Voter Provision, which was not yet ripe for review.\n   <em>\n    Utah Republican Party v. Herbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5900473\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/133/1337/\">\n    133 F.Supp.3d 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Utah 2015) (\"\n   <em>\n    URP I\n   </em>\n   \"). Once the URP notified the state that it intended to become a QPP, that issue ripened and the district court granted the URP summary judgment invalidating the Unaffiliated Voter Provision.\n   <em>\n    Utah Republican Party v. Herbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5914734\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/1263/#p1278\">\n    144 F.Supp.3d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1278-82 (D. Utah 2015) (\"\n   <em>\n    URP II\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In doing so, the court held that the Unaffiliated Voter Provision imposed a severe burden on the URP's associational rights and the State had no compelling interest to justify that burden.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5914734\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/1263/#p1278\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The practical effect of the First Lawsuit, then, was to invalidate SB54's Unaffiliated Voter Provision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5914734\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/1263/#p1278\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5914734\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/1263/#p1278\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   while upholding the Signature Requirement, the Either or Both Provision, and all other aspects of SB54,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    URP I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5900473\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/133/1337/\">\n    133 F.Supp.3d 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The rulings in the First Lawsuit are not before us on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Second Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After the First Lawsuit, the URP announced that it would permit nomination only by caucus. The URP's justification for doing so was that it interpreted the Either or Both Provision as offering the\n   <em>\n    political party\n   </em>\n   (rather than the candidates) the option to allow nomination by either the signature gathering method, or the convention method, or both. The Lieutenant Governor responded that it was the State's position that under SB54 it is the party\n   <em>\n    member's\n   </em>\n   choice, not the party's, whether to pursue the nomination using the signature gathering method, the convention method, or both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Following this interpretation by the Lieutenant Governor, the URP filed this suit in the United States District Court for the District of Utah seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that SB54 was unconstitutional. The phrasing of its Complaint was similar to the Complaint filed in the First Lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Utah Republican Party v. Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355975\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/177/1343/#p1354\">\n    177 F.Supp.3d 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1354 (D. Utah 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    URP III\n   </em>\n   \") (noting similarities). The party reiterated its argument that SB54 violated its freedom of association under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and added a claim that the State should be judicially estopped from advancing an interpretation of the Either or Both Provision that differed from the one it advanced in the First Lawsuit. Shortly thereafter the Utah Democratic Party (\"UDP\") intervened as co-plaintiff to defend against the possibility that portions of SB54 would apply to one political party but not the other, and to complain that the URP's bylaws and constitution violated SB54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In February of 2016, the district court certified two questions of state law to the Utah Supreme Court. The first requested that court's interpretation of the Either or Both Provision, asking whether that provision meant the candidate member or the party had the right to choose which-or both-of the qualification processes to use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Utah Republican Party v. Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356108\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/178/1150/#p1165\">\n    178 F.Supp.3d 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1165 (D. Utah 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    URP IV\n   </em>\n   \") (discussing certification). The Utah Supreme Court replied that the Either or Both Provision allows the candidate\n   member, not the party, to select which of those two paths to follow in an effort to be certified to the primary ballot.\n   <em>\n    Utah Republican Party v. Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801634\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/373/1286/#p1287\">\n    373 P.3d 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1287 (Utah 2016). The second question, certified at the request of the UDP, was what would happen if a party elects to become a QPP under Utah law, but fails to comply with the requirements of that status.\n   <em>\n    URP IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356108\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/178/1150/#p1165\">\n    178 F.Supp.3d at 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Utah Supreme Court declined to answer the second question, finding it not ripe for review because it was not yet clear whether the URP was going to comply with SB54.\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801634\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/373/1286/#p1287\">\n    373 P.3d at 1288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   While waiting for those answers from the Utah Supreme Court, the UDP and the State filed motions in federal court for judgment on the pleadings, and the URP filed for partial summary judgment on its claims relating to the Signature Requirement. On April 6, 2016, the district court ruled that (1) the URP's claims were not barred by claim preclusion, issue preclusion, or claim splitting, (2) the State should not be judicially estopped from advancing its interpretation of the Either or Both Provision, and (3) the Signature Requirement was valid because it did not present a severe burden to the URP.\n   <em>\n    URP III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355975\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/177/1343/#p1354\">\n    177 F.Supp.3d at 1356, 1362, 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Finally, the court rejected the URP's claim that SB54 was the result of impermissible viewpoint discrimination, and then the court granted summary judgment for the State.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356108\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/178/1150/#p1165\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356108\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/178/1150/#p1165\">\n    at 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   URP timely appealed the district court's grant of summary judgment. The UDP subsequently cross-appealed, challenging the district court's denial of judgment on the pleadings based on assertions of claim preclusion, issue preclusion, and claim splitting, and also the portions of the district court's opinion which purport to invalidate the URP's bylaws and constitution to the extent those provisions conflict with SB54.

The URP argues that SB54 infringes on its First Amendment associational rights by forcing it to adopt a candidate-selection process different from that which it would prefer. However, the Supreme Court has recognized that when political parties become involved in a state-administered primary election, the state acquires a legitimate interest in regulating the manner in which that election\n   unfolds-subject only to the same interest-balancing that occurs throughout the Court's electoral jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The distinction between wholly internal aspects of party administration on one hand and participation in state-run, state-financed elections on the other is at the heart of this case. When a party selects its platform, its Chairman, or even whom it will endorse in the upcoming election, the state generally has no more interest in these internal activities than in the administration of the local Elks lodge or bar association. But when the party's actions turn outwards to the actual nomination and election of an individual who will swear an oath not to protect the Party, but instead to the Constitution, and when the individual ultimately elected has the responsibility to represent all the residents in his or her district, the state acquires a manifest interest in that activity, and the party's interest in such activity must share the stage with the state's manifest interest. The dissent blurs this distinction between the party's internal and external activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Supreme Court's jurisprudence has consistently reflected this difference between a party's internal mechanisms and its external manifestations.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A political party has a First Amendment right to limit its membership as it wishes, and to choose a candidate-selection process that will in its view produce the nominee who best represents its political platform. These rights are circumscribed, however, when the State gives the party a role in the election process-as New York has done here by giving certain parties the right to have their candidates appear with party endorsement on the general-election ballot. Then ... the State acquires a legitimate governmental interest in ensuring the fairness of the party's nominating process, enabling it to prescribe what that process must be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

SB54 was not designed to change the substantive candidates who emerged from the parties, but rather only to ensure that all the party members have some voice in deciding who their party's representative will be in the general election.

At the outset of this litigation, a candidate using the signature-gathering path to access the primary ballot for State Senate needed to collect signatures from between 6.21% of registered Republicans (in district 14) and 30.82% of registered Republicans (in district 1) depending on the district in which he or she was running. The numbers are even starker for the State House, where a candidate was required to collect signatures from between 7.14% (in district 27) and 57.2% (in district 26) of the registered Republicans in a given district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The URP argues that these numbers are so high as to severely burden its right of association with potential candidates of its party and cannot be saved as reasonably calculated to serve a compelling state interest.

First, the signature-gathering path is only one possible avenue onto the primary election ballot, and all parties to this lawsuit concede the alternative-advancing from the party's caucus-both is constitutional and would be constitutional standing alone. Therefore, from the URP's perspective, the signature-gathering provision only \"increases the opportunities to get on the ballot\" thereby reducing the burden placed on the URP and other political parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaRouche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10508407\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/990/36/\">\n    990 F.2d at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Furthermore, over an objection from the URP, which tried to establish a dispute of material fact, the district court found that notwithstanding the loftiness of these requirements, the signature gathering path remained \"a realistic means of ballot access[.]\"\n   <em>\n    URP III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355975\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/177/1343/#p1354\">\n    177 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1369 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at n.174 (\"[T]he URP recognizes that there are at least some URP candidates who have successfully met the signature requirements to obtain access to the ballot.\"). This also weighs in favor of finding that the burden is less than severe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, we do recognize that some of these numbers-57%, in one particular house district-are eye-popping. Yet we are struck that the enormity of these figures says more about the compartmentalization of our current political landscape than it does the validity of SB54. The 57% figure comes from House District 26 which was one of only a handful of districts in Utah-an overwhelmingly Republican state-that is packed so full of Democratic voters that Republicans did not even bother fielding a candidate there in the most recent election. In 2014 the Republicans fielded a candidate, but that candidate received just 28% of the votes, compared to 72% for the Democratic candidate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to data in the Record, in 2016 District 26 had 9,522 registered voters, just 18% of whom were registered Republicans. This in a state where 48% of the registered voters statewide were registered Republicans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Against this backdrop, it is more likely these eye-popping numbers say more about modern political gerrymandering and segmentation than they about do the constitutionality of SB54. Whether by\n   overt gerrymandering, a growing tendency of people to gravitate towards those who share their politics, or some combination of the two, the percentages imposed by the Signature Requirement in several Utah districts is so high precisely because there are so many Democrats packed into those particular districts that the URP will never actually be able to capture that seat. Where the URP has no reasonable likelihood of fielding or electing a serious candidate in those districts with high percentage requirements of petition signatures, we cannot say the URP has suffered any real injury to its constitutional right of association when it was largely redistricting decisions that caused such anomalies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   When we look at the state's electoral scheme in totality, including the retention of the caucus system as a method of qualifying a candidate for the primary ballot, we conclude that the Signature Requirement does not impose a severe burden on the URP's associational rights. Therefore we hold that Utah's legitimate interest in requiring a candidate to demonstrate a minimum degree of support in terms of gathering 1,000 or 2,000 signatures on a petition before being placed on the primary ballot for the State House or State Senate is sufficient to outweigh the provision's minimal burdens on the URP. Therefore we AFFIRM the district court's ruling that the challenged Signature Requirements do not constitute an unconstitutional burden on the URP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Utah Democratic Party\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   At the district court the Utah Democratic Party (\"UDP\") intervened as a plaintiff in part to \"ensure [the State] appl[ies] the laws equally to all Utahns, no matter what political party, if any, they choose to join.\" Aplt.

First, the brief did not satisfy this Court's rules, in that it did not state the opposing party's position on the relief requested as required by Tenth Circuit Rule 27.1. Second, Mr. Mumford failed to comply with Tenth Circuit Rule 31.5 by not providing this Court with hard copies of his brief within two business days of the brief having been filed electronically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Our colleagues-correctly, in our opinion-noted but did not linger on these errors. More troubling, however, was Mr. Mumford's repeated inability to file papers\n   in a timely manner. Rather than paraphrase the extensive timeliness problems associated with this brief, we simply incorporate our colleagues' findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   The opening brief was originally due September 27, 2016. The appellant requested and was granted an extension of time to file the opening brief until October 27, 2016. The appellant then requested a 96-day extension of time to file the opening brief, or until January 31, 2017. At the direction of the court, the appellant was granted a portion of the requested extension. We allowed 30 additional days to file the opening brief, which pushed the filing deadline to November 28, 2016. The court advised that no additional extensions of time to file the opening brief would be granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   On November 28, 2016, the appellant electronically filed a four volume appendix. No opening brief was submitted with the appendix, however. Two days later, having received no opening brief, the court issued a deficiency notice to the appellant regarding the missing brief. The court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   granted 10 additional days to file the opening brief. The opening brief was due December 12, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   With the additional time provided by operation of the deficiency notice and an intervening weekend, the appellant had\n   <em>\n    14 additional days\n   </em>\n   beyond the final extension deadline to file the opening brief. But even with all of this additional time, the appellant still did not file the opening brief on the due date. The brief was due December 12, 2016, but was not filed until the morning of December 13, 2016. Compounding the problem further is the fact that the [Motion to Accept Late Brief] was not filed until December 14, 2016, two days after the deadline set in the deficiency notice expired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <em>\n    Utah Republican Party v.

SB54, as modified in the First Lawsuit, strikes an appropriate balance between protecting the interests of the state in managing elections and allowing the URP and all other political associations and individuals across Utah to express their preferences and values in a democratic fashion and to form associations as protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not only does\n   this balance not offend our Constitution, it is at its very essence.

But the URP is not a parish or a club, but rather a political association whose activities run the gamut from purely internal-such as voting on the party platform-to a hybrid internal-external-such as nominating candidates who will appear on the general election ballot in the hopes of being elected to represent not the URP, but the broader citizenry of Utah.

The problem with this approach is that in discerning legislative intent we look not to the motive of advocacy groups, lobbyists, or even individual legislators, but the legislature as a whole. So let's talk about the legislature. First, a substantial majority of the members of the Utah legislature are members of the URP. Second, if we were to look to advocates rather than legislators, all indications are that CMV's goal was not to determine\n    <em>\n     who\n    </em>\n    won the URP's nomination, but rather\n    <em>\n     how\n    </em>\n    that nominee was selected. Finally, the record reflects that the Utah legislature was motivated to preserve a representative and fair\n    <em>\n     process\n    </em>\n    rather than focusing on the specific outcome of the process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-258\">\n    Let's step back for a minute and reflect on what really happened. The process that led to SB54 is certainly not determinative to our outcome, but it may be informative. On one hand, the URP wanted to preserve its traditional caucus and convention system, which was susceptible to strong influence by Party leadership. On the other hand, CMV wanted a mandatory primary, which would entirely eliminate the URP's preferred system. CMV had a powerful piece of ammunition in its arsenal in that it was threatening to take its idea to the voters directly via a ballot initiative, and apparently the Republican majority in the state legislature gave credence to that possibility. Thus was born the \"Grand Compromise\" where both sides got something they wanted. The Party received the assurance that the nominee it selected through its preferred caucus system would appear on the primary ballot. CMV ensured that all party members had the opportunity to play a meaningful role in selecting their Party's nominee through a direct primary vote. And URP leadership still retained the ability to advise the party membership as to who they endorsed and to advertise and campaign for their preferred candidate. And who, perhaps, was the biggest winner of this compromise? It was the heart and soul of the Republican Party: its members writ large. They were given the right to ensure that they, the URP, could decide with whom they wanted to associate on the general election ballot. This compromise illustrates the best aspects of representative democracy and honors the diverse interests that make up any political subdivision or district.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Robert Gehrke,\n    <em>\n     Senate advances bill that would nullify Count My Vote initiative\n    </em>\n    , Salt Lake Tribune, http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=57575253&amp;type=CMSID (Feb. 20, 2014, 6:08PM) (last visited, Feb. 28, 2018); Robert Gehrke,\n    <em>\n     It's back on: Legislators, Count My Vote renew deal on election reform\n    </em>\n    , Salt Lake Tribune, http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=57619746&amp;type=CMSID (March 2, 2014, 9:44AM) (last visited, Feb. 28, 2018).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-259\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    Spencer Overton,\n    <em>\n     Voter Identification\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%20631\">\n     105 Mich.

One change to procedure can work a profound change to the substance of political parties, including which candidates they choose and what messages they communicate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In this case, the Utah Republican Party claims that Utah's 2014 election law reforms purposely try to change the\n   <em>\n    substantive type\n   </em>\n   of candidates the Party nominates, all the while masquerading as mere\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   reform.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Utah Republican Party argues Utah's recent reforms violate its First Amendment associational rights. Utah's Lieutenant Governor contends Utah's legislation is well within the state's regulatory power over elections. To evaluate these claims, we must first look at what those reforms sought to accomplish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Utah Republican Party's Nomination Procedures\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Before Utah passed legislation known as Senate Bill 54 in 2014, Utah election law gave political parties freedom to choose how they would nominate candidates for the general election. Parties could choose whether or not to use the state's primary election mechanism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   With that freedom, the Utah Republican Party chose not to use the primary as its principal means of selecting candidates. Instead, the Party had, and continues to employ, a carefully crafted convention process. Party members in defined precincts conduct neighborhood caucus meetings. In accordance with the Republican Party's bylaws, each caucus meeting is open to the public and begins with prayer, a recitation of the pledge of allegiance, and a reading of the Party's platform. The caucus attendees in turn select community representatives to serve as delegates to the Party's convention, where nominees will eventually be considered and selected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The Party's nominating conventions are also open to the public. After candidates or their representatives make nomination speeches, delegates cast their votes for candidates to each office. If a candidate obtains sixty percent of the vote, he or she becomes the Party's nominee for that office in the general election. If there are more than two aspiring candidates for a given office, ballots are conducted until there are only two remaining candidates or until a candidate gains sixty percent of the vote. And if there are two candidates left and neither has obtained sixty percent of\n   the vote, the candidates participate in a primary election run by the state. This means the Party uses the primary election mechanism only when no candidate for a contested office could obtain sixty percent of the delegates' vote. In other words, a consensus convention nominee with sixty percent of the convention vote gets the nomination-leaving no room for a party challenger by other means.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The Republican Party claims it has developed this convention-based nomination process over the years to ensure the selection of nominees who will best represent the Party's platform. Because a maximum of two candidates ever participate in a primary election for a given office, these procedures also guarantee that nominees chosen through a state-run primary will have obtained a majority (and not just a plurality) of party members' votes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Party's candidate qualification requirements, like its nomination procedures, are designed to make certain that nominees are committed to the Party's platform. All candidates must file a statement certifying that they do not hold a position in any other political party. They must also certify they have read the Party's platform and accept it as the standard by which their performance as an officeholder will be evaluated. Candidates must file these certifications at least thirty days before the convention. If they do not, the Party Chairman announces this failure before the delegates vote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   As an additional security measure against the possibility of unfaithful nominees, the Party's bylaws require nominees to certify they will abide by the Party's nomination procedures. These procedures do not allow for any method to gain the nomination other than competition in the Party's convention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Senate Bill 54\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The events leading up to this case began in 2013. According to the Party, and uncontested by Utah, a bipartisan group registered as the Utah Political Issues Committee Alliance for Good Government, but known popularly as Count My Vote, began lobbying the Party to change its nomination procedures. The group believed the convention method gave \"the most power and influence to those with the most extreme views,\" presumably because only the most fervent and eager undertake the inconvenience of attending a caucus meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its view, this \"extremism\" was pernicious because the Republican Party is presently the dominant party in Utah and its nominees are favored to win many district- and state-wide elections in the general elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   To confront this perceived problem with the Republican Party's nominees, or in other words, to \"require political party nominees to show a sufficiently broad level of support in order to appear on the general election ballot,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the group repeatedly\n   asked the Party to change its nomination rules. If the Party did not comply, the group threatened to bring a ballot initiative to change the Party's nomination rules against its will. Specifically, it wanted the party to accept absentee votes at conventions and increase the number of votes required for candidates to secure the nomination at a convention. This way, contested nominations would more often be decided with a primary election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The Republican Party refused. Undaunted, Count My Vote registered its initiative and began efforts to persuade the Utah legislature to enact its desired reforms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The result was Senate Bill 54. Enacted in 2014, it completely overhauled the requirements political parties must meet to have their nominees placed on Utah's general election ballot. No longer are parties free to select their nomination procedures. \"Each registered political party that chooses to have the names of the registered political party's candidates for elective office featured with party affiliation on the ballot at a regular general election,\" the bill provides, \"shall nominate the registered political party's candidates for elective office in the manner described in this section.\" Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 20A-9-403(1)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The bill creates two possible paths for political parties to earn the right to place their endorsements on the ballot-they can be \"registered political parties\" or \"qualified political parties.\" For registered political parties, participation in the primary is mandatory. \"Each registered political party\" must \"either declare the registered political party's intent to participate in the next regular primary election\" or declare that it chooses \"not to have the names of the registered political party's candidates for elective office featured on the ballot at the next regular general election.\" \u00a7 20A-9-403(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   To earn a place on the primary ballot, candidates for a registered political party have one choice only: to collect nomination petitions from \"at least 2% of the registered political party's members who reside in the political division\" for the office sought. \u00a7 20A-9-403(3)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   A \"qualified political party,\" by contrast, is allowed to use a convention to select nominees. But this comes at a cost. Qualified political parties must permit delegates to vote by absentee ballot. And they must allow members to seek nomination\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   by using the party's convention\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   by collecting a statutorily-designated number of signatures (which varies by office),\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   both. \u00a7 20A-9-101. This is called the \"Either or Both\" provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Whenever there is at least one candidate chosen by convention and at least one who gained candidacy for the same office by collecting signatures, a qualified political party must participate in a primary election to choose between them. The same is true when there are two or more persons who gained candidacy for the same office by collecting signatures. \u00a7 20A-9-409(2). Unlike registered political parties, then, qualified political parties do not necessarily have to participate in the primary election. They only must do so when there are persons who gathered signatures to become candidates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Candidates who obtain \"the highest number of votes\" in the primary election, regardless of whether they gained candidacy by convention or signature collection, are deemed \"nominated for that office by the candidate's registered political party.\" \u00a7 20A-9-403(5)(a). Parties cannot opt out of this scheme while still retaining their\n   ability to list their affiliation with candidates on the ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   And that was not all. As originally passed, Senate Bill 54 also required qualified political parties to allow voters unaffiliated with any party to sign nomination petitions and vote in the party's primary election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. The Lawsuits\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In 2015, the Utah Republican Party filed suit against Utah's Lieutenant Governor to enjoin the law's application to the Party. The Party concentrated its arguments on the provision requiring it to allow unaffiliated voters to vote in its primary and sign nomination petitions. The district court in Utah held that provision unconstitutional because it unduly burdened the Utah Republican Party's associational rights.\n   <em>\n    Utah Republican Party v.

After the first suit, the Party sought clarification from Utah's Lieutenant Governor on whether he would uphold the Party's objections against any candidate who obtained a spot on the primary ballot by using the signature gathering method, which the Party's bylaws did not allow. The Lieutenant Governor responded that his office would not uphold objections to candidates solely because they used the signature-gathering method to gain candidacy. State law, the Lieutenant Governor said, required the Party to allow members to use the signature collection method to become a nominee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In early 2016, the Party again filed suit, arguing, among other things, that Senate Bill 54 was unconstitutional as applied to the Party because it (1) required the Party to participate in a primary election; (2) required the Party to accept candidates who gathered signatures, in violation of its bylaws; and (3) required an unconstitutionally burdensome number of signatures for qualified political party members to become State House or Senate candidates in the primary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Upon certification from the district court, the Utah Supreme Court interpreted the Either or Both provision and agreed with the Lieutenant Governor: the law requires the Party to allow members to become nominees by collecting signatures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   On motions for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings, the district court entered summary judgment for Utah on all claims, holding the burden these provisions placed on the Republican Party's associational rights was not severe and that the state's interests were substantial enough to justify what little burden existed. The Utah Republican Party has appealed every claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   I dissent because I believe the Party is correct that, in the circumstances of this\n   case, Utah's interference in the Party's nomination process was unconstitutional. At a minimum, the majority is wrong to conclude Senate Bill 54 is clearly constitutional on this record. There is at least a material dispute of fact as to the burden on the Party's rights and the sufficiency of the state's interests. I concur with the majority that, if Senate Bill 54 is otherwise constitutional, the number of signatures required for State House and Senate candidacies is not unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Mandatory Primary provision and the Either or Both provision must be evaluated together.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   The Utah Republican Party elaborates separate arguments against (1) the requirement that it participate in a primary to choose between signature-collecting candidates and convention candidates (what it calls the \"mandatory primary\"), and (2) the requirement that it allow members to become primary election candidates by collecting signatures. But the distinction between the two provisions has little relevance for the purposes of this analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   In this as-applied challenge, we evaluate only the provisions that apply to the Utah Republican Party. Here, those are the provisions related to qualified political parties, not registered political parties. While Senate Bill 54 requires registered political parties to participate in the primary, it does not mandate participation of qualified political parties in every case. Instead, qualified political parties only have to participate in the primary when they must decide (1) between signature-gathering candidates and convention-chosen candidates, or (2) between two signature-gathering candidates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 20A-9-409(2). If a party's only candidates for an office are chosen at its convention, the party \"may, but is not required to, participate in the primary election for that office.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3527493\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/1035/#p1045\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For qualified political parties, then, the requirement to participate in the primary only exists when the signature-gathering path to nomination is used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In short, the two provisions work as one and cannot be evaluated separately. The question is not whether each provision, in isolation, is constitutional. It is whether this scheme, as a whole, imposes a severe burden on political parties' associational rights, and if so, whether Utah has presented interests compelling enough to justify that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. The Burden\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   First, we analyze the burden. Senate Bill 54's effects are further confirmation of\n   the truism that procedure can have enormous substantive repercussions. Not only does the law interfere with the Utah Republican Party's internal procedures, but it also changes the types of nominees the Party will produce and gives unwanted candidates a path to the Party's nomination. By doing so, Senate Bill 54 will inevitably cause divisiveness within the Party and reduce candidate loyalty to the Party's policies. Put together, these consequences severely burden the Party's ability to choose a loyal nominee and, ultimately, its right to define itself and its message. I explain each of these effects in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   To begin, Senate Bill 54 \"substitute[s]\" the Utah legislature's \"judgment for that of the party as to the desirability of a particular internal party structure.\"\n   <em>\n    Eu v. San Francisco Cty. Democratic Cent. Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031909\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/214/#p222\">\n    489 U.S. 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 233,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031909\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/214/#p222\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031909\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/214/#p222\">\n    103 L.Ed.2d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). The law is, in effect, a sort of state-created majority veto over the candidates a party selects through its carefully crafted convention process. And it gives aspiring candidates license to ignore a party's chosen convention procedures without ever having to convince other members to vote to change those procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Such changes to a group's internal nominee selection process affect a group's ability to define itself. That is to say, they change the group's\n   <em>\n    substance\n   </em>\n   . Consider as illustration a Catholic parish. Imagine a situation in which parishioners could collect signatures to challenge their formally selected priest in a congregational election. Would not something substantive about the church have changed? Some might call this procedural reform. But it is more like a Reformation. And the profound importance of leadership selection is not limited to the religious context. Every group's leadership-selection procedures help define its substance-whether hierarchical, uber-democratic, or a mix. This defining choice is, constitutionally, up to each group, unless important state interests are at stake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Here, the possibility Senate Bill 54 will substantively alter the Utah Republican Party's character is not mere speculation. It is very real. The Utah Republican Party's neighborhood caucus meetings are a communitarian affair-with shared prayer, competition for delegate slots, and local electioneering in support or opposition to candidates and platform recommendations. Under Senate Bill 54, candidates can evade the scrutiny of delegates chosen at these meetings, ignoring the caucus system altogether. In effect, the new procedures transform the Party from a tight-knit community that chooses candidates deliberatively to a loosely affiliated collection of individuals who cast votes on a Tuesday in June.\n   <em>\n    Cf. generally\n   </em>\n   David P. Redlawsk et al.,\n   <em>\n    Why Iowa?: How Caucuses and Sequential Elections Improve the Presidential Nominating Process\n   </em>\n   (2010) (arguing that compared to a primary system, the Iowa Caucus encourages greater candidate interaction with voters as opposed to impersonal campaign advertising).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Second, Senate Bill 54 will likely change the types of candidates the Party nominates. That was precisely the purpose of the law's promoter, Count My Vote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   A nomination process filtered through a convention of party regulars will generate different candidates than one accomplished by polling the crowds, among whom are many persons who only nominally associate\n   with the Party. Count My Vote understood that. So does the Party. Whether it makes candidates more moderate, as Count My Vote would have it, or allows for more extreme candidates divorced from the influence of party leadership, the signature-gathering path to nomination will produce \"nominees and nominee positions other than those the part[y] would choose if left to [its] own devices.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    California Democratic Party v.

Republican Party of Connecticut\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213947\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/208/#p217\">\n    479 U.S. 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 215,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213947\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/208/#p217\">\n    107 S.Ct. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213947\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/208/#p217\">\n    93 L.Ed.2d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). Senate Bill 54 forces the Party to include people who only marginally identify with the party in its nomination decisions. This change will lessen candidates' loyalty to the Party relative to the Party's preferred convention process. A candidate may still formally have to certify agreement with the Party's policies, but faithful delegates are no longer able to hold rogue candidates accountable. And because more than two candidates may end up running in the primary election and split the vote, a person can gain the nomination without a majority of the vote-intensifying the risk that a nominee will be disloyal to the Party platform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   In sum, then, Senate Bill 54 interferes with the Party's internal procedures, changes the kinds of nominees the Party produces (is, in fact, meant to do so\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), allows unwanted candidates to obtain the Party nomination, causes divisiveness within the Party, and reduces the loyalty of candidates to the Party's policies. When an association grows large, the risk the association's central message will be lost amidst a sea of nominal members grows too-especially if the group must maintain an inclusive membership policy. Many organizations respond by leaving membership relatively open, but restricting leadership to those who are \"true believers,\" so to speak, in the group's mission. That is what the Party has tried to do. At core, Senate Bill 54's sin lies in taking this option away. In so doing, the law constrains the Party's ability to carry out its most central associational mission-its selection of a faithful nominee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   In spite of the foregoing burdens, the majority opinion concludes the law's overall burden on the Party's associational rights is light. The majority bases this conclusion on five main reasons: (1) its conclusion the law does not regulate the Party's internal process, (2) the Party's continued ability to use traditional advertising channels to endorse the candidate of its choice, (3) the fact the Party's members still get to choose the nominee, (4) states' ability to regulate \"the scope\" of party primaries, Maj. Op. at 1080, and (5) the Supreme Court's dicta on the power of states to mandate primaries. Since the Supreme Court's dicta relates to both the Party's burden and Utah's interest, I will address its continued vitality after I discuss the relevant state interests. As for the other reasons, I respectfully suggest they are mistaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   To begin, the majority holds Senate Bill 54 does not \"regulate the party's internal\n   process\" because \"in fact its grand compromise was to maintain the [Party's] traditional caucus system as a path onto the primary ballot.\" Maj. Op. at 1080. Yet this observation misses the point. The problem is not that the Party cannot use the caucus system at all. The problem is that the Party cannot use the caucus system as its exclusive means of nomination while still being able to list its endorsements on the ballot. The law requires the Party to allow members to either force a primary race or participate in one by collecting signatures. It is confounding to maintain that such a change does not \"regulate the party's internal process.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Next, the majority, like the district court, argues the Party's freedom not to associate with unwanted candidates is sufficiently protected because the Party's leadership can publicly disavow signature-gathering candidates. That cannot be correct. Imagine a political party chooses a \"legislator of the month\" and gives Senator Sally a badge. Now imagine the government confers that title to Bob as well, and gives him an identical badge. It cannot be the case the party's associational rights have not been trampled upon simply because the party can just tell people that Bob is not the \"real\" legislator of the month. If that were true, not much would be left of the right not to associate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , the \"ability of the party leadership to endorse a candidate\" did not lessen the burden on \"party members' ability to choose their own nominee.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p572\">\n    530 U.S. at 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p572\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So too, the ability to publicly disavow a candidate does not alleviate the forced association imposed on the Party here. Persons who gather signatures are listed as\n   <em>\n    the Party's\n   </em>\n   candidates in\n   <em>\n    the Party's\n   </em>\n   primary ballot and can become\n   <em>\n    the Party's\n   </em>\n   nominee in the general election ballot-all in contravention of the Party's express rules. The ability to publicly deny those candidates is no solution. Indeed, tactical considerations will seriously constrain that ability in practice: the denounced candidate may end up the Party's only nominee in the general election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The majority further suggests, again like the district court, that there can be no severe burden on the Party so long as nominees are ultimately chosen by the Party's members. The majority argues we must \"define the association with the requisite specificity\" and proceeds to define the Party as a collection of \"roughly 600,000 registered Republicans.\" Maj. Op. at 1081-82. Because Senate Bill 54 still permits those party members to choose the nominee, the majority concludes the burden is minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   There are two problems with this theory. First, it assumes that nothing of substance changes when nomination is transferred from the party's established convention-based system to a large-scale vote by its members. The error of this line of reasoning has already been explained. Nomination procedures can be substantive, and we err if we consider such a change immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Second, in order to hold that all is well so long as Party members choose the nominee, the majority defines political parties as merely a collection of members. That is wrong. A political party is more than the sum of its members. Political science literature has long observed parties have several components, only one of which is their membership.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Nathaniel Persily &amp; Bruce E. Cain,\n   <em>\n    The Legal Status of Political Parties: A Reassessment of Competing Paradigms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20Colum.%20L.%20Rev.%20775\">\n    100 Colum.

Parties therefore have associational rights that are distinct from those of the individuals that form its membership. The superstructure of the party-its bylaws, customs, and leadership-are protected by the First Amendment too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   If this were not true, then states would have plenary power to alter the internal regulations of political parties, so long as they left ultimate nomination decisions up to party membership. But the Supreme Court has already rejected that theory. It has held that \"[f]reedom of association also encompasses a political party's decisions about the identity of, and the process for electing, its leaders\" and that \"a State cannot substitute its judgment for that of the party as to the desirability of a particular internal party structure.\"\n   <em>\n    Eu v.

Utah has not claimed that elections were conducted in an \"uncontrolled manner\" before Senate Bill 54. Nor has it explained why the law increases the \"controlled manner\" of elections now. This appears instead to be a\n   way of saying it has an interest in election regulation in general. But the state's power to regulate elections \"does not justify, without more, the abridgment of fundamental rights, such as ... the freedom of political association.\"\n   <em>\n    Tashjian\n   </em>\n   , 479 U.S. at 217,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213947\" index=\"343\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/208/#p217\">\n    107 S.Ct. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Utah's second asserted interest fares worse.

In \"the circumstances of [that] case,\" the state's reason for thinking the law would increase voter participation was that \"more choices favored by the majority [but not by the party] will produce more voters.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"347\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"347\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p572\">\n    at 584-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"348\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p572\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That was \"hardly a compelling state interest,\" the Court explained, \"if indeed it [was] even a legitimate one.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"349\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is one thing to protect the right to vote; it is quite another to lecture political parties because their internal processes turn off average voters. It is for elections to disclose the truth of that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Though the state has not explained why it thinks Senate Bill 54 will increase voter participation, there are reasons to think Utah's asserted interest in \"increasing voter participation\" suffers from the same flaw as that in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   . As recounted earlier, the advocacy group Count My Vote spearheaded the passage of this legislation, and its express purpose was to change the Party's nomination practices so that nominees would be more representative of the majority of general election voters. It believed \"[p]arty delegates ... do not represent the views of average Utahns.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   It is uncontested that Senate Bill 54 was designed to accomplish Count My Vote's goals. At oral argument, Utah's counsel admitted that Senate Bill 54 was a \"compromise\" enacted to address the concerns of the Count My Vote movement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the majority explained, \"it is clear from our review of the record that [Senate Bill 54] was a compromise crafted between the Utah legislature and outside interests,\" namely, County My Vote. Maj. Op. at 1073. Indeed, the bill's sponsor, Senator Bramble, opened his proposal by discussing Count My Vote's efforts to \"increase citizen participation\"-mentioning the group's appeals for the \"dominant party\" to change its convention rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Senator Bramble further explained that encouraging \"competitive races between competing\n   philosophies\" would increase citizen participation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is likely, then, that Utah's purpose of \"increasing voter participation\" is linked to Count My Vote's goal of making party nominees more representative of Utahns as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   This is not a legitimate way to increase voter participation. As the Court said in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , the desire to make a party's nominees more \"representative\" is \"nothing more than a stark repudiation of freedom of political association: Parties should not be free to select their own nominees because those nominees, and the positions taken by those nominees, will not be congenial to the majority.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"350\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p572\">\n    530 U.S. at 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"351\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p572\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If Utahns feel they are not represented by Republican Party office holders, they are free to vote for a different party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the solution for citizen indifference cannot be to destabilize an existing party in the hopes of galvanizing citizen attention. Nor can it be to force insurgent candidates upon the party, even if they are more representative of the median voter than the candidates the party would choose for itself. And after all, insurgency cuts both ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   As for Utah's third interest-providing more ways for persons to become party candidates-it is similarly inadequate. This asserted interest is analogous to the state's claim in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   that it had an important interest in allowing nonmembers to have a voice in a party's nomination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"352\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"352\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p572\">\n    at 583-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"353\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p572\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court rejected that interest because a \"nonmember's desire to participate in the party's affairs is overborne by the countervailing and legitimate right of the party to determine its own membership qualifications.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"354\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tashjian\n   </em>\n   , 479 U.S. at 215-216,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213947\" index=\"355\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/208/#p217\">\n    107 S.Ct. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   The same reasoning applies here. A party member's desire to become a candidate by means other than those the party has adopted is \"overborne by the countervailing and legitimate right of the party to determine its own\" candidate nomination procedures. While the state may have an interest in making it easier for persons to earn a place as\n   <em>\n    unaffiliated\n   </em>\n   candidates on the general election ballot, it does not have a strong interest in making it easier for them to become\n   <em>\n    the party's candidates\n   </em>\n   on\n   <em>\n    the party's\n   </em>\n   primary ballot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The district court also considered a fourth possible state interest-that \"[r]equiring a primary\" allows the Lieutenant Governor to better perform his statutory duty to \" 'ensure compliance with state and federal election laws' more effectively than if nominee selection is left to a party-managed convention process.\" JA 1171 (quoting Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 20A-2-300.6 (2)(b) ). Utah has not even mentioned this interest on appeal, perhaps acknowledging what little connection exists between preventing fraud and Senate Bill 54. Even if one accepts the district court's premise that primaries help prevent fraud, Senate Bill 54 does little to prevent fraud because it does not require a primary in every case: when a qualified political party only has candidates who emerged from its convention, the law does not require the party to participate in a primary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   To summarize, then, Utah has not shown that its \"interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff's rights.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"356\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/#p788\">\n    460 U.S. at 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"357\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/#p788\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Consequently, I respectfully think this reed cannot support the weight placed upon it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   The problem lies in its inception. In 1974, in\n   <em>\n    American Party of Texas v.

After the Utah Republican Party repeatedly rebuffed requests to change its nomination procedures, the unsuccessful reformers simply went to the state legislature and changed the Party's procedures by force of law. Allowing this collateral attack on party rules to be a run-of-the-mill part of the political process invites leaders \"to enlist and rely on state law as the primary vehicle for party governance, largely relieving these leaders of any need to secure the support or acquiescence of party members to a chosen course.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ellen D.
