Washtech's complaint alleged that the regulations exceed their statutory authority, suffer from multiple procedural deficiencies and are arbitrary and capricious. The district court dismissed Washtech's complaint in full, relying on a mixture of grounds-standing; failure to state a plausible claim for relief; and a deficient opposition to the DHS's motion to dismiss-depending on the precise claim at issue.

After concluding that the increase in competing products in the market was a sufficient injury in fact, we held the challenged regulation caused the injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9049859,3695927\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/91/1493/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9049859,3695927\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/91/1493/\">\n    at 1499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because \"the injury claimed is exposure to competition\" rather than \"lost sales, per se,\" it was \"no answer to say that the FDA is merely permitting a competitive product to enter the market and leaving the purchasing decision to the consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9049859,3695927\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/91/1493/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The same rationale obtains here. The injury claimed is exposure to increased competition in the STEM labor market-not lost jobs, per se. Accordingly, the DHS's argument that its regulation leaves the hiring decision to the employer is unavailing.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Honeywell Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3429241,9240902\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1363/\">\n    374 F.3d at 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting argument that plaintiff's injury was not caused by regulation allowing competing products into market because plaintiff could only \"speculat[e] about the purchasing decisions of third parties not before the court\").

Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Third, and finally, Washtech's injury is redressable by a favorable decision. Washtech has alleged that it is injured because of increased competition from workers who are eligible to work only because of the 2016 Rule. A court order invalidating the 2016 Rule would eliminate workers from the STEM job market and therefore decrease competition for the STEM jobs pursued by Washtech's members. The specific injury suffered, then, would be remedied by a favorable court order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sherley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3551058,3696355\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/610/69/\">\n    610 F.3d at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stem-cell\n   research plaintiffs challenging regulations that increased competition for research grants had standing; redressability \"clear\");\n   <em>\n    Honeywell Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3429241,9240902\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1363/\">\n    374 F.3d at 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"As a favorable opinion of the court could\n   <em>\n    remove the competing\n   </em>\n   [products] from the market, redressability is satisfied ....\" (emphasis added) ). Accordingly, Washtech has standing to bring its three claims challenging the 2016 Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Washtech's standing to bring Count I, a claim that the 1992 Rule exceeds the DHS's statutory authority, is less certain. Washtech argues that the 1992 Rule caused the same injury as the 2016 Rule-an increase in competition for STEM jobs as a result of the Rule's permitting OPT workers in the STEM field-but Washtech's complaint provides less substance regarding the 1992 Rule. The complaint alleges that Washtech members compete with workers operating under the extensions authorized by the 2016 Rule but does not specifically allege that they compete with workers operating under the initial twelve-month OPT period authorized by the 1992 Rule. The DHS urges us to agree with the district court that Washtech's failure is fatal to its standing to challenge the 1992 Rule. We are skeptical of the DHS's argument. No OPT participants could apply for extensions to work without first working for twelve months as authorized by the 1992 Rule. The allegations regarding the 2016 Rule naturally and inevitably encompass allegations against the 1992 Rule, even if not explicitly spelled out that way in the complaint. Nevertheless, we need not decide this issue because there is another jurisdictional bar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We affirm dismissal of Count I on the alternative ground that the claim is untimely.

As discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , however, the dismissal of Count I does not foreclose Washtech's challenge to the statutory authority of the OPT program as a whole because the 2016 Rule may have reopened the issue anew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In this circumstance, we believe that, in kicking Washtech out of court under Local Rule 7(b), the district court abused its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   That said, whether Count II may proceed remains in question.
