See, e.g., R. 62-6 at 6, 16, Page ID 1941, 1951.

The following common refrains in summary judgment cases are important to recall in a case with so many factual recitations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   On summary judgment a court may not make credibility determinations, weigh the evidence, or decide which inferences to draw from the facts; these are jobs for a factfinder. Rather, the court has one task and one task only: to decide, based on the evidence of record, whether there is any material dispute of fact that requires a trial. Summary judgment is not appropriate if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. We must look therefore at the evidence as a jury might, construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and avoiding the temptation to decide which party's version of the facts is more likely true. As we have said many times, summary judgment cannot be used to resolve swearing contests between litigants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107579\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/767/#p770\">\n    337 F.3d at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotations omitted).

There is no magic to this test; it is merely one way of culling the relevant evidence needed to demonstrate whether a reasonable factfinder could conclude that an employer engaged in an adverse employment action based on the plaintiff's race or other proscribed factor. But because the framework is helpful we use it to evaluate each of the plaintiffs' claims by looking to see whether the plaintiffs\n   (1) are members of a protected class; (2) performed reasonably on the job in accord with their employer['s] legitimate expectations; (3) were subjected to an adverse employment action despite their reasonable performance; and (4) similarly situated employees outside of the protected class were treated more favorably by the employer.\n   <em>\n    David\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123754\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/216/#p224\">\n    846 F.3d at 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Relevant evidence means evidence having \"any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Fed. R. Evid. 401. Evidence of what has happened to other employees is only relevant if that employee is in the same boat as the plaintiff. For example, one would expect an employee with ten years' experience to be paid more than an employee with ten months' experience.

They submitted no pay records, nothing about their qualifications or experience (other than that Diane was an aqua teacher at a park and had not worked at a hospital before), who supervised Kelly and Diane, how long they had worked for the hospital, what types of reviews they received, and if they had been subject to any discipline. In fact, the plaintiffs never revealed the last names of \"Kelly\" and \"Diane\" such that the defendant could, on its own, look for the answers to any of these questions.

He claims that there was no evidence that white employees in his job category were asked to perform these tasks, nor was there evidence that they were deprived of the charge pay. Once again, however,\n   the burden was on Parnell to produce evidence of a disparity and he failed to do so in any manner. He did not submit affidavits from white EVS technicians who were paid for their work, records of assignments, pay, or any other scintilla of evidence of how similarly situated white employees were treated.

Here again, plaintiffs have failed to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of the same element discussed above which is essential to their case and on which they will bear the burden of proof at trial-that is, that there are similarly situated non-African-American workers who were treated more favorably.

We can quickly dispense with Scott-Murray's claim as he does not dispute that he did not apply for any promotions. R. 64 at \u00b654, Page ID 2040. Advocate offered Pannell a Tech 2 position but he declined it because it was not on his preferred shift. R. 64 at \u00b636, Page ID 2029-30; R. 62-10 at \u00b613, Page ID 1986. Thus, according to the undisputed facts, neither Pannell nor Scott-Murray were denied a Tech 2 position. No reasonable juror could infer that Pannell and Scott-Murray were passed up for promotions because of their race. They were not passed up at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Johnson and Smith, on the other hand, did apply unsuccessfully for other positions. They both claim that Advocate's hiring personnel passed over their applications and hired non-African-American people with less seniority or experience in their stead. Smith's evidence consisted of her deposition testimony that she applied for positions, did not get the jobs, and that white applicants did. Save for one exception, she did not know the names of any of the applicants, nor anything about their experience, qualifications, resumes, or interviews. R. 46-3 at 9, 11-12, 65-67, Page ID 622, 624-25, 678-80. Smith did know that a white woman named Mary Harris, received a dispatcher position for which she applied. R. 46-3 at 9, Page ID 622. Other than knowing that Harris had worked in an office before, however, Smith did not know anything else about Harris' resume, background, qualifications or why she was selected for the position.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Just as before, it was the plaintiffs' burden to set forth factual information to demonstrate that these other applicants were similarly situated, and they failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Johnson's claim contains the same defect. Although he does identify four white employees who received positions for which he unsuccessfully applied-Gina Lika, John Mueller, Lance White, and Fred (Last Name Unknown)-he offers no evidence of their background, qualifications, resume, or any other information that would satisfy the plaintiff's burden to demonstrate that the comparators were similarly-situated applicants. Although the brief points to Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Statement of Material Facts as to Which There is No Genuine Issue (Appellant's Brief at 12-13), and that document,\n   in turn, points to depositions and declaration pages, we could not find, despite our digging, any relevant material evidence that the employees who received the promotions for which Johnson and Smith applied were similarly situated to the latter. It was, of course, the plaintiffs' responsibility to point us to any evidence that would have supported this essential element of their claim.

For example, Pannell stated in his deposition that a white candidate who was hired must have had less experience than Scott-Murray because \"[h]e [the white candidate] was hired, and he had to be trained, so I mean if [Scott-Murray's] already been trained, he has got less experience.\" R. 46-1 at 9, Page ID 460. And in regard to a different position, Pannell stated that he spoke with the hired candidate and, \"[h]er background, as far as being a tech two, I talked with her and she said she had never done that type of [tech two] work before.\" R. 46-1 at 10, Page ID 461.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, Johnson stated in his deposition that two white women, whose names he did not know, received jobs in positions for which he had applied. According to Johnson, one had the state approved certification for the job (which Johnson did not have), but Johnson did not know anything about her other qualifications. The other was, at that time, going through the state certification program and had no other work experience other than \"she said she worked on and off at Popeyes.\" R. 46 at 62-63, Page ID 422-23. The brief makes no claim that any of these employees who were hired were similarly situated to Johnson or Smith and the citations in the brief do not point to any relevant support that they were. The plaintiff has failed to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of the element that is essential to their claim-that similarly situated non-African-American employees were treated more favorably by the employer vis-\u00e0-vis promotions.\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 322,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    David v.

Disparate terminations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The lack of a relevant comparator similarly dooms several other of the plaintiffs' claims. Smith, Johnson, and Scott-Murray each claim that they were terminated because of their race. But once again, none of the plaintiffs sets forth any admissible evidence that similarly situated white employees were treated more favorably. For example, Smith alleges she was terminated for refusing to work in her assigned area, while another white employee, Jolanta, who also refused to work in her assigned area, was not terminated, reprimanded, or sent home. The brief is silent as to any evidence that Jolanta was similarly situated. The plaintiffs offer no evidence about who Jolanta was, what her position was, who supervised her, why she refused to work in her assigned area, and whether she had a similar disciplinary record and similar performance reviews. Arguments that consist of conclusory allegations that are not properly developed are waived.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156805\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/645/#p649\">\n    759 F.3d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 649 (7th Cir. 2014). But even if we dig through the statement of facts (which, again, we should not need\n   to do), the only evidence that the plaintiff and Jolanta were similarly situated is that they shared the same supervisor R. 64 at \u00b6 78, Page ID 2052-53. We have no idea whether Jolanta was otherwise similarly situated, or whether there were any unusual circumstances, mitigating factors, difference in seniority, that would have made the comparison inapt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The same deficiencies plague Scott-Murray's claims of a racially-based termination. Her non-specific claim that she was disciplined for false reasons is unsupported by any details or any comparison to similarly situated non-African-American employees. She does raise one example of a non-African-American employee being treated differently for the same conduct. Advocate ultimately terminated Scott-Murray for taking an unauthorized break. Scott-Murray alleges that she was actually performing her job by cleaning the conference room at the time of the alleged infraction. She also asserts that Diana Esparaza, who is not African American, was shown more favor by the supervisors and was not terminated even when she sat in the lobby using her phone and watching television. The brief provides no information as to whether Scott-Murray and Esparaza had the same supervisor, or whether they were subject to the same standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Johnson also disputes the motivations behind his termination claiming that management unfairly criticized him, held him to unfair standards, nitpicked and micromanaged. This evidence cannot support a claim for race discrimination unless he can set forth some evidence that similarly situated non-African-American employees were not treated in the same manner. A supervisor who nitpicks, micromanages, and holds employees to unreasonable standards is simply a bad boss. It is only if she applies this poor management unequally based on race that a plaintiff has a claim for race discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As evidence of this claim, Johnson makes only the same type of similarly broad and conclusory allegation that \"white EVS were not subject to such excessive scrutiny, micromanagement and monitoring.\" (Appellant's Brief at 15). But even if such an undeveloped, generalized argument that supervisors treated white employees better than black employees is not waived (and we believe it is, see\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156805\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/645/#p649\">\n    759 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   649 ), it certainly is not sufficiently supported by evidence so as to survive a motion for summary judgment. Johnson's only evidence on this matter was his testimony that \"they walk up behind me, the fact that they nitpick. They won't follow white people or Polish people. They will just follow black people. It's a fixation upon black people.\" R. 46 at 51, Page ID 411. Johnson can certainly set forth evidence of discrimination in his own declaration or deposition, but speculation as to an employer's state of mind is not sufficient to create an issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107579\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/767/#p770\">\n    337 F.3d at 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There may be disputed facts about how many beds employees were expected to clean, but unless there was some evidence that African-American employees were held to a different standard than white employees, the dispute is not material to the question of race discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Discriminatory assignments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The related claims-that supervisors assigned African-American EVS technicians to more strenuous and less desirable assignments-also lack evidentiary support. The plaintiffs testified that some assignments required more effort than others. Even accepting the bare allegations that some floors were less desirable and that more African-American employees were assigned to these floors (both allegations without factual support), the plaintiffs have not set forth sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the non-African-American employees who cleaned the allegedly easier floors were similarly situated. We do not know, for example, whether those non-African-American employees had more seniority or different qualifications or were assigned to those floors by request or for other reasons. Moreover, the evidence that higher floors were more strenuous came either from the plaintiffs subjective opinion or speculation as to co-workers states of mind.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   R. 46-1 at 8, Page ID 459 (\"Q: Is it possible that some people would find that [a lower floor] to be more difficult?

In order to remove such a question of fact from the jury on summary judgment, the court would have to determine that no reasonable jury could find the conduct at issue severe or pervasive. In this case, it is certainly possible that a reasonable jury could find that the conduct was pervasive or severe based on the claims of racially derogatory speech used by Aramark supervisors. Once again, we remind ourselves that as we review the facts on summary judgment we do so in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and refrain from resolving swearing contests. We have divided those facts-the incidents of racially derogatory speech-into three categories: comments made directly to plaintiffs; comments made directly to non-plaintiff co-workers and comments made to non-plaintiffs about which others were aware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Racially charged language\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    a.

R. 62-2 at 14, Page ID 1740; R. 62-3 at 95, Page ID 1853.

For example, it is evidence, not of the veracity of the remark of course, or even of the truth as to whether Castillo uttered it or not, but of the fact that employees understood their environment to be one in which derogatory statements were pervasive. This latter group of evidence might have some bearing in a trial on the merits, but it would be for the district court to determine whether these comments were more prejudicial than probative.

R. 63 at \u00b6 30, 32, Page ID 2003. The parties agree that by contract, Advocate maintained ultimate control over disciplinary, hiring, and firing actions and that Aramark supervisors could not hire, fire or discipline any EVS tech without prior approval from Advocate. See R. 63 at \u00b6 33, Page ID 2002-03; (Appellants' Brief at 20). In other words, the Aramark supervisors did have some supervisory and control powers in the sense that they supervised work, created schedules and assignments, recommended discipline, etc., but, by contract, a significant amount of control remained with Advocate.

Such a discussion was not critical to its decision at the time, as it had found no evidence of discrimination.

But it is also possible that, in reality, Advocate acted as a mere rubber stamp for the recommendations of Aramark supervisors about these tangible employment actions. Once the District Court ferrets out the question of supervisor status and the relationship between the entities, including whether \"the employer may be held to have effectively delegated the power to take tangible employment actions\" to the Aramark supervisors (\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698473\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/421/#p431\">\n    570 U.S. at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698473\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/421/#p431\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), it can determine under which standard Advocate might be held liable for actions by Aramark supervisors-strict liability or negligence.

Advocate paid the plaintiffs' salaries and the EVS tech employees expected to stay in their positions indefinitely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The answer to the question of whether Advocate took \"prompt and appropriate corrective action reasonable likely to prevent the harassment from recurring.\"\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174035\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/888/\">\n    838 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   898 also will require a hard look at the particular facts and circumstances of the case at hand. But we conclude that there is sufficient evidence of notice to the employer to proceed past a motion for summary judgment. Johnson did not report the \"porch monkey\" comment to Advocate human resources, nor did he report Michalkowski's mocking slang, but other employees did. Johnson also reported to the president of the hospital that a supervisor had stated that she\n   preferred to hire Polish workers rather than African-American workers because \"they clean better.\" And Johnson submitted a list of African-American associates who he believed had been discriminated against and gave this list to Advocate's human resources department. Smith made several complaints to Advocate's human resources department about what she believed to be racially motivated behavior. R. 46-3 at 61, Page ID 674; R. 62-1 at 104-112, 144-145, Page ID 1649-57, 1689-90. Scott-Murray reported to Advocate human resources department that her Aramark supervisor told her \"not to give him that black girl ghetto attitude.\" R. 64 at \u00b6 45, Page ID 2035. Based on these reports, a jury could conclude that Advocate had adequate notice of the problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As for adequate steps to remedy the discrimination, Advocate investigated many of the complaints, held some meetings, and met with some supervisors. It is true that an employer's course of action need not have been perfect, but it cannot be negligent.\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Waste Mgmt. of Ill.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645541\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/1021/#p1030\">\n    361 F.3d 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1030 (7th Cir. 2004). Advocate argues that it took sufficient corrective action by investigating \"the allegations brought by Plaintiffs and [taking] remedial action in the form of training and rounding with associates.\" (Appellee's Brief at 41). Advocate also notes that it reassigned Castillo when certain allegations were made in fall 2014, and moved Skalnik away from Plaintiff Scott-Murray when she complained that he placed his hands on her. The district court pointed out that Advocate human resources employees investigated Scott-Murray's complaint against Skalnik; investigated Smith's complaints of improper treatment; provided discrimination and harassment training; instructed leadership to round with associates in EVS; and investigated Johnson's complaint about payroll errors and resolved some of them.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205871489\">\n    2016 WL 5871489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Advocate did not reprimand or terminate any of the harassers, including Castillo, Skalnik, or Michalkowski. Advocate did not separate Castillo from the employees who raised concerns about her. Although Advocate's human resources employee, Abigail Oman, stated that she investigated Johnson's claims that he and other African-American EVS techs were being treated unfairly, the plaintiffs argued that the investigation was wholly inadequate. Johnson had supplied Oman with a list of other African-American EVS techs who he claimed were also being treated unfairly. Oman went back through her notes of conversations she had in the past with some of those African-American EVS techs to see if they had any past reports that corroborated Johnson's, but she did not re-interview any of the EVS techs after Johnson's complaint, and she did not interview workers on the list with whom she had never spoken. Nor did she contact any white EVS techs to compare their experiences. Certainly a jury could conclude that an investigation such as this one-a review of notes of previous conversations with some of the employees on Johnson's list-was negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, although Advocate held discrimination training sessions, it is undisputed that Michalkowski, one of the main alleged perpetrators of the discrimination, did not attend. There is, moreover, a clear factual dispute as to whether Castillo-the other Aramark supervisor most accused of discrimination-attended the human resources training sessions. The district court found it \"unfortunate\" that the alleged discriminators did not attend the anti-discrimination training. We think it is more than unfortunate; it creates a material fact as to whether Advocate took reasonable actions to remedy the alleged discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   A jury might well find that Advocate's actions were minimally sufficient or even completely so, but that is a factual determination based on all of the facts and circumstances of this particular case. And those \"facts and circumstances\" include the \"gravity of the harassment alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    May v.

In short, the question as to whether an employer's response was reasonably likely to end the harassment is fact specific and must be analyzed according to a totality of the circumstances review. By dismissing on summary judgment Advocate's liability for the hostile work environment, the district court declared that no reasonable jury could have found that Advocate's response to the discrimination was inadequate. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Perhaps Advocate's response was adequate given the fairly low bar this court has set.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645541\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/1021/#p1030\">\n    361 F.3d at 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In this case, we conclude that it could not be determined as a matter of law on a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   On a final note, we reject entirely the defendant's notion that it \"strains credulity\" to think that African-American employees might be subject to a hostile work environment where many of the managers in the workplace are also African-Americans. There are many reasons why women and minorities in management might tolerate discrimination against members of their own class, or why they might participate in discriminatory acts themselves.

Indeed, once one discounts the plaintiffs' disparate treatment claims (as the court does), some of the plaintiffs' hostile work environment claims are extraordinarily weak. Plaintiff Kimberly Scott-Murray, for example, complains of just one racially charged comment the entire time she was employed at Advocate. She had no interaction with Susan Castillo and just one minor interaction with Mike Michalkowski, so the conduct of these two major offenders had little to no impact on her work environment. Plaintiff Robert Pannell's claim is on even shakier ground; the only racially charged comments which he testified to hearing were not addressed to him. And neither the court today nor the district court pointed to any race-based comment made in the presence of Plaintiff Annette Smith. At the very least, we should affirm summary judgment for Advocate against these three plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Plaintiffs Warren Johnson and Sherry Young have somewhat stronger claims, but even their allegations fall short of demonstrating the type of work environment necessary to survive summary judgment. I agree with the district court that \"[e]ach of these comments should be cause for concern, but they were not so serious (on their own or in combination) or so numerous that they materially influenced plaintiffs' working conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205871489\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These \"sporadic, offensive comments\" are simply not enough to clear the high bar this court has set in order to bring hostile work environment claims before a jury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205871489\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, I would also affirm the district court with respect to Johnson's and Young's hostile work environment claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Because I conclude that none of the plaintiffs proffered sufficient evidence to avoid summary judgment on their hostile work environment claims, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the court's\n   opinion and judgment.
