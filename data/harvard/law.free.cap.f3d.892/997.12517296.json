Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 5 of the Nevada Rules of Appellate Procedure,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   we respectfully request that the Nevada Supreme Court determine whether, under Nevada law, \u00a7 453.337 is divisible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In 2012, Gibran Figueroa-Beltran (Figueroa), a native of Mexico, was found in possession of one gram of cocaine and 5.8 grams of heroin during a traffic stop. He was convicted in the Eighth Judicial District Court of possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell in violation of \u00a7 453.337 and sentenced to 19 to 48 months' imprisonment. He was paroled approximately one year later, but subsequently arrested for selling a controlled substance, and removed to Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Within two years of his removal, Figueroa illegally reentered the United States, where he was once again arrested for selling a controlled substance. While those charges were pending, Figueroa was charged with 26 other counts of drug-related offenses, including receiving stolen property, receiving a stolen vehicle, being a prohibited person in possession of firearms, operating a place for the sale of controlled substances, possessing for sale Schedule I/II controlled substances, trafficking Schedule I controlled substances (28+ grams), conspiring to violate the federal Controlled Substances Act, and selling Schedule I or II controlled substances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A federal grand jury later indicted Figueroa for being a deported alien found unlawfully in the United States, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Figueroa pled\n   guilty without a plea agreement and the district court imposed a low-end Guideline sentence of 41 months' imprisonment followed by a three-year term of supervised release. In calculating the 41-month sentence, the district court began with a base offense level of 8 and added a 16-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2L1.2 due to Figueroa's 2012 conviction for possession of a controlled substance for sale. Figueroa objected to the enhancement, noting that his conviction for a violation of \u00a7 453.337 did not qualify as a drug trafficking offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Figueroa filed a timely appeal challenging the district court's application of the 16-level enhancement provided for in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

According to Figueroa,\n   <em>\n    Luqman\n   </em>\n   established that, under Nevada's post-1981 statutory drug scheme, which encompasses \u00a7 453.337, the identity of the controlled substance is \"merely a fact\"-rather than an \"element of the offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At issue in\n   <em>\n    Luqman\n   </em>\n   was the authority of the state board of pharmacy to \"classify drugs into various schedules according to the drug's propensity for harm and abuse,\" thereby setting the penalties for violations of the relevant statutory provisions.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2403493\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/101/149/\">\n    697 P.2d at 109-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Muller\n   </em>\n   , the defendant-appellant contended that where \"the sale of [two] different controlled substances was consummated simultaneously in one transaction, his conduct d[id] not constitute two separate offenses for which he may be charged.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4864055\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/93/686/\">\n    572 P.2d at 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In contrast,\n   <em>\n    Muller\n   </em>\n   appears to conclude that the sale of one controlled substance is an offense distinct from the sale of another, and proof of the identity of the controlled substance at issue is required. Without further guidance, we cannot say with confidence that the Nevada precedent definitively answers the question whether \u00a7 453.337 is divisible as to the identity of a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
