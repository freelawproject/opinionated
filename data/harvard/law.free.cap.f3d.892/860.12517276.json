A Regional Director (\"the Director\") of the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\" or \"the Board\") ruled that such employees were included in PFAC's bargaining unit for the purposes of their part-time faculty duties. An independent arbitrator disagreed. After PFAC filed a federal suit to confirm the arbitration, the district court gave precedence to the Director's decision and vacated the award. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CCC operates a private university in Chicago that focuses on the arts and media. It employs approximately 220 full-time faculty, 1,000 part-time faculty, and 700 staff (350 full-time and 350 part-time). PFAC represents part-time faculty for the purposes of collective bargaining. A separate union, the United Staff of Columbia College (\"USCC\"), represents both full- and part-time staff members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case involves a dispute over the collective bargaining representation of a unique hybrid category of approximately 50 to 75 employees who work as\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   full-time staff\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   part-time faculty, referred to as \"Full Time Staff Who Teach\" (\"FTST\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The record is divided as to whether, prior to 2015, it was informally understood that PFAC represented FTST in their capacity as part-time faculty. On one hand, at the time of PFAC's original certification in 1998, it sent a written invitation to all part-time faculty, including FTST, to become union members. Following PFAC's certification, CCC also applied the union's wage scale and other contractual benefits (such as tuition remission and sick and personal leave) to both exclusive part-time faculty and FTST. Additionally, PFAC's former president and lead negotiator for its first three collective bargaining agreements considered FTST as part of the bargaining unit. At the same time, the President of CCC wrote to a group of FTST in 2014 that \"[t]he College has never recognized nor does it agree to voluntarily recognize [FTST] either as members of the PFAC bargaining unit or as an independent union.\" Moreover, CCC never placed any FTST on the \"unit eligibility list\" that it provided to PFAC each semester, and it did not accord FTST any seniority within the PFAC bargaining unit. Finally, FTST did not pay PFAC union dues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The recognition clause in PFAC's collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") is equally equivocal. That clause states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Unit includes\n   <em>\n    all part-time faculty members who have completed teaching at least (1) semester at Columbia College Chicago\n   </em>\n   , excluding all other employees, full-time faculty, artists-in-residence, and Columbia College Chicago graduate students, part-time faculty members teaching only continuing education, music lessons to individual students or book and paper making classes,\n   <em>\n    Columbia College Chicago full-time staff members\n   </em>\n   , teachers employed by Erickson Institute, the YMCA or Alder [sic] Planetarium, and other individuals not appearing on the Columbia College Chicago payroll, managers and confidential employees, guards, and supervisors as defined in the [National Labor Relations Act].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (emphasis added). FTST are part-time faculty members who have generally taught at least one semester at the College, and thus arguably fall under the scope of the general inclusion provision. However, FTST also qualify as full-time staff members, which are expressly excluded from representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In February 2015, USCC petitioned the NLRB under \u00a7 9 of the National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\") to add FTST to its existing bargaining unit via a self-determination election.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20159\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The petition was originally dismissed on the ground that FTST were already represented by PFAC. However, that dismissal was later revoked and the petition rein-stated so that evidence on the issue could be presented. The Director conducted a twelve-day evidentiary hearing, during which numerous CCC employees testified about terms and conditions of employment at the College.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   PFAC intervened in the Board proceedings and claimed that it did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   represent FTST. It argued that FTST did not share a \"community of interest\" with other part-time faculty and that their inclusion in the bargaining unit would \"destabilize\" the existing contract between PFAC and the College. It also asserted that including FTST \"would create a minority union to compete with an already established majority union's representation of part-time faculty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In August 2016, the Director issued a \"Decision and Order\" that found FTST were included in the PFAC bargaining unit in their capacity as part-time faculty. He ruled that FTST qualified as \"dual\n   function\" employees because they held \"two separate and independent jobs, one as full-time staff and the other as part-time faculty.\" He further decided that as part-time faculty, FTST were \"already included in the PFAC unit ... and covered by the PFAC contract.\" He supported this determination by highlighting relevant witness testimony and pointing to the section of PFAC's recognition clause that states, \"[t]he Unit includes all part time faculty members who have completed teaching at least one (1) semester at Columbia College Chicago.\" Although he acknowledged that the recognition clause also excludes \"full-time staff members,\" he believed the limitation applied to FTST \"only in regard to their capacity as full-time staff.\" Thus, in his view, FTST were included \"within the plain language of the PFAC unit description.\" Because their faculty job classification \"[was] already included in a unit covered by a contract,\" he concluded that contract bar principles prevented their further inclusion in USCC. Consequently, USCC's self-determination petition was dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   PFAC requested review of the Director's decision by the NLRB.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102.67\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (\"Upon the filing of a request ... the Board may review any action of a Regional Director.\"). Before the Board issued its final decision, however, CCC began to unilaterally assign retroactive seniority to FTST employees under the terms of the PFAC CBA. In response, PFAC filed a grievance against the College, arguing that CCC's actions violated the CBA because \"[n]one of the so-called 'FTST' ... ha[d] paid the necessary union dues or agency fees to accrue or maintain seniority in the [PFAC] unit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After CCC denied the grievance, PFAC sought arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its briefs to the arbitrator, PFAC acknowledged that the Director included FTST in the PFAC bargaining unit, and claimed that it was \"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   using [the] arbitration as a collateral challenge to the [Director's] ruling.\" It further stated that it would \"comply with [the decision] and fairly represent the FTST\" as long as it remained in effect. Nevertheless, it maintained that the Director \"was silent as to how to implement that decision,\" and \"silent as to retroactivity.\" In the eyes of PFAC, the Director \"claimed jurisdiction over a representation dispute,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a contract dispute over comparative, intraunit seniority.\" It argued that, by extension, \"[n]othing in the [Director's] Decision mandate[d] that the Employer (or the Union) give FTST 'back seniority.' \" It advocated that, since the Board had not yet issued a final decision, it was best \"to allow the administrative process to play out\" rather than allow \"immediate, unilateral action from the Employer.\" It sought for the College \"to cease and desist such unilateral assignments of seniority and to make whole any [PFAC] unit member who loses work as a result of the improper assignment of seniority/credit history.\" It argued that such a ruling would \"maintain[ ] the status quo until the administrative process [before the Board was] 'final.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The arbitrator issued an award to PFAC on January 11, 2017. His decision, however, went beyond matters of mere seniority and addressed the underlying question of\n   representation. He framed the \"core issue presented\" as one of \"contract law,\" specifically, the proper interpretation of the recognition clause in PFAC's CBA. He emphasized that his \"role and authority\" was to \"determine the parties' mutual intent lying behind the governing contract language.\" He concluded that the recognition clause was ambiguous as to the inclusion of FTST. He further determined that, prior to the Director's decision, the parties' \"custom and practice\" excluded FTST from the PFAC bargaining unit. As a result, he characterized FTST as \"non-members of the bargaining unit.\" In his view, \"because the parties did not mutually intend to include the FTST employees in the bargaining unit ... [CCC] violated [the CBA] when it treated those employees as if they were in the unit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 14, 2017, the NLRB denied PFAC's request for review, thereby affirming the Director's dismissal of USCC's petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102.67\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (\"Denial of a request for review shall constitute an affirmance of the regional director's action.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On January 23, 2017, PFAC filed suit under the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") to confirm the arbitration award and compel CCC to abide by its terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . CCC responded by filing a cross-motion to vacate the arbitrator's decision, arguing that it directly conflicted with the Director's ruling and thus infringed upon the NLRB's primary jurisdiction over representation issues. CCC further claimed that the arbitrator exceeded his authority because the question of FTST representation was not fairly subsumed within the grievance submitted by PFAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The district court ruled in CCC's favor on November 7, 2017. It agreed that the arbitration award contravened the Director's ruling and found that, \"where the Board decides a representational issue, that decision necessarily takes precedence over an arbitration award on the same issue.\" According to the court, because the arbitrator \"decided that issue inconsistently with the NLRB's resolution of that question, it cannot stand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court further found that the arbitrator exceeded his contractual authority. It believed that PFAC's grievance was \"cast in terms focusing on the required method for making seniority determinations, not on determinations about who is eligible for representation by the bargaining unit.\" As a result, \"the issue in the arbitration was not whether FTST were within the PFAC unit, but rather whether the manner in which CCC was assigning work ... was consonant with the terms of the CBA.\" Thus, it concluded that the arbitrator acted improperly by reaching the representation issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, the court ruled that the arbitration award contravened the public policy\n   goal of vesting primary jurisdiction over representation issues to the NLRB. In addition, it felt that enforcement of the award would \"force CCC, like Odysseus, between Scylla and Charybdis by requiring it to comply with two irreconcilable orders, one requiring the college to recognize FTST as members of the PFAC bargaining unit and the other forbidding it from doing so.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In reviewing a district court's affirmation or vacation of an arbitrator's award, \"[w]e accept ... findings of fact that are not clearly erroneous and review questions of law\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Prostyakov v.

Here, the district court found the arbitrator's award unenforceable because: (1) it conflicted with a representational decision of the NLRB; (2) the arbitrator exceeded his authority under the CBA; and (3) it violated public policy. We need not address all three issues here. \"[W]e may affirm on any basis that appears in the record,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kidwell v.
