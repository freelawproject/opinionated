(the \"NBEO\"). Three optometrists, Rhonda L. Hutton, Tawny P. Kaeochinda, and Nicole Mizrahi (the \"Plaintiffs\"), as representatives of the putative class of victims, specify in two complaints that their personal information and that of the class members was stolen in the NBEO data breach. Hutton and Kaeochinda joined in the initial complaint-which underlies appeal No. 17-1506-that was filed in the District of Maryland in August 2016. It alleges five claims, including negligence, breach of contract, and breach of implied contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hutton v. Nat'l Bd. of Exam'rs in Optometry, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:16-cv-3025 (D. Md. Aug. 30, 2016), ECF No. 1 (the \"Hutton Complaint\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint of plaintiff Mizrahi-which underlies appeal No. 17-1508-was filed in that court in September 2016, and alleges claims of negligence, breach of contract, breach of implied contract, and unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mizrahi v. Nat'l Bd. of Exam'rs in Optometry, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:16-cv-3146 (D. Md. Sept. 13, 2016), ECF No. 1 (the \"Mizrahi Complaint\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   All the claims arise from the NBEO's failure to adequately safeguard personal information of the Plaintiffs and the class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The district court dismissed the Complaints for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, based on a failure to establish that the Plaintiffs possessed Article III standing to sue. It reasoned, inter alia, that the Complaints had not sufficiently alleged the necessary injury-in-fact and that, in any event, they failed to sufficiently allege that any injuries suffered by the Plaintiffs were fairly traceable to conduct of the NBEO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hutton v. Nat'l Bd. of Exam'rs in Optometry, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:16-cv-3025 (D. Md. Mar. 22, 2017), ECF No. 19 (the \"Opinion\"). The Plaintiffs have appealed the judgments of dismissal and the appeals have been consolidated. As explained below, we are satisfied that the Plaintiffs have standing to sue and therefore vacate and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In July 2016, optometrists across the United States noticed that Chase Amazon Visa credit card accounts had been fraudulently opened in their names.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hutton Compl. \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mizrahi Compl. \u00b6 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The creation of those fraudulent accounts-which required the use of an applicant's correct social security number and date of birth-convinced several of the victims that data containing their personal information had been stolen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hutton Compl. \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mizrahi Compl. \u00b6 21. The victims discussed the thefts among themselves in Facebook groups dedicated to optometrists, including, for example, a group called \"ODs on Facebook.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hutton Compl. \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mizrahi Compl. \u00b6 2. The optometrists determined that the only common source amongst them and to which they had all given their personal information-including social security numbers, names, dates of birth, addresses, and credit card information-was the NBEO, where every graduating optometry student had to submit their personal information to sit for board-certifying exams.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hutton Compl. \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mizrahi Compl. \u00b6 3. Although the victim optometrists identified other possible sources for the data breach-for example, the American Optometric Association, the American Academy of Optometry, and the Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry-those organizations had not collected or stored social security numbers, or they confirmed that their databases had never been breached.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hutton Compl. \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mizrahi Compl. \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The NBEO soon became aware of the concerns and suspicions of the victim optometrists. On August 2, 2016, the NBEO released a statement on its Facebook page asserting that, \"[a]fter a thorough investigation and extensive discussions with involved parties,\" the NBEO had determined that its \"information systems [had] NOT been compromised.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mizrahi Compl. \u00b6 4, 25. Two days later, however, the NBEO revised that view, posting a second statement on Facebook asserting that it had decided to further \"investigate whether personal data was stolen from [its] information systems to support the perpetrators' fraud on individuals and Chase.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hutton Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mizrahi Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 26. Three weeks later, on August 25, 2016, the NBEO revised its earlier announcements \"with a cryptic message stating its internal review was still ongoing and that it may take a number of additional weeks to complete.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hutton Compl. \u00b6 17. The NBEO also advised the victims to \"remain vigilant in checking their credit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 30, 2016, Hutton and Kaeochinda initiated their civil action in the District of Maryland, pursuant to codified provisions of the Class Action Fairness Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2). Two weeks later, Mizrahi initiated her own civil action in the same court. Hutton, Kaeochinda, and Mizrahi alleged that their personal information, and that of the class members, had been compromised in a breach of the NBEO's database. The Plaintiffs-on behalf of themselves and the putative class-sought damages, restitution, and injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hutton Compl. \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mizrahi Compl. \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Hutton, a resident of Kansas, had submitted her personal information to the NBEO in 1998 when she registered to take a professional optometry licensure examination. Eighteen years later, on August 5, 2016, Hutton received by mail a Chase Amazon Visa credit card for which she had not applied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hutton Compl. \u00b6 5. Although \"Hutton\" was her married name in 2016, the Chase credit card account was opened in her maiden name, which she had used in 1998 in registering with the NBEO.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hutton alleges that, as a result of her personal information being compromised, she faces an increased risk of identity theft and fraud.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hutton also alleges that she has spent \"time and money putting credit freezes in place with the credit\n   reporting agencies Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Kaeochinda, Hutton's co-plaintiff, is a resident of California.

Mizrahi also alleges that, on about August 27, 2016, a credit monitoring service advised her that her credit score had fallen by eleven points due to a credit card application filed under her name just one day earlier.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On about September 2, 2016, Mizrahi received a letter from Chase bank advising her of steps to be taken to protect her personal information that may have been compromised, but not specifically stating that any such compromise had occurred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at \u00b6 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The motion sought relief pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), for lack of Article III standing to sue, and under Rule 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On November 2, 2016, the NBEO moved to consolidate the two civil actions. By its Opinion of March 22, 2017, the court dismissed both Complaints pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), ruling that it did not possess subject-matter jurisdiction due to the Plaintiffs' lack of standing. The Opinion then concluded that the other grounds for dismissal, as well as the motions to consolidate, were moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Op. 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In dismissing for lack of standing, the court relied primarily on our decision in\n   <em>\n    Beck v.

It first concluded that the Plaintiffs had failed to sufficiently allege that they suffered an injury-in-fact because, even if the NBEO had confirmed an actual data breach, the Plaintiffs had \"incurred no fraudulent charges\" and \"had not been denied credit or been required to pay a higher interest rate for credit they received.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Op. 8. The district court reasoned that the Complaints simply alleged speculative harms that could only occur in the future.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Beck\n   </em>\n   , the Opinion emphasized that the Plaintiffs had \"failed to establish standing either upon their asserted increased risk of identity theft or upon their expenses to negate identity theft.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, the Opinion explained that any alleged injury of the Plaintiffs was not traceable to the NBEO, emphasizing that, \"in all of the cases that have been cited by the parties in the instant cases, an actual data breach had occurred and had been acknowledged or announced by the entity whose data files had been breached.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Op. 7. Elaborating, the Opinion explained that the allegations in the Complaints \"relied upon ... online conversations with other optometrists to conclude that NBEO suffered a data breach.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Opinion then determined that the allegations in the Complaints \"rest[ed] upon sheer speculation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It recited that the Plaintiffs' \"speculation is mistakenly fueled by NBEO's announcements that it was looking into whether an intrusion occurred and that it denies such in fact happened.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In comparing the NBEO's statements denying the data breach to the denials of the other professional optometry organizations, the district court reasoned that the \"Plaintiffs do not explain why NBEO's denial of a data breach is less credible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, the Opinion ruled that the Plaintiffs had \"failed to allege a plausible inferential link\" between providing their personal information to the NBEO and their receipt of unsolicited credit cards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Accordingly, the Opinion dismissed the Hutton and Mizrahi Complaints for lack of Article III standing to sue for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

They primarily argue that the court erred by making factual determinations to support its ruling. More specifically, the Plaintiffs maintain that they made sufficient allegations of injury-in-fact deriving from the NBEO data breach that are not at all speculative. The Plaintiffs argue that, if their allegations had been accepted by the court, their actual and impending injuries flowing from the NBEO's failure to properly protect their personal information were sufficiently alleged. The Plaintiffs also maintain that their injuries are fairly traceable to the NBEO's conduct, because the allegations of the Complaints extensively tie the NBEO to the data breach. The Plaintiffs also assert that the court misapplied the Article III standing requirements by misconstruing our decision in\n   <em>\n    Beck v.

In\n   <em>\n    Beck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   the plaintiffs alleged only a threat of future injury in the data breach context where a laptop and boxes-containing personal information concerning patients, including partial social security numbers, names, dates of birth, and physical descriptions-had been stolen, but the information contained therein had not been misused. The Plaintiffs in these cases, on the other hand, allege that they have already suffered actual harm in the form of identity theft and credit card fraud. The Plaintiffs have been concretely injured by the data breach because the fraudsters used-and attempted to use-the Plaintiffs' personal information to open Chase Amazon Visa credit card accounts without their knowledge or approval. Accordingly, there is no need to speculate on whether substantial harm will befall the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   By way of example, the Hutton Complaint specifies that Hutton received an unsolicited Chase Amazon Visa credit card that was applied for using her social security number and her maiden name (the name that she had provided to the NBEO in 1998). Around the same time, Kaeochinda learned that someone had applied for a Chase credit card using her social security number and former married name. Mizrahi also actually received an alert that her credit score had decreased eleven points due to a credit application that was fraudulently filed with Chase, using her address, social security number, and mother's maiden name. She had to spend time and resources to repair her credit. The Plaintiffs do not allege that they suffered fraudulent charges on their unsolicited Chase Amazon Visa credit cards, but the Supreme Court long ago made clear that \"[i]n interpreting injury in fact ... standing [is] not confined to those who [can] show economic harm.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Hutton and Mizrahi Complaints both allege that the Plaintiffs incurred out-of-pocket costs. And the Plaintiffs also suffered time lost in seeking to respond to fallout from the NBEO data breach. Indeed, they had to purchase credit monitoring services, and they had to notify credit reporting agencies and the IRS of the data breach of their personal information.

With respect to the traceability element, the Court has reasoned that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [t]he injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action, and relief from the injury must be likely to follow from a favorable decision....

The Complaints allege that a group of optometrists from around the country began to notice that fraudulent Chase accounts were being opened in their names in July 2016. For example, in August 2016, Hutton and Kaeochinda received their unsolicited Chase Amazon Visa credit cards. Hutton's fraudulent credit card was applied for in her maiden name-which she had provided to the NBEO eighteen years earlier. Kaeochinda's unsolicited Chase credit card was applied for in her former married name, which she had provided to the NBEO several years earlier. In August 2016, Mizrahi was informed by a credit monitoring service of an effort to open a fraudulent credit card account in her name, using personal information she had previously provided to the NBEO in registering for a professional examination. Notably, the Plaintiffs allege that, amongst the group of optometrists, the NBEO is the only common source that collected and continued to store social security numbers that were required to open a credit card account, and also stored outdated personal information (such as maiden names and former married names) during the relevant time periods. Furthermore, other national optometry organizations do not gather or store Social Security numbers, or have investigated and confirmed that their databases have not been breached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Put simply, the Complaints contained sufficient allegations that the NBEO was a plausible source of the Plaintiffs' personal information. Accordingly, the Complaints\n   contain \"sufficient factual matter\" to render the Plaintiffs' allegations plausible on their face with respect to traceability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277363\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/262/\">\n    848 F.3d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In these circumstances, the standing elements of injury-in-fact and traceability are both sufficiently alleged in the Complaints.
