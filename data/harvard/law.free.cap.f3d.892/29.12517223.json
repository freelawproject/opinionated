Murphy, as that term is used in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207433\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). After careful consideration, we hold that an employee of the IRS \"willfully violates\" a discharge order when the employee knows of the discharge order and takes an intentional action that violates the order. Under \u00a7 7433(e), the IRS's good faith belief that it has a right to collect the purportedly discharged debts is not relevant to determining whether it \"willfully violate[d]\" the discharge order. Because the IRS's actions in this case meet this standard, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 13, 2005, Murphy filed a Chapter 7 petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maine. On Schedule E of his bankruptcy petition, Murphy listed his income tax obligations to the IRS for the years of 1993-1998, 2000, 2001, and 2003, as well as a 2003 tax obligation to the Maine Revenue Services. Murphy's tax obligations were by far the largest liabilities he sought to discharge. In his petition, Murphy listed total liabilities of $601,861.61, of which $546,161.61 were tax obligations. On January 20, 2006, Assistant U.S. Attorney Frederick Emery, Jr. (\"AUSA Emery\") filed an appearance on behalf of the IRS in the bankruptcy proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 14, 2006, the bankruptcy court granted Murphy a discharge. The discharge order, which appears to be a standard form, reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   It appearing that the debtor is entitled to a discharge,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The debtor is granted a discharge under section 727 of title 11, United States Code, (the Bankruptcy Code).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Beneath the bankruptcy judge's signature, there is a notice that states, in bold and capital letters, \"\n   <strong>\n    SEE THE BACK OF THIS ORDER FOR IMPORTANT INFORMATION.\n   </strong>\n   \" The back of the order provides an explanation of bankruptcy discharge in a Chapter 7 case, stating that \"[t]he discharge prohibits any attempt to collect from the debtor a debt that has been discharged.\" The order lists \"[s]ome of the common types of debts which are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   discharged\" and specifically notes that \"[d]ebts for most taxes\" are not discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It does not appear that the IRS objected to Murphy's discharge prior to the bankruptcy court entering its discharge order. On February 16, 2006, the IRS received notice of the discharge order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The IRS did not believe that the discharge relieved Murphy of his tax obligations. Rather, the IRS viewed Murphy's taxes as excepted from discharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C), which excepts from discharge any tax if \"the debtor made a fraudulent return or willfully attempted in any manner to evade or defeat such tax.\" Based on its earlier investigations into Murphy, the IRS believed that Murphy had willfully attempted to evade taxes during all of the years in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   From February 2006 to February 2009, the IRS repeatedly informed Murphy that it did not view his tax obligations as discharged and that it planned to collect what it believed was owed. On February 20, 2009, the IRS issued levies against several insurance companies with which Murphy then did business in an attempt to collect on these tax obligations. Margurite Gagne, a revenue officer for the IRS, signed the levy notices sent to the insurance companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 14, 2009, Murphy filed an adversarial proceeding seeking a declaration that his tax obligations from 1993-1998, 2000, and 2001 had been discharged. In this proceeding, AUSA Emery represented the IRS. According to the IRS, AUSA Emery \"took only minimal discovery in the case\" and failed to submit evidence to the bankruptcy court that the IRS had developed during its investigation into Murphy's tax obligations. Instead, the IRS claims that AUSA Emery merely filed a summary of the IRS's allegations of Murphy's tax evasion, without submitting any admissible evidence to support the allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 22, 2010, the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in Murphy's favor and declared that Murphy's tax obligations had been discharged. The bankruptcy court later noted that it granted summary judgment in large part because the IRS's opposition to summary judgment \"fell far short of applicable substantive and procedural standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    IRS\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Murphy\n   </em>\n   ), No. 05-22363,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206799251\">\n    2013 WL 6799251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Bankr. D. Me. Dec. 20, 2013). The IRS did not appeal the bankruptcy court's 2010 summary judgment ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Subsequently, AUSA Emery was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (\"FTD\"). According to the IRS, symptoms of FTD include \"impairment of executive function, such as the cognitive skill of planning and organizing.\" Based on AUSA Emery's medical records and the opinions of three physicians, the IRS believes that AUSA Emery was already experiencing the symptoms of FTD in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In February 2011, Murphy filed a complaint against the IRS under \u00a7 7433(e), alleging that an employee of the IRS willfully violated the bankruptcy court's 2006 discharge order in February 2009 by issuing levies against the insurance companies with which he did business and thereby attempting to collect on his discharged tax obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IRS responded that it did not willfully violate the order because it reasonably believed his tax obligations were excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(1)(C) based on its investigation into his alleged tax evasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 20, 2013, the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment for Murphy for his \u00a7 7433(e) claim. The court found that the term \"willfully violates\" has an established meaning in the context of violations of automatic stays and discharge orders issued in bankruptcy proceedings: a willful violation occurs \"when, with knowledge of the discharge, [a creditor] intends to take an action, and that action is determined to be an attempt to collect a discharged debt.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206799251\">\n    2013 WL 6799251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. The court further found that the 2010 summary judgment ruling collaterally estopped the IRS from relitigating whether Murphy's tax obligations were discharged, whether the IRS knew they were discharged, and whether it took actions which violated the discharge order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the bankruptcy court denied the IRS's motion for reconsideration, the IRS appealed to the district court, which vacated the bankruptcy court's decision.\n   <em>\n    IRS\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272349\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/96/#p98\">\n    564 B.R. 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 98 (D. Me. 2016). The district court concluded that the bankruptcy court should have considered AUSA Emery's impairment before finding that the 2010 summary judgment ruling collaterally estopped the IRS from relitigating\n   issues related to Murphy's discharge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272349\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/96/#p98\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272349\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/96/#p98\">\n    at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, the district court agreed with the bankruptcy court's definition of \"willfully violates\" as used in \u00a7 7433(e).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272349\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/96/#p98\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272349\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/96/#p98\">\n    at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court found that, by 1998, the term had an established meaning in the context of violations of both automatic stays and discharge injunctions, and under this established meaning, a creditor's \"good faith belief in a right to the property is not relevant to a determination of whether the violation was willful.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272349\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/96/#p98\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Fleet Morg.

The IRS reserved the right:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   for further appeal(s) only its arguments that that [sic] a debtor is not entitled to damages where a creditor's violation of the discharge reflects a reasonable belief that the debt involved was excepted from discharge, and/or that the \"willfully violates\" language in IRS \u00a7 7433(e) should be construed to permit the IRS to defend against liability for violating the discharge on the basis that its employee reasonably believed that the tax involved is excepted from discharge [hereinafter \"the willfully violates issue\"].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As part of the settlement, the IRS agreed to pay $175,000 as Murphy's damages once it had exhausted the reserved right to appeal if the appeal was lost. The settlement did not \"resolve whether or not the deficiencies in in [sic] the United States' response to plaintiff's motion for summary judgment ... were caused by any mental disability of the former Assistant United States Attorney at the time of the summary judgment proceedings.\" Based on this agreement, on January 4, 2017, the bankruptcy court entered final judgment against the United States, and the district court affirmed the judgment on appeal. The IRS timely appeals to this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We are, at this stage, confronted solely with the bankruptcy court's resolution of a legal question, which we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Wilding\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    CitiFinancial Consumer Fin.

The parties' settlement agreement reserved for the IRS the right to appeal only the bankruptcy court's construction of the phrase \"willfully violates\" as used in \u00a7 7433(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The IRS argues it does not \"willfully violate\" an automatic stay or discharge order if it has a good faith belief that its actions do not violate the bankruptcy court's order. In support of its position, the IRS presents two somewhat conflicting arguments. First, it claims that, before Congress enacted \u00a7 7433(e) in 1998, all creditors could raise a good faith defense to allegations that they willfully violated an automatic stay or discharge order. Second, it posits that even if most creditors could not raise a good faith defense, such a defense must be available to the IRS because \u00a7 7433(e) is a waiver of sovereign immunity that must be construed narrowly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We begin our interpretation of \u00a7 7433(e)\"where all such inquiries must begin: with the language of the statute itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Ransom\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    FIA Card Servs., N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5979953,12439772\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/61/\">\n    562 U.S. 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 69,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5979953,3784650,12439772\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/716/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5979953,12439772\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/61/\">\n    178 L.Ed.2d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ron Pair Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031939\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/235/#p241\">\n    489 U.S. 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 241,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031939,6498933\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/109/1026/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031939\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/235/#p241\">\n    103 L.Ed.2d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) ).

By 1998, \"willful violation\" had an established meaning in the context of violations of automatic stays, and this established meaning had been applied to violations of discharge orders. And, by 1998, the Tax Code already allowed the IRS to raise its\n   good faith belief, not as a defense to liability, but as a means of limiting the taxpayer's recovery to the actual damages incurred. Moreover, several of the decisions adopting the generally accepted definition of \"willful violation\" before 1998 applied that definition against the government, despite the government's invocation of sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hardy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7651242,6455053\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/97/1384/\">\n    97 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1390 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Jove Eng'g, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6475353,7638834\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/1539/\">\n    92 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1555-56 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6117748,7417301\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/42/1068/\">\n    42 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1071 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Pinkstaff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513313,6521213\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/974/113/\">\n    974 F.2d at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   When considering the scope of a waiver of sovereign immunity, a \"narrower temporal approach-looking at congressional understanding of the enumerated sections at the time of the [enactment]-is preferable,\" in part because \"the approach adheres to the general principle that Congress is presumed to know the content of background law.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Rivera Torres\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556294\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/432/20/#p25\">\n    432 F.3d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 25 (1st Cir. 2005). By directly linking the phrase \"willfully violates\" in \u00a7 7433(e) to sections 362 and 524, Congress sought to use the generally accepted definition of the phrase \"willful violation\" in this context as the limit to its waiver of sovereign immunity. And, when we look past 1998, our subsequent caselaw and the administrative materials from the IRS itself both confirm that the generally accepted standard should control. For these reasons, we do not believe sovereign immunity requires us to adopt a more narrow definition of \"willfully violates.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The IRS claims that if we apply the generally accepted definition of \"willful violation\" to \u00a7 7433(e), we are effectively forcing it to \"seek a pre-enforcement determination from the bankruptcy court about whether a tax debt has been discharged prior to initiating any post-discharge collection efforts,\" which would be both impractical and inconsistent with other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We agree that \"the IRS need not appear and object in the bankruptcy court to be excepted from [a] discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(1)(C).\"\n   <em>\n    Console\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Comm'r\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=291%20Fed.%20Appx.%20234\">\n    291 Fed.Appx. 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237 (11th Cir. 2008). Nothing in our decision today forces the IRS to obtain a pre-enforcement determination before seeking to collect on tax obligations like Murphy's. The IRS remains free to \"wait until the bankruptcy discharge is invoked as a defense to its collection efforts, and then prove a factual basis for the tax fraud exception in the collection proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=291%20Fed.%20Appx.%20234\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   But, to the extent we find policy considerations relevant, we believe compelling policy justifications, embodied in \u00a7 7433(e), weigh against allowing the IRS to attempt to collect purportedly discharged debts without facing potential consequences.

Congress enacted \u00a7 7433(e) to protect taxpayers who invoked the bankruptcy process, providing them with a means of recovering damages if an employee of the IRS willfully violates either the automatic stay or the discharge order, the two foundational orders of the bankruptcy process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   If the IRS found the February 14, 2006 discharge order ambiguous, there was a variety of processes available to it to determine whether Murphy's tax obligations had been discharged.

And, of course, if AUSA Emery had adequately supported the opposition for summary judgment on dischargeability with admissible evidence back in 2010, the bankruptcy court may well have ruled in the IRS's favor and brought this case to an end years ago, with the IRS facing no penalty for its collection efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Because of the parties' settlement agreement, the factual issues surrounding Murphy's alleged tax evasion and AUSA Emery's cognitive disability are no longer relevant to this case. We agree with the dissent that no judge has found that Murphy did not evade taxes, and we take seriously the allegations against Murphy that the IRS continues to make in its filings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   If we were to adopt the IRS's definition, we would render \u00a7 7433(e) a near nullity. As the bankruptcy court ably described it below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [t]he IRS's position is that, as far as tax collection and \u00a7 523(a)(1)(C) goes, it retains the authority to make up its mind whether tax obligations are discharged, that it may act unilaterally on the basis of its conclusions, and that it encounters no risk for doing so, as long as it has a \"good faith\" or \"reasonable belief\" for its conclusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    In re Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206799251\">\n    2013 WL 6799251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Under this view, it is hard to imagine a case where a taxpayer could ever collect against the government for a violation of the automatic stay or discharge order. Although the dissent forcefully argues that the sovereign immunity canon compels this narrow definition of \"willfully violates,\" we ultimately find that the dissent's position \"presents an unduly restrictiv[e] reading of the congressional waiver of sovereign immunity, rather than a realistic assessment of legislative intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Franconia Assocs.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254644\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/129/#p145\">\n    536 U.S. 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 145,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"156809\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/122/1993/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254644\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/129/#p145\">\n    153 L.Ed.2d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The IRS had several opportunities to obtain a judicial determination that Murphy's tax obligations were excepted from discharge.

When \u00a7 7433(e) was passed in 1998, three circuits had held that a colorable legal position was sufficient to show that a violation of a stay was not willful. These decisions never said that their interpretation of \"willful violation\" in \u00a7 362(h) was affected by the unusual nature of the facts presented. Bankruptcy cases-including this one-often involve unusual facts; the peculiarity of the facts in a couple of the cases involved in the pre-1998 circuit split does not mean that Congress would have interpreted those cases differently or seen a consensus where there was none. The majority argues that\n   <em>\n    In re Nelson\n   </em>\n   was limited to its facts but, even if that were true, its holding that a reasonable legal argument was sufficient to render a violation not willful is irreconcilable with the majority's holding in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Congress's Tax Collection Scheme Is Inconsistent with the Majority View\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The statutory context for the IRS tax collection scheme, which we are required to consider,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SAS Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611230,12611231\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1348/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is also inconsistent with the majority view. I am concerned that that majority holding will cause damage to the tax collection scheme. The practical effect of the decision is to impose damages on the IRS when it initiates collection efforts in the face of a discharge injunction that the IRS reasonably and in good faith determines does not apply. The opinion effectively requires the IRS to first go to court and prove its case that the taxes are owed before instituting any collection efforts. But Congress has decided to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Congress specifically chose\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to require the IRS to first obtain a judicial\n   determination that an exception to discharge applies before engaging in tax debt collection efforts. Section 523(a) holds that certain types of debts, including tax debts \"with respect to which the debtor made a fraudulent return or willfully attempted in any manner to evade or defeat such tax,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   are excepted from a discharge injunction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611230,12611231\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1348/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 523(a)(1)(C). By contrast, \u00a7 523(c)(1) specifies that three particular types of debts are automatically deemed included in a discharge injunction unless or until the creditor initiates a post-injunction adversarial proceeding that yields a judicial determination that the debt is excepted from discharge. Significantly, tax debts are not listed in \u00a7 523(c)(1). This means that Congress chose not to require that the IRS seek a pre-collection determination from the bankruptcy court that tax debts are excepted from a discharge injunction. Given that Congress created this exception to discharge and did not require the IRS to seek a pre-collection determination that tax debts are not dischargeable, there is no reason to say that the IRS should incur the risk of having damages found against it even if it acted on a reasonable and good faith belief that the tax debts were excepted from discharge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   If Congress had intended to require the IRS to seek a pre-collection determination from the bankruptcy court or had intended for the IRS to incur a risk of damages under these circumstances even when it acts reasonably, it would have said so directly.\n   <em>\n    Epic Sys.

And even under \u00a7 7430, a victorious taxpayer is not treated as a \"prevailing party,\" and so is unable to recover litigation costs against the IRS, if the IRS's litigation position was \"substantially justified.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207430\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 7430(c)(4)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Contrary to the majority's assertion, the IRS cannot mitigate the damages it is\n   forced to pay to the taxpayer under the majority's interpretation of \u00a7 7433(e) by showing a substantial justification for its position under \u00a7 7430(c)(4)(B). Section 7430 only covers \"litigation and administrative costs,\" so having a substantially justified position does not allow the IRS to mitigate the \u00a7 7433(e) damages the majority would force it to pay. Parties are routinely required to cover their own costs; \u00a7 7430's cost-shifting provision has no bearing on \u00a7 7433(e) damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   It is not true, as the majority posits, that adopting the IRS's definition of \"willfully violates\" \"would render \u00a7 7433(e) a near nullity.\" Adopting the IRS's definition would only free it to collect tax debts that it reasonably believes are not covered by a discharge injunction or automatic stay. If the IRS were to collect other types of tax debts not exempted from discharge by \u00a7 523, that would present a different issue under \u00a7 7433(e), which is not before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The majority appears skeptical that courts would ever find that the IRS has violated the reasonableness requirement. Several bodies of law instruct courts to inquire into the reasonableness of an actor's behavior, including torts,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 282 (1965), and administrative law,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nat.

The use of a reasonableness standard in those areas does not render the relevant statutes near nullities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In my view, the intent of Congress is clearly not to waive sovereign immunity in these circumstances. But even if there were ambiguity, that ambiguity itself would require that we find no waiver of sovereign immunity.

Cases from the 2000s do not help us determine how Congress would have understood a phrase in 1998. Even so, there is no consensus on the definition of \"willful\" in the \u00a7 524 discharge injunction context. The Ninth Circuit has held that a good faith belief that one is not violating a discharge injunction is sufficient to show that there was no \"willful violation\" of the discharge injunction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lorenzen\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Taggert\n    </em>\n    (\n    <em>\n     In re Taggert\n    </em>\n    ),\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516699\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/438/#p444\">\n     888 F.3d 438\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 444 (9th Cir. 2018).

A citation to the current Manual does not tell us how Congress would have interpreted \"willfully violates\" in 1998. As the majority concedes, the Manual does not even have the force of law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    The majority attempts to deny the existence of this circuit split by pointing to a handful of lower and Article I court cases that are not in accordance with the precedent of their respective circuits.

The First, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits had held that mere knowledge of a stay was insufficient to show a \"willful violation.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    The majority similarly argues that Congress would have ignored these cases when drafting \u00a7 7433(e) because they lack \"a broader analysis of the meaning of 'willful violation.' \" First, many of the circuit cases adopting the majority's favored definition of \"willful violation\" also provide little analysis.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Price\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    (\n    <em>\n     In re Price\n    </em>\n    ),\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6117748,7417301\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/42/1068/\">\n     42 F.3d 1068\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1071 (7th Cir. 1994) ;\n    <em>\n     Goichman\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Bloom\n    </em>\n    (\n    <em>\n     In re Bloom\n    </em>\n    ),\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6503435,10527988\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/224/\">\n     875 F.2d 224\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 227 (9th Cir. 1989). Second, that the analysis may have been limited in these three cases is irrelevant. Three circuits had held that a colorable legal argument was sufficient to show that a violation was not \"willful\" under \u00a7 362(h).
