She had at the time of her decease twenty cousins, all on the Farmer side, and about one hundred and twenty-nine children of her mother\u2019s cousins ; twenty-nine of them of the Kimball blood, and the others of the Collins blood, who were her nearest relatives on her mother\u2019s side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-10\">Her cousins on the Farmer, side and the children of her mother\u2019s cousins resided in different parts of the country, and some of her cousins and most of the children of her mother\u2019s cousins were personally unknown to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-11\">The specific devises and bequests of the will given to individuals by name were mostly the relatives on the mother\u2019s side \u2014 one on the father\u2019s side, and some to strangers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-12\">The specified real estate given by the will to \"the mother\u2019s cousins\u2019 children on the Kimball side\u201d was about equal to that given \"unto cousins excepting the children of Daniel Farmer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-13\">In conclusion she gave as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-14\">\"I give, bequeath and devise unto my cousins and to the children of my mother\u2019s cousins all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal or mixed, wheresoever found or however situated, to be divided equally between them after the payment of my just debts and legacies.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-15\">The real estate remaining to be disposed of under this clause is of the value of about twelve or thirteen thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-16\">The plaintiffs claim as cousins of the deceased on the Farmer side, and the defendants as children of her mother\u2019s cousins.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-17\">A copy of the will is to be made a part of the case.

The defendants contend that the cousins and the children of the mother\u2019s cousins take per <em>capita </em>in equal shares.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-11\">The counsel for the petitioners make the following suggestions as favoring and tending to sustain their construction of said clause in the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-12\">1. The -word \"between\u201d is not appropriately or commonly used to signify a division or distribution <em>\"among\u201d </em>more than two individuals or classes. If the testatrix had intended that the residue of her estate should go in equal shares to the individuals answering to the two general descriptions named, the usual and proper word to show that intention would have been <em>\"among,\u201d </em>and not <em>\"between.\u201d </em>This argument, however, standing alone, cannot be regarded as <em>conclusive; </em>for the word \"between,\u201d when the general intention appears to require it, has been sometimes held to have the same sense as <em>\"among.\u201d Williams </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>1 C. P. Cooper, 177; <em>Dowding </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>3 Beav. 541.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-13\">2. No individuals are named here as the objects of the testatrix\u2019 bounty; from which it is to be fairly inferred that she had in mind the two classes as representing, one the father\u2019s, and the other the mother\u2019s side of the <em>family; </em>that she regarded each class collectively as entitled to one etjual share of the residue of her estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-14\">3. The residue is given <em>unto </em>my cousins <em>and to </em>the children of my mother\u2019s cousins; the repetition of the word <em>to </em>or <em>unto </em>before the second of the two classes or descriptions of persons has been regarded as an indication that the intention was to give equally <em>\"between\u201d </em>the two classes or descriptions of persons, and not equally <em>\"among\u201d </em>the persons of which they are composed \u2014 that <em>classes </em>and not <em>individuals </em>were contemplated in the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-15\"><em>4. </em>The fact that the estate was derived partly on the father\u2019s side and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>partly on the mother\u2019s side and nearly equally from each, after deducting the several individual legacies and devises to relatives on the mother\u2019s side, is not to be overlooked in searching for the intention of the testatrix. She would naturally feel inclined to divide her estate between her relatives on the two sides in reference to the source from which it had been derived, regarding not individuals but the relatives on one side as representing the father\u2019s side, and the relatives on the other side as representing the mother\u2019s side of the family.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-5\">5. The testatrix evidently bore in mind, throughout the will, the claims of her relatives on the <em>two sides </em>as <em>two classes, </em>one representing her father and the other her mother. This idea pervades the whole will. One specific devise is made to the children of her mother\u2019s cousins on the Kimball side without naming any of them; another specific d\u00e9vise is made to her cousins, who, <em>when the </em>uncle is included instead of his children, represent the father\u2019s side. In these cases there is no room for doubt, that she regarded the <em>classes </em>and not the individuals, and it is fair to infer that she had the same intention when she speaks of the same classes or relatives in the residuary clause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-6\">\u00ab 6. Mother\u2019s cousins\u2019 children were her'nearest relatives on the mother\u2019s side, and, after excepting Daniel Farmer, cousins were her nearest relatives on the father\u2019s side. Mother\u2019s cousins\u2019 children, regarded as individuals, were not so nearly related to the testatrix as cousins; and, as individuals, cannot be supposed to have had so strong claims on the testatrix\u2019 bounty. If she had had only cousins and children of mother\u2019s cousins, the cousins, under the statute of distributions, would have taken all. But the children of mother\u2019s cousins, though more remote, were her nearest relatives on the mother\u2019s side, and when she looked for a <em>class </em>to represent the mother\u2019s side, they were the next of kin and the legal and proper representatives of that side of the family. We may thence infer that the gift was made to the children of the mother\u2019s cousins on the one side in their representative and collective and <em>not </em>individual character, and so of the cousins ; and that she meant to give one half to one class as representing her father\u2019s side, and the other half to the other class as representing the mother\u2019s side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-7\">7. To <em>settle </em>the construction of the residuary clause, we must look to the whole will to discover what was the real intention of the testatrix ; and this intention roust control technical and arbitrary rules, which would otherwise prevent the real intention from being carried into effect. Following this maxim and looking to the language of the residuary clause and the other provisions of fhe will in connection with the condition and origin of the estate and the family relatives of the testatrix, we submit that the children of the mother\u2019s cousins <em>as a class, </em>will take one half of the residue, and the cousins, as the <em>other class, </em>the other half.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-8\">8. We would further suggest that, upon the construction contended for by the defendants\u2019 counsel, the children of the mother\u2019s cousins representing the mother\u2019s side would take about thirteen fifteenths of the whole .twelve or fifteen thousand dollars worth of residuary estate, while the cousins, representing the father\u2019s side, would take only the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>two </em>fifteenth parts thereof, and the mother\u2019s cousins\u2019 children, of the Collins blood, from whose ancestors none of the testatrix\u2019 estate was ever derived, would take ten fifteenths of the residuary estate. We submit that upon all the facts, this could not have been the intention of the testatrix.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-5\"><em>I. A. Eastman, </em>for petitionees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b439-6\">Bartlett, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1r\">If, in this case, the residue of the estate had been given to the cousins and the children of the mother\u2019s .cousins, to be equally divided among them, the devisees would have taken <em>per capita, </em>unless something in the will indicated a different intention on the part of the testatrix. 2 Jarm. *111, and n., (Perkins Ed.;) <em>Blacker v.

Blackmere, </em>10 Simons 626; <em>Warrington v. Warrington, 2 </em>Hare 54; <em>Williams v. Yates, </em>1 C. P.

McMaster, </em>10 Gratt. 275; <em>Brown v. Ramsey, 7 </em>Gill 347; or, by the fact that the devisees are not each named individually, Blackler <em>v. Webb, </em>2 P. Wms. 383; Lee <em>v. Lee, </em>39 Barb. 173; <em>Roper v. Roper, </em>5 Jones Eq. 17; and from many of the cases already cited it appears that a difference in the degree, of kinship like that in the present case will not prevent the application of the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">It is unnecessary to determine whether the mere fact of the prior mention in the will of the devisees as classes is to be regarded as a sufficient indication of an intention so to treat them in a subsequent clause; see <em>Gilliam </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>3 Jones Eq. 102; <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>3 Ib. 205; <em>Pardue </em>v. <em>Givens, 1 </em>Ib. 312; <em>Low </em>v. <em>Carter, 2 </em>Ib. 378; <em>Bivens </em>v. <em>Phifer, </em>2 Jones (Law) 436; though perhaps in several such cases it will be found that other circumstances aided in the conclusion, for here such a rule would fail to support the claim of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>petitioners. The will contains no prior general division of the legatees into two classes, of which the cousins are to form one, and the children of the mother\u2019s cousins the other. In <em>the </em>devise to the cousins the children of Daniel are excepted, while he takes a share equal to that of each of the other devisees; and the children of the mother\u2019s cousins are not made devisees as a class, for the numerous children of the Collins blood are not included in the fifth clause of the will. See Doe v. <em>Joinville, 3 East. 175.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">But little stress can be laid on the facts as to the sources of the property; see <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>29 N. H. 453 ; and besides no general intent to distribute the property among the, representatives of the branches from which it was derived can be inferred, for the numerous children of the cousins of the Collins blood take under the residuary clause; and no general intent to divide the property equally between the paternal and maternal branches of the family of the testatrix can be inferred, because these Collins cousins are not included in the fifth clause of the will. In general, where a class are intended to take as representing</p>\n<p id=\"Afl\">some person, they take together in his stead; <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>18 Pick. 162; <em>Bretton </em>v. <em>Lithulier, </em>2 Vernon 653; <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Hanbury, </em>3 Ves. 260, (Sumner\u2019s note;) <em>Mattison </em>v. <em>Tanfield, </em>3 Beavan 132; <em>Miller\u2019s Appeal, 35 </em>Penn. 323; <em>Ortt\u2019s Appeal, </em>Ib. 267 ; <em>Fissell\u2019s Appeal, </em>27 Penn. 55 ; <em>Alder </em>v. <em>Beall, </em>11 G. &amp; I. 123 ; <em>Bpiney </em>v. <em>Bpiney, </em>2 Ird. Eq. 103; <em>Levering </em>v. <em>Levering, </em>14 Md. 30 ; <em>Bool </em>v. <em>Mix, </em>17 Wend. 119 ; but here is nothing sufficiently indicative of an intention of the testatrix that the cousins should take as representatives of any one in the paternal branch, or the children of the mother\u2019s cousins as representing any of her family, and therefore the devisees take in their own right. <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Bradbury, </em>2 Vernon 705 ; <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Hanbury, </em>3 Vesey 260, Sumner\u2019s Note; <em>JSTorthey </em>v. <em>Strange, </em>1 P.
