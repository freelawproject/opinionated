He challenges the district court\u2019s application of a two-level bodily injury enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(A) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, contending that the court erred in concluding that his objection to the enhancement was both untimely and without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">In the pre-dawn hours on January 15, 2012, four masked men, including Aguilar-Ibarra, entered a Florida warehouse brandishing replica semi-automatic pistols. The intruders bound, gagged, and then forced a warehouse employee into a back office, where they assaulted him and secured him to a chair with duct tape. One of the assailants then used a warehouse forklift to load over half a million dollars\u2019 worth of cellular phones into a truck that had been stolen from a nearby business.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">Aguilar-Ibarra\u2019s presentence investigation report (PSR) calculated a total offense level of 27, which included a two-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(A) because a victim of the robbery had sustained bodily injury. In support of that enhancement, the PSR indicated that the warehouse employee \u201cwas taken to the hospital for minor injuries\u201d as a result of the assault. Aguilar-Ibarra\u2019s total offense level, when coupled with his criminal history category of I, yielded a sentencing guidelines range of 70 to 87 months imprisonment. Aguilar-Ibarra did not file any written objections to the PSR within the 14-day period prescribed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-17\">At sentencing, defense counsel objected to the bodily injury enhancement, asserting that she and the government had agreed that the enhancement should not apply because there was no evidence that the warehouse employee had sustained any bodily injuries, and because it had not been applied at the sentencing of Aguilar-Ibarra\u2019s co-conspirators. The government\u2019s attorney, laboring under the mistaken impression that the two-level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>enhancement required proof of serious bodily injury, confirmed that \u201cthe victim did not sustain a serious bodily injury.\u201d The district court, after recounting the factual allegations in the PSR and emphasizing that the two-level enhancement did not require the presence of serious bodily injury, asked the parties whether they disputed the PSR\u2019s statement that the warehouse employee had sustained minor injuries and was taken to the hospital. The government initially responded that it had \u201cno evidence that there were bodily injuries,\u201d but quickly clarified that it had no evidence of \u201cthe extent of those injuries\u201d and that it did not dispute that the victim had suffered minor injuries. Defense counsel similarly stated that she was not disputing the factual allegations in the PSR, though she was unable to ascertain the nature of the victim\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The district court then questioned the probation officer about the source of the information included in the PSR. The probation officer responded that the government had provided that information and that he was \u201cfamiliar with the related case\u201d against Aguilar-Ibarra\u2019s co-conspirators because he \u201ccovered [their] sentencing hearing.\u201d The probation officer also clarified that the co-conspirators had indeed received the bodily injury enhancement at sentencing. Defense counsel conceded that she misunderstood what occurred at the co-conspirator\u2019s sentence hearing and stated that she had \u201cnothing further\u201d on the enhancement issue. The court then overruled Aguilar-Ibarra\u2019s objection as both \u201cuntimely\u201d and \u201cwithout merit.\u201d After adopting the PSR in full, the court sentenced Aguilar-Ibarra to a total term of 87 months imprisonment. When asked whether he had any objections to the court\u2019s factual findings and sentence, Aguilar-Ibarra replied, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Aguilar-Ibarra contends that the district court erred in rejecting his objection to the bodily injury enhancement as untimely. He asserts that the time limit for filing objections to the PSR was inapplicable in this case because he and the government agreed that the enhancement should not apply, and, in any event, the court exercised its discretion to waive the timeliness requirement when it considered and ruled on the merits of his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Rule 32(f)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that \u201c[w]ithin 14 days after receiving the [PSR], the parties must state in writing any objections, including objections to material information, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy statements contained in or omitted from the report.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(f)(1). After receiving any written objections from the parties, the probation officer \u201cmay meet with the parties to discuss the objections,\u201d \u201cinvestigate further,\u201d and \u201crevise the presentence report as appropriate.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(f)(3). At least seven days before sentencing, the probation officer must submit the PSR to the court along with \u201can addendum containing any unresolved objections, the grounds for those objections, and the probation officer\u2019s comments on them.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(g). For good cause shown, however, the district court may extend the 14-day deadline for filing objections to the PSR, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b)(2), or \u201callow a party to make a new objection at any time before sentence is imposed,\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(l)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Aguilar-Ibarra did not comply with the 14-day deadline for objecting to the contents of the PSR, and there is no merit to his contention that the deadline was inapplicable because the parties agreed that the bodily injury enhancement should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>not apply. Aguilar-Ibarra takes the position that the procedures mandated by Rule 32(f) are simply designed to \u201cresolve disputes between the parties\u201d and that it is therefore unnecessary to submit written objections in advance of sentencing \u201cto correct an undisputed error in the [PSR].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Rule 32(f)(1), however, clearly provides that all objections to the PSR, whether or not they are shared by the parties, must be submitted in writing well in advance of sentencing. And the manifest purpose of Rule 32 as a whole, of which the procedures and deadlines mandated by subsection (f) are an integral part, is not simply to resolve disputes between the parties; it is to ensure that the district court can meaningfully exercise its sentencing authority based on a complete and accurate account of all relevant information. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c) \u2014 (f) (mandating the preparation and submission of a PSR in advance of sentencing so that a district court can \u201cmeaningfully exercise its sentencing authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\u201d); Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 advisory committee notes (1975) (explaining that because \u201cpresentence reports are important aids in sentencing,\u201d it is \u201cessential that the presentence report be completely accurate in every material respect\u201d). The deadlines imposed by subsection (f) are meant to facilitate this process by ensuring that the probation officer has an adequate opportunity to investigate and resolve any potential inaccuracies in the PSR, regardless of whether those inaccuracies are perceived by one or both parties. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 advisory committee notes (1994). Aguilar-Ibarra\u2019s position not only runs counter to the clear import of Rule 32(f)(1), but also ignores two fundamental, intertwined tenets of sentencing law \u2014 that a district court has an independent obligation - to \u201ccalculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines,\u201d <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted), and that it is therefore \u201cnot bound by the parties\u2019 agreements or recommendations\u201d at sentencing, <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>132 F.3d 628, 630 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Although it is certainly true that the district court had the discretion to waive the timeliness requirement for good cause, Aguilar-Ibarra did not show cause for failing to timely raise his objection to the bodily injury enhancement, and the district court did not exercise its discretion to waive the timeliness requirement. The court expressly overruled Aguilar-Ibarra\u2019s objection as untimely, and although it alternatively addressed the merits of that objection, the court \u201cnever indicated that it would excuse the [timeliness requirement] and decide the [ ] issue solely on the merits.\u201d <em>See United States v. Milian-Rodriguez, </em>828 F.2d 679, 683 (11th Cir.1987) (district court\u2019s decision to deny a suppression motion both on timeliness grounds and on the merits did not excuse the untimeliness of the motion where the district court \u201cnever indicated that it would excuse the waiver and decide the [ ] issue solely on the merits\u201d). The district court did not err in overruling Aguilar-Ibarra\u2019s objection to the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(A) enhancement as untimely. For that reason, we treat the matter as if no objection had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Aguilar-Ibarra argues that the district court erred in applying the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(A) enhancement because there was no evidence that the robbery victim sustained any bodily injury, and the government purportedly conceded the absence of such evidence at sentencing. He also argues that even if the district court could rely solely on the factual allegations contained in the PSR, those allegations do not support a finding of bodily injury, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>defined by the guidelines, because the PSR did not describe the precise nature of the victim\u2019s injuries or specify that they were of a type that ordinarily would require medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">As we have discussed, because Aguilar-Ibarra did not file a timely objection to the bodily injury enhancement, and because the district court did not waive the applicable time limit for good cause shown, we review the present claim for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Parrish, </em>427 F.3d 1345, 1346 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[W]e review for plain error those issues to which the defendant did not make timely objections in the district court.\u201d). Under plain error review, Aguilar-Ibarra bears the \u201cburden of establishing that (1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting his substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Bedeles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 842 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks and brackets omitted). \u201cBefore an error is subject to correction under the plain error rule, it must be plain under controlling precedent or in view of the unequivocally clear words of a statute or rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Schmitz, </em>634 F.3d 1247, 1270-71 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Section 2B3.1 of the sentencing guidelines, which governs robbery offenses, imposes varying degrees of enhancements if \u201cany victim sustained bodily injury.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3). The guidelines call for a two-level enhancement in the event of \u201c[b]odily [i]njury,\u201d a four-level enhancement for \u201c[s]erious [bjodily [i]njury,\u201d and a six-level enhancement for \u201c[permanent or [l]ife-[t]hreatening [b]odily [i]njury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Bodily injured is defined by the guidelines as \u201cany significant injury; <em>e.g., </em>an injury that is painful and obvious, or is of a type for which medical attention ordinarily would be sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.1, cmt. n.1(B). When a defendant challenges one of the factual bases of his sentence, the government must prove the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>572 F.3d 878, 887 (11th Cir.2009). A district court may, however, base its factual findings on undisputed statements in the PSR, because a defendant is deemed to have admitted any such statements that he has not objected to \u201cwith specificity and clarity.\u201d <em>Bedeles, </em>565 F.3d at 843-44 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cIndeed, the defendant\u2019s failure to object to conclusory statements in the [PSR] renders those statements undisputed and permits the sentencing court to rely upon them without error even if there is an absence of supporting evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Although Aguilar-Ibarra argued at sentencing that there was no evidence that the warehouse employee had sustained any bodily injuries, he did not dispute the PSR\u2019s factual statements that the employee suffered minor injuries as result of being assaulted and was taken to the hospital for those injuries. In fact, when the district court pointedly asked both parties whether they disputed that portion of the PSR, they affirmatively stated that they did not. Because Aguilar-Ibarra did not specifically and clearly object to these factual statements contained in the PSR, he is deemed to have admitted them and the district court was entitled to rely on them even in the absence of supporting evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 843-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">And based on the undisputed facts in the PSR that the victim was assaulted by multiple masked men brandishing replica firearms and then transported to the hospital with minor injuries, the district court did not plainly err in concluding that the vie-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>tim sustained a bodily injury within the meaning of the guidelines. The court could have reasonably inferred from these undisputed facts that the victim\u2019s injuries were either \u201cpainful and obvious\u201d or \u201cof a type for which medical attention ordinarily would be sought.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, cmt. n.l(B). Aguilar-Ibarra has not cited any controlling precedent from this circuit or the Supreme Court holding otherwise, and the fact that the PSR did not specifically describe the nature of the \u201cminor injuries\u201d sustained by the victim does not render the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2B3.1 (b)(3)(A) enhancement plainly erroneous. We therefore affirm Aguilar-Ibarra\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
