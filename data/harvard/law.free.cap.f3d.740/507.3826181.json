R.App. P. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-20\">The petitions for rehearing en banc are DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>GOULD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Apz\">concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">I respectfully file this separate concurrence in the denial order. In my view, the opinion and partial dissent fairly present the key issues in this appeal, and the denial order should be read with the majority opinion\u2019s reasoning in mind. But in light of the views of my dissenting colleagues, I offer supplemental observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">First, the dissent is riddled with overstatements. For example, it claims that California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (\u201cLCFS\u201d) \u2014 and the ethanol provisions contained therein \u2014 explicitly discriminates against other states and is a \u201cprotectionist regulatory scheme that threatens to Bal-kanize our national economy.\u201d Dissent at 512. Not only is this mere alarmist rhetoric, it also does not fit the reality of the California legislation. Moreover, although the dissent trumpets that nine states seek rehearing, the converse is that 41 do not. And some states, like Washington and Oregon, have already joined California in its endeavor to combat global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fuels. Finally, the dissent characterizes the LCFS as an extraterritorial regulation, and argues that the majority\u2019s position to the contrary contravenes Supreme Court precedent. This is an incorrect view of the law: California is free to regulate commerce <em>within </em>its borders even if it has an ancillary goal of influencing the choices of actors in other states. <em>See Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am. v. Walsh, </em>538 U.S. 644, 669, 123 S.Ct. 1855, 155 L.Ed.2d 889 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Second, the dissent is written as if the majority opinion conclusively determined that the LCFS was above constitutional reproach. It begins, for example, by accusing the majority of \u201cupholding California\u2019s ethanol regulations.\u201d Dissent at 512. It later repeats this charge. <em>See </em>Dissent at 515. We did no such thing. Believing that findings of fact and more proceedings in the district court were needed to determine the LCFS\u2019s constitutionality, we remanded. All we did, in other words, was to reject the argument that the LCFS\u2019s ethanol provisions facially discriminate against out-of-state commerce. Our remand advises the district court to determine \u201cwhether the Fuel Standard\u2019s ethanol provisions discriminate in purpose or in practical effect.\u201d <em>Rocky Mtn. Farmers Union v. Corey, </em>730 F.3d 1070, 1078 (9th Cir.2013). And we instructed the district court to apply strict scrutiny to those provisions if it found that they did discriminate, or to apply the balancing test set forth in <em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </em>397 U.S. 137, 90 S.Ct. 844, 25 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970), if it found that they did not. <em>Rocky Mtn. Farmers Union, </em>730 F.3d at 1078. The dissent acknowledges our remand, but it rhetorically argues that the remand has a \u201cpredestined\u201d outcome, Dissent at 514, because of our statement that the LCFS incorporates state boundaries for \u201cgood and non-discriminatory\u201d reasons, <em>Rocky Mtn. Farmers Union, </em>730 F.3d at 1107. There is a simple response to this critique, which has no legal merit: We reviewed this case at the summary judgment stage. As such, we had to take as true all facts presented by California and reasonable inferences therefrom. Our statement, then, about good and non-discriminatory reasons for incorporating state boundaries into the LCFS methodology is based on evidence that had to be credited at the summary judgment stage. It will not control what the district court decides on remand as it considers the LCFS\u2019s purpose and effect and makes factual findings on disputed evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Similarly, the dissent asserts that our opinion \u201cnullifies\u201d constitutional limitations on states\u2019 ability to legislate in ways that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>affect other states. Dissent at 513. I disagree. If the LCFS in purpose or practical effect discriminates against interstate commerce, such limitations still exist in the form of strict scrutiny. And even if it does not discriminate, the <em>Pike </em>balancing test imposes its own limitations on states\u2019 ability to legislate in this arena.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Third, the dissent argues that the LCFS\u2019s ethanol provisions facially discriminate against out-of-state commerce by drawing lines based on state borders, and that strict scrutiny therefore applies to invalidate the law. I disagree. For the reasons stated in the majority opinion, I believe that California made its geographic distinctions based on the carbon impact and intensity of various fuels, not on their state-of-origin. True, the LCFS does attribute different carbon intensity values to fuels from different geographic areas. Cal.Code Regs. tit. 17, \u00a7 95486(b). But the dissent\u2019s argument that it is \u201cclear that the challenged regulations discriminate against interstate commerce\u201d is wide of the mark. Dissent at 21. A legislative geographic distinction is not facially discriminatory merely because it affects in-state and out-of-state interests unequally. Rather, as long as there is \u201csome reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently,\u201d California may distinguish between Midwestern, Brazilian, and California ethanols. <em>Philadelphia v. New Jersey, </em>437 U.S. 617, 627, 98 S.Ct. 2531, 57 L.Ed.2d 475 (1978). The dissent disregards this principle. To the extent that California treats fuels based on their location, it does so for non-discriminatory reasons; if Midwestern ethanol is more carbon-intensive than its California counterpart, that is so not because of its origin but rather because of its method of production and other objective factors, including transportation-related emissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Further, the pathways set forth in the LCFS \u2014 and reproduced at the end of the majority opinion in Appendix One \u2014 are not immutable legislative classifications. They are default pathways, and while they may be relied upon by producers, they may also be supplanted if a producer creates an individualized pathway by supplying its own data about the carbon emission impact of its product. This allows ethanol producers in California and elsewhere some control over the carbon intensity value assigned to their fuels. And it shows that the dissent\u2019s position that the LCFS facially discriminates is incorrect. The LCFS\u2019s ethanol provisions are based on an objective fact, carbon emissions, not on the constitutionally impermissible goal of benefit-ting local companies at the expense of foreign ones. Such a system does not warrant strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The dissent notes that \u201cthe Fuel Standard expressly assigns a higher carbon intensity to Midwestern ethanol.\u201d Dissent at 516. In fact, however, the lowest carbon intensity values yet \u2014 supplied by producers who went outside the default pathways to provide their own data \u2014 are from Midwestern and Brazilian ethanol producers. <em>See </em>Cal.Code Regs. tit. 17, \u00a7 95486(b)(1); <em>Rocky Mtn. Farmers Union, </em>730 F.3d at 1084. This is so largely because the LCFS takes into account carbon emissions from transportation, and most California ethanol producers import corn from the Midwest to make their product, whereas Midwestern ethanol produc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>ers, who have corn close by, avoid those transportation emissions. The geographic distinctions made by California, then, are not classifications based on state boundaries <em>per se; </em>rather, they are classifications based on the carbon impact of fuels as calculated under a rubric that considers transportation-related emissions. That does not warrant strict scrutiny unless the district court concludes that the LCFS discriminates against out-of-state commerce in purpose or practical effect. That is why we remanded with instructions to consider such purpose and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Fourth, the tone and substance of the dissent is perhaps aimed at encouraging Supreme Court review. A petition for writ of certiorari from the parties who sought rehearing is likely forthcoming, but our court properly declines to give its judicial imprimatur to the dissent\u2019s position. Because Supreme Court review is possible, however, I set forth my own views on that prospect. On the one hand, the Supreme Court\u2019s considered judgment could be helpful to clarify as soon as practical what states may do of their own accord to deter or slow global warming. The Supreme Court, if it wants to do so at this time, can set constitutional limits, binding in all circuits, as to what the individual states in our Union may do to combat global warming. The Supreme Court also can give meaning to, or limit, the general principle that state experimentation is often a desirable predicate to actions by other states or the federal government. On the other hand, the record in this case is incomplete and thus unsuitable for understanding the full scope of the issues presented. The panel remanded for findings on discriminatory purpose or effect which, if it exists, would invoke strict scrutiny. And, if not, the majority required on remand that the district court engage in <em>Pike </em>balancing, weighing the LCFS\u2019s benefits against its impact on interstate competition. The issues raised by the dissent, then, may be rendered moot by the district court\u2019s decision, and in any event there will be a more complete record, including findings on purpose and effect, on which to make a ruling about the controlling legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Fifth, the dissent contends that California admits its scheme will, by itself, have little effect in averting environmental catastrophe. Dissent at 516-17. This argument ignores not only the principle that incremental change, when aggregated, can be significant, but also the possibility that successful experimentation by California could lead to broader action by other states and/or the federal government. The Supreme Court has reminded us that it is \u201cerroneous\u201d to assume that \u201ca small, incremental step, because it is incremental\u201d is legally \u2014 or truly \u2014 insignificant. <em>Massachusetts v. EPA </em>549 U.S. 497, 524, 127 S.Ct. 1438, 167 L.Ed.2d 248 (2007). Just as a journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step, so too must legislative action to fight global warming start somewhere. Further, once other states appreciate the benefits of the LCFS, there may be a cascade of similar laws throughout the country \u2014 and perhaps federal action\u2014 aimed at stemming the tide of global warming. Indeed, proposed legislation in Oregon and Washington is an example of this. <em>See Rocky Mtn. Farmers Union, </em>730 F.3d at 1104 n. 14; Michael Wines, <em>Climate Pact Is Signed by S States and Partner, </em>N.Y. Times, Oct. 30, 2013, at A18 (noting an agreement between California, Oregon, and Washington, as well as British Columbia, to \u201craise the cost of greenhouse gas pollution, promote zero-emission vehicles and push for the use of cleaner-burning fuels in transportation\u201d as part of a \u201cbroad alliance to combat climate change\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Meanwhile, global temperatures are increasing, storms are intensifying, polar ice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>caps are melting, and seas are rising. If California\u2019s experiment with the LCFS is to succeed in inducing increased production of alternative fuels and/or decreased carbon impact of existing fuels, the sooner it can proceed, the better; it could take years, or decades, for other states to recognize the benefits of the LCFS, to react to it, and to engage in similar experiments themselves. Justice Brand\u00e9is recognized the importance of this sort of state experimentation in his now-famous dissent in <em>New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, </em>when he wrote: \u201cIt is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\u201d 285 U.S. 262, 311, 52 S.Ct. 371, 76 L.Ed. 747 (1932) (Brand\u00e9is, J., dissenting). This is what California has done with the LCFS. The benefits that may flow from such cooperative state action do not, as the dissent urges, threaten to \u201cBalkanize our national economy.\u201d Dissent at 512. Rather, the development of alternative fuels and a market system regulating carbon emissions would likely benefit the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Sixth, the dissent\u2019s argument that California\u2019s \u201ceconomic clout\u201d means that the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of the LCFS is to regulate commerce beyond California\u2019s borders misstates the law. Dissent at 517-18. In fact, Supreme Court precedent points in a contrary direction. <em>See, e.g., Walsh, </em>538 U.S. at 669, 123 S.Ct. 1855 (refusing to apply the extraterritoriality doctrine to a law that \u201cdoes not regulate the price of any out-of-state transaction, either by its express terms or by its inevitable effect\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). While a state may not mandate compliance with its preferred policies in wholly out-of-state transactions, it may regulate commerce within its boundaries even if one of its goals is to influence the out-of-state choices of market participants. <em>See id. </em>This is what California permissibly has done with the LCFS.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">A majority of active judges on our court wisely refused to grant en banc consideration in this case. I concur in the order denying rehearing en banc.</p>\n<author id=\"b566-8\">M. SMITH, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-5\">. The dissent\u2019s insistence that strict scrutiny should be applied to the regulatory provisions here, absent a finding of discriminatory purpose or effect, is a type of \"archaic formalism\u201d that should not be encouraged by the Supreme Court. <em>Rocky Mtn. Fanners Union, </em>730 F.3d at 1107. In my view, the Supreme Court has not applied strict scrutiny to provisions like those in the LCFS based on a theory of facial discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b566-5\">. If the dissent's position were adopted, it would spell the end of much beneficent state legislation. Let us assume, for example, that a safety-conscious state regulates automobiles, preventing them from being sold in that state absent certain safety protections like airbags or a performance standard requiring a minimum survival rate from a crash at 40 miles per hour. The dissent apparently would say that the safety-conscious state is regulating extraterritorially because its restrictions provide incentives to automakers in other states to make their cars safer if they wish to sell them in the safety-conscious state. I respectfully disagree. The Supreme Court has not said anything to that effect, and, as explained above, its precedent points in the opposite direction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"AK6\">with whom O\u2019SCANNLAIN, CALLAHAN, BEA, IKUTA, and N.R. SMITH, Circuit Judges, join, and with whom MURGUIA, Circuit Judge, joins as to Part III, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">In upholding California\u2019s ethanol regulations, the 2-1 majority in this case finds at least facially constitutional a protectionist regulatory scheme that threatens to Bal-kanize our national economy. In so doing, the majority disregards longstanding dormant Commerce Clause doctrine, and places the law of this circuit squarely at odds with Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">The deleterious effects of California\u2019s scheme on our national economic union are not speculative. The states of Nebraska, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, and South Dakota <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>(which are major producers of corn and ethanol) filed an amicus brief in support of en banc rehearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They argue that California\u2019s ethanol regulations \u201cimpinge[ ] on the sovereign interests of the Amici States to regulate farming, ethanol production, and other activities within their own borders as they see fit.\u201d These states further observe that California\u2019s regulations \u201cclose[] the California border to ethanol produced in Amici States in favor of chemically-identieal ethanol produced within California....\u201d These are the very types of concerns that generated the Supreme Court\u2019s dormant Commerce Clause case law, and the panel majority ignores them.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Our federal system grants states substantial discretion to remedy perceived local problems. But the Constitution sharply constrains their power to do so at the expense of other states. Because the majority opinion nullifies any such limitations, I respectfully dissent from our failure to rehear this case en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, California pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. To implement this goal, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) promulgated the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (Fuel Standard). The Fuel Standard requires businesses that sell transportation fuels in California to reduce the \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d of their fuels by ten percent before 2020. As CARB describes it, \u201c[c]arbon intensity is not an inherent chemical property of a fuel, but rather it is reflective of the process in making, distributing, and using that fuel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">The Fuel Standard explicitly treats instate and out-of-state ethanol differently in calculating carbon intensity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, a fuel\u2019s carbon intensity depends in part on the location where it is produced. All else equal, the regulations always assign a higher carbon intensity to Midwestern ethanol than ethanol from California. As such, CARB predicts that the Fuel Standard will soon eliminate Midwestern ethanol from the California market. Further, the regulations sweep beyond the borders of California. Because a fuel\u2019s carbon intensity depends largely on out-of-state production and land use decisions, California\u2019s scheme necessarily affects those processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">On December 23, 2009, and February 2, 2010, Plaintiffs-Appellees filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, contending that California\u2019s regulations violate the dormant Commerce Clause. Specifically, two groups of Plaintiffs led by the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union (Rocky Mountain) and the American Fuels <em>&amp; </em>Petrochemical Manufacturers Association challenged the Fuel Standard\u2019s ethanol regulations. On December 29, 2011, the district court agreed that the ethanol regulations violate the dormant Commerce Clause, awarded summary judgment on that basis, and granted Rocky Mountain\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>On September 18, 2013, a divided panel of our court reversed and remanded in principal part. According to the majority, the Fuel Standard\u2019s ethanol regulations do not facially discriminate against interstate commerce because California has \u201cgood and non-discriminatory reason[s]\u201d for treating out-of-state ethanol differently. <em>Rocky Mountain Farmers Union v. Corey, </em>730 F.3d 1070, 1107 (9th Cir.2013). The majority further concluded that the regulations do not have extraterritorial reach because they merely provide incentives to out-of-state firms. The majority therefore reversed the judgment of the district court in relevant part, vacated the preliminary injunction, and remanded to the district court for consideration of whether the ethanol regulations \u201cdiscriminate in purpose or in practical effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1078. The panel instructed the district court to apply strict scrutiny if it finds that they do, and to apply the balancing test established in <em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </em>397 U.S. 137, 90 S.Ct. 844, 25 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970), if it determines that they do not. <em>Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, </em>730 F.3d at 1078. However, the majority made clear that the outcome of this analysis is predestined, instructing the district court that the regulations \u201cincorporate state boundaries for good and nondiscriminatory reason[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\">Judge Murguia concurred in part and dissented in part. While she agreed with the majority in some respects, she disagreed regarding the ethanol regulations. Judge Murguia determined that the ethanol regulations were facially discriminatory, and she concluded that they failed to withstand strict scrutiny because California could attempt to mitigate climate change through non-discriminatory means.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In the name of combating \u201ca new type of harm,\u201d the majority rejects longstanding dormant Commerce Clause precedent as mere \u201carchaic formalism.\u201d <em>Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, </em>730 F.3d at 1107. I therefore begin with a brief survey of the doctrine, and its critical place in our constitutional order.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\u201cDuring the first years of our history as an independent confederation, the National Government lacked the power to regulate commerce among the States,\u201d and \u201ceach State was free to adopt measures fostering its own local interests without regard to possible prejudice to nonresidents.... \u201d <em>Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, Me., </em>520 U.S. 564, 571, 117 S.Ct. 1590, 137 L.Ed.2d 852 (1997). This \u201cconflict of commercial regulations, destructive to the harmony of the States.... was the immediate cause that led to the forming of a [constitutional] convention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gibbons v. Ogden, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 224, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824) (Johnson, J., concurring in the judgment)). Thus, as Justice Cardozo observed long ago, the Constitution \u201cwas framed upon the theory that the peoples of the several states must sink or swim together, and that in the long run prosperity and salvation are in union and not division.\u201d <em>Baldwin v.

Taylor, </em>477 U.S. 181, 151, 106 S.Ct. 2440, 91 L.Ed.2d 110 (1986)). \u201cIt is driven by a concern about \u2018economic protectionism\u2014 that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors.\u2019 \u201d <em>McBumey, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1719 (quoting <em>New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, </em>486 U.S. 269, 273-74, 108 S.Ct. 1803, 100 L.Ed.2d 302 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">In upholding California\u2019s sweeping and discriminatory ethanol regulations, the majority brushes aside two foundational tenets of dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence. First, the majority gives short shrift to the principle that \u201c[sjtate laws that discriminate against interstate commerce face \u2018a virtually <em>per se </em>rule of invalidity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Granholm v. Heald, </em>544 U.S. 460, 476, 125 S.Ct. 1885, 161 L.Ed.2d 796 (2005) (quoting <em>Philadelphia v. New Jersey, </em>437 U.S. 617, 624, 98 S.Ct. 2531, 57 L.Ed.2d 475 (1978)). Second, the majority abjures the rule that \u201ca state law that has the \u2018practical effect\u2019 of regulating commerce occurring wholly outside that State\u2019s borders is invalid.... \u201d <em>Healy v. Beer Inst., </em>491 U.S. 324, 332, 109 S.Ct. 2491, 105 L.Ed.2d 275 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Until recently, our circuit faithfully applied these doctrines, striking down parochial state laws that burdened interstate commerce. <em>See, e.g., Birth Hope Adoption Agency, Inc. v. Ariz. Health Care Cost Containment Sys., </em>218 F.3d 1040, 1044-45 (9th Cir.2000); <em>NCAA v. Miller, </em>10 F.3d 633, 640 (9th Cir.1993); <em>BFI Med. Waste Sys. v. Whatcom Cnty., </em>983 F.2d 911, 913 (9th Cir.1993). The majority opinion represents a dramatic and unwarranted change of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">The majority\u2019s most basic, and perhaps most consequential, error is its contention that California\u2019s regulatory scheme does not facially discriminate against out-of-state commerce. The majority concludes, in essence, that the regulations are not discriminatory on their face because California has \u201csome reason, apart from [its] origin, to treat [out-of-state ethanol] differently.\u201d <em>Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, </em>730 F.3d at 1089 (quoting <em>Philadelphia, </em>437 U.S. at 627, 98 S.Ct. 2531, 98 S.Ct. 2531). As Judge Murguia observes in dissent, however, this reasoning \u201cputs the cart before the horse,\u201d and is therefore \u201cinconsistent with Supreme Court precedent.\u201d <em>Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, </em>730 F.3d at 1108 (Murguia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s analytical framework, \u201c[determining whether a regulation facially discriminates against interstate commerce begins and ends with the regulation\u2019s plain language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the dormant Commerce Clause, \u201c \u2018discrimination\u2019 simply means differential treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.\u201d Or. Waste <em>Sys., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>511 U.S. 93, 99, 114 S.Ct. 1345, 128 L.Ed.2d 13 (1994). \u201c[T]he purpose of, or justification for, a law has no bearing on whether it is facially discriminatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 114 S.Ct. 1345 (citing <em>Chem. Waste Mgmt., Inc. v. Hunt, </em>504 U.S. 334, 340\u201441, 112 S.Ct. 2009, 119 L.Ed.2d 121 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Further, the language from <em>Philadelphia, </em>437 U.S. at 627, 98 S.Ct. 2531, on which the majority relies has nothing to do with determining whether a regulation facially discriminates against interstate commerce. Rather, it merely shows that some discriminatory regulations may ultimately survive strict scrutiny. <em>See United Haulers Ass\u2019n v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Autk, </em>550 U.S. 330, 366, 127 S.Ct. 1786, 167 L.Ed.2d 655 (2007) (Alito, J., dissenting) (citing quoted passage from <em>Philadelphia </em>as example of applying strict scrutiny). Thus, whether California has good reasons for penalizing Midwestern ethanol simply has nothing to do with whether the state\u2019s regulations are facially discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">It is clear that the challenged regulations discriminate against interstate commerce. Most blatantly, the Fuel Standard expressly assigns a higher carbon intensity to Midwestern ethanol, based in part on the greenhouse gas emissions arising from its transportation to California. Ethanol produced in-state faces no such penalty. As Judge Murguia notes, the regulatory scheme therefore \u201cdifferentiates between in-state and out-of-state ethanol, according more preferential treatment to the former at the expense of the latter.\u201d <em>Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, </em>730 F.3d at 1108 (Murguia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Because ethanol from Midwestern states faces a regulatory burden that chemically identical in-state ethanol does not, California\u2019s regime is facially discriminatory. <em>See Or. Waste, </em>511 U.S. at 99-100, 114 S.Ct. 1345. In concluding otherwise, the majority contravenes black letter law and renders our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence incoherent.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The majority compounds its error by concluding that legitimate local concerns support California\u2019s regulation of the interstate ethanol market. Because the regulations are facially discriminatory, any justifications for them must \u201cpass the \u2018strictest scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 114 S.Ct. 1345 (quoting <em>Hughes v. Oklahoma, </em>441 U.S. 322, 337, 99 S.Ct. 1727, 60 L.Ed.2d 250 (1979)). To withstand this searching review, \u201cthe statute must serve a legitimate local purpose, and the purpose must be one that cannot be served as well by available nondiscriminatory means.\u201d <em>Maine, </em>477 U.S. at 140, 106 S.Ct. 2440. \u201cThis is an extremely difficult burden, \u2018so heavy that facial discrimination by itself may be a fatal defect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Camps Newfound, </em>520 U.S. at 582, 117 S.Ct. 1590 (quoting <em>Or. Waste, </em>511 U.S. at 101, 114 S.Ct. 1345).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">California fails to carry its heavy burden. According to the majority, \u201c[i]f [greenhouse gas] emissions continue to increase, California may see its coastline crumble under rising seas, its labor force imperiled by rising temperatures, and its farms devastated by severe droughts.\u201d <em>Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, </em>730 F.3d at 1097. When viewed against this backdrop, California\u2019s regulatory justifications appear weighty indeed. But the majority overlooks a critical fact \u2014 the Fuel Standard will not remedy the problem. To the contrary, CARB acknowledges that \u201c[greenhouse gas] emission reductions by the [Fuel Standard] alone will not result in significant climate change.\u201d In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>words, California admits that its scheme will have little to no effect in averting the environmental catastrophe envisioned by the majority. This concession alone shows that the regulations fail strict scrutiny.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">And the defects in California\u2019s ethanol regime go well beyond its ineffectiveness. While the regulations may not slow climate change, they will assuredly promote California\u2019s energy industry at the expense of out-of-state competitors. CARB acknowledges that the Fuel' Standard will \u201cre-duc[e] the volume of transportation fuels that are imported from other states____\u201d As such, CARB expects that the regulations will \u201ckeep[] more money in the State,\u201d and that they \u201cwill provide needed employment, [and] an increased tax base for the State....\u201d In short, CARB admits that it purposefully \u201cdeveloped the [Fuel Standard] in a manner that minimizes costs and maximizes the total benefits to California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Of course, states may pass legislation that benefits local industry. But, \u201cin all but the narrowest circumstances,\u201d they may not do so at the expense of other states. <em>Granholm, </em>544 U.S. at 472, 125 S.Ct. 1885. In concluding that California\u2019s ethanol regulations are facially neutral in spite of their overt and unjustified discrimination against interstate commerce, the majority departs from settled law and cuts this circuit\u2019s dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence loose from its moorings.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">California\u2019s ethanol regulations suffer from another constitutional defect: they seek to control conduct in other states. The Supreme Court has clearly and eonsis-tently instructed that \u201ca state law that has the \u2018practical effect\u2019 of regulating commerce occurring wholly outside that State\u2019s borders is invalid.... \u201d <em>Healy, </em>491 U.S. at 382, 109 S.Ct. 2491; <em>see also Baldwin, </em>294 U.S. at 521-22, 55 S.Ct. 497. And the ethanol regulations plainly have extraterritorial reach, as they seek to influence out-of-state land use decisions and production methods. In concluding otherwise, the majority disregards controlling precedent and departs from the holdings of the Supreme Court and our sister circuits. More fundamentally, the majority approves a regime that threatens the very sort of \u201ceconomic Balkanization that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the Articles of Confederation.\u201d <em>Granholm, </em>544 U.S. at 472, 125 S.Ct. 1885 (quoting <em>Hughes, </em>441 U.S. at 325-26, 99 S.Ct. 1727).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">The rule that one state \u201chas no power to project its legislation into\u201d another state, <em>Baldwin, </em>294 U.S. at 521, 55 S.Ct. 497, is fundamental to our federal system. It embodies \u201cthe Constitution\u2019s special concern both with the maintenance of a national economic union unfettered by state-imposed limitations on interstate commerce and with the autonomy of the individual States within their respective spheres.\u201d <em>Healy, </em>491 U.S. at 335-36, 109 S.Ct. 2491 (footnotes omitted). Thus, \u201cthe \u2018Commerce Clause ... precludes the application of a state statute to commerce that takes place wholly outside of the State\u2019s borders, whether or not the commerce has effects within the State....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336, 109 S.Ct. 2491 (quoting <em>Edgar v. MITE Corp., </em>457 U.S. 624, 642-43, 102 S.Ct. 2629, 73 L.Ed.2d 269 (1982) (plurality opinion)). California\u2019s ethanol regulations fail this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>It is no answer to assert, as the majority-does, that the Fuel Standard merely provides \u201cincentives\u201d that might influence out-of-state conduct. <em>See Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, </em>730 F.3d at 1103-04. By penalizing certain out-of-state practices, California\u2019s regulations control out-of-state conduct just as surely as a mandate would, particularly in view of California\u2019s economic clout. Thus, whether California\u2019s scheme is characterized as providing \u201cincentives\u201d or establishing \u201cmandates,\u201d it has the practical effect of regulating interstate commerce. And, under the dormant Commerce Clause, \u201c[t]he critical inquiry is whether the <em>practical effect </em>of the regulation is to control conduct beyond the boundaries of the State.\u201d <em>Healy, </em>491 U.S. at 336, 109 S.Ct. 2491 (citing <em>Brown-For-man Distillers Corp. v. N.Y. State Liquor Auth, </em>476 U.S. 573, 579, 106 S.Ct. 2080, 90 L.Ed.2d 552 (1986)) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Finally, the majority significantly underestimates the risk that California\u2019s ethanol scheme will spur other states to enact \u201cthe kind of competing and interlocking local economic regulation that the Commerce Clause was meant to preclude.\u201d <em>Healy, </em>491 U.S. at 337, 109 S.Ct. 2491. For example, now that the panel majority has blessed California\u2019s experiment in extraterritorial regulation, Oregon may move forward with its own Clean Fuels Program. The majority assures us that the Oregon program and those of other states will merely \u201ccomplement!]\u201d California\u2019s, <em>Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, </em>730 F.3d at 1104, but there is no guarantee that this is so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In any event, ethanol producers will soon face the daunting prospect of navigating several interlocking, if not entirely contradictory, regulatory regimes. Fragmentation of the national economy may ensue.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Two brief examples Al\u00fastrate the point. If California may, consistent with the dormant Commerce Clause, seek to influence out-of-state ethanol production, it may just as legitimately seek to influence any out-of-state conduct with perceived local effects. Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, California could impose regulatory penalties (or grant \u201cincentives\u201d) to require manufacturers in Texas to pay higher wages to their employees if they intend to sell their products in California. Such a measure would, of course, benefit California to the extent that it would minimize the risk of competition from Texas businesses, with their lower labor costs. But under the same logic, Texas could \u2014 and assuredly would \u2014 respond in kind, perhaps by penalizing California agriculture on account of its reliance on costly irrigation methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Similarly, California could \u2014 under the majority\u2019s reasoning \u2014 penalize out-of-state wineries to account for the environmental effects of transporting their wines to California. Like the Fuel Standard, such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>regulation would promote California businesses at the expense of out-of-state interests. And, also like the Fuel Standard, such a regulation could lead to destructive interstate retaliation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">The very purpose of the dormant Commerce Clause is to ensure that \u201c[rivalries among the States are ... kept to a minimum, and a proliferation of trade zones is prevented.\u201d <em>Granholm, </em>544 U.S. at 472, 125 S.Ct. 1885 (citing <em>C &amp; A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, N.Y., </em>511 U.S. 383, 390, 114 S.Ct. 1677, 128 L.Ed.2d 399 (1994)). Until the majority\u2019s ruling, the dormant Commerce Clause guarded against such economic fragmentation. <em>See Baldwin, </em>294 U.S. at 524, 55 S.Ct. 497 (explaining that a state may not \u201ccondition importation upon proof of a satisfactory wage scale in factory or shop\u201d). Now, the dormant Commerce Clause has been rendered toothless in our circuit, and we stand in open defiance of controlling Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">The majority opinion in this case upholds a regulatory scheme that, on its face, promotes California industry at the expense of out-of-state interests. The majority opinion also sanctions California\u2019s clear attempt to project its authority into other states. Because the Constitution forbids such an expansive and discriminatory exercise of state power over interstate commerce, I respectfully dissent from our failure to rehear this case en banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\">. In his concurrence in the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge Gould notes that 41 states did not join in the amicus brief seeking en banc rehearing. This should be no surprise since one of those states is California, which promulgated the offending regulations, and most of the other states are not major corn or ethanol producers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b567-13\">. For the sake of brevity, I focus on the majority\u2019s endorsement of California's ethanol regulations. But the panel\u2019s approval of California\u2019s sweeping crude oil regulations also merited en banc review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b569-9\">. \"The 'negative' aspect of the Commerce Clause was considered the more important by the 'father of the Constitution,\u2019 James Madison.
