SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1078-24\">Luther Arnold appeals <em>pro se </em>the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, claiming that the registration requirements of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (\u201cSORNA\u201d) compel his speech in violation of the First Amendment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-26\">In 1994, Arnold pleaded guilty of rape, incest, and homosexual acts in Madison County, Tennessee. As a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>convictions, he was required to register as a sex offender pursuant to SORNA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2011, he moved from Marshall County, Mississippi, to Tennessee but did not (a) notify Marshall County of his move, (b) update his registration with Mississippi, or (c) register as a sex offender in Tennessee. Shortly thereafter, he was charged, and pleaded guilty of, failure to register as a sex offender in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Arnold did not file a direct appeal but collaterally challenged his sentence using \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We granted a certif\u00edcate of ap-pealability, allowing Arnold to argue on appeal that \u201cSORNA is unconstitutional because the registration requirements violate his right to free speech----\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">We have not addressed whether SOR-NA\u2019s registration requirements violate the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition of compelled speech.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We therefore begin by discussing <em>West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, </em>319 U.S. 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943) and <em>Wooley v. Maynard, </em>430 U.S. 705, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977), the relevant Supreme Court precedent on compelled speech. We then turn to related circuit-court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-13\">In <em>Barnette, </em>a state statute required public-school students to participate in daily public ceremonies by honoring the flag with words and traditional salute gestures. The Court held that \u201ca ceremony so touching matters of opinion and political attitude may [not] be imposed upon the individual by official authority under powers committed to any political organization under our Constitution.\u201d <em>Barnette, </em>319 U.S. at 636, 63 S.Ct. 1178. In explaining why the First Amendment prohibits a state actor from compelling such speech, the Court noted, \u201cIf there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642, 63 S.Ct. 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-14\">In <em>Maynard, </em>New Hampshire required all noncommercial vehicles to bear a license plate embossed with the state\u2019s motto: \u201cLive Free or Die.\u201d <em>Maynard, </em>430 U.S. at 707, 97 S.Ct. 1428. Because that slogan conflicted with his faith, Maynard contended that the state law coerced him into \u201cadvertising a slogan which [he found] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>morally, ethically, religiously and politically abhorrent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713, 97 S.Ct. 1428.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">The Court first emphasized its holding in <em>Barnette, </em>that the First Amendment protects the right to remain silent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In particular, the Court suggested that the state could violate that protection in two ways: (1) by forcing an individual, through his speech, to affirm a \u201creligious, political [or] ideological cause[ ]\u201d that the individual did not believe in; or (2) by forcing \u201can individual, as part of his daily life ... to be an instrument for fostering public adherence to an ideological point of view he finds unacceptable.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Though recognizing that <em>Barnette </em>\u201cinvolved a more serious infringement upon personal liberties than the passive act of carrying the state motto on a license plate,\u201d the Court held that New Hampshire could not constitutionally require citizens to display the state motto on their license plates. <em>Id. </em>at 715, 97 S.Ct. 1428.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">In regard to lower-court precedent, Arnold has also not identified any decisions striking a registration requirement as being compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment. Although sex offenders have brought a myriad of challenges to registration requirements, it does not appear that any court has squarely addressed this type of compelled-speech challenge,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">In <em>United States v. Sindel, </em>53 F.3d 874 (8th Cir.1995), albeit in a different context, the court rejected a claim that compelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>disclosure of information on an IRS form was unlawful compelled speech: \u201cThere is no right to refrain from speaking when \u2018essential operations of government require it for the preservation of an orderly society \u2014 as in the case of compulsion to give evidence in court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 878 (quoting <em>Barnette, </em>319 U.S. at 645, 63 S.Ct. 1178).</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">And in <em>Cutshall v. Sundquist, </em>193 F.3d 466 (6th Cir.1999), a sex offender challenged Tennessee\u2019s Sex Offender Registration and Monitoring Act. Although not bringing the compelled speech argument Arnold presses, Cutshall argued that the registration requirements violated his constitutional \u201cright to privacy.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 480. The court rejected that theory, holding that \u201cthe Constitution does not provide Cutshall with a right to keep his registry information private.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Arnold has not urged that SORNA either requires him (a) to affirm a religious, political, or ideological belief he disagrees with or (b) to be a moving billboard for a governmental ideological message. In fact, it appears that Congress enacted SORNA as a means to protect the public from sex offenders by providing a uniform mechanism to identify those convicted of certain crimes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Barnette </em>and <em>Maynard </em>do not therefore require us to conclude that the government has unlawfully compelled Arnold\u2019s speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Our limited sister-court precedent further supports this view. The logic of <em>Sin-del </em>extends to the present case: When the government, to protect the public, requires sex offenders to register their residence, it conducts an \u201cessential operation[ ] of [the] government,\u201d just as it does when it requires individuals to disclose information for tax collection. And as <em>Cutshall </em>notes, the Constitution does not provide Arnold \u201cwith a right to keep his registry information private.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">The judgment based on the order denying Arnold\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is AFFIRMED. Arnold\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913 (2012) (\"A sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender is a student.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a) (2012) (\"Whoever \u2014 (1) is required to register under [SORNA]; (2)(A) is a sex offender as defined for the purposes of [SORNA] ...; or (B) travels in interstate or foreign commerce ...; and (3) knowingly fails to register or update a registration as required by [SORNA] shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a) (2012) (\"A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States ... may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1079-16\">. Because we granted the certificate of ap-pealability only on the First Amendment issue, we do not need to address the other arguments Arnold raises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1079-17\">. <em>Cf. Hersh v. United States ex rel. Mukasey, </em>553 F.3d 743, 765 (5th Cir.2008) (\"The First Amendment protects compelled speech as well as compelled silence.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">. <em>See Maynard, </em>430 U.S. at 714, 97 S.Ct. 1428 <em>(\u201cA </em>system which secures the right to proselytize religious, political, and ideological causes must also guarantee the concomitant right to decline to foster such concepts. The right to speak and the right to refrain from speaking are complementary components of the broader concept of individual freedom of mind.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">. The Court further explained this concept of compelled speech as requiring the individual to be a \u201cmobile billboard\u201d for the state's message. See <em>id. </em>at 715, 97 S.Ct. 1428 (\u201cNew Hampshire's statute in effect requires that appellees use their private property as a 'mobile billboard\u2019 for the State's ideological message or suffer a penalty, as Maynard already has.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">. The Supreme Court has also discussed compelled speech in the context of commercial speech. <em>See, e.g., Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, </em>471 U.S. 626, 650, 105 S.Ct. 2265, 85 L.Ed.2d 652 (1985) (\"Appellant [] overlooks material differences between disclosure requirements and outright prohibitions on speech. In requiring attorneys who advertise their willingness to represent clients on a contingent-fee basis to state that the client may have to bear certain expenses even if he loses, Ohio has not attempted to prevent attorneys from conveying information to the public; it has only required them to provide somewhat more information than they might otherwise be inclined to present. We have, to be sure, held that in some instances compulsion to speak may be as violative of the First Amendment as prohibitions on speech____ But the interests at stake in this case are not of the same order as those discussed in <em>Wooley, Tomillo, </em>and <em>Bar-nette. </em>Ohio has not attempted to prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). <em>See generally </em>Jennifer M. Keighley, <em>Can You Handle the Truth? Compelled Commercial Speech and the First Amendment, </em>15 U. Pa J. Const. L. 539 (2012).
