After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-26\">Under \u00a7 3582, a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1131.10(a)(1) (Supp. May 1, 2008). Section 3582(c)(2) requires a sentence reduction to be consistent with the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 policy statements, which include U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Section lB1.10(b)(2) and its commentary preclude a district court from reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence below the new, amended guidelines range if the defendant\u2019s original sentence fell within the then-applicable guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B) &amp; cmt. n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Davis\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered most of the base offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 for crack-cocaine offenses. Davis was convicted of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and two firearms offenses. Davis\u2019s original guidelines range for his crack cocaine offense was 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the district court\u2019s original 210-month sentence on the crack offense was at the low end of that range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">After Amendment 706, Davis\u2019s offense level was reduced by two levels, yielding a new guidelines range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment for the crack cocaine offense. The district court granted Davis\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and reduced Davis\u2019s sentence for the crack offense to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the low end of that new, amended guidelines range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court denied Davis\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) request to sentence him below the new, amended guidelines range pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">On appeal, Davis argues that the district court erred when it failed to apply <em>Booker </em>and instead treated U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) and the new, amended guidelines range as mandatory rather than advisory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, as explained above, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) requires a sentence reduction to be consistent with the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 policy statements and in turn \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2) and its commentary preclude the reduction in Davis\u2019s case. This Court recently held \u201cthat <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kim-brough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings\u201d and that <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kim-brough </em>do not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009). Because Davis\u2019s original sentence was within the then-applicable guidelines range, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2) and its commentary precluded the district court from reducing Davis\u2019s sentence below the new, amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-7\">. The district court imposed a total 270-month sentence due to a 60-month consecutive sentence for one of the firearms offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b944-8\">. Thus, with the 60-month consecutive sentence for the firearms offense, Davis's new total sentence was 228 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AJTC\">.We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009). We also review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
