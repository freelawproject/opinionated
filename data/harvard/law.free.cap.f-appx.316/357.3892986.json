Rodriguez-Valla-dares claims that he is a member of a particular social group \u2014 young Honduran males who refuse to join the Mara Salva-trucha gang (the MS gang) \u2014 and that he was persecuted as a result of his membership in that group. Rodr\u00edguez-Valladares further claims that he will suffer further persecution based on his membership in that social group if he is removed to Honduras.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Although Rodr\u00edguez-Valladares was twice beaten by MS gang members, the beatings took place over a four-year period and resulted only in minor injuries. Thus, Rodriguez has not shown that the evidence compels the conclusion that he was persecuted. <em>See Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Abdel-Masieh v. I.N.S., </em>73 F.3d 579, 584 (5th Cir.1996) (holding that alien twice detained and beaten for participation in large demonstrations did not establish past persecution); <em>Mikhael v. I.N.S., </em>115 F.3d 299, 304 (5th Cir.1997) (holding that alien failed to show persecution based on religious beliefs when his father was kidnapped and held for two days, his brother was shot in the leg, another brother was kidnapped and tortured, and the alien was detained and assaulted twice).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">Rodr\u00edguez-Valladares also failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution if he returns to Honduras. Except for his testimony that he feared more beatings of the type he previously received, which did not constitute persecution, Rodr\u00edguez-Valladares failed to produce any evidence regarding future persecution. Because Rodriguez-Valladares\u2019s subjective fear of persecution does not satisfy the reasonable person standard, Rodr\u00edguez-Valladares has not established that his fear is well-founded. <em>See Jukic v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">Because Rodr\u00edguez-Valladares failed to prove that he was entitled to asylum, he is ineligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1138 (5th Cir.2006). Rodr\u00edguez-Val-ladares has abandoned his CAT claim by not arguing it in this court. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir. 2003) (citing <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">Rodriguez-Valladares\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
