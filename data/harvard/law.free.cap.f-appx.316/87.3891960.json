Wilder appealed, and this Court affirmed in an opinion dated July 16, 1999. On January 2, 2008, Wilder filed a motion to reopen his appeal, alleging that he was unable to pursue his claim due to a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-26\">The District Court determined that Wilder had failed to establish why his case should be reopened, and we agree. Wilder asserts that he was unable to pursue his claim, but that is not so because he completed an appeal before this Court. Nor does he explain why he should be allowed to relitigate claims that were previously considered by both the District Court and this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-27\">Accordingly, Wilder\u2019s appeal presents no substantial question, and we will summarily affirm. Wilder\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
