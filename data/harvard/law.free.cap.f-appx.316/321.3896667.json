The verdict against Sanders could have been based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The verdict against the city was based on Louisiana law. La. C.C. art. 2320 (providing that \u201c[mjasters and employers are answerable for the damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>occasioned by their servants ... in the exercise of the functions in which they are employed\u201d); <em>Kyle v. City of New Orleans, </em>353 So.2d 969, 972 (1977) (noting the availability of municipal liability under art. 2320 when officers use unreasonable or excessive force); <em>see Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Sens., </em>436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (holding that municipalities cannot be held liable under \u00a7 1983 on a pure <em>respondeat superior </em>theory). Defendants appeal. The parties are familiar with the facts of this case. After considering the district court\u2019s opinion and the briefing, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">A district court\u2019s findings of fact following a bench trial will only be disturbed if clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Defendants complain that a lack of specificity in the trial court\u2019s judgment creates such error. This complaint is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Based on the evidence adduced at trial, the district court could have found that Sanders used an unjustifiable quantum of force on the plaintiff. The court noted that the parties\u2019 testimony concerning the circumstances of Sanders\u2019 use of the chemical weapon was \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d; accordingly, it paid particular attention to the testimony of the other officer on the scene that night, Officer Russell Jones, on this point. Jones said that it appeared that Sanders had the situation under control, and that he believed Sanders did not use the chemical weapon before Doucet was seated in the police ear. The court further stated that \u201c[a]ll the testimony agrees that Ms. Doucet was handcuffed before she was placed in the vehicle.\u201d The court stated that although \u201cthe evidence shows Ms. Doucet was loud and uncooperative during the incident,\u201d it did not believe that \u201cthis obese woman with asthma and a limp (an infirmity which was apparently obvious to everyone but Officer Sanders), actually ran/moved quickly away from him or posed any threat to his safety.\u201d Applying the relevant legal standards and considering the parties\u2019 competing versions of the incident, the court found Sanders\u2019 use of the chemical weapon unreasonable and excessive. It could have reached that conclusion notwithstanding defendants\u2019 qualified immunity defense because it determined, on the basis of the facts before it, both that Sanders\u2019 conduct deprived Doucet of rights that were clearly established, and that his conduct was objectively unreasonable. <em>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). That determination was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-16\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A2v\">. In addition to an excessive force claim, Doucet originally brought other claims, but they were dismissed before trial. Doucet does not appeal those dismissals. Therefore, only the excessive force claim is before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
