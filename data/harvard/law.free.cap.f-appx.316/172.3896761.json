DeGrazia paid the filing fee for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>his complaint. The District Court dismissed DeGrazia\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and our review of a decision made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is plenary. <em>See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., </em>542 F.3d 59, 63 (3d Cir.2008). We may affirm on any grounds supported by the record. <em>See Hughes v. Long, </em>242 F.3d 121, 122 n. 1 (3d Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The District Court liberally construed DeGrazia\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint, but concluded that it is frivolous because it relies on \u201cfantastic or delusional scenarios.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 328, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). However, the standard for dismissal of a complaint as \u201cfrivolous\u201d under the <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute, as articulated in <em>Neitzke, </em>does not apply to DeGrazia\u2019s complaint because he paid the filing fees and did not proceed <em>in forma pauperis. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 109 &amp; n. 10 (3d Cir.2002). Rule 12(b)(6), the basis for the District Court\u2019s dismissal of DeGrazia\u2019s complaint, merely \u201cauthorizes a court to dismiss a claim on the basis of a dispositive issue of law,\u201d <em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 326, 109 S.Ct. 1827. It \u201cdoes not countenance [] dismissals based on a judge\u2019s disbelief of a complaint\u2019s factual allegations. District court judges looking to dismiss claims on such grounds must look elsewhere for legal support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Nevertheless, we conclude that dismissal was appropriate. A federal court may <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) when the allegations within the complaint \u201care so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit, ... wholly insubstantial, ... obviously frivolous, ... plainly unsubstantial, ... or no longer open to discussion.\u201d <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 536-37, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). There is no question that DeGrazia\u2019s claims meet this standard, as they rely on fantastic scenarios lacking any arguable factual basis. On appeal, DeGrazia\u2019s sole argument is that the matter should be remanded to the District Court because the order and opinion dismissing his case was the product of undue influence exerted by attorneys for the Appellees. This alleged conspiracy\u2014 which DeGrazia offers no credible evidence to support \u2014 only serves to bolster the District Court\u2019s conclusion. Because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will affirm the decision of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. IOP 10.6. The motion to remand is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
