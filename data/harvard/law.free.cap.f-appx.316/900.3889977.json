Ford\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels associated with crack cocaine offenses. Ford\u2019s motion also included an argument that the district court could impose a sentence below the amended guideline range after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court granted the motion in part, recalculated the guideline range, and imposed a sentence at the low end of the amended guideline range. On appeal, Ford argues that both <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and that the district court should further reduce his sentence after considering his post-conviction efforts, strong family ties, and the crack/powder disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-26\">In the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>lines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-5\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2): in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, <em>if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">The policy statement applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which instructs courts how to determine the amended guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) (2008). The policy statement provides in relevant part that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined under [\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) ].\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">In <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009), we held that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only allows a district court to reduce sentences in a manner \u201cconsistent with the applicable policy statements of the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1193. We noted that the policy statement applicable to 3582(c)(2) proceedings prohibited the district court from reducing a term of imprisonment below the end of the amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 1191; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A). We further held that the district court could not rely on <em>Booker </em>or <em>Kimbrough </em>to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence below the low end of the amended guideline range. <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">In the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, the district court was not permitted to reduce Ford\u2019s sentence below his amended guideline range. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err, and we affirm Ford\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
