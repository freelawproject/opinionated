The district court dismissed Johnson\u2019s suit because he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The district court also certified that Johnson\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith. Pursuant to <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997), Johnson challenges the district court\u2019s certification decision and requests that this court grant him authorization to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) imposes specific filing requirements on prisoners who seek to file civil actions regarding prison conditions; one such requirement is that administrative remedies first be exhausted. <em>See Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 532, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e. Section 1997e(a) specifically provides that \u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>see also Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 85, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006) (observing that exhaustion of all administrative remedies is mandatory). When challenged by the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, Johnson did not dispute the defendants\u2019 evidence that he had not complied with prison procedure and thus had not exhausted his administrative remedies. Consequently, summary judgment in the defendants\u2019 favor was proper. <em>See </em>Fed R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">Johnson fails to demonstrate that he has a nonfrivolous issue that this court may consider on appeal. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Consequently, his motion to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and this appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
