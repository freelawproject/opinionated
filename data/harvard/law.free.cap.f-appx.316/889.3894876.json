Means was originally sentenced, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), to the mandatory minimum of life imprisonment for possession with intent to distribute 50 or more grams of crack cocaine, with two or more prior felony drug convictions. On appeal, Means argues that the district court erroneously denied her 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a two-level reduction in her base offense level. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d as well as \u201cquestions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied </em>(No. 08-7610) (U.S. Jan. 12, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). This authority is limited to those guideline amendments listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), including Amendment 706, that \u201chave the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2), (c) (2008). Amendment 706, which reduced the offense levels in crack cocaine cases calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) by two levels, became effective November 1, 2007. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The Amendment was made retroactive as of March 3, 2008, by incorporation into U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">Although the retroactive effect of Amendment 706 allows a defendant whose guideline imprisonment range was calculated in accordance with \u00a7 2D1.1 to seek a reduction in her sentence, a defendant whose original sentence was based on something other than \u00a7 2D 1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction, since the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). This occurs, for example, where the defendant was sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A))) (noting that the operation of another guideline or statutory provision, such as \u201ca statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment,\u201d would prevent the crack cocaine amendment from having the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">When a sentence is being reconsidered pursuant to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court first must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>it must \u201cdecide whether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000). If a defendant is not eligible, such as when an amendment is not applicable or does not actually lower the guidelines range, the district court is not required to engage in this two-step analysis. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1328-29; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (\u201cEligibility for consideration under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by an amendment listed in subsection (c) that lowers the applicable guideline range.\u201d). Title 21 Section 841(b)(1)(A) states that if the defendant is convicted of a violation involving 50 grams or more of crack cocaine \u201cafter two or more prior convictions for a felony drug offense have become final, such person shall be sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Here, Means was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment, under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), since she was responsible for more then 50 grams of crack cocaine, and had four prior felony drug convictions. Because Means was sentenced to an applicable statutory mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment, resulting in a sentence that ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1, she was precluded from receiving a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. Accordingly, we likewise do not reach any of Moore\u2019s challenges to her sentence, and affirm the district court\u2019s denial of her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
