We will vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-19\">On January 10, 2008, Mock submitted her IFP application to the District Court. In her affidavit, she stated that her monthly wages totaled $1,020.00, that she had $100.00 in a checking or savings account, and that she owned a 2000 Toyota valued at $11,500.00. In addition, she has three children who depend upon her for support. By order entered April 14, 2008, the District Court denied the motion without explanation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mock appealed, arguing that the District Court erred because she financially qualifies for IFP status. Mock has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-20\">We have jurisdiction under 28 \u00a7 U.S.C. 1291, <em>see Redmond v. Gill, </em>352 F.3d 801, 803 (3d Cir.2003), and we review the District Court\u2019s ruling for abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Holiday, </em>436 F.2d 1079, 1079 (3d Cir.1971). IFP determinations generally are made solely on the basis of indigence, without regard to the potential merit' of a complaint. <em>See Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1084 n. 5 (3d Cir.1995). Although we have noted that \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d might justify denying IFP status to an otherwise financially qualified applicant, we have not had occasion to define the circumstances for which such action would be appropriate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-21\">Here, the District Court did not explain why it denied Mock\u2019s IFP application. Based on the financial informat ion contained in the application, she appears eligible for IFP status. If the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>believed that some other factor constituted an \u201cextreme circumstance\u201d warranting the denial of IFP status for non-f\u00ednancial reasons, the District Court should have provided that explanation in the order that denied Mock\u2019s IFP motion. On the record before us, we must conclude that the District Court\u2019s determination constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Accordingly, we will summarily vacate the District Court\u2019s order, and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-17\">. Six weeks after entry of this order and three weeks after Mock filed her notice of appeal, the District Court consolidated this case with several that Mock had filed appealing from a Bankruptcy Court order or orders. We have considered whether the consolidation order effectively permitted Mock to proceed with the claims raised in this case. As the record does not include Mock\u2019s complaint, and the docket prepared by the District Court in this matter describes Mock\u2019s cause of action as arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, we cannot say that the consolidation order permitted Mock to assert the claims raised in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
