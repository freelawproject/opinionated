Ornelas has waived any challenge to this determination by failing to address it in his brief. <em>E.g., Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). We lack jurisdiction to consider Ornelas\u2019 contention that he is a battered spouse, eligible for relief from removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(2), because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by raising this issue before the BIA. <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-20\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
