Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 627.901 and 627.902 by assessing a four dollar installment service charge on automobile insurance premiums. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b921-18\">Appellants are GEICO customers and participants in GEICO\u2019s premium installment payment program. Rather than pay the full amount of them insurance premium at the beginning of each policy period, Appellants pay the premium in installments over the life of the policy. After their initial down payment, Appellants are assessed an installment fee on each subsequent installment payment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Florida law regulates these installment fees. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgA\">A general lines agent may make reasonable service charges for financing insurance premiums on policies issued or business produced by such an agent or agency.... The service charge shall not exceed $3 per installment. The maximum service charge shall not exceed $36 per year. In lieu of such service charges, an insurance agent or agency, at the sole discretion of such agent or agency, may charge a rate of interest not to exceed 18 percent simple interest per year on:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-19\">(a) The unpaid balance; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-20\">(b) The average unpaid balance as billed over the term of the policy and subject to endorsement changes</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-21\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.901.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-22\">GEICO claims that its installment fee is equal to eighteen percent simple annual interest on the unpaid premium balance, capped at four dollars. As such, it does not exceed the eighteen percent simple annual interest allowed under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.901. Appellants argue that the fee is a \u201cservice charge.\u201d As such, it is above the statutory maximum of three dollars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>permissible under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.901. The district court concluded that the fee reflected a capped rate of interest well within the statutory limitation and granted summary judgment in favor of GEICO. Appellants challenge that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"A2gQ\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 836 (11th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of fact and compels judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Atm\">The district court relied primarily on two facts to conclude that the installment fee reflected a capped interest fee: (1) GEICO never assessed a fee on Appellants\u2019 first premium payment because until Appellants chose to make an installment payment, rather than the full payment, there was no unpaid balance on which to charge interest, and (2) if eighteen percent simple annual interest on the unpaid balance was less than four dollars, GEICO charged the lesser amount. Appellants argue that there are genuine issues of disputed fact with respect to whether the installment fee reflects a capped interest fee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We address and reject each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">First, Appellants contend that the district court erroneously relied on inaccurate and untrustworthy \u201cStatement of Accounts\u201d created by GEICO in preparation for litigation. The district court considered and rejected this argument for two reasons. Appellants stipulated to the accuracy of the statements, and Appellants presented no evidence to support the allegation that the statements were inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">Appellants submitted affidavits challenging the accuracy of the \u201cStatement of Accounts.\u201d On appeal, they argue that these affidavits create genuine issues of material fact sufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment. We disagree. Each affidavit alleges that GEICO assessed a four dollar installment fee before any outstanding balance was due.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the account histories that Appellants attached to their own affidavits clearly contradict this assertion. In each case, the first installment charge was assessed after the initial down payment was due and, as a result, after an unpaid balance accrued.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">Furthermore, the exhibits attached to Appellants\u2019 affidavits indicate that the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>stallment fees on Appellants\u2019 final payments were frequently less than four dollars. This confirms that GEICO was not charging a flat fee. It also supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that GEICO was applying a capped interest fee. Accordingly, Appellants affidavits are not sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Next, Appellants argue that GEICO referred to the installment fee as a \u201cservice charge\u201d on Appellants\u2019 account histories. Assuming this was true, the district court determined that GEICO\u2019s use of the term \u201cservice charge\u201d did not raise a material issue of fact with respect to the character of the fee because record evidence unequivocally established that the charges were in fact calculated based on a capped eighteen percent simple annual interest rate. We discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Finally, Appellants stress that GEICO did not report these fees as interest income to the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). However, the district court noted that GEICO presented undisputed evidence that the fees were intended to offset the cost of administering the installment payment program. Accordingly, GEICO reported this income to the IRS as a reduction to the expense of administering the installment program. Thus, the district court concluded that this allegation was insufficient to raise a disputed issue of fact regarding how the charges were calculated. We discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Considering Appellants allegations individually and as a whole, we conclude that Appellants have not raised a genuine issue of material fact. Accordingly, the opinion of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-13\">. The fee is intended to cover the additional administrative costs of an installment payment program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b922-6\">. Contrary to Appellants' argument, we apply Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) and not the Florida standard governing summary judgment. <em>See Hanna v. Plumer, </em>380 U.S. 460, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b922-7\">. In support of their arguments, Appellants rely on <em>Smith v. Foremost Insurance Company, </em>884 So.2d 341 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004). In <em>Smith, </em>unlike here, the defendant imposed a flat fee. That fee both exceeded the maximum \"service charge\u201d allowed under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.901 and, at least occasionally, exceeded eighteen percent simple interest per year. Thus, <em>Smith </em>provides no support for Appellants\u2019 claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b922-12\">. If no balance was due on the account the four dollar fee could not represent interest on the unpaid balance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b922-13\">. Appellant Jemison's initial down payment was due on 12/03/2006. The first installment charge was assessed on 12/19/2006. Appellant Tackett\u2019s initial down payment was due on 04/03/2007. The first installment charge was assessed on 04/26/2007. Appellant La-Penna\u2019s initial down payment appears to have been due on 10/06/2007 and the first installment charge was assessed on 10/22/2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b923-10\">.
