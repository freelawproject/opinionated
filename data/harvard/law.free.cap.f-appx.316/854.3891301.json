United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2502, 171 L.Ed.2d 784 (2008), which vacated our opinion <em>United States v. Arregui'iv-Aguilar, </em>257 Fed.Appx. 152 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). In that opinion, we affirmed the sentencing decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida to increase Arreguin\u2019s base-level offense by 16 levels on the ground that he was deported after being convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, a crime which we determined to be a crime of violence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. To come to that conclusion, we relied on a line of Eleventh Circuit cases interpreting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371, 1372 (11th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir.2006). That section defines a crime of violence one way. Arreguin, however, was sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), which defines a crime of violence in slightly different terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-25\">When Arreguin petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, the Solicitor General filed a brief arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) differs materially from \u00a7 4B1.1, and that the district court\u2019s decision to increase the base level of his offense by 16 levels was therefore a plain error. The Supreme Court vacated our judgment affirming the district court and remanded the case \u201cfor consideration in light of the position asserted by the Solicitor General in his brief for the United States filed April 21, 2008.\u201d <em>Arreguin-Aguilar v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2502, 171 L.Ed.2d 784 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">On June 5, 2008, Arreguin moved for expedited review of the issue because, if the Solicitor General is correct, he may be due for release in a matter of days.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">We therefore GRANT his motion for expedited review, VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment, and REMAND for further consideration in light of the Solicitor General\u2019s brief.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
