The court arrived at that sentence as follows. The base offense level for the possession offense was 14. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. The court added four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), because appellant possessed the firearm in connection with an aggravated assault, and six levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c), because he assaulted a police office while committing the offense. With these adjustments, total offense level came to 24. For this offense level and a criminal history category of V, the Guidelines prescribed a sentence range of 95 to 115 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">Appellant now appeals his sentence, arguing that the court erred in finding that he was committing an assault while in possession of the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">We review findings of fact made by the district court during sentencing for clear error. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cWhen a defendant objects to a factual finding that is to be used as a basis for sentencing, the government bears the burden to establish the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Agis-Meza, </em>99 F.3d 1052, 1055 (11th Cir.1996). Although the preponderance standard is a relaxed evidentiary standard, it \u201cdoes not grant the court a license to sentence a defendant in the absence of sufficient evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2005). When determining whether the error occurred, great deference is accorded to the district court\u2019s determination of witness credibility. <em>United States v. Gregg, </em>179 F.3d 1312, 1316 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">The Guidelines impose a four-level enhancement when \u201cthe defendant used any firearm ... in connection with another felony offense,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), and a six-level enhancement is applied if a law enforcement officer is assaulted during the course of the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c). The commentary to \u00a7 2K2.1 defines another \u201cfelony offense\u201d as any \u201cfederal, state, or local offense ... punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n. 14(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court found credible the testimony of the Government\u2019s witnesses. Because the testimony supported the offense-level enhancements and we accord great deference to the district court\u2019s determination of witness credibility, we are bound to hold that the court did not clearly err when it found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>that appellant was committing an assault on a law enforcement officer while he was illegally in possession of a firearm. Appellant\u2019s sentence is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
