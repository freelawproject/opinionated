The district court found that Harris violated his supervised release when he burglarized Charles Mosby\u2019s house. Harris contends that the government\u2019s evidence failed to establish conclusively that he entered Mosby\u2019s house \u2014 a required element of burglary under Georgia law \u2014 as neither Mosby nor the police officer arriving on the scene, Milton Latch-er, testified to seeing Harris in the house. Harris argues that the court violated his due process rights by refusing to allow him to test the weight and sufficiency of the government\u2019s evidence. He also challenges his sentence as procedurally unreasonable because the district court focused exclusively on the nature of the offense, did not consider other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and refused to hear mitigation evidence when imposing his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to revoke supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 112 (11th Cir.1994). The district court\u2019s findings of fact made at the revocation proceeding are binding and will not be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993). We cannot find clear error unless we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Craiv-ford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe credibility of a witness is in the province of the factfinder and this court will not ordinarily review the factfinder\u2019s determination of credibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court may, upon finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release, revoke the term of supervised release\u201d and require the defendant to serve prison time. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1107 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">At the revocation hearing, Officer Latcher testified that when he responded to Mosby\u2019s 911 call he saw Harris walking away from the porch of the Mosby house with a window screen trapped on his left arm. He also noted that Harris was shoeless and had multiple puncture wounds on his bare feet. Mosby testified that he heard the intruder roaming around the house as he hid in his bedroom, later found bloody footprints throughout his home, and saw police apprehend Harris in his front yard after a 911 dispatcher told him it was safe to come outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>Latcher\u2019s and Mosby\u2019s testimony was sufficient, if believed, to establish that Harris was inside Mosby\u2019s house, and the district court\u2019s decision to credit their testimony was not clear error. Nothing in the record creates a definite and firm conviction that any of the district court\u2019s findings were erroneous. Moreover, because the court permitted Harris to cross-examine the government\u2019s witnesses, make a statement and argument, and present evidence and testimony, his due process rights were not violated. Accordingly, the district court was well within its discretion to revoke Harris\u2019 supervised release based on its finding that Harris burglarized Mos-by\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">We review sentencing decisions for abuse of discretion using a two-step process, looking first to whether the district court committed a procedural error such as incorrectly calculating the guidelines, treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, imposing a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to explain the chosen sentence adequately. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If we find the sentence procedurally sound, we then consider its substantive reasonableness under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>Harris sufficiently argues only procedural error \u2014 that the district court failed to consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and instead focused exclusively on the nature of the offense \u2014 and he raises that argument for the first time on appeal. Where a defendant does not present an argument or objection to the district court, our review is only for plain error. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>478 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">A district court may revoke a term of supervised release and impose a sentence \u25a0 of imprisonment under \u00a7 3583(e) after considering the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-10\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed \u2014 ... (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed ... [treatment] ...; (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range ...; (5) any pertinent policy statements ... (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a). However, the district court is not required to discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court,\u201d and we will not remand for resentencing unless we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Contrary to Harris\u2019 contention, the district court considered more than just the underlying crime in determining his sentence. In addition to the offense conduct, the court noted Harris\u2019 \u201clong conviction record,\u201d which included armed robberies and other violence; his unwillingness to apologize for his wrongdoing; his belief that he was always \u201caggrieved in some fashion;\u201d his inability \u201cto follow the rules;\u201d and the fact that he was \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>The court\u2019s discussion of these factors provided a clear review of the nature and circumstances of the offense, Harris\u2019 history and characteristics, the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence, and the need to protect the public from Harris\u2019 further crimes. Although Harris testified that he had learned to accept responsibility for his actions, the district court was entitled to place great weight on the other factors and to determine that they outweighed Harris\u2019 new-found sense of accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Finally, Harris argues that the district court erred by not allowing him to present mitigation evidence that might have affected his sentence. The record demonstrates, however, that the court offered Harris additional time to be heard. Harris declined this opportunity. While the record may support an inference that the district court was impatient or displeased with Harris\u2019 testimony, which the court considered perjurous, the court nonetheless met its obligation to Harris by offering him time to present his evidence. Harris\u2019 choice to forgo that time, based on his belief that he could not change the court\u2019s decision, was his and his alone. The district court did not err in sentencing Harris to 24 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
