He argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K2.0 downward departure based on poor pretrial confinement conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">\u201cWe lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a downward departure unless the district court incorrectly believed that it lacked authority to grant the departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). The district court is not required to state on the record whether it believed it had authority to depart below the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>Instead, \u201c \u2018when nothing in the record indicates otherwise, we assume the sentencing court understood it had authority to depart downward.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Chase, </em>174 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">Here, the district court not only indicated that it understood that it could depart downward, the court indicated that it believed Shore\u2019s criminal background warranted a higher sentence than the one imposed. Because the district court gave no indication that it believed it lacked authority to grant Shore a downward departure, we lack jurisdiction to review its decision to deny the departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm Shore\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
