The Government did not file a response to Johnson\u2019s motion in the district court, and the district court\u2019s order denying Johnson\u2019s motion stated that it had \u201ccarefully reviewed said Motion and the entire court file\u201d and was \u201cotherwise fully advised in the premises.\u201d The district court did not otherwise explain its ruling. Johnson asserts the district court abused its discretion because the basis for the denial cannot be clearly discerned, thus, effective appellate review is not possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-22\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003). Generally, \u201cthe court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). However, where a defendant has been sentenced pursuant to a sentencing range \u201cthat has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Section lB1.10(b)(l) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-5\">In determining whether, and to what extent, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement is warranted, the court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) to the guidelines listed in subsection (c) had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced. In making such determination, the court shall substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). The application notes for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 instruct that the court: (1) shall consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; (2) shall consider the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community posed by the reduction; and (3) may consider the post-sentencing conduct of the defendant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">We have instructed that in considering a defendant\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court must engage in a two-part analysis: first, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines; second, the court must decide whether, in its discretion, it will choose to impose a new sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000). The second part of the analysis \u201cshould be made in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">The district court\u2019s order denying Johnson\u2019s motion stated that it had \u201ccarefully reviewed said Motion and the entire court file\u201d and was \u201cotherwise fully advised in the premises.\u201d The district court did not otherwise explain its ruling. Accordingly, the record does not demonstrate the district court took the pertinent factors into account in denying Johnson\u2019s motion. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Johnson\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence and remand for further consideration and explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
