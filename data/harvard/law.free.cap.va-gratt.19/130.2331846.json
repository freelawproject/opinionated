He left a widow and six sons and five daughters. After providing for his widow and sons, he in the sixth clause of his will \u25a0says, \u2014 \u201c I lend to my daughter Haney Perry one hundred and forty acres of land, it being the lower lot of my road tract of land as laid off and surveyed, to be ^possessed by her during her natural life, and the natural life or widowerhood of her present or future husband; and at her death and the death or after marriage of her husband, then to be equally divided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>among her children, if she has any, and if she has none, then to be divided among all my children.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-4\">The tenth clause of the will is \u2014 \u201cI lend to my daughter Sally one hundred and forty acres of land, .it being the lot laid off next above her sister Lucy\u2019s and below the lot devised to my son Thomas, to be possessed by her and any husband she may have upon the same terms and conditions as Haney Perry\u2019s.\u201d And in the eleventh clause he says \u2014 I lend to my five daughters, each one slave to be possessed by them, and upon the same terms and conditions as they will hold their lands. And he specifies the slave which each daughter is to have; Phoebe being the name of the one given to Sally. By the 14th clause he gave the residue of his estate to his wife for her life or widowhood; and then to all his children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">It appears that Sally Stone received the land and the slave Phoebe, and that the living descendants of Phoebe numbered twenty-five in 1857, when Sally Stone died never having married, and being then as the bill states, about sixty-one years of age. By her will, which was \u2022duly admitted to probate in the County court of Fluvanna, after some bequests to other persons, she gave the remainder of her estate to her niece Christian Stone, who afterwards married Schuyler B. Moon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">After the death of Sally Stone, in a suit in the County court of Fluvanna, by the surviving children of Caleb Stone, and the personal representatives of \u2022such as were dead, for the purpose of having a sale of the said slaves, commissioners were appointed to sell them, and they were sold on a credit of six months; the executor of Sally Stone not claiming them as a part of her estate. There was also another suit in the same court by the same parties, for the sale of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">\"Whilst these suits were thus pending Schuyler B. Moon and Christian his wife, filed their bill in the Cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>cuit court of Fluvanna county, against the executor of Sally Stone, deceased, and the other parties in said in which they set out the wills of Caleb and Sally Stone. They insisted that by the will of Caleb Stone, Sally took an estate tail in the land and an absolute interest in the slave Phcebe; and that by her will the land and the slaves passed to the plaintiff Christian. They referred to the suits which had been brought for the sale of the slaves and the land; expressed themselves willing that the sale of the slaves should stand, and to take the purchase money in their stead. Asked that the parties might be restrained from proceeding in said suits; that the commissioners be restrained from paying over the purchase money of the slaves, until the further order of the court; and that the rights ,of the plaintiffs and the defendants in the said real and personal estate, might be ascertained and declared by the court; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-6\">The defendants demurred to the bill and answered, contesting the construction put upon the will of Caleb Stone by the plaintiffs; insisting that Sally Stone took but a life estate in the property; and that upon her death, unmarried and without children, the bequest over to the children of Caleb Stone was valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-7\">On the 16th of September 1859, the cause came on to be heard, when the court was of opinion that Sally Stone took but a life estate in the slaves, under the will of Caleb Stone; and that upon her death, unmarried and without children, they either passed over under the 14th clause of the will, to the testator\u2019s wife and children, or that both the land and slaves given to Sally Stone passed over to the testator\u2019s children by virtue of the sixth, tenth and eleventh clauses of the will; that the words of these clauses created neither an estate tail in the land nor a perpetuity in the slaves; and the limitation over was therefore good. And the court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the bill with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>costs. Whereupon the plaintiffs obtained an appeal to , i \u2022 this court. ,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-6\"><em>Pettit, </em>with whom were <em>Nance \u00a7 Williams, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-9\">The question here is, what estate Sally, the daughter of Caleb Stone, acquired under his will in the land and slaves devised and bequeathed to her; and I shall first treat it as if in making the devise to her, the testator had used the same words employed in the clause making a similar devise to his daughter Haney Perry. That clause is,</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-11\">\u201c 6th. I lend to my daughter Haney Perry 140 acres of land, to be possessed by her during her natural life, and the natural life or widowerhood of her present or future husband, and at her death and the death or after marriage of her husband, then to be equally divided among her children if she has any; and if she has none, then to be divided among all my children.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-12\">The 10th is, \u201cI lend to my daughter Sally, 140 acres of land, to be possessed by her and any husband she may have, upon the same terms and conditions as Haney Perry\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-13\">The 11th is, \u201cI lend to my five daughters each one slave and her future increase, to be possessed by them, and upon the same terms and conditions as they will hold their lands; that is to say,\u201d proceeding to name the slave given to each.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-14\">Haney had a husband and children at the date of will and death of testator. Sally was then of tender years, and never married. The will is dated in 1807, and was probated in 1810. Sally died in 1857, leaving the land and twenty odd valuable slaves the progeny of the woman bequeathed to her, and a will by which this property was given to the female appellant, if hers to dispose of.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVCX\">The construction cannot be affected by the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>the word \u201clend.\u201d There is no difference in reason or authority between a loan for life and a gift for life. <em>Parker wife </em>v. <em>Wasley\u2019s ex\u2019or, </em>9 Gratt. 477; <em>London </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>11 Leigh 403.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9D\">the word children, where it first occurs in the 6th clause, is held to be a word of purchase and not a word of limitation, then the effect of this clause is to create in Eaney Perry an estate in the land for her own life, and the life or widowerhood of any husband she might have, with a contingent remainder for life to any children she might have, and who should be living at <em>her </em>death, if she survived her husband, or at <em>his </em>marriage or death if he should survive her; or if she should have no child living at that one of these events which should occur last, then with a substitutional, contingent remainder for life to such of the testator\u2019s children as should be living at the date of such event; and the fee would be undisposed of by this clause. Of course I am throwing out of view; now the statutes abolishing estates tail, or rather converting them into fees absolute, and the statute dispensing with words of inheritance in order to create a fee, which statutes I shall presently show should have no effect upon the-construction in such a case as this, and I am considering now this clause in the light of the common law, \u201cthe law as it aforetime was.\u201d According to that law it is clear that if land be devised to A. for life, .and at his death to B. and D. if then living, and if not, then to O. and E.; B. and D., and O. and E. would take contingent remainders for life, B. and D.\u2019s being contingent upon the event of their surviving A., and O. and E.\u2019s being contingent upon their surviving A., and B. and D.\u2019s not surviving him; and the fee would descend to the heir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-6\">This then is the result of the construction contended for by the appellees, and it involves the imputation to the testator of the following absurd, unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>and inconvenient testamentary disposition. If his <em>\u00b0 </em>A 4 daughter should die leaving one child and a dozen grandchildren, the children of deceased children, the surviving child would take all and the grandchildren nothing. If she should leave no child, but a dozen grandchildren, the grandchildren could still take nothing, for the land is directed to be divided among his children if she has no children. And if all her children should survive her, they could at the common law take only life estates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">And yet no one can doubt that the testator intended that that portion of his property which he set apart for his daughter should remain to her issue forever, and should never go over to his other children until her issue was extinct. If this intent be manifest then the word children is synonymous with the word issue, is used as a <em>nomm colleetivum, </em>and not as a <em>designado personas, </em>and is a word of limitation and not a word of purchase. Indeed, this word in a will is to be construed a word of limitation or of purchase, as will best effectuate the intention of the testator; and is most generally in a will a word of limitation, unless there are children living at the date of the will or death of testator, or unless words of inheritance are superadded to the gift to children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-7\">In the great case of <em>Jesson </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>2 Bligh. 1, decided in 1820, the court of King\u2019s Bench adopted such a construction as is contended for by the appellees here, but after the most elaborate argument by the most distinguished counsel, this decision was reversed in the House of <em>Lords; </em>the Lord Chancellor, on moving judgment, remarking, that the court below had decided that \u201c\u00a5m. Wright took only a life estate under the will, with remainder to his <em>children for life,\" </em>and that the appellants alleged \u201cfor error that the testator intended to embrace all the issue of the said Wm. Wright, which intention can only be effected by giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>proceeded to the said \u00a5m, \"Wright an estate tail,\u2019: thus: \u00a3\u00a3I will not trouble the house by going through all the cases in which the rule has been established, that where there is a particular and a general intent, Particular is to be sacrificed to the general intent, A great many certainly, and almost all of them, coincide and concur in the establishment of that rule.\u201d \u201cIt is definitely settled as a rule of law that where there is a particular and a general or paramount intent, the latter shall prevail, and the courts are bound to give effect to the paramount intent.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-6\">The words of the devise in that case were as follows : \u201c I give unto William, one of the sons of my sister Ann Wright, all that messuage,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c to hold the same premises unto the said William <em>for </em>and <em>during </em>the <em>term </em>of his <em>natural </em>life, and <em>from </em>and <em>after </em>his decease, I give and devise all,\u201d &amp;c., \u201cunto the heirs of the body of the said William, lawfully issuing, in <em>such shares and proportions </em>as he the said William, in and by deed or writing or last will shall give, direct, limit or appoint; and for want of such appointment, then to the heirs of the body of said William, lawfully issuing, share and share alike, as tenants in common, and if but <em>one </em>child, the whole to <em>such only child. </em>And for want of such issue I give and devise all,\u201d &amp;c., \u201cto my right heirs forever, charged,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-7\">The intention of testator to confine William to a life estate could not be more plainly expressed, and notwithstanding the use of the words heirs of the body, it is equally obvious that, \u201cfrom and after William\u2019s decease,\u201d the testator intended the messuage, &amp;c., to go to William\u2019s children equally, if he had more than one, and if one child only, the whole to that child. William could not appoint to any but children, if there was any child living; and heirs of the body, in the technical sense of the term, could not take together share and share alike as tenants in common. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>could only take successively one after another. It is equally obvious that the testator intended the children to take as purchasers under his will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-4\">But, say Mr. Jervis and Sir Edward Sugden, counsel for the appellants, \u201cit was the intention of the testator to include all William\u2019s issue, and sufficient appears on the face of the will, to enable a court of law to effectuate that intention. The decision in the court below attributes this meaning to the testator, that if William had only one child horn who survived him, such child should take the whole estate for life; but if he had twelve (for example), and eleven died in his lifetime, the surviving child should have only a twelfth of the estate for his life. Is this a probable intention ? Again, if he had twelve children, and they all died in his lifetime, leaving issue, according to this decision none of the issue could take. If their parents indeed had lived, they might have been supported out of the estate, but if their parents chanced to die in William\u2019s lifetime, they could derive no benefit from the estate. If we consider the probable duration of their lives, it is not likely that the testator intended to stop there, with all the risks attending such a limited bounty, and then to give the estate to his heir at law. What is the value of such a gift ? To the devisees it is highly important that the estate should not go over until a total failure of their issue; but to the heir the value of a reversion in fee after a life estate to a young person, with remainders for life to all his children, is trifling. Suppose that twelve children had survived William, is it a probable intention that upon the death of each a share should fall to the heir, who would thus perhaps be a long series of years acquiring all the shares in the property ? The testator intended William to take <em>for life, </em>and he intended <em>all </em>his issue to take. But he intended his children to take <em>as purchasers, </em>and it is manifest that he considered, although erroneously in point of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>law, that his intention to include all William\u2019s possible issue, would be effectuated, if the children did take purchasers. The argument assumes this shape, that, because he intended the children to take as purchasers, and has not repeated words of inheritance, they can only take for life as tenants m common.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-6\">Sir Edward, after referring to some cases, continued : \u201cThe inconvenience of the supposed intention has been already stated. If only one child should be born, they imagine the testator meant he should take the lands for life. If twelve children, and eleven die infants, according to one construction, the survivor would take the whole; according to another construction, he would take only a twelfth part. If the eleven died leaving families, the families would take nothing. If, according to the argument, the children would take estates only for life, the necessary consequence is, that the parent must take an estate tail; otherwise the intention of the testator is frustrated. He intended to provide for the issue, and they would have no provision. If the gift had been to \u201c children,\u201d instead of \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d the same argument would have arisen. The word <em>children, </em>when used as a class, gives the same interest.\u201d It is argued that he meant the children to take, if more than one, because he gives to one child, if there should be but one. <em>No doubt </em>that was his intention, and that they should take as purchasers, but he also intended that children\u2019s children to the last generation should inherit, before the estate should go to the remainderman. In the case of one child, he meant that the one child should take the inheritance, and a limitation to children or a child as a class, is sufficient to give such interest. In <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>the words child or children are used .throughout the will; the limitation over is on failure of children, not issue. The court collects the intention to give the parent the inheritance from the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>these words as a class. So in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>Lord Thurlow held, that where children are to take as a class, they must take as heirs. Some stress was laid upon the circumstance that the estate was expressly devised to William for life. But that circumstance has heen disregarded in similar cases, even where the strong negative words, only, and no longer, have been superadded. But it is material in this view, that it shows by opposition, that he did not intend the children to take life estates only. To William for life, and after his decease to his children. Had he intended them also to take for life only, he would of course have said so. Lord Mansfield often truly observed, that when a man gives a house to one, he always means to give the entire interest in it, the same as if he had given him a horse. To effect this intention the courts have gone great lengths to supply, by other words and implications, the want of express words of inheritance.\u201d \u2014 \u201cIt is said the provision and devise, if one child, to that one, includes the other case, viz: of there being more than one, in which case they were all to take; granted. But still it remains to show, that because the children were to take, they^were to take life estates only. If but one child, the whole to that one child, i. e. the whole estate, and also the testator\u2019s interest in it. This is what the testator meant, although his meaning cannot, in <em>this way, </em>be effectuated. The gift over, \u201cfor want of such issue,\u201d afforded irresistible evidence of the testator\u2019s intention that the estate should not go over until a general failure of William\u2019s issue.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-6\">So, here, the provision that the land should be \u201c divided among the children\u201d of Haney Perry, \u201cif she has any,\u201d includes the other case, that if she has only one, then that one to take all; and the words of the gift over, \u201cif she has none, then\u201d over, furnish evidence equally irresistible that the testator did not in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>tend to confine the children to life estates. He gives the land over \u201c if she has none,\u201d and must have in-that it should remain with the children and their issue, if she had any. If he had intended its-k\u00b0u-^ <em>S\u00b0 </em>over upon the death of Haney\u2019s children, he would have used very different or additional words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-6\">Mr. Sugden goes on: \u201c It is immaterial whether the words were <em>heirs of the body </em>or <em>children; </em>in either case the intention would he equally apparent to pass the inheritance. A tenancy in common is incompatihlo with an estate tail in the parent, but that does not prove that the testator intended the children to take for life only. The following rules may be safely laid down:</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-7\">\u201cI. That a devise may, in favor of the intention, include all a man\u2019s possible issue, although in terms only a particular class is included.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-8\">\u201cH. That if words are used which denote an intention to give the estate to the children by purchase, they shall take in that character where they can take by force of the will such an estate as will include all the issue, so that the estate may not go over before a total failure of issue.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-9\">\u201cIH. That although such an intention is apparent, yet when the general intention, viz: to include all the issue, can only be effectuated by vesting an estate tail in the parent, he shall take that quantity of interest in \u25a0opposition to the words of the will. The particular intent of the testator shall he sacrificed in favor of his general intent.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-10\">In support of these principles, Sir Edward Sugden referred to <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>1 Burr. R. 38, decided in 1756, where the devise was of \u201call my real estate (except my estate in the parish of Endellyon) to Lancelot Hicks, for and during the term of his natural life, and <em>no longer; </em>provided that he alter his name and take that of Bobinson, and live at my house at Boehym; and after his decease to such son as he shall have, law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>fully to be begotten, taking the name of Bobinson; and for default of such issue, then I bequeath the same to my cousin \u00a5m. Bobinson and his heirs</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhL\">The testator died 30th September 1728, and Lancelot took the name of Bobinson, and afterwards had two sons, the elder of whom died, and then Lancelot died, leaving his younger son an infant. Both sons took the name of Bobinson, and the question was, \u201cWhether any and what estate or interest is vested in the said infant and second son of Lancelot by virtue of the said will.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-5\">This case was thrice argued in the King\u2019s Bench.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgJ\">Many cases were cited on both sides, and the judges of the King\u2019s Bench unanimously certified in these words: \u201cWe are of opinion, that upon the true construction of the said will of the testator George Bobinson, the said Lancelot Hicks must, by necessary implication, to <em>effectuate </em>the manifest <em>general intent </em>of the said testator, be construed to take an estate in tail male, he and the heirs of his body taking the name of Bobinson;\u201d notwithstanding the express estate devised to the said Lancelot Hicks, \u201cfor his life and no longer.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-7\">\u25a0 A decree was entered in accordance with the certificate, and on appeal to the House of Lords, the opinion of all the judges was taken, and they unanimously agreed with this certificate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-8\">How here is a case in which the particular intent of the testator to confine the first taker to a life estate, is expressed in the strongest terms, and in which nevertheless, the court, after the most thorough consideration, determined that in order to effectuate the general intent in favor of the issue, he should, by necessary implication, take an estate tail. The word \u201cson\u201d is certainly no more a word of limitation than the word \u201c children;\u201d and certainly there is nothing in the language employed, more strongly manifesting the tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>tator\u2019s intent, in favor of Lancelot Hick\u2019s issue, than there is in the language employed by the testator in our case. The general intent in favor of the issue in that case, was manifested and implied from the gift, after the first taker\u2019s decease, \u201cto such son as he should have, lawfully to be begotten,\u201d without the addition of words of inheritance, \u201c and for default jaf such issue then\u201d over, showing that notwithstanding the omission of words of inheritance in the gift \u201cto such son as he should have,\u201d yet the testator manifestly intended \u201c such son,\u201d if Lancelot should have such, to take the whole estate, for he only gives it over in the event he should have none.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-9\">So in our case it is evident the testator intended the property he gave to his daughter for life, should after, or at her death, go to her children forever, if she had any, for he only gives it over, \u201c if she has none.\u201d Yet as there is an omission of words of inheritance in the gift to the children here, as in the gift to the son above, and as the effect of holding the word \u201cson\u201d and the word \u201c children,\u201d to he words of purchase, would he to confine the \u201cson\u201d and the \u201cchildren\u201d to life estates, and to disinherit their issue, and as the general intent in favor of the issue, can only he effectuated in either case, consistently with the rules of law, \u201c as it aforetime was,\u201d by giving the parent an estate tail, \u201che shall,\u201d in accordance with Sir Edward\u2019s iii rule, and the certificate of all the judges above, \u201ctake that quantity of interest in opposition\u201d even \u201cto the words of the will.\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe particular intent shall he sacrificed to the general intent.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-10\"><em>Wild\u2019s </em>case, 6 Coke R. 16, is a strong authority for an estate tail here. The devise there was to \u201cRowland Wild and his wife for their lives, and after their death, to their children; they then at the date of the will having two children. And it was held that Rowland and wife took joint estates for life with remainder to. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>their children, for life; and the reasons assigned according to Coke were 1st, that there were children living at the date of the will; and 2ndly, that there did not appear any general intent in favor of an inheritance to the children; and says the report, \u201cas the heir is to sit in the place of the ancestor and in his stead to do and perform all proper services for the king and commonwealth, and is favored by the law, he shall not be disinherited except by express words or necessary implication.\u201d These reasons imply that if there had been no child living, or if there had appeared any general intent in favor of an inheritance in the children, then in either case an estate tail would have been given to the parents. There was not in that ease any limitation over in default of children as there is in ours.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-4\">But it was at the same time resolved, that if a devise be to A., and his children, and there is no child living at the time, A. shall have an estate tail, and in support of this, a case in Sergeant Bendloe\u2019s B. 4 Eliz. is referred to. And while toward the end of the report it is asserted that if a devise be to A. for life, and after his death to his children, then, even though A. has no child at the time, he shall only take a life estate, with remainder for life to his children, yet no case is referred to in support of this proposition, and it is therefore, a mere <em>obiter dictum. </em>Besides, the case supposed is unlike ours, because there is no limitation over in default of children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-5\">By the report of this case contained in Moore 397, under the name of <em>Richardson </em>v. Yardley, according to Lord C. J. Alvanley, in <em>Seale </em>v. <em>Barter, </em>2 Bos. &amp; Pull. 485, and Sir Edward Sugden in <em>Jesson </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>2 Bligh 38, it appears that Popham and Gawdy Js. held that Wild took an estate tail, notwithstanding that he had children living at the time of the devise, though Benner and Clench thought it was only an estate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>life, and they all agreed that if no children had been born it would have been an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-9\">So, at same page, Sir Edward gives the following case: \u201cA devise to William for the term of his life, and after his decease to the men children of his body; and if he dies without man child,\u201d or according to counsel in <em>Seale </em>v. Barter, 2 Bos. <em>&amp; </em>Pull. 485, \u201cwithout men children of his body, then\u201d over; and it was held that William took an estate tail. 1 Anderson R. 43. This case is referred to by Lord Alvanley in <em>Seale </em>v. <em>Barter, </em>having been stated by the counsel just as it is by Sir Edward, except as above noted, and except that he refers it to 1 And. Pl. 110; and it was referred to in argument before Lord Mansfield, in <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>Doug. 431; and not a word escaped either bar or bench, hinting even a doubt as to its correctness and authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-10\"><em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Middleton, ubi supra, </em>decided in 1780, is another strong case for the appellants. There the devise was, \u201cI give to my kinswoman Mrs. Anne Middleton, my house and lands at Arlborough Hatch, and all my real estate in the parish of Barking, <em>during her life; </em>and <em>at her death </em>to <em>her children, </em>upon condition that she or they constantly pay \u00a330 a year for a clergyman to officiate in my chapel, &amp;.e.; and on failure of these conditions here mentioned, then I give the said house and lands to my own next heirs, to be enjoyed by them on the same conditions; and in case of <em>failure of children </em>of my said kinswoman Mrs. Anne Middleton, then I give the house and lands aforesaid to her brother Mr. George Hodges and his children, on the same conditions; and in case of failure of his children, then I give the said house, and lands to the sisters or sister of the said Anne Middleton and George Hodges, to be equally divided between them or their children that are living at that time.\u201d Anne Middleton had seven children living at the death of the testatrix, the testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>trix having died only a year after the date of her will, and she had six living at her own death. Joseph Hodges, son and heir at law of George Hodges, who was heir at law of the testatrix, \u201cbrought his bill to have his right to the freehold and inheritance of the said premises, subject to the life estates of the surviving children of Anne Middleton, and for an injunction against waste.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-4\">Hill, sergeant, for the plaintiff, contended that Anne Middleton only took an estate for life, and that her children being in esse at the date of the will and death of the testatrix, took an estate for life by purchase, in joint tenancy. That it is laid down in Lord Coke\u2019s Comm, upon Littleton, that if B. have divers sons and daughters, and A. give lands to B., and <em>liberis suis, </em>the father and all the children take jointly. So in <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>2 Vern. 545, it is said that if there is a devise to J. S. and his children, if he hath children, they take with their father; but if he hath no child, it is an estate tail. And <em>inWild\u2019s </em>case this distinction is made between children being in esse and not in esse, it being there determined that if land be devised to A. and his wife, and after their decease to their children, they then having issue a son and daughter, A. and his wife had but an estate for life, with remainder for life to their children.\u201d To which it was replied: \u201cIt is admitted that there are cases where the word children in a will is a word of limitation, and creates an estate tail; that Lord Hale in <em>King </em>v. <em>Melting, </em>1 Ventr. 225-31, seems to think it may be <em>nomen eollectivum, </em>althongh there be children then in esse; and that, in the case from 1 And. above referred to, though Lord Coke said it was determined to be an estate tail, because it did not appear in the case that there were issue male at the time of the devise, yet in this he must be mistaken, as neither of the two other reporters mention that circumstance; and if the determination had proceeded upon such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>distinction, the fact would certainly have been enquired into and ascertained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-9\">The court of King\u2019s Bench, Lord Mansfield presiding, returned a certificate in these words:</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-10\">\u201cWe are inclined to think that under the will of Frances Bladen, the testatrix, Anne Middleton took an estate tail, but if she took an estate for life only, we are of opinion, that her children would take an estate tail, and in either case the limitation to George Hodges, the heir at law, was barred by recovery, and the plaintiff has no title.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-11\">It will have been noticed that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel conceded there would have been no question as to Anne Middleton\u2019s taking an estate tail, if she had not had children in esse at the date of the will, and that the defendant\u2019s counsel argued to show that this fact should make no difference in the construction; and it is impossible to doubt that the court, but for this fact, would unhesitatingly have declared its opinion to the same effect. This fact does not exist in our case, and this decision is therefore most persuasive. The only circumstance to distinguish this case from ours, is the sole circumstance relied on to confine Anne Middleton to a life estate; and that circumstance was held insufficient for that purpose, and being absent from our case, the testator\u2019s daughter, Sally Stone, must, according to this decision, be held to take an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-12\"><em>Seale </em>v. <em>Barter, 2 </em>Bos. &amp; Pull. 485, decided in 1801, is another most persuasive authority. The devise was, \u201cIt is likewise my will that all my lands and estates shall, after my decease, come to my son John Seale and his children, lawfully to be begotten, with full power for him to settle the same, or any part or parts thereof, by will or otherwise, on them, or any of them, as he shall think proper; and for default of such issue, then that all my lands and estates come to my daughter Elizabeth Seale and her children, lawfully to be be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>gotten, with full power for her to settle the same, or any part or parts thereof, by will or otherwise, on them, or such of them as she shall think proper; and in default of such issue, it is my will and meaning that all my estates and lands shall belong to my said son and daughter equally between them, to whom in such case I do hereby give, devise and bequeath the same.\u201d The testator died in 1777, leaving his said son and daughter his only children. His son was married at the date of the devise, but then had no child; afterward he had one in testator\u2019s lifetime, and several since, and the question was what estate he took under this devise. The case was twice argued, and the authorities reviewed and commented on. I beg to quote a sentence or two: \u201cIn the present case the devise is to.J. S. and his children, and in default of such issue, <em>then only </em>is it to go over, <em>which shows that the children were intended to take an estate of inheritance, </em>which they could not do but\u201d through their father, nor through him unless he took an estate tail. In <em>Davies </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>Douglas 320, there was a devise of the fee simple and inheritance to William and his child or children forever, and it was held to be an estate tail in William, Lord Mansfield saying the meaning is the same as if the expression had been to William and his heirs, that is to say, his children or his issue. How if in that case the word children was held Synonymous with issue, in order to restrain the devise to an estate tail, there is no reason why in this case it may not be held to bear the same sense, in order to enlarge the devis'e to an estate tail. The general intention was that the estate should not go over to E. S. until after an indefinite failure of the issue of J. S.; but if the word children is to be held to be <em>designado persones, </em>though there was no child in esse at that time, what is there to give to the children anything more than estates for life?\u201d Lord C. J. Alvanley, after reviewing the cases, and amongst others, <em>Wild\u2019s </em>case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>as reported by Coke and by Moor, and <em>King </em>v. <em>Melling, Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>and <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>and combating -the argument that the power to appoint among the children should vary the construction, expressed himself in conclusion thus: \u201cThe true question to be considered is, whether the testator meant to give the estate to John Seale and his posterity? Probably, if the testator had been asked, whether he meant that his son should have the power to defeat the limitation, he would have answered that he did not understand the effect of an estate tail, but that he wished the estate to go to his son and his posterity. If he meant to give the estate to his son and his posterity generally, it is an estate tail.\u201d How we are of opinion, upon all the authorities, that the words \u201c children lawfully to be begotten,\u201d in this case, are not to be considered as words of purchase, but that the intention of the testator was to give his estate to his son and the issue of his body generally.\u201d And it was accordingly decreed that John Seale took an express estate tail, with a power of appointment annexed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-9\"><em>Mellish </em>v. <em>Mellish, </em>2 Barn. &amp; Cress. 527, decided in 1821, is another strong case for the plaintiffs. John Mellish being seized in fee, subject to a mortgage for years, of a messuage, &amp;c., known as Ham el\u2019s, made his will, containing the following clause: \u201cThe mortgage on Hamel\u2019s to be paid off as soon as \"William Mellish can do it without prejudice to the business. Hamel\u2019s to go to my daughter Catherine Mellish as follows: in case she <em>marries </em>and <em>has a son, </em>to go to that son; in case she has more than one daughter <em>at </em>her <em>husband\u2019s </em>or <em>her death, and no son, </em>to go to the eldest daughter; but in case she has but one daughter, <em>or no child at that iime&gt; </em>I desire .it may go to my brother \"William Mellish.\u201d And it was held that C. M. took an estate tail male, the word son being \u201c construed to mean any son, whether immediate or remote, such as grandson,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>therefore a word of limitation, because the effect of ^ . holding it to be a <em>designatio personae </em>or word o\u00b1 purchase, \u201cwould be that if the son died leaving sons, the estate would go over to the daughters,\u201d and the grandsons would be unprovided for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-8\"><em>Wollen </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>2 Bingh. 126, 9 E. C. L. Rep. 342, decided in 1824, is another strong authority. The devise was to trustees, \u201c upon trust to permit the testator\u2019s six children A., B., 0., D., E. and E., to have and receive one-sixth part or share each of the net rents and profits thereof, for and during the terms of their natural life and lives; and from and <em>immediately </em>after their respective deceases, then upon further trust to permit and suffer all and singular the child or children of such of his sons or daughters so dying, to have, receive and take the rents, issues and profits of such share or shares of him, her or them, so dying, of and in the said estates before devised, in <em>equal parts, shares and, proportions, </em>and so on in like manner from children to children. His will further was, that in case any or either of his said children should happen to die without <em>leaving </em>any lawful issue, then the rents, issues and profits belonging to such of his sons or daughter so dying, \u2022should go to and be received by the <em>survivor or survivors.\u201d </em>It was decided that each of the testator\u2019s six children took an estate tail in one-sixth of the property. This case is almost exactly like the case at bar, it being in short a devise to A. for life, and from and immediately after his decease to his child or children, in equal parts and shares; and if either should happen to die without leaving any lawful issue, then to his surviving brothers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-10\">In <em>Pierson </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>5 East R. 518, the limitations were to the testator\u2019s daughter, Ann, and to the heirs of her body, lawfully to be begotten, whether sons or daughters, as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants; and in default of <em>such </em>issue, to her sisters for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>their joint lives; remainder to a trustee to preserve contingent remainders; and after the decease of either them, to all and every the child and children of, &amp;c., whether sons or daughters; and it was held that Ann took an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATs\">In <em>Doe d. Cock </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>1 East R. 229, decided in 1801, the devise was of a messuage and lands to Eichard Cock, \u201c for the term <em>only </em>of his natural life; and after his decease unto the lawful issue of the said Eichard Cock <em>as tenants in common; </em>hut in ease the said Eichard Cock shall die, without leaving lawful issue, then and in such case, after his decease unto Elizabeth Harding and her heirs and assigns.\u201d Eichard Cock died in 1800, without issue, having first suffered a recovery, and conveyed the messuage, &amp;c. in fee. And the heir at law of Elizabeth Harding and of the testator brought an action to recover the messuage, &amp;c. After listening to argument for plaintiff, and stopping counsel on the other side, Lord C. J. Kenyon proceeded thus: \u201cCases of this kind have been so much agitated of late, that all the arguments occur readily to one\u2019s mind, and after the decisions we have made, we^ should not be consistent with ourselves, if we were not to hold, that the first taker <em>took </em>an estate tail in this case. It has been the settled doctrine of \"Westminster Hall for the last forty or fifty years, that there may be a <em>general </em>and a <em>particular </em>intent in a will, and that the latter must give way, when the former cannot otherwise be carried into effect. I remember that point was much discussed in the case of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson. </em>I heard it argued the first time before a very great lawyer, Sir Dudley Eyder, who then presided in this court. A second argument was directed, but he died before it came on. It was argued a second time before Lord Mansfield, and the certificate, which was afterwards returned upon the greatest deliberation is in print. Hothing could be more positive than the words of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>will in that case, to show the particular intent, that the first taker should take an estate for his life, <em>and no longer. </em>But there was a <em>general intent </em>apparent, <em>which could not be effected but by giving him an estate tail, </em>and on <em>that the decision was founded. </em>The case was carried up to the House of Lords, while Lord Hardwieke sat there, and was much considered by him; and questions were put to the judges upon it, framed by him in every possible shape; and Lord Ch. B. Parker, who is known to have been a very strict lawyer, delivered their opinions, agreeing with the judgment of this court. The same question came on again to be considered in <em>Roe d. Dodson v. Grew, 2 </em>Willes R. 323, in the court of Common Pleas, and was there much canvassed, and underwent the same determination. Then came on the case of <em>Doe d. Candler </em>v. <em>Smith, 7 </em>Term R. 531, in which I thought I could not make the matter more clear, than by reading the words of Lord C. J. Willes in <em>Roe d. Dodson </em>v. <em>Grew. </em>Perhaps we should best fulfill the particular intent of the testator in this case, by giving Bichard Cock only an estate for life; but the general intent was, that all his issue should inherit the entire estate, before it went over; and that intent can only be answered by giving him an estate tail by implication, from the subsequent words \u2018in default of his leaving issue.\u2019 It is suggested that it would answer the same purpose, if we were to raise cross remainders by implication between the children of R. C. But to do this between more than two, without any thing further than what appears here, would be directly contrary to former authorities.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-4\">Grose J. said: \u201cThe only question is, what, upon the whole of the will appears to have been the intent of the testator? and this has been truly stated to be, that Bich. Cock should first take the estate, <em>and after him his children, and that the remainder over should not take effect so long as any of his descendants remained. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Then this general intent can only be carried into effect by giving the first taker an estate tail.\u201d Lawrence J. that cross remainders could not be given to the issue of R. C., because it was a settled rule of law s^ou^ n\u00b0t tie implied between more than two; and said that it was very clear here, as 'in <em>Candler </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>that the testator\u2019s particular intent was, only to give R. G. an estate for life, because the issue were to take as tenants in common, and <em>therefore could not take hy descent; </em>yet in order to effectuate the general intent the estate of inheritance implied from the subsequent words must be annexed to the prior estate for life, given to the first taker. *</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-7\"><em>Wood </em>v. <em>Baron, </em>1 East R. 258, decided in 1801, is another case in which the word children has been held to be a word of limitation, although there was a child living at date of devise. The words were, \u201cI give and bequeath to my daughter Ann, the wife of Jos. Wood, all my whole estate, real and personal; also my household goods, &amp;c., who shall hold the same as a place of inheritance to her and her children or issue forever. And if it should so happen that my daughter Ann should die <em>leaving no child or children, </em>or if it so happen my daughter Ann\u2019s children should die without\u201cissue, then I order and direct that all my houses and lands, &amp;e. shall be sold and the money arising therefrom divided,\u201d &amp;c.; and he appointed his wife, to whom he had given his whole estate for life, before giving his daughter anything, and John Bithel one,of the legatees of the money arising from the sale directed if his daughter should die without leaving any child or children, and another, his executors. Tlis daughter had one child at date of will and several afterwards, and it was contended that according to Wild\u2019s case a child being in esse, mother and child must be held to take joint estates; but it was determined unanimously, Lord Kenyon presiding, that Ann Wood took an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>This is a much weaker case for an estate tail than the case at bar, for the inheritance being first given to the mother, and the limitation over being to take effect only upon her dying leaving no child or children, or issue of any child or children, there was no danger of disinheriting any of her issue, while in the case at bar the words of the limitation over extending expressly only to children, there is danger, if a literal and strict construction were adopted, of the grandchildren or issue of children being utterly disinherited. It would be vain to argue for any difference in the intention respectively, of the testators in these two cases. The intention of each was obviously the same, and is only more liberally and fully expressed by the one than the other. It is certain that Mr. Stone intended that part of his land which he carefully laid off and assigned to his daughter, should be a place of inheritance for her and her children; and it was only for the purpose of more certainly assuring it to her and her children as a place of inheritance, that ho determined to confine her to a life estate. And it is just as certain that he did not intend that it should go over so long as his daughter had any children or the issue of any children to enjoy it. That the devise in our case is expressly to Haney Perry for life can make no difference, as is shown by many cases. \u201cIt is immaterial,\u201d Lord Thur-low observes, in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>\u201cthat the testator meant the first estate to be an estate for life. I rest it upon what ho meant afterwards.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-4\">And how aptly do the words of Grose J. in <em>Cock </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>apply to this case. \u201c The only question is, what upon the whole will appears to have been the intent of the testator ? And this has been truly stated to be that Richard Cock (Haney Perry or Sally Stone), should first take the estate, and after him, his (her and her husband, her) children, and that the remainder over should not take effect so long as any of his (her) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>descendants remained. Then this general intent can only carried into effect by giving the first taker an estate tail.\u201d You cannot confine the first taker to a ^13 eslale5 and say that the remainder in fee shall vest in the first child that is born, subject to be divested in part on the birth of each subsequent child, who will take undivided shares likewise in fee, because, first, of the want of words of inheritance in the gift to the children; and secondly, supposing the statute dispensing with words of inheritance could apply, because if either of the children should die without issue, his share would pass from the family and could not go to the surviving children, as cross remainders could not he implied between them. <em>Jesson </em>v. <em>Wright, Cock </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>and other cases cited, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEk\">It is respectfully submitted that these decisions of the highest judicial tribunals in England, embracing some of the most important earlier and later cases on this vexed subject, show that according to the law, \u201cas it aforetime was,\u201d the testator\u2019s daughter Haney acquired an estate tail in the realty, and the absolute property in the personalty, given to her 'by the will. It is true some English cases may be found in conflict with these. But they are mostly the decisions of a single judge, and they will be found on examination to have proceeded on principles at war with those which prevailed in the earlier and in the later eases decided by the highest English tribunals, and to be therefore not entitled to respect even though they may not have been expressly overruled by the later decisions. The most distinguished of these cases, and the latest in point of time, is <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>1 P. Wms. 664, decided by Lord O. Parker in 1720. There the devise was to two nephews, \u201cand if either of them should depart this life and leave'to.o issue of their respective bodies, then he gave the leasehold to the daughter of his brother \u00a5m,. Gore, and the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>of his sister Sibly Price.\u201d Question, whether the limitation over was void as too remote ? The court below* was of opinion devise over was void, but Parker, on appeal, reversed the decree and said, \u201cthat if I devise a term to A., and if A. die without leaving issue, remainder over, in the vulgar and natural sense this must be intended if A. die without leaving issue at his death, and then the devise over is good.\u201d And further on he said: \u201cIf the words of a will can bear two senses, one whereof is more common and natural than the other, it is hard to say a court should take the will in the most uncommon meaning. To do what ? to destroy the will?\u201d And further he said: \u201cIt might be reasonable enough to take the same words as to different estates in different senses.\u201d As if a testator could intend to use the same words in their natural or more common sense as to personalty, and in a different or artificial sense as to realty. And he held, without any better reasoning or authority, that as to freehold an estate tail arose, but as to leasehold a life estate only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-6\">This judge had previously decided the cases of <em>Nichols </em>v.

It never could have been decided as it was in England, and never would have been so decided in this State, but for the controlling influence which the statute of 1776, abolishing entails, and that provision of .the statute of 1785, which dispenses with words of inheritance in order to create a fee, had upon the minds of the judges who sat in it. An examination of the separate opinions of those judges will render this perfectly obvious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-11\">This use of these statutes was contended for by Judges Coalter, the later Tucker and others, in many cases. In <em>Thomason </em>v. <em>Andersons, </em>4 Leigh 118, the latter contended for it and showed that in his opinion the deeison in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>was based upon it. He said, in arguing against the creation of an estate tail in that case, p. 126: \u201cAnd his children, had the estate ever vested in them, would have taken a fee as I think by the <em>operation of the statute- of </em>1785, <em>dispensing with words of inheritance </em>in the creation of estates in fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>simple. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Mun. 240.\u201d In <em>Bells </em>v. Gillespie, 5 Rand. 273, 302, Judge Coalter claims <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>to be a decision in favor of this use of the act, and asks, \u201cHas this case been overruled? It may be said that it has, because in many cases we have recognized the British doctrine in a search after the intention.\u201d At page 303, after alluding to the departure from the doctrine of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>in several later cases, and to the consequent passage of the act of 1819, restricting the meaning of a limitation over upon the death of the ancestor without heirs, or heirs of the body, or issue, or children, to a dying without such living at the time of the death, he said: \u201cSuppose the course of decision now indicated by the legislature had taken place soon after 1787; or had been considered as settled by the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>as it ought to have been, and persevered in since; could any one have complained ? So far from it, the act of 1819 would have been unnecessary.\u201d And on next page he said: \u201cThe only question now remaining for us to consider is, whether we can now throw off' the wrong and take up the right rule ? \u2014 If we cannot go back, cannot we now <em>re-assert </em>and <em>establish </em>the doctrine laid down.in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman,\u201d </em>&amp;c.?</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-5\">But the court pronounced against the use of these statutes in <em>Bells </em>v. <em>Gillespie, </em>notwithstanding the argument of Judge Coalter and the decision in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>and continued so to pronounce until in <em>See </em>v. <em>Craigen, </em>8 Leigh 449, Judge Tucker, the last advocate for this use of them, surrendered and gave up the point. At page 452, he said: \u201c This use of the statute has been attempted in many cases, but has been as repeatedly overruled. I have struggled for it in many cases, but have found myself in the woful minority of one. I must therefore surrender, and in doing so I must pronounce against the effect of the statute in this case.\u201d Since the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>trae doctrine has been in repeated cases held to be, in the language of Judge Brooke in <em>See </em>v. <em>Craigen, </em>\u201c that these acts can only apply in cases where the rules of construction, as the law aforetime was,\u2019 in respect to estates tail and executory devises, applied to the words in the deed or will, will not be affected.\u201d The principles and grounds of the decision in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>having been thus discarded, the case itself has been overruled, as is clearly indicated in the remarks of Judge Coalter above quoted, and cannot now be regarded as an authority against us, even if that and our case were exactly alike, which we have shown is not the fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-9\">The Virginia eases, both prior and subsequent to those above commented on, which have met with almost universal favor, about which there has been scarcely any dissatisfaction expressed, and which must now be taken to furnish the law upon the questions here involved, are very numerous; and commencing with <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>2 Wash. 9, come down to <em>Tinsley </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>13 Gratt. 284. Most of these earlier cases are brought in review by Judge Carr in <em>Bells </em>v. <em>Gillespie, </em>5 Rand. 273-280, <em>et seq.; </em>and I will not stop to state or comment on them. ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-10\"><em>Bells </em>v. <em>Gillespie </em>is an important case. It was thoroughly argued by bench and bar. After giving each of five sons a fee simple in different tracts of land, the testator says, \u00a3\u00a3 My will is, if either of my sons should die without lawful issue, that the part allotted them be <em>equally divided among the surviving brothers, </em>children, of my last wife.\u201d Judge Carr, p. 277, asks, \u201cwhat did he mean ? Bid he look to a definite or indefinite failure of issue in the first takers ? It seems to me clear that the land given to each son should be enjoyed by the family of that son so long as any branch- of it remained; and that whenever it failed the land should go over. Each son and his family were the first ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>jects of his bounty, as to that part of his land given to each; his other sons and their families the second. Suppose P. Bell had left a child at his death, and that \u25a0 child had died the day or the hour after him. Did the testator mean in such case that his other sons should have no part of or interest in P. Bell\u2019s land? \"Why he &lt; should postpone their interests to the failure of the issue of P. Bell, I can clearly see, but I cannot perceive why time should be so important with him as that he should say to his other sons, \u2018 though it is my will that you have the land of P. Bell if he has no child at his death, yet if he leave a child' you shall not have it, though that child die the next hour.\u2019 If he had had this idea in his mind would it not have been more natural and direct to have said, \u2018 it is my will that if either of my sons die without issue <em>living at his death </em>his part shall be equally divided among his surviving brothers?\u201d\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnO\">How strong, pertinent and apposite are these observations to the case now in hand. It is impossible to read Caleb Stone\u2019s will without being impressed with the conviction that as to the land he gave to each of his daughters, he intended it should be enjoyed by each daughter and her immediate family so long as any branch of it remained; and that it should never go over to the other children, while any issue of that daughter was in being, whether that issue were children, grandchildren or great grandchildren. Indeed in one aspect our case is a stronger case for an estate tail than <em>Bells </em>v. Gillespie, for in the latter, the fee being first given to each son, if he had any issue at his death, that issue, whether children or remote descendants, could take the whole estate, whereas here a life estate only being given- expressly to each daughter, and the limitation over being on failure' of children, and not issue, unless the daughter take an estate tail, none but children could take at her death, and they only for life, there being no words of inheritance superadded to the devise to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>In Bells <em>v. Gillespie, </em>great reliance was placed on tlie words \u201c that the part of the land of any son dying without issue should <em>be equally divided among the surviving </em>brothers,\u201d to tie up the failure of issue to the death, an&lt;^ ^uc^e Carr referred to several cases, English and Virginian, to show that these words could not properly have this effect. Among others, to <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Salter, </em>17 Ves. R. 479, in which the devise was in these words, \u201c all my estate, real and personal, to my daughter M. V., to her and her heirs; and half the navigation money for her natural life; and in case she dies without issue, all to be divided between my four nephews and nieces, dST., W., O. and E.; C.\u2019s part only for life, and her part to be divided between the survivors.\u201d The bill was filed by one of the nephews against the daughter, praying that the nephews and nieces might be declared entitled in the event of the daughter\u2019s dying without issue living at her death; and praying an account accordingly. It ivas admitted that there was no real estate, and this makes the ease the stronger, for it is well known that slighter words will be taken to tie up the failure of issue to the death in personal than in real property. The master of the rolls went into the consideration of the words, <em>in c\u00e1se she dies without issue. </em>The judges in some of the early cases, he said, had inclined to hold these words to mean issue at the death of the person named, but he thought that ever since the case of <em>Beauclerk </em>v. <em>Dormer, </em>a different rule had prevailed. The single circumstance relied on in this case in favor of the restrictive construction is, that one of the four persons to whom the bequest over is made, is to take a life interest in her part, which is to be divided equally among the survivors. But in the case at bar it is not even survivors; - it is that the land shall be divided among <em>all my children.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-4\">The cases of <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>1 Call 165; <em>Broaddus </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>5 Rand. 308; <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>6 Id. 73, are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>the same effect, and are strong and pertinent authority for the construction for which we contend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-4\">The case of <em>Bramble </em>v. <em>Billups, </em>4 Leigh 90, runs on all fours with the case at bar. There is no substantial difference between the limitations in the two cases. Children is certainly as much a word of limitation in a will technically as offspring is, and there is nothing in our case, not a single circumstance, which is not present in this case, to show that Caleb Stone, rather than Matthias Christian, mean by the word children, only such children as should be living at his daughter\u2019s death. The intention of Christian to provide for the issue of his daughter generally, and that the issue, if any, should take the whole estate, is manifested by the fact that he only limits it over in the event of her having none. The same intention on the part of Caleb Stone is evinced by the same circumstance. But the offspring could not take the whole estate, if the term offspring Avere held to be a word of purchase, because of the absence of words of inheritance in the gift to them. The life estate of the parents was therefore raised into a fee tail. The same reason and necessity for the same thing exists here; and shall a different result be arrived at.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-5\">The power of appointment given to Bramble and wife, it was insisted, tied down the failure of issue to the death of the survivor of them, because it must be intended such issue as they could [appoint to; and it seems that such a power has been permitted, in some cases, to have a controlling influence in this respect. But in many others such influence has been denied to it. Yet it cannot be denied that it is a circumstance tending to show that the testator intended only such issue as should be living at the death. <em>That indicium </em>of such an intent is absent from the case at bar. It is not in the power of any ingenuity to distinguish between these cases with the view of showing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>testator Christian intended to provide for all the issue of his daughter, and that the testator, Stone, did not intend to provide for all the issue of his daughter. That the word offspring is used in one case and children in the other, can make no difference against us here, as many cases to which I have referred, and the next case to which I shall refer, <em>Thomason </em>v. <em>Andersons, </em>4 Leigh 118, abundantly show. Indeed the necessity for giving an estate tail, in order to effectuate the general intent of the testator, is greater, because of the use of the word children; for used as a <em>designatio persones </em>the word offspring would embrace children and other descendants, however remote, while children, construed to be a <em>word </em>of <em>purchase, </em>would not; and thus the chances of defeating the intention in favor of all the issue, would be greater in the latter case than the former.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-8\">The whole opinion of Judge Carr in this case is a forcible argument in favor of the appellants here. I beg to refer the court to his exposition of the force or effect, of the expressions, \u201cif any by my daughter Lydia,\u201d and \u201cif they have any,\u201d &amp;c., and \u201cif they have none,\u201d on p. 94, which are almost identical with the terms employed by the testator here, in the devise to Fancy Perry. On p. 95 he refers to and approves the decision in Doe v. <em>Goldsmith, </em>7 Taunt. 209, \u201cwhere the devise was t\u00f3 F. G. for life, and <em>immediately </em>after his decease to the heirs of his body lawfully begotten, in <em>such parts </em>and <em>shares </em>as F. G. should by deed or will appoint, and in default of <em>such </em>heirs of the body of F. G., <em>then immediately </em>after his decease, over to J. G.;\u201d and the question was whether F. G. took an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-9\">Chief Justice Gibbs in delivering the opinion of the court, thus states the argument of the counsel, who contended that F. G. took an estate for life only: \u2018 That the words heirs of the body mean children of F. G., for when he devises to the heirs of the body of F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Gr. in such shares as the tenant for life shall appoint, <em>that </em>is a gift to <em>persons </em>who must be <em>in esse </em>when F. G-. was to appoint to them; that the default of <em>such </em>issue must therefore be a default of <em>such </em>persons, who can only be children, and that the testator by this expression, therefore manifestly means to refer to the same persons who wore to take as tenants in common under the appointment, not to the heirs of the body of the first taker in the ordinary legal sense.\u2019 But the court, admitting all this it would seem, \u201csaid, \u2018it is an established rule, that where a general intent appears, any <em>particular intent </em>which appears, <em>however clearly </em>expressed, shall never take effect when it is inconsistent with the general intent; and it was clearly the testator\u2019s general intent that the estate should never go over to \u00abJ. G-. till all of the heirs of the body of F. Gr. were extinct,\u2019 and <em>therefore </em>it was an estate tail in F. Gr.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-4\">Judge Tucker, who dissented, after arguing that the word offspring was a word of purchase, as shown by the power of appointment, proceeded, p. 105, to examine the terms of the limitation to Bramble and wife, and to their offspring, for the purpose of showing that only such offspring could take as should be living at the death of the survivor. He said, \u201c the devise is to them and the longest liver of them, and <em>then </em>to their offspring <em>if any. </em>If any, when ? The answer seems to be echoed by the clause, if any then, <em>at that time. </em>To what could he be considered as so naturally referring as to that time of which he had just spoken, namely, the termination of the particular estate? Can he be supposed to have intended no definite period, to have meant <em>if any </em>in the long succession of generations ? I think not.\u201d Yet in next p. 107, he said, \u201cIt is said that the testator did not design the estate to go over to the offspring of Molly Baynes and Haney Ashley as long as there were any descendants of his daughter Lydia by J ohm <em>Bramble; this cannot be denied. </em>It is then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>said that, if the words are not construed to give an estate tail, the descendants of Lydia after the first generation he cut off, since the offspring, if they took as purchasers, would only take estates for life, there being no inheritable words in the bequest to them. This position cannot he admitted.\u201d He then referred to several cases which were relied on to sustain this position. \u201cIn <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Applin, </em>4 T. R. 82,\u201d he proceeded, \u201cthe devise was to A. for life, and after his decease <em>to and amongst </em>his issue, and in default of issue, then over: A. took a fee tail, and for this obvious reason, that as the issue could not take more than an estate for life, <em>for toant of words of inheritance, </em>the estate would go over from the grandchildren, notwithstanding the clear-intent to postpone the remainder so long as there should be issue or descendants of A. In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>7 T. R. 531, the devise was to A. and the heirs of her body forever, <em>as tenants in common, </em>and not as joint tenant^, and in case she died before twenty-one or (and) without <em>leaving </em>issue of her body, then to B. Held, A. took an estate tail avowedly upon the necessity to effectuate the general intent. And Lord Kenyon said there are no words of limitation added to the estate given to the <em>children </em>(supposing they took as purchasers), and yet the remainder over is not to take effect until there is a general failure of her issue, <em>so that there must he an estate to comprehend all her children </em>forever.\u201d And -having referred to <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Goldsmith </em>and <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Cooper, 1 </em>East R. 229, he continued, \u201cIn all of these cases, then, the want of superadded words of inheritance -upon the devise to the issue, so as to give them -heritable estates instead of estates for life, was the obvious, and in some of them the avowed principle of decision. Eor if we attend to the course of argument-in all of them-, both of the bar and bench, it is very 'manifest that the power of appointment, the direction <em>to divide the estate amongst them, </em>and the provision that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>they should hold as tenants in common, would in these . t, v .. cases, as m <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Laming, </em>have prevented the implication of an estate tail, if there had been superadded words of inheritance. Thus in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>Lord Kenyon, speaking of <em>Atherton </em>v. <em>Dye, </em>said, \u2018in that case there were words of limitation added to the devise to the daughters, and <em>this forms a principal ground of distinction </em>;\u2019 and in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>in speaking of <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Laming, </em>which had been cited, he said, \u2018that case is distinguishable from this, for there were words of limitation superadded.\u2019 .... If then the existence of an inheritable estate in the issue or offspring is the point upon which those cases turn in which there is a limitation to the issue to take in a manner different from the law of descents, then, I say, that that is furnished in the case before us by the <em>statute </em>of 1785, which declares that a fee shall be construed to be conveyed where there is no restriction either by express words or by construction of law.\u201d And the distinguished judge proceeded to argue, p. 110, that by operation of that statute the offspring of Bramble and wife, living at the death of the survivor of them, would take a fee simple estate; \u201cand thus the whole generation of the testator\u2019s daughter would, in succession, come to the estate, unless it should be aliened by those in whom it might rest. And thus there would be no ground for implying an estate tail by forcibly converting a designation of the persons to take into words of limitation.\u201d And thus his honor shows the utter impracticability of confining the first taker in the case at bar to a life estate, and holding the word children to be a word of purchase, consistently with the well established principles upon which similar cases have proceeded; for it is now well established that the statute of 1785 cannot be invoked to give the children the fee. In the language of Judge Brooke in this very case, 101, that statute can only be applied where the rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>construction, \u201cas the law aforetime was,\u201d in respect to estates tail and executory devises applied to the words in the deed or will, will not be affected. And thus this, argument of Judge Tucker becomes a powerful and impregnable one, in favor of the implication of an estate tail in the case at bar; for holding throughout that it was the true intent and meaning of the testator, and the true construction of his will, that the offspring, if any, <em>living at the death, </em>should take the land, and if none, in default of <em>such </em>offspring, that is, offspring living at the death, then, and then only, the land should go over; he admits and shows, that if such offspring could not take by purchase an estate in fee; that if, taking by purchase, they would be confined to estates for life, and the daughter\u2019s grandchildren would be unprovided for, that then, in order to effectuate the general intent, such an. estate must be given to the mother \u201cas would comprehend all her children forever;\u201d although it was the obvious intention of testator that she should take only an estate for life, and that her offspring, if any, <em>living at her death, </em>should take by purchase. This is as strong a statement of the case for the appellees in the case at bar as can possibly be made for them. The extremest extent of their pretensions can only be, that the word children must be taken to' be a word of purchase, and to embrace and refer to children living at the death; and yet, even then, this distinguished judge, who was an advocate for the restricted construction, admits that unless the statute of 1785 could be used to give the children the fee, then a fee tail must be given to the mother. That this statute' cannot be so used, has been for many years authoritatively decided. The judge (Tucker) was the last advocate for this use of the act, on the bench, and he, in <em>See </em>v. <em>Craigen, </em>8 Leigh 449, conceding that it had been pronounced against in several cases, gracefully surrendered -the point, and in doing so pronounced for an estate tail in that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>That case differed from <em>Bramble </em>v. <em>Billups, </em>in this, ' that the devise was, \u201cI give and bequeath to my daughter Phoebe Couchman the upper half of my plantation, to be equally divided between her and John Oraigen as to quality and quantity; but should my said daughter die without heirs of her own body, it is then my will and desire that said half of my plantation should be divided between my son-in-law John Oraigen and my son Adam See.\u201d The devise being to P. O. indefinitely, and therefore, by the rules of the common law, only for life, Judge Tucker said, \u201cif under our law you consider P. O. as taking a fee by the operation of the act of 1785, then there is a good devise to her of the fee with a limitation over upon her dying without heirs of the body, by way of executory devise, and thus the whole line of her descendants will take, according to the manifest general intent, without the necessity of creating an estate tail.\u201d But the court again decided, and now unanimously, that that act could only be applied in cases in which by its application the rules of construction \u201c as the law aforetime was,\u201d in respect to estates tail and executory devises, applied to the words in the deed or will, will not be affected. In this case the proposition was to add words of inheritance to the devise to the first taker P. C. In <em>Bramble </em>v <em>Billups, </em>and in the case at bar, it was and is proposed to add them to the devise to the offspring or children. The effort failed in those cases, and they control this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-8\">In <em>Thomason </em>v. <em>Andersons, </em>4 Leigh. 118, the devise was, \u201c I give to P. A., my natural daughter, 100 acres of land, two negroes, one feather bed, &amp;c., to her and her heirs forever. My further will and desire is tliat if she should die <em>leaving no child, </em>the estate before given should <em>return </em>into my estate and <em>be divided amongst all my children ; but should she leave a living child or children, then </em>the estate shall be heired by him, her or them, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the case may be.\u201d By a slight transposition of the clauses of the ulterior limitations here they are made substantially identical with those in the case at bar, as most strongly interpreted for the app ellees. Thus: My further will is, that should she leave a <em>living </em>child or children, then the estate before given shall be heired by him, her or them, as the case may be; but should she die <em>leaving </em>no child, then the estate shall return into my estate, and be divided amongst all my children.\u201d This transposition improves the grammatical construction, does not alter the sense, and presents more strikingly the similarity between the limitations in the two cases. But to make the limitations here precisely identical with those in our case, it is only necessary to omit certain words-which are in fact absent from our case, and on which great reliance has in some cases been placed to tie down the failure of issue to the death, and then it will read thus: \"My further will is, that should she leave (have at her death) any children, then the estate shall be heired by them (shall be equally divided between them); but should she die without any (should she have none), then the estate (land) shall be equally divided among all my children.\u201d In this statement of our case all is conceded that is or can be asked for by the appellees, and yet it is at once apparent, that it is a much stronger case for an estate tail than the case under consideration. The very important \u2014 so held in some cases \u2014 restrictive phrases, should she <em>leave </em>a living child or children;\u201d \u2014 should she die leaving no child;\u201d \u2014 \"should return into my estate,\u201d are wanting in our case, and besides the fee was first given to the daughter P. A., and there was therefore less necessity for creating an estate tail in her, in order to provide for all her issue. See the remarks of Judge Tucker in this case and in <em>See </em>v. <em>Craigen. </em>Yet the court without hesitation, Judge Carr delivering a most emphatic opinion, in which Judges Cabell and Brooke con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>curred, pronounced in favor of an estate tail in the <em>\u2019 r </em>daughter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-6\">Judge Carr, p. 122, said, \u201cDid the testator mean to provide for his daughter and her issue indefinitely ? If so, this is an estate tail, no matter how he may have expressed himself, or with what conditions or limitations he may have attempted to clog it.\u201d After quoting the clause he continued, \u201c Can any one look upon it and not perceive that it was the intention of the testator to provide for the daughter and her whole line of descendants ? When this intent is clear, the words <em>child or children </em>are taken to mean issue.\u201d Judge Tucker, upon these points said, \u201c As to that portion of his estate set apart for that branch of his family, it is natural that the testator should have preferred her children to <em>his own </em>legitimate children (the daughter was an illegitimate child), and that he should have designed what he bequeathed to her to go to her posterity instead of coming back to the posterity of his other children, who had their shares of his bounty provided by other parts of his will.\u201d But he contended that the daughter took the fee subject to be defeated upon her death without a child or grandchild, and not a fee tail, remarking \u201c the word child or children is indeed construed to mean issue or heirs of the body, when such a construction is absolutely necessary, but not otherwise. But I know of no case in which the words <em>child or 'children living at the death, </em>&amp;c., have been so construed, where the parent herself has an express estate <em>in fee </em>limited to her by a prior clause of the will.\u201d And it is thus apparent that he would have concurred ' with the other judges but for the fact that the fee was first given to the daughter, coupled with the use of the restrictive phrases above referred to, all of which are absent from the case at bar. The only circumstances in which that case differs from ours, are the circumstances upon which the dissenting judge relied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>to rebut the implication of an estate tail. That case then must rule this, unless it has been itself overruled. so far from having been overruled, the principles TP011 which it proceeded have been over and over af^rmec^ an^110 word of disapprobation of it has ever escaped bench or bar. Judge Carr made, pp. 123, 4, some further remarks, which I cannot forbear quoting,, as they contain a most powerful argument in favor of an estate tail here, an argument which is indeed entitled to more weight in our case than that, because of the greater risks of disinheriting the issue in our case than in that; indeed because of the absolute certainty of disinheriting all of the issue in our case after the first generation, should it be held that the mother took only an estate for life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-6\">Said he: \u201cIf I. considered it doubtful, upon the face of the will, whether this were a fee tail or a fee with an executory devise over, I should feel inclined, on several grounds, to lean against the executory devise.\u201d And adverting to the rule lad down by Lord Hale in <em>Purefoy </em>v. Rogers, \u201cthat where a contingency is limited to depend on an estate of freehold which is capable of supporting a remainder, it shall never be construed to be an executory devise, but a contingent remainder only;\u201d and to the fact that am executory devise establishes a perpetuity, to its extent putting fetters upon the estate which may often last for a century, he continued, \u201cbut I do not think it at all doubtful. The testator was making provision for his daughter and her issue; would he make such a disposition of his property as, in certain events, not at all improbable, would carry it over to others, though there were descendants of his daughter in being or just coming into life? Yet such might be the case if this were taken as-an executory devise, which we know is a limitation of a future interest, not to take effect at the testator\u2019s death, but limited to arise and vest on some future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>contingency. The contingency here would be the death of the daughter without a child living. The moment this happened the executory devise would take effect, and the estate vest in the legitimate children of the testator, and no subsequent event could divest it. Suppose the daughter had had six children who had all died in her lifetime, each leaving five children, and then the daughter died, she would die without leaving <em>any . child </em>living, and the estate would be taken from her family though she left thirty <em>grandchildren. </em>It may be said the word children sometimes comprehends grandchildren, and under that meaning these would be taken in. But if grandchildren were comprehended, no one would contend that great grandchildren were, and it might well happen that the daughter might die leaving only such.\u201d And as shown by Sir Edwdrd Sugden in <em>Jesson </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>and by Judge Carr in <em>Bramble </em>v. <em>Billups, </em>it might well happen that the daughter should die leaving only one child, and thirty grandchildren, the issue of deceased children, and in this event, in the case at bar, the grandchildren could take nothing. But for still another reason in our case the grandchildren could in no event take anything, and even children could take only an estate for life, viz: because of the absence of words of inheritance. Could this testator have designed such a result? \"Would he not have disclaimed the use of the word children in its natural sense, if these consequences, unnatural and revolting to his heart, had been pointed out to him? And are not the courts well justified in adopting that construction of the testator\u2019s language which will best effectuate his main design, even though his particular design may be frustrated?</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-6\">The principles of these eases have been applied and the cases approved in various subsequent cases. <em>Nowlin </em>v. <em>Winfree, </em>8 Gratt. 356; <em>Callis </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>11 Gratt. 78; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>12 Gratt. 135, in which the testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>tor said, \u201cand it is my express desire that the parts of my estate which shall go to my daughters M.

We are taught, however, by the decision of Sir W. Grant, in <em>Donn </em>v. <em>Penney, </em>that the <em>doctrine </em>of the case of <em>Pinbury </em>v. <em>Elkin will not be applied </em>to any case in which the <em>variation of phrase </em>is such as fairly to take it out of the reach of its authority.\u201d And then in the same and next pages, the learned judge shows that stronger manifestation of intention to use the words of the limitation over in a restricted sense will be required in a case in which a life estate only is given to the ancestor, than in a case in which a fee simple is given to him. \u201cIn the latter case the issue may inherit from him or his heirs at law or derive it from him by deed or will; whereas in the former they cannot get it at all\u201d (or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>our case but for life), \u201cif the words be construed in a restricted sense; and it is therefore necessary to construe them in a technical sense to effectuate the intention of the testator. There can be no conceivable motive for limiting the estate over only in the event of the ancestor\u2019s dying without issue, but that the issue, if any, may have the estate\u201d (or in our case \u201c only in the event of the ancestor\u2019s dying' without children, but that the children, if any, should take it to them and their heirs forever\u201d). The restrictive words should therefore be <em>extremely strong </em>to require such a construction as would deprive the issue of any possible means of succeeding to the\u201d <em>whole </em>\u201cestate.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-6\">He then shows that the statute of 1785 could not be used to give the ancestor in that case an estate of inheritance; and by the same reasoning, and by the definitive determination of the whole court in <em>See </em>v. <em>Craigen, </em>it cannot be used to give the children here an estate of inheritance, and the result in either case must equally be, that the ancestor must take an estate tail in order that the intention in favor of all the issue may be effectuated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-8\">The learned judge then, p. 297, referred to the case of <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Duffield, </em>6 Gratt. 456, which had been relied on by counsel to show that the words <em>\u201cdie </em>without issue\u201d were used in a restricted sense, and manifestly disapproving and \u201cwithout undertaking to reconcile that case with others on the same subj ect,\u201d an undertaking which, it must be confessed, it would be very difficult successfully to accomplish, he said, \u201cit is plainly distinguishable from <em>See </em>v. <em>Craigen </em>and other cases therein referred to, in this, that the land there was devised to <em>~W. </em>H. <em>to him and his heirs.\u201d </em>\u2014 \u201cThe decision, I imagine, would have been different if a life estate only had been given by the will to \"W. D., and the manifest general intent in favor of the issue could only have been effected by enlai-ging that life estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>into an estate in tail.\u201d The phraseology in <em>Tinsley </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>is evidently more restrictive than in the case at A glance at it is sufficient to show this. \u201cIt is m7 will ^ m7 said son J. F. B. die without issue, that ProPerty heretofore given him <em>shall go to his brother F. B., </em>who in that case will lose the land heretofore given him. It being my will and desire <em>then, </em>and in <em>that case, </em>and upon the <em>happening </em>of the <em>event of my son J. F. B.\u2019s death, </em>that the land near <em>~W., </em>which would otherwise be F. B.\u2019s share, be sold, and the money <em>equally divided between my surviving </em>children.\u201d Here is present a circumstance too which in some cases has been held to tie up the failure of issue to the death, to wit, the limitation over is first to the surviving brother, without words of inheritance, and then to the testator\u2019s surviving children, without words of inheritance. Yet his honor, without hesitation, pronounced in favor of an estate tail in J. F. B., who died without ever having had any issue, adding, \u201c it is n'ot material to enquire whether the remainder to F. B. is to take effect on the death of J. F. B. without issue <em>indefinitely, </em>or without issue <em>living at his death; </em>as, by the act for docking entails, <em>all remainders, </em>whether <em>contingent or vested, </em>depending on an estate tail, are utterly barred; and as the case occurred before the act of 1819, giving effect to every limitation upon such an estate, which would be valid when limited upon an estate in fee simple created by technical language.\u201d And he referred to a long line of eases, commencing with <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>and ending with <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Brooks, ubi supra, </em>to sustain the principles on which his opinion was based. 2 Jarman 440-1 marg., 315-16 top, 312 top, 435 marg., 315 top, 440 marg.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-6\">Treating the question as I have hitherto, as if the testator had employed the same words in making the devise to his daughter Sally that are employed in the \u25a0clause making a similar devise to his daughter Haney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Perry, I submit with confidence that upon principle and authority, Sally must take a fee tail in the land. \u201cAnd if as applied to real estate the clause created an estate tail in the daughters, in such case the full and entire interest in personalty will pass to them; as an estate tail in personal property gives the absolute dominion.\u201d Allen P. in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>12 Gratt. 135, 144. Mr. Jarman (2 Jarman 300 top, 418 marg.) says, \u201cthe established legal construction of the several expressions, \u2018if he die without issue/ \u00a3if he have no issue/ \u00a3or if he have no issue/ or \u00a3if he die before he has any issue/ or \u2018for want or in default of issue/ unexplained by the context, and whether applied to <em>real </em>or <em>personal </em>estate, notwithstanding the distinction taken between these two species of property in some of the early <em>cases, </em>\u2014 Target v. <em>Gaunt, Pleydell </em>v. <em>Pleydell, Nichols </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>1 P. <em>W., </em>is that they import a general indefinite failure of issue.\u201d He adds, \u201cthis rule, however, admits of two exceptions, the first where the phrase is, \u2018leaving no issue/ with respect to which the settled doctrine is, that applied to real estate it means an indefinite failure of issue, but in reference to personal estate it imports a failure of issue <em>at the death. Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>is the leading authority for this distinction, but it has been confirmed by a long line of subsequent decisions;\u201d and he refers to many cases which on examination will be found not to support the proposition. Amongst them is <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Drew, Agar </em>v. <em>Agar, Wollen </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>and others, which show that \u201cleaving\u201d makes no difference. Lord Kenyon, in <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>denied the soundness of this distinction, as did Lord Thurlow in <em>Boggs </em>v. <em>Beasley, </em>and Mr. Jarman, though an advocate for the distinction, admits, at p. 307 top, 427 marg., that the difference has been much narrowed by the later decisions. The decisions which proceeded upon this distinction in England and in Virginia were never received with favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>by the profession, and it is not a little remarkable that tbe earlier and later cases, in both countries, either ignore or deny the soundness of the distinction. Judge Lomax, 3 Lomax Dig. 434 top, 308 marg., says of it: \u201cThe rule of decision first intimated by Boane, J., in <em>Higginbotham </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>in 1800, and repeated in several cases following in rapid succession down to <em>Didlake </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>in 1820, was brought under reconsidei\u2019ation in <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>in 1829, and was entirely overruled.\u201d Carr and Green, Js., in <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>expressly disapproving <em>Timberlake </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>&amp;c., held that the principles governing the decisions in <em>Bells </em>v. <em>Gillespie, &amp;c., </em>applied to that case, where the subject was personalty, and Coalter, J., used this pointed language: \u201cAs the executory bequest of the <em>personal </em>estate, was limited over in the same words with the executory devise of the <em>real, </em>and was intended to take effect at the same time, upon the same contingency, upon the same failure of issue, the executory bequest of the <em>personal </em>subject was also ineffectual.\u201d The rule re-established in <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>has been followed in <em>Callava </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>3 Leigh 103; <em>Deane </em>v. <em>Hansford, Nowlin </em>v. <em>Winfree, </em>and <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Brooks, ubi supra, </em>all cases of personalty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-9\">That the use of the word lend makes no difference in the construction is shown by various cases. A loan for life and a gift for life amount to the same thing. <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, Deane </em>v. <em>Hansford, Callis </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>and others, <em>ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-10\">In addition to the various cases above referred to, showing that the use of the word \u201cchildren\u201d makes no difference in the construction, where it is necessary to give the ancestor an estate tail in order to give effect to the paramount intent of admitting all the issue, I beg to refer to 2 Fearne 268, and <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>4 Bar. and Adol. 43, there stated, which is very much like the case at bar; 2 Fearne 219, \u00a7 436, and remarks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>of Green, J., in <em>Bells </em>v. Gillespie, 5 Rand. 273, 287, and Lord Mansfield, <em>Davie </em>v. Stevens, 1 Doug. 321-4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-4\">There is still another view which makes it imperative that the construction for which we contend should be placed on this will. \u201cAll limitations and executory interests, except those in remainder after, or en-grafted on an estate tail, must be so limited that from the very first moment of their limitation, it may be said that they will necessarily vest, in right, if at all, within the period occupied by the life or lives of a person or persons in being, and twenty-one years and ten months thereafter. And it is not enough that the limitation <em>may </em>take effect, within a life or lives in being, and twenty-one years afterwards; or that in the events which have happened, it would take effect within that period, though under other circumstances it might not; it must have been so limited that from the first moment of its creation, it could be said, that it must necessarily vest, if at all, within one of the periods mentioned. And hence it follows that real or personal estate cannot be limited to the children of a person who is not in esse at the date of the will, so as to enable such children to take as purchasers, even though their parents may happen to be born before the death of the testator, unless the testator expressly limits the property to the children of a person who shall be born in his, the testator\u2019s, lifetime.\u201d 2 Fearne; Smith\u2019s Original View, part III, ch. 4, \u00a7 1 and 2, pp. 391-2; 1 Jarman 254 top, 220 marg.; 1 Leigh 362 top, 329 marg.; Carr, J. <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Thompson. </em>And this rule applies, not only to executory devises and bequests, but to all contingent remainders, except those engrafted on an estate tail. 1 Jarm. 258 top, 225-6 marg., 2 Jarm. 515 top, 728 marg., 519 top, 734 marg. And it is thus seen that the bare possibility, <em>potmiiaremotissima </em>(no matter how great the improbability), of the occurrence of events, <em>subsequent </em>to the <em>date </em>of the will, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>which would have let in. objects beyond the perpetuity line, or would have postponed th\u00e9 vesting, in interest, the period mentioned, is sufficient to defeat the limitations. 1 Jarman 263 top, where he says, \u201cin apru^e regard is -had to <em>possible </em>not <em>actual </em>events.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-7\">How the land given to the testator\u2019s daughter Sally, is \u201cto be possessed by her and <em>any </em>husband she <em>may </em>have, on the same terms and conditions as Haney' Perry\u2019s.\u201d Putting out of view all ideas of an estate tail, and conceding that the devise to Sally is to be construed as if the testator had used in making it the same language employed in making the devise to Haney and her children, &amp;c., and it must then be conceded that Sally\u2019s husband, had she married, would have acquired a contingent life estate in the land; contingent upon his surviving her, and remaining her widower till his death. She was at the date of the will quite a young girl; not more than 10 or 11 years old. The will is dated in 1807, and was probated in 1810. Sally died in 1857, being about 61 years old, fifty years after the making of the will, and forty-seven after the testator\u2019s death. It was, therefore, at the date of the devise, and even at the death of the testator, if not very probable, yet by no means impossible, that Sally should marry a man, who was not <em>in esse, </em>at the date of the will or death of testator. It was not impossible that she should have children by such marriage. It was not impossible that she should die leaving such husband and children behind her; and that he should remain single for the balance of his life, and after surviving her for a period longer than twenty-one years, that he should die leaving the children surviving him. It will not do to argue from the events that have occurred, nor to say that the occurence of those supposed was extremely improbable. The first would be, in the words of Lord Brougham in construing Lord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Vere\u2019s will, quoted by Jarman, vol. 1, 266 top, 239 marg., \u201cto rely upon an accident,\u201d and tbe second assumes that the application of the rule depends upon the probability or improbability of the occurrence of the hypothecated events. The same argument was attempted in <em>Jee </em>v. <em>Audley, </em>stated 1 Jarman 276-7 top, 254-5-6 marg., where the validity of the limitation depended on the question, whether John Jee and Elizabeth his wife would have any daughters after the date of the will, or death of testator; and it was contended, \u201cthat <em>there was no real possibility o\u00ed </em>their having children after testator\u2019s death, as they were <em>then seventy years old.\u201d </em>But Sir Lloyd Kenyon said, \u201cthe general principles which apply to this case are not disputed; limitations of personal estate are void, unless they necessarily vest, if at all, within a life or lives in being and twenty-one years and nine or ten months after-wards. This has been sanctioned by the opinions of judges of all times, from the time of the duke of Norfolk\u2019s case to the present; it is grown reverend by age and is not now to be broken in upon. I am desired to do in this case something which I do not feel myself at liberty to do, namely, to suppose it impossible for persons at so advanced an age as John and Elizabeth Jee to have children; but if this can be done in one case, it may in another, and it is a very dangerous experiment, and introductive of the greatest inconvenience, to give a latitude to such sort of conjecture. Another thing pressed on me is, to decide upon the events which have happened; but I cannot do this without overturning very many cases. The single \u2022question before me is, not whether the limitation is good in the events which have happened, but whether it was good in its creation; and if it was not I cannot make it so. Then must the limitation, if at all, necessarily take place within the limits prescribed by law?\u201d And after stating the case he answered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u201cmost certainly not; because John and Elizabeth Jee might have children born ten years after the testator\u2019s, death, and then Mary Hall <em>might die without issue fifty years afterwards; </em>in which case it would transgress the-rule prescribed.\u201d And so in our case the question, propounded by Sir Lloyd must receive the same answer. If Sally is to be confined to a life estate; if the devise gave her an estate for life, with contingent remainder for life to any husband she might have, with contingent remainder for life, or in fee, to \u00b0 her children who should survive her husband, as in the case above hypothecated; and with a substitutional of alternative remainder for life or in fee to testator\u2019s children, then all these remainders are void; because in the events supposed the vesting in interest would be postponed beyond the limits prescribed by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-8\">It will not do to say that in the case supposed the children of Sally living at her death would then be-ascertained; for some of them might die in the lifetime of the surviving husband, and those only could take who were living at his death. If none were living then, then the remainder to the testator\u2019s children would, if not void, take effect. Both the remainders-continue contingent up to the death of the husband-Then, and not till then, could it be ascertained who should take. Uor will it do to argue, that as the limitation to the testator\u2019s children is to them simply without words of inheritance, that therefore such only of them as should survive the husband could take; and as they were, all <em>in esse </em>at the testator\u2019s death or in ten months afterwards, it may be said that the remainder to them must vest, if at all, within the prescribed period. The case of <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Thompson, ubi supra, </em>furnishes a complete answer to this argument. Said Green J. in that case, p. 372 top, \u201cwhen a preceding limitation is too remote, all that succeed it, even although limited to take effect in good time, are de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>fieated. Thus in <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Bishop of Bath and Wells, </em>2 H. Blacks. R. 358, a devise to the first or other son of T. P. (he having none), that should be bred a man and be in holy orders, and to his heirs and assigns; but if T. P. shall have no Such son, then to his grandson T. M. and his heirs. T. P. <em>died without ever having had a son; </em>and it was held that the first limitation over to that son if he had one was too remote, as none could take holy orders until the age of <em>twenty-four, </em>and as T. P. <em>might </em>have a son <em>born </em>a <em>short time before </em>his death, who <em>might </em>take <em>holy orders </em>at the age of <em>twenty-four, </em>which would be beyond the fixed limits of executory devises; that the devise over was, consequently, void also. The same principle is affirmed in <em>Chatham </em>v. <em>Tothill, </em>7 Bro. P. C. 453, Tomlin\u2019s edi.\u201d The limitation to Sally\u2019s children in the case supposed is too remote, because her husband, born after testator\u2019s death, might have survived her <em>twenty-two </em>years; and that limitation being void, the limitation to testator\u2019s children is void also. 1 Jarm. 268 top, 242 marg., 2 Fearne 414.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-9\">If those children of Sally could take the land in no other way than by purchase under their grandfather\u2019s will, they could not therefore take it at all, but would be disinherited, notwithstanding the clear intent of their grandfather in their favor. How then? Are the intentions of the testator in favor of his daughter\u2019s issue to be altogether frustrated? By no means; but the court \u201cwill sacrifice his minor intent that the grandchildren should take by purchase, because it is contrary to the rule against perpetuities, but will, nevertheless, under the doctrine of approximation, or <em>cypres, </em>give effect to his paramount intent, that all the issue of his daughter should take, by giving an estate tail to such daughter; so as to enable the grandchildren to take derivatively through the daughter, though they cannot be allowed to take in the particular mode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>P0\u2122^ ou^ by testator.\u201d For the word children. will he construed a word of limitation, in cases where, hut for the rule against perpetuities, it would he con'strued a word of purchase. 2 Fearne; Smith\u2019s Orig. View, p. 264, part II, ch. 14, and rule 6, on preceding page; 1 Fearne 203-8, notes; 1 Jarman 280-1 top, 261-2 marg.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-6\">If the <em>cypres </em>doctrine cannot avail to give Sally an estate tail in the land, the principles and authorities last adverted to show that she acquired the absolute property in the personalty. At common law no remainder could he limited after a life estate given in personalty. \u201cAs to it,\u201d to use the language of Judge Carr in <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>1 Leigh 362, \u201ca gift for an hour was a gift forever; hut this has long been changed; and it is laid down by Mr. Fearne, as settled by numerous decisions, that there may be as well an executory bequest of personal as an executory devise of real estate. They are governed, too, by the same general rules. Thus in either case, the devise must he such, that in the <em>very nature of the limitation it must vest </em>within twenty-one years after a <em>life </em>or <em>lives </em>in being; if more remote, it is void in its creation. And the question whether the contingency he too remote, depends on the construction of the will at the time of making, and <em>cannot </em>he influenced by <em>after events. </em>The <em>possibility, at the creation </em>of an executory devise, that the event on which its existence depends, may exceed the prescribed limits, vitiates it from the very beginning.\u201d But if the remainder limited be not good, if it he void for remoteness or other cause, the original rule still prevails, and the estate of the first taker becomes absolute. 4 Bacon\u2019s Abridg., title Remainder and Reversion, p. 294 old edition; 11 Leigh 403 <em>London </em>v. <em>Turner; </em>1 Fearne 487. Fearne says, \u201cfor'though it seems, that whenever a term is devised to one for a day, or an hour, it is held to he a devise of the whole term, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the devise over be void, and it appears to be the intention of the testator to dispose of the whole from his executors; yet, if such intention does not appear, it has been held, that a limitation of a term to one for life does not vest the whole so absolutely in him as to be at his disposal, but leaves a possibility of reversion in the executors of the testator.\u201d Taldng Bearne\u2019s statement of the law to be correct, and it is stated more strongly for the appellants in the other authorities cited, and still Sally acquired the absolute property in the slaves; for she is not expressly confined to a life estate, and if she was, still nothing can be more manifest in the whole will, than that the testator intended to dispose of the whole properly from his executors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-6\">It would be conceded, I apprehend, that if the limitation to Sally\u2019s husband for life, had been to a person ascertained not to be <em>in esse </em>at the date of the will, or death of the testator, or in other words, if her prospective husband were, at the time, ascertained to be a person not then in being, then the limitation to her children after the death of such husband would be too remote; for he might survive her more than twenty-one years, and the prescribed limits for the vesting in her children be thus transcended. But there is no difference in principle and authority between the case where the person to whom the prior limitation for life is made is ascertained not to be <em>in </em>esse, and the case where it can only be said that <em>he may not be in esse </em>at the death of the testator. It is sufficient?/ <em>by possibility </em>he may not be <em>in esse </em>at the death of the testator; and the rule applies if it cannot at the date of the will be asserted that he will <em>ex necessitate </em>be <em>in esse </em>at the death of the testator. Thus in the case of <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Bishop of Bath and Wells, </em>it was not certain that the first son of Thomas Proctor would not be born in the lifetime of the testator, and be bred a clergyman; but it was possible that he might not be so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>born, and if so born, that be might not be bred a . . , \u00b0 , clergyman; and so as to the second or other son. indeed the first son had been living at the date of the will and death of the testator, and had lived to ^re&lt;^ a clergyman and take holy orders, yet as he might not be bred a clergyman and take holy orders, and thus acquire the qualification necessary to entitle him to the gift, and as in such case, the \u201cother son,\u201d who might acquire that qualification, <em>might be born after </em>the testator\u2019s death, therefore the devise was held to be void. And the limitation over to T. M., his heirs and assigns, was adjudged to be void also, the court observing, \u201cthat there was no instance of a limitation after a prior devise, which was void for the contingency\u2019s being too remote, being let in to take effect.\u201d 1 Jarman 269 top, 243-4 marg. In a note to Jarman, Perkins, his annotator, says, in this case \u201cthere was only a <em>possibility </em>of the rule of law being transgressed, as T. P. might have had a son who took orders in his own lifetime, or even in the lifetime of the testator.\u201d And thus if Sally had actually married in the lifetime of the testator, yet as the gift is to <em>any </em>husband she may have, and her first husband might have died, and she taken another, who was not <em>in esse </em>at the testator\u2019s death, the limitations would still be void. In the case upon Lord Vere\u2019s will the bequest was to testator\u2019s wife and son A. B. for life, and upon the decease of survivor, to such \u201c person as should from time to time be Lord Vere;\u201d and at the death of Lord Vere the title descended to his son, the legatee for life, upon whose decease it descended to his son, the testator\u2019s grandson, who was also living at the testator\u2019s death, and upon the death of the grandson it descended to testator\u2019s great grandson, who was born after testator\u2019s death. The chief struggle was between the personal representatives of the grandson and those of the great grandson. As the first was born in testator\u2019s lifetime, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>clear, lie might have heen made legatee for life with remainder absolutely to the person next in succession, and the question therefore was, whether the will authorized such a construction. Sir J. Leach, V. 0., decided in the affirmative. But this decision was reversed in the House of Lords, Lord Brougham remarking <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthat the person who secondly after the death of testator became Lord Yere, the grandson, was <em>in esse </em>at the date of the will; but whether he would take, or whether he would be Lord Yere, was at the time uncertain. The next life estate, after those named in the will, was not to the person by name, but to the Lord Yere, whoever he might be. To argue from the fact that the person was in esse at the date of the will who became Lord Yere, is to rely upon an accident. The event <em>might </em>have been <em>otherwise. </em>He would not <em>ex necessitate </em>answer the description within the allowed period. A limitation, to he supported, must he definite and certain to the man or to the peer as an individual.\u201d And so even the second limitation to the grandson, after the first to the son, was not supported, though both were in esse at date of will; it not being certain that the grandson would ever become Lord Yere, and it being uncertain whether the person who should next become Lord Yere, would be capable of taking at the death of the son, or within twenty-one years and a fraction thereafter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-4\">Suppose the limitation here had been to Sally for her life, remainder to such son of A. B. as should become her husband, for life, and at the death of survivor, to be divided among their children then living, if any; and if none, then to be equally divided among all testator\u2019s children; and suppose that A. B. had a son living at the date of will and death of testator, but that son did not marry Sally; and he had another son born after testator\u2019s death who did marry her, and had children by her; and Sally then died, leaving that husband and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>those children surviving her; and he having survived her more than twenty-one years died, leaving them him; could there be a doubt, in the face of the authorities cited, that those children could not take as PurchasersJ the vesting being postponed beyond the prescribed period? And is there any difference, in substance, between the limitations supppsed and the limitations in the testator\u2019s will ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-6\">Thatitmakes.no difference that the object of the prior devise, held to be void for remoteness, 3iever came into existence, with reference to its effect on any ulterior devise, is shown by authorities already cited; and Jarman, 1 vol., p. 268 top, 242 marg., lays it down as a rule not to be questioned, \u201cthat where a devise is void for remoteness, all limitations ulterior to or expectant on such remote devise, are void also, though the object of the prior devise should never come into existence.\u201d And Mr. Smith, in his Original View, 2 Fearne, p. 414, part III, ch. 4, \u00a7 iii, lays down certain propositions connected with the doctrine of remoteness, the 2nd of which is: \u201c Where a limitation is void for remoteness, a limitation in remainder, after it, is not accelerated, but is also void.\u201d <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Bishop of Bath and Wells, </em>is a conclusive authority ^for this proposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-7\">Mr. Smith, at same page, lays down another proposition which is peculiarly applicable to the bequest of the slave and future increase, if the effect of that bequest is to be governed by the construction presently suggested; which proposition is in these words: \u201cWhere a testator'first makes a gift in terms which would carry the absolute interest in chattels, and then proceeds to restrict it to an estate for life, adding a limitation over which is void for remoteness; the entire interest, as conferred by the original gift, remains unaffected by the subsequent attempt at restriction.\u201d How the bequest of the slave Phoebe and her future increase, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>under the 11th clause, is at first made in such terms as would carry the absolute interest. The testator certainly designed, by this clause, to dispose of his whole interest not only in Phoebe, but in her future increase. He first lends her and her future increase to hi3 daughter Sally, and then proceeds in the same clause, to add a phrase: \u201c to be possessed by her, and upon the same terms and conditions as she will hold her land.\u201d And it is said that this modifying phrase confined her to a life estate only, because it is necessary in order to ascertain the quantity of interest intended to be given to her, and to others besides her, to look to the devise of the land, and to read this clause in the same way, and give-it the same construction, as if the testator had, in making the bequest, used the same language, and made the same limitations, in express terms, that are found in the clause making the devise of the land to her and to Haney Perry. Concede this to be proper, and, I submit, it has been shown, that the limitations attempted to be made, being void for remoteness, the interest and estate of Sally became absolute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-10\">Put suppose it be impracticable, under rules of construction, to imply, from the phrase \u201cto .be possessed by <em>her, </em>and upon the same teims and conditions as <em>she </em>will hold her land,\u201d limitations not only to her <em>for life, </em>but to any husband she may have for his life, and at the death of the survivor, then to her children, if she has any; and if none, then to all testator\u2019s children. Suppose, I say, it be impracticable, under the rules of' law, to imply and supply all (and if not all then certainly not any) of these limitations, then what is the consequence? It is, I emphatically answer <em>this, </em>that the attempted modification or restriction upon the interest or estate, first limited to Sally Stone, must fail and be of no effect, and that interest and estate remains absolute and unrestricted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Can these limitations he implied and supplied by force of the aforesaid phrase? Is not the effect of that phrase rather to annex to the gift to Sally <em>conditions, </em>than to superadd limitations?</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-7\">But in any and every aspect of it, can this phrase make so strong a ease for confining Sally to a life estate, as was furnished by the express language in many of the eases above stated. Take the case of <em>Mellish </em>v. <em>Mellish: </em>\u201cHamil\u2019s to go to my daughter Catharine as follows: <em>in case </em>she <em>marries and has a son </em>to go to that son; in case she has more than one daughter <em>at her husband\u2019s or her death, and no son, </em>to go to the <em>eldest daughter; </em>but in case she has <em>but one daughter, or no child at that time, </em>I desire it may go to my brother \u00a5m. Mellish.\u201d So here: \u201cPhcebe and her future increase to go to my daughter Sally, to be possessed by her upon the same terms and conditions as she will hold her land, viz: in case <em>she marries, </em>to go to her husband for life; in case she has more than one child at her husband\u2019s or her death, to be equally divided between her children; but in case she has no child at that time, I desire Phoebe-and her increase may go to my children to be equally divided among them.\u201d Hamil\u2019s was real estate, and the bequest now under consideration is of personalty. But still as to this the objection because of remoteness applies in all its force. The vesting may be postponed till the death of the husband, \u25a0and that may be more than twenty-one years after a life in being. But as to the land the same considerations apply. Can the devise to Sally and any husband she may have, of land, to be possessed upon the same terms and conditions as Haney Perry\u2019s land is to be possessed by her, amount to a devise to her children, she has any, and if none, then to all the testator\u2019s children? Can a devise to A. of land, to be possessed B. by a precedent clause will possess certain other land devised to him, be held to give the property to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>C. and D., who are not named at all ? Can the court, by force of the expression, \u201cto be possessed,\u201d &amp;e. be authorized to imply or interpolate limitations to Sally\u2019s children, if any, and if none, to the testator\u2019s children? 'Will not this be going further in supplying words than is admissible ? Is not the rule on this subject well laid down in <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>6 Munf. 114, where it is held, \u201c that in supplying words in a will, it is the most correct course to supply only such as it is evident the testator <em>intended to use, </em>and not such also as would be necessary to effectuate the supposed intention of the testator ?\u201d And is it not evident here that the testator <em>intended to use only </em>the words which he did use? The others were omitted, not by inadvertence, but from design. Yet it is equally evident from the whole will that the testator intended the issue of Sally, if any, to take the land set apart for her, forever, and intended by the clause making the devise to her, to dispose of his whole interest in the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-6\">Yet no estate is, in express terms, given to her issue, and they cannot, as purchasers, take even for life. Is not the case then brought still more strongly within the influence of the doctrine of approximation or <em>cypres, </em>and of that general principle so often adverted to, that in the construction of wills the paramount intent of the testator shall prevail ? This principle, with reference to this subject, is tersely stated by Judge Green, 5 Rand. 287. Says he: \u201cEstates tail were unknown to the common law. They were created by the statute <em>de donis conditionalibus. </em>In executing this law it was the duty of the court to ascertain from the whole will taken together, whether the intent of the testator was to provide for the issue of the first taker; and if so, without regard to the particular estates <em>given in terms-</em>by the will, to hold that the first taker had an estate tail, if the issue could not otherwise be provided for according to the intention of the testator.\u201d Or as ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>pressed \"by Judge Carr in <em>Thomason </em>v. <em>Andersons: </em>\u201cDid the testator mean to provide for his daughter and her issue indefinitely ? If so, this is an estate tail, no matter how he may have expressed himself, or with what conditions or limitations he may have attempted to clog it.\u201d The testator intended that the daughter should take such an estate in the property given her by the will, as would be transmissible to her issue, and this must be an estate tail or a fee. But what more, at most, can be implied'from the expression, \u201c same terms and conditions as Haney Perry\u2019s,\u201d than such gifts as were expressly made in <em>Mellish </em>v. <em>Mellish? </em>In case she marries, and has children, to such children, if any living at her <em>death; </em>in case she has none, then over.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-9\">These considerations apply with still greater force to the bequest of the slave and future increase under the 11th clause. The daughters are not expressly confined to life estates. The remainders intended to be limited by the phrase, to be possessed by them upon the same terms and conditions as they will hold their lands, are ineffectual, because of the want of sufficient words. Being ineffectual, the interests of the daughters become absolute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-10\">If the daughter Sally did not take an estate tail in the land, and the absolute property in the slaves, what was their proper destination upon her death? The court below inclined to the opinion that they passed to the testator\u2019s wife and children, under the 14th clause of the will. Did the testator intend to embrace the land and slaves given to his daughters for life, in the 14th clause ? The fact that he gives the property, intended to be embi\u2019aced by that clause, to his wife for life or widowhood, is sufficient to show that he did not intend the property before given to his daughters for life, to pass under it. But if the further opinion of that court be correct, \u201cthat the land and slaves given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>to Sally Stone for life, passed over to the testator\u2019s children under the 6th, 10th and 11th clauses of his will,\u201d which of his children are to take ? Those liv- \u25a0 ing at the testator\u2019s death, and their representatives, or those only who were living at Sally\u2019s death? Unless the statute of 1785 can he used to give the testa-, tor\u2019s children the fee, they would take only for life, and the testator would be intestate as to the reversion in fee. If all the testator\u2019s children living at his death are held to take under the 6th, 10th and 11th clauses, and to take the fee, and absolute property, then the representatives of Sally, the life tenant, are entitled to her due share.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-4\">A child who is made a legatee for life, is not thereby incapacitated from claiming under a bequest of the ulterior interest to the testator\u2019s children, living at his decease. 2 Jarman, 55 top, 74 marg., and note (f), referring to <em>Jennings </em>v. Newman, 3 Jar. 748. If the testator died intestate as to the reversion, Sally\u2019s representatives are still entitled to her share. But several of the testator\u2019s children having survived him, afterwards, and in Sally\u2019s lifetime, died without issue and intestate. Sally\u2019s representatives are entitled to her share of their shares. In the view taken of the questions by the court below, itself, then, the plaintiffs have an interest in the proceeds of the land and slaves, and their bill should not have been dismissed,</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-5\">But I confidently and respectfully conclude that Sally Stone acquired the absolute interest in the personalty and an estate tail in the land. An examination of the statute of 1819, abolishing the rule in Shelly\u2019s case, 1 Rev. C. 369, \u00a7 26, will show that in the opinion of the legislature, where a contingent limitation was made dependent upon the dying of any person without children, the word children was regularly held by the courts to be a word of limitation and not of purchase; and Lord Mansfield, one of the most, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>if not-the most, distinguished ornament of the English bench, frequently and most emphatically in some cases, held \u201c children\u201d in a will, where none were in existence at the date of it, to be synonymous with \u201cissue\u201d an&lt;^ \u201cheirs of the body.\u201d Witness his remarks in <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>and in <em>Davie </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>1 Douglas 321-4. In the latter case the devise was, \u201cI give and bequeath to my son Wm. Stevens, when he shall accomplish the full age of twenty-one years, the fee simple and inheritance of Lower Shelstone, to him and his child or children forever.\u201d William was about fifteen and lived to twenty-one, and died leaving several children. The question was, whether the devise conferred on William a fee or fee tail. Lord Mansfield, after argument said, \u201cI had a mind to see whether ingenuity could raise a doubt on one side, or supply an argument on the other, to make the case plainer than it is on the face of it. If the testator had used the words, \u201c all his estate,\u201d \u201c inheritance\u201d or \u201cforever,\u201d and had stopped there, the fee simple would have passed. But the words \u201c <em>child\u201d </em>or \u201c <em>children\u201d </em>are to the full as restrictive, as .if he had said, \u201c and if my son die <em>without heirs of his body </em>and the court unanimously held that William acquired an estate tail and not the fee simple.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-5\">How it cannot be denied that any word which will have the effect of cutting down a fee to a fee tail, will have the effect of enlarging a life estate to a fee tail, where the intention to provide for all the issue of the first taker may be collected from the wdiole will. Indeed it is shown by many authorities, above cited, that the courts more readily yield to the restricted construction when the fee is given to the ancestor, than when a life estate only is in express terms given to him; the danger of disinheriting some of the issue, being much greater in the latter case, if a restricted construction be adopted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>Royall, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-4\">The court cannot enquire whether this would have been an estate tail at common law or not. It has been settled by repeated decisions of this court, that these particular words in a will give only an estate for life, so that it is no longer open to question in Virginia. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 240; <em>Warners </em>v. <em>Mason and wife, </em>5 Munf. 242; <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>Sand\u2019s Quar. Law Review for April 1860.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-5\">But this will would not have made an estate tail by the common law. The argument on the other side is, that it was Caleb Stone\u2019s intention to provide for Sally\u2019s descendants as long as she should have any. But where is this intention to be found expressed in the will? It may be <em>conjectured </em>that Caleb did not wish his property to leave Sally\u2019s family while she should have progeny. She was his daughter, and from the influences which are known to operate upon the minds of men, it would seem eminently probable that he wished that daughter and her descendants to enjoy the provision he was making for her, as long as her descendants continued, rather than any other persons. But he has not said so. Certain terms in the law have fixed meanings, and if testators use those terms, they must expect the law to fix that intention upon them which those terms indicate, irrespective of what may have been in their minds. Amongst those terms is the word \u201cchildren,\u201d which the law conclusively presumes to mean children in the first degree, unless it be necessary to presume otherwise, to effect a plain, manifest and certain intent. The court must, therefore, read the will as it finds it written, without reference to theories, probabilities or conjecture, and in that it is nowhere said, either directly or by implication, that Sally\u2019s offspring, further than the first degree, is to be provided for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>The intention which the law fixes upon this testator, as learned from the legal interpretation of the words he has used, is to give it to Sally for life, and then, as he has not attached words of inheritance to the gift to her children, to them for life: making no \u00b0 \u2019 \u2019 T ' further disposition, and leaving the property at the death of her children to be governed by whatever rules of law might apply. Such a disposition it was perfectly competent for him to make, and it has been decided as far back as the reign of queen Elizabeth, that these particular words make that particular disposition, and no estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-10\">In <em>Wild\u2019s, </em>case, <em>6 Coke 16, </em>it was resolved that, if land be devised to husband and wife, and after their decease to their children, or the remainder to their children, then, though they have no children at the time, the husband and wife shall take for life, and the children the remainder as purchasers. Some slurs have been thrown on this resolution, in <em>Wild\u2019s </em>case, which I pass by unnoticed, leaving it to the ample and complete vindication of my learned senior, Mr. Green. See also <em>Buffar </em>v. <em>Bradford, 2 </em>Atk. R. 220; <em>Merest </em>v. <em>James, 1 </em>Brod. &amp; Bing. 484, <em>5 </em>Eng. C. L. R. <em>156.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-11\">The line of distinction in reference to words which make an entail and those which do not, is drawn when it is determined whether there is a limitation over upon an <em>indefinite </em>failure of issue, or a like limitation upon a <em>fixed </em>and <em>definite </em>failure. If the former, it is at once settled that there is an entail; if the latter, it is clear there is not. How, language could not make it clearer than it is, that the limitation over here to Caleb\u2019s children, is in case of Sally\u2019s death without children living at her death, or the death of children'she might leave, before the death of her husband. And the appellants assume the whole case when they declare the limitation over to be upon an indefinite failure of issue. This assumption is nothing but another manifestation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number><em>\u25a0of </em>the <em>mirage of intention </em>which the testator\u2019s supposed kindness of feeling for his daughter has shaped itself into.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-4\">But, say the appellants, Sally\u2019s husband might have been unborn at the time of the devise, and as the remainder to her children is not to take effect till his death, which might have been more than twenty-one years after her death, it is void for remoteness, and this likewise destroys the remainder over to the testator\u2019s children, because, one remainder being void, all subsequent ones are. So, on the construction <em>cy </em>pres, Sally must take an estate tail. This proposition will be discussed in two aspects: first, as to whether the remainder to Sally\u2019s children being void, she should take an estate tail; second, whether the remainder to her children being void, the remainder over to the testator\u2019s children is void also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-5\">As to the construction <em>cy pres: </em>It is well settled that this construction is to be narrowed rather than \u2022enlarged, and will not be applied except in cases perfectly analogous to those where it has been already made. Lewis on Perp. marg. 454. What is the construction <em>cy pres ? </em>This construction is made where the testator has manifestly two intents, which cannot possibly stand together. As where he devises to a person for life, remainder to his unborn son for life, as \u2022a purchaser, remainder to the issue of that unborn son, and their heirs indefinitely. Here it is plain, and cannot be doubted, that he wishes the descendants of the first taker to have the property <em>in perpetuum, </em>but they cannot have it in the way that he has designated, because its vesting in the children of the unborn son would be postponed for more than a life in being and twenty-one years. In such cases the courts, to effectuate the testator\u2019s manifest intent to provide for the issue, have sometimes given the first taker an estate tail, the only 'way in which it could be done. Lewis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>on Perp. 426 et seq. But this case does not come within the construction, because the radical essential, the intention to provide for descendants indefinitely, does not appear. It is only <em>conjectured </em>from the near relationship of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-9\">The construction <em>cy pres </em>will certainly, however, never be applied to personal property. 1 Fearne Con. Rem. 205, 3rd Am. ed.; Lewis on Perp. marg. 485. But granting for the sake of the argument that the remainder to Sally\u2019s children is void for remoteness, why give Sally an estate tail ? One argument of the appellants for an estate tail is, that Sally might have died with one child, and fifty grandchildren, children of other of her children deceased, and yet if children in this will is to be read as a word of purchase, that one child would take all to the exclusion of the others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-10\">This, then, is exactly what would occur if Sally is given an estate tail. Instead of having fifty grandchildren excluded, we might then have a dozen children excluded; for if Sally should leave thirteen sons, the oldest would take all, and the other twelve would go begging. If anything is certain upon the face of the will, it is that <em>all </em>of Sally\u2019s children should have the property equally. It is perfectly certain that he did not wish one of her children to have it in exclusion of all the others. If the remainder is too remote, the property should rather revert to the testator\u2019s-heirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-11\">It is argued that personal property will not revert; that a limitation over of personal property which is void for remoteness, gives the entire interest to the first taker. This is not law. Personal property will revert under such circumstances, in like manner as real property. Keyes on Chattels, sects. 276, 280. Neither will the expression of an intention to dispose-of it from executors prevent a reverter. There must be an effectual and valid disposition from them. Id. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>sects. 281, 282. But if the remainder to Sally\u2019s children he void, let that over to Caleb\u2019s take effect; though it is argued that one being void, all are, and the case of <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Bishop of Bath &amp; Wells, </em>2 H. Bl. R. 358, is relied on for this. The cases are entirely different. The devise over in that case was only to take effect in case a single and particular event happened, which was too remote. In that ease Mai-y Proctor devised unto the first or other son of Thos. Proctor <em>that should be bred a clergyman, and be in holy orders; </em>but in case Thos. Proctor <em>should have no such son, </em>then over. The devise to Thos. Proctor\u2019s son was void, because he might have had no son until the hour before his death, and that son could not take orders, by the canons of the church, until he should be twenty-three. It was then contended that the devise over should take effect. But it was held that it should not, because it was only to\u00bbtake effect in case Thos. Proctor had no <em>such </em>son; that is, a son in holy orders; and that could not be determined until twenty-three years after his death. The devise was not, in case Thos. Proctor have <em>no </em>son, but in ease he have no <em>such </em>son. It is true that where one remainder succeeds another and is only to take effect after the first is expended, if the first be void, the second is likewise. But where one is created as a <em>substitute </em>for another, to take effect in case the first fails, then if the first be void for remoteness, the second will take effect, if limited upon an event not too remote. Farther, if a remainder be substitutional, and limited to take place upon either of two events which shall first occur, one being good and the other bad, if the event which is good occur, the remainder will vest, and the court will not enquire whether the other event, which did not happen, was too remote or not. This was the case in <em>Longhead </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>2 W. Blacks. R. 704, which is the case that must govei\u2019n this question. See also <em>Goring </em>v. <em>Howard, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>16 Sim. R. 395; <em>Monypenny </em>v. <em>Dering, </em>15 Law &amp; Eq. R. 551.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-9\">Row it is plain, that Caleb Stone intended the remainder to his own children to <em>vest in interest, </em>either upon his daughter leaving children who should subsequently die during the life of any husband who might survive her, or upon her dying without children living at the time of her death. The first of these may have been too remote; the second was good. This must be so, otherwise his will would be absurd. \"What could prompt him to give the property over to his own children in case Sally should have children who should subsequently die during the life of her surviving husband, but to say that they should not have it in case Sally never had children ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-10\">His will must be read thus: I'give the property over to' my children in case Sally has children who survive her, but die before her husband, or in case she never has children. In the latter event it is to vest in interest in them, at her death, to await enjoyment till the death of her surviving husband. The contingency not too remote having happened, the court will not enquire whether the other was too remote or not, as in <em>Longhead </em>v. <em>Phelps, supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-11\">Ror is it necessary that it should be expressed in the will in words that the gift depends upon either of two-contingencies. It is sufficient if it be necessarily implied from the nature of things. 1 Jarm. on Wills, 3d English ed. 268, 269, 270; 3 Atk. R. 315; Fearne Con. Rem. 513.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-12\">But the remainder to Sally\u2019s children is good, because limited to take effect within a life in being. <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>17 Gratt. 8. The language of the will makes it perfectly clear that it was to <em>vest in interest </em>in the children, at Sally\u2019s death, to await enjoyment till the death of her husband. A remainder need not take effect <em>in possession </em>within a life in being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>and twenty-one years. It is sufficient if it <em>vest in interest </em>within that time. A remainder may he limited to one for life, remainder to his unhorn son for life, remainder to the unborn son of that unborn son, provided the last remainder be limited to <em>vest in interest </em>within a life in being and twenty-one years, although it may have to wait for possession till the death of the unborn son. Lewis on Perp. 409, 420, \u00a7 3. At Sally\u2019s death it became certain what children were to take the remainder, and it would <em>vest </em>then, to await enjoyment till the death of the husband. The objection that Sally might have left grandchildren, but no children, and that these grandchildren could not take if children is to be read a word of purchase, is effectually disposed of by Judge Moncure in <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Saunders, ubi </em>supra. He has so willed it, and so let it be.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-4\"><em>Wm. Green, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-5\">I. To support their pretensions, <em>advanced in the bill, </em>appellants must maintain that Sally Stone took, <em>under her father\u2019s will, </em>an interest devisable and bequeathable in the land and in the slaves it gave her. Accordingly this is attempted by counsel for them, under distinct heads, in divers aspects.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-6\">1. As to the land: <em>First, </em>on the supposition that she took therein an estate no way distinguishable from that which Haney Perry took in the land given her under the same will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-7\">Respecting this, it cannot be disputed that the testator <em>intended </em>to give her no more than an estate during her own life and, at most, in addition thereto, contingently, during the widowerhood of one other person. Counsel opposite does not hesitate to concede this. But he strives to maintain that nevertheless the testator\u2019s will has, against his wish, a quite contrary effect; so as to give her an absolute fee simple; and yet not what may be called a natural fee simple, which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>still permit his intention in favour of his other children in case this daughter should have none, to prevail, by means of an executory limitation that, grafted upon <em>such </em>a fee simple, would be valid; but an artificial fee simple, the product of a legal metamorphosis from an artificial fee tail: the <em>sole </em>means, within the compass of possibility, whereby this utter frustration of the testator\u2019s unmistakeable intention could be brought about \u2014 and to what end? In order that appellants may get, under <em>general </em>words in Sally Stone\u2019s will, what <em>she </em>never dreamed it was in her power to give.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-9\">As a first step towards accomplishing this result, a great many reported decisions have been cited, to prove that, desjiite the plainest intention to give to the first taker no more than a life estate, nevertheless he may take an estate tail: And certainly, wherever the law \u201caforetime\u201d remains in this respect unaltered, no position is more indubitable. But then, even under that aforetime law, this never happened except where the testator had (or, what practically was equivalent, was held to have) another and a paramount intention, not legally compatible with the first taker\u2019s having a mere life estate; so that both his intentions, or (to speak perhaps more accurately) both parts of his one intention, could not by law stand together. Under such circumstances, that which he presumably considered the less important was displaced : in order that what, it was supposed, he had more at heart might take place. And all such cases, if I mistake not, may be ranged in two classes, both really depending upon this one principle: First, where, though there was an expressed intention to give to the first taker no more than a life estate, yet, upon the face of the will, or upon it coupled with admissible extraneous evidence, there was an equally clear intention to give a remainder to the heirs of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>body or to some description of such heirs: so as to . . ....... . . . , . . bring the total limitation within the despotic influence of the Rule in Shelley\u2019s case: Secondly, where, with such an expressed intention as to the first taker, there was, upon the face of the will, or upon it coupled with such evidence as aforesaid, an equally clear intention that what was given him, expressly for life only, should become another\u2019s whenever, in an indefinite future, the first taker\u2019s issue or some particular line of such issue should have failed, and not till then; it being thence inferred, that a benefit was intended preferably for such issue, which they could not take unless by vesting in their ancestor (the first taker) an estate tail; whether because there was no direct gift to them by way of remainder; or because, if such gift to them were implied, then the case would come within the range of the Rule in Sh\u00e9lley\u2019s case, in like manner as where such gift to them was express, and so this class of cases would become identical with the class first mentioned. \u201dWhere that Rule still operates, as it does in cases governed by the same law which (as having been the <em>lex temporis) </em>is alleged by counsel opposite to govern ours, it makes no difference whether it is in the one, or in the other, of these modes that the result is effected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-7\">If there be two such classes, really separate and distinct, then the case of <em>Jesson et al. </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>2 Bligh. 1, which by counsel opposite is placed in the foreground of his argument, comes within both of them. The decision therein by the House of Lords, which house <em>isthae vice </em>consisted of only Lord Eldon and Lord Redesdale, \u2014 overruling the judgment of the King\u2019s Bench in the same case, and what Mr. Jarman calls a (Clong line\u201d of other cases, (2 Jarm. Wills 286-297; see p. 295;) \u2014 has established in England, that where there is a devise to <em>W. </em>for life, and after his decease to the heirs of his body, in such shares and proportions as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>he shall appoint, and, for want of such appointment, to the heirs of his body, share and share alike, as ten-in common, and, if but one child, the whole to such only child, and, for want of such issue, to the heirs c^ev^S01\u201d there the first taker (W.) has an estate tail: The case being, let me repeat, within both of the classes aforesaid (if in reality there be two), by there being, first, a remainder to the heirs of the body of the first taker, not sufficiently shown, by the context or otherwise, to mean some other, less comprehensive, class of remaindermen, and, secondly, a limitation oveiv upon au indefinite failure of his issue; Lord Redesdale insisting mainly upon the first of these grounds, Lord Eldon mainly upon the second. And, for the purposes of this discussion, it may be conceded that the decision in our Virginia case of <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>12 Gratt. 135, professedly following that of the Lords in <em>Jesson </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>has settled, though made only by three judges against two, that where in this state, there is a devise,, in the will of a testator who died before 1 Jan. 1820, to his two daughters \u201cto be held by them during their natural lives and no longer, and then equally divided between their heirs lawfully begotten,\u201d without any limitation over; there also the respective first takers have an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-7\">Neither of these <em>decisions </em>has any bearing on our case; because in Caleb Stone\u2019s will there is no phrase having even the slightest resemblance (in meaning and effect) to the phrase \u201cheirs of the body\u201d or \u201cheirs lawfully begotten,\u201d \u2014 which latter has been for centuries held precisely tantamount to the former, <em>(Church </em>v. <em>Wyatt, </em>Moore 637; <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 Sid. 41, 42, 43, 73, 74; <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Beckford, </em>1 Ves. sen. 521; <em>Nanfan </em>v. <em>Legh, </em>7 Taunt. 84, 2 Marsh. 107; <em>Mortimer </em>v. <em>Hartley, </em>6 Welsh.

Dig. 296 [197]; see also <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>1 Call 165;) and was taken in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Brooks </em>to mean nothing else, \u2014 in Caleb Stone\u2019s will, I say, there is no such phrase, connected with any gift therein to any of his daughters; nor is there any limitation over upon an indefinite failure of issue of any first taker, as, at a more appropriate place, it will be my particular business to prove : But both - those <em>cases </em>are authorities in ours, of high grade, and in favour of appellees; for in each of them one ground, and in one the sole ground, of decision expressly was, that the words employed in the respective wills then <em>sub jndice </em>could not be taken as equipollent with the word \u201cchildren,\u201d which in our case is the word used. In the former of them, when it was before the King\u2019s Bench, the judges who then sat therein concurred in holding, that the words \u201cheirs of the body\u201d were sufficiently shown by the context to mean only \u201c children,\u201d and therefore that the first taker had but a life estate. <em>Doe d. Wright </em>v. <em>Jesson, </em>5 Maule &amp; S. 95. And although their judgment was reversed, yet that was not upon the ground that this consequence would not have legitimately followed, if the technical words \u201cheirs of the body\u201d could there have been read as \u201cchildren,\u201d but on the contrary wdth a full admission on every hand that it would, \u2014 and all the argumentation of counsel in that case, reproduced by counsel in this, upon the deprecable consequences of reading the former words so as to give them the sense and effect of the latter word, proceeded, not upon a denial, but upon an assertion, that, if the will were so read, those consequences must ensue, \u2014 unless counteracted by there being superadded a limitation over upon an indefinite failure of issue of the first taker; which, indeed, would necessa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>rily restore to the phrase used, or insuperably prevent its for a moment losing, in that connexion, its primary legal sense, its technical acceptation. And in the latter <em>(Moore </em>v. <em>Brooks) </em>the two dissenting judges, though the reasons of their dissent are not reported, must needs have held that, in the will before them, \u201cheirs lawfully begotten\u201d bore the restricted sense of \u201cchildren,\u201d with the consequence of giving to the first takers no more than life estates respectively; which consequence, if the words W\u2019ere to be so read, was admitted distinctly, \u2014 not only so, hut moreover urged as an argument in support of their refusal so to read them, \u2014 by the three judges who composed the majority. 12 Gratt. 144. The point, however, does not rest upon mere admissions or arguments of any counsel or any judges; hut more securely reposes upon solemn decisions, both in England and in Virginia, which, subsequently to that of the Lords in <em>Jesson </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>have re-established, \u2014 if (contrary to what was always Mr. Jarman\u2019s opinion, 2 Pow. Dev. edit. Jarm. 488-492; 2 Jarm. Wills 300-305;) it had been at all shaken thereby \u2014 the rule that even \u201cheirs of the body\u201d may be read, under circumstances, so as to mean \u201cchildren,\u201d and that <em>when </em>so read, those words will give, as this word, when not forced out of its natural signification, gives, to the first taker no more than a life estate. <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>6 Comm.

And, notwithstanding the devise in question was made loug after the first of January 1787, when the statute of 1785, (12 Hen. Stat. 157,) dispensing with words of inheritance to create a fee simple, took effect, it is insisted further that the limitation therein to the first taker\u2019s children must be construed to give them, as purchasers, no larger an estate than for tk\u00e9ir own lives; because such, before that statute, was the rule of construction, and the <em>lex iemporis, </em>under which Caleb Stone both made his will and died, ordained that \u201cevery estate in lands which since [7 Oct. 1776] hath been limited, or hereafter shall be limited, so that, as the law aforetime was, such estate would have been an estate tail, shall be deemed to have been and to continue an estate in fee simple.\u201d V.

And, as there has been a marvellons amount of blundering (I can find no fitter word), about this leading case, even among persons so learned and intelligent as Lord Alvanley and Lord St. Leonards, whose errors are reproduced by counsel \u25a0opposite, I propose, first of all, to remove out of our way those errors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-6\">The book called Sir Francis Moore\u2019s Reports, containing cases which run through one hundred and thirty-five years, and which therefore, however they may have been of his collecting, out of other men\u2019s m. sis., were certainly not all of his own reporting, was first published in 1663, long after his death, (which happened 20 Nov. 1621, \"Wallace\u2019s Reporters, 3rd edit. 36;) and more than sixty years after the case here in question had been decided; which is reported in that volume, p. 397, pl. 519, by the name of <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Yardley. </em>So much of the report as is here material, literally translated from the norman-french, or rather the to-french of that time, is as follows: \u201cHill. 37 Eliz. <em>rot. </em>1030. In <em>ejectione </em>finnae, the jury found a devise to wife for life, and after to son, and, if he should die without issue, to the child which then was <em>in ulero matris, </em>she being far gone with child, and its issues in tail. <em>Rem, </em>my will is, if my wfife die and my children, without issue of my children living, that then the land shall remain <em>to Richard Wild and his wife, and after iheir death to their children. </em>The devisor dies, his wife and all his children also die without issue, and Wild and his wife die, having issue: And the question was, whether Wild and his wife had an estate in tail, or that they had only for life, with a remainder by purchase for life to their children horn at the time of the devise. And Popham and Gawdy, that it is an estate tail in them. And Clench and Fenner, that [it is] an estate only for life.\u201d \u2014 In reporting the same case, 6 Rep. 166, under the caption \u201c <em>Wild\u2019s case, </em>Hil. 41 Eliz. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>King\u2019s Bench,\u201d Coke says: \u201cHil. 37 Eliz.' in <em>\u2018ejectione firmae </em>between <em>Richardson </em>and <em>Yardley, </em>in the King\u2019s on <em>not guilty </em>pleaded, the jury gave a special verdict to this effect. Land was devised to A. for life, remainder to B. and the heirs of his body, the remainder \u2018 <em>to Roioland Wild and his wife, and after their decease to their </em>children,\u2019 Kowland and his wife <em>then </em>having issue <em>a son and a daughter; </em>and afterwards the devisor died, and after his decease A. died, B. died without issue, Kowland and his wife died, and <em>the son </em>had <em>issue </em>a daughter, and died: If <em>this daughter </em>should have the land or not, was the question; and it consisted only upon the 'consideration what estate Kowland and his wife had, viz. if they had an estate tail, or an estate <em>for life </em>with remainder to their children <em>for life. </em>And the ease, for difficulty, was argued before all the judges of England; and it was resolved, that Kowland and his wife had <em>but an estate for life, </em>with remainder to their children <em>for life, </em>and <em>no estate tail;\u201d </em>(so that the daugh-. ter of Kowland\u2019s son did <em>not </em>get the land, whatever intention of the testator might be presumed in favour of all the posterity of Kowland:) And then Coke relates, at considerable length, the reasons and resolutions of the judges. <em>Which </em>(it is, for our present purpose, worth noticing,) <em>he published </em>in 1607, the case having been decided only some five, or at most six, years before; almost every judge of England, that had been on the bench when, as he states, the case had been argued before them all, and moreover a large number of serjeants, and barristers, and law-students (of that day, since come to the bar), who must have been at the time well informed, in the main, concerning case of so much public expectation (in the profession) as this was, being still alive; who very frequently met one another in \"Westminster Hall and in the temples and inns of court, and elsewhere; and must have been startled, and thereupon compared notes, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>any serious misreport of the' case in a book of such commanding authority, such universal and immediate perusal among lawyers (in the then, not comparative only, but absolute, paucity of law-books), as each Part of <em>The </em>Reports (published in Coke\u2019s lifetime) was from the beginning: Yet <em>this </em>report, though frequently cited, within a few years after its publication, as well as in times more distant, appears to have been never impeached, as incorrect or in any manner misleading, until since and very long after) the publication of Mopre\u2019s report of the case (if it is his), \u2014 which publication assuredly Moore himself never would have permitted, without (at-least) a correction of its manifest defectiveness, in not indicating what judgment was at last, or whether any was ever, rendered. But, of very late time, comparatively speaking, some sort of disparagement has been, in consequence of that publication, attempted to be cast on Coke\u2019s report, by the two modern law-lords before mentioned. Thus, in <em>Seale </em>v. <em>Barter, </em>2 Bos. &amp; P. 492-493, Lord Alvanley said: \u201c <em>Wylde\u2019s </em>[Wild\u2019s] <em>case </em>(which is the leading case upon this subject) was cited and relied on. I will shortly state that case as it is reported in 6 Co. 16, and in Moore 397, under the name of <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Yardley; </em>for though the titles of the cases are different and one is stated to have been in the 41 Eliz. and the other in the 37 Eliz., it is hardly possible to consider them as different cases, especially as the name of <em>Wylde </em>occurs in them both, and the circumstances are so nearly the same; and indeed in some books, where the report in Moore has been cited, it has been said that the same case was better reported in Coke.\u201d Iiis lordship then states, with substantial accuracy, the principal case from Coke\u2019s account of it; after which he proceeds thus: \u201cBut a case was there putas good law, that if A. devise to B. and his children or issues and he hath not any issue at the time of the devise, the same is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>estate tail: and a ease is cited from Serjeant Bend- <em>' </em>\" loes\u2019s reports, which, was a devise to husband and wife and the men children of their bodies begotten, and it did not appear in the case that they had any issue male at the time of the devise, and therefore it was adjudged that they had an estate tail to them and to the heirs [male] of their bodies. According to the repoi\u2019t in Moore, Popham and G-awdy held that <em>Wylde took </em>an estate tail <em>notivithstanding that he had children living cd the time of the devise, </em>though Fenner and Clench thought it was only an estate for life. <em>It appears </em>therefore that <em>two </em>of the judges were disposed to think that an estate tail would pass <em>even </em>in a case where children were <em>in esse </em>at the date of the will, and <em>they all </em>agreed that, <em>if no children had been born, it would have been an estate tail\u201d </em>And on <em>this </em>criticism of <em>Wild\u2019s case </em>by Lord Alvanley, indorsed by Lord St. Leonards, (to be sure, in his character of counsel only,) Mr. Pettit relies for overthrowing the credit of Sir Edward Coke\u2019s report of that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aab\">How, never in my whole reading have I met with any passage, emanating from a respectable source, more remarkable for oscitancy than this is. Besides mistakes in point of expression, not all of which are exhibited in my preceding extract, Lord Alvanley shows that he could not have read Coke\u2019s report, or Moore\u2019s, with any but the most drowsy sort of attention. He resorts to probable arguments for proving the case in both reports to be the same, notwithstanding the difference of names, though Coke expressly states it to have been between the same parties as Moore does: and notwithstanding the difference of times, though Coke expressly states it to have arisen at the same time and in the manner Moore does: And then, notwithstanding the real difference of dates, to which what is respectively reported by them in regard to judicial sentiment refers, he takes it for granted that the opinions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>of the <em>four </em>judges in the King\u2019s Bench, which alone Moore mentions, are the same which, delivered about four years later, Coke reports of <em>all </em>the judges England; before whom, he tells us expressly, the case was debated <em>propter difficultatem,, </em>meaning (no doubt) on account of that very <em>division </em>in the King\u2019s Bench mentioned by Moore, \u2014 in conformity with what was a common practice in those days and long before and long after.

Melling;\u201d which is always cited from the report of itinlVentr. as incomparably the best; and there he was stared in the face with such expressions as these: by Rainsford J., pp. 225-6, \u201cI rely mainly upon <em>Wild\u2019s case, </em>6 Co., which was brought before all the judges of England;\u201d by Twisden J., p. 227, \u201cI rely mainly upon <em>Wild\u2019s case, </em>6 Co., and the case quoted out of Benloe in the end of that case,\u201d giving it as it is given in 6 Rep. 17 b; \u201c\u2019tis true, that case is variously reported in the books, but I adhere to my Lord Coke, presuming that, that being brought before all the judges, in the argument of <em>Wild\u2019s case, </em>it was a true report;\u201d and by Hale C. J., p. 231, \u201cthe court of Xing\u2019s Bench were <em>at first </em>divided; indeed it was <em>after-wards </em>adjudged an estate <em>for life </em>to Wild and his wife.\u201d But the most serious in point of importance, though not the sole remaining, nor the most remarkable, of his, oversights (in this astounding collection of them) is exposed as follows by Mr. Jarman: \u201c In <em>Seale </em>v. <em>Barter, </em>Lord Alvanley observed that according to the report of <em>Wild\u2019s case </em>in Moore, two of the judges thought it was an <em>estate tail </em>in him, though there were children at the time of the devise; but probably it did not occur to his lordship, that the devise in that ease was to [Wild] and his wife and, <em>after their death, </em>to their children ; which, <em>it is now admitted on all hands, </em>gives an <em>estate for life </em>to the parents, with remainder to their children; so that,\u201d' continues Mr. Jarman, <em>\u201cthe notion </em>as to its being an estate tail <em>was clearly untenable;\u201d </em>(2 Jarm. Wills 315;) a remark repeated from Mr. Jar-man\u2019s supplemental volume to Pow. Dev. 502; and again repeated in the third edition (p. 372,) doubtless also in the second, of his -work on wills, by Wolsten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>holme and Vincent, his English editors, who by no means adopt implicitly all his views; and not quarrelled with by Mr. Perkins, his well-known American editor. Finally, the statement of Lord Alvanley, that \u201cthey all,\u201d meaning all the four judges of the King\u2019s Bench, \u201cagreed that, if no children had been born, it would have been an estate tail,\u201d \u2014 this most extraordinary statement, \u2014 has no warrant whatever in (even) Moore\u2019s report; nor in another report of what is doubtless the same case, in Gouldsb. 139, pl. 47, although given there without any name, and among cases of Hil. 43 Eliz.; while it is, in the most positive manner, contradicted by Coke\u2019s report, published very soon after he was made chief justice of the Common Pleas, when his intellectual powers were in their zenith, of a case which he doubtless had himself argued, and which his report of it shews him to have understood perfectly. Ho counsel is, indeed, named in any report I have seen of it; but, besides its being hardly possible that Coke, then at the head of the common-law bar, should not have been engaged in such a case, in 1 Ventr. 231, <em>King </em>v. <em>Melling, </em>it is said by Hale C. J., that Coke did argue the case in Moore 397, of <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Yardley; </em>which fact may well have been known to him, from some yet unpublished MS. note of the case, or from tradition not then worn out in the profession, or from Sir Francis Moore\u2019s communication, whose grand-daughter was Hale\u2019s first wife. Life of Hale (prefixed to Runn. edit. Hal. Hist. Comm. Law, Dubl. 1792,) p. xxxiii; Wallace\u2019s Reporters, 3rd edit. 86. \u2014 Professor Hoffman, in his Course of Legal Study, gives a selection of leading cases from Coke\u2019s Reports; and his neat and at the same time accurate abstract of <em>Wild\u2019s case </em>is in these words: \u201cDevise to baron and feme, and <em>after their decease </em>to their children, or, <em>remainder </em>to their children; <em>whether </em>they have or have not children at the time, this is but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>an <em>estate for life </em>in baron and feme, remainder to their children. But if lands are devised to A. <em>and </em>his children or issue, he having <em>none at the time, </em>A. takes an <em>estate tail; </em>but if he have <em>children at the time, </em>he and his. children take a <em>joint estate for life.\u201d </em>Hoffm. Leg. Stud. 2nd edit. 203.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-9\">Having said thus much, I am content to leave to the court whether \u201c <em>Wild\u2019s case </em>is a strong authority for an estate tail here,\u201d as counsel opposite insists it is; or even so much as the very slightest of all possible authorities for such a position. Misunderstood, as Lord Alvanley misunderstood and misstated it, perhaps it would countenance such a position; but, with the due corrective applied, it affords not any such countenance. While if that be true which, as counsel opposite says, \u201c towards the end of [Coke\u2019s] report is asserted,\u201d it manifestly tends contrariwise; namely, \u201c that if a devise be to A. for life, and after his death to his children, then, even though A. has <em>no child at the time, </em>he shall only take <em>a life estate </em>with <em>remainder for life </em>to his children.\u201d Accordingly that gentleman manifestly feels an incumbent <em>onus </em>on him to give some answer to this (as he styles it) <em>assertion; </em>and his answer is, that it is \u201ca mere <em>obiter dictum.\u201d </em>To me the propriety seems very questionable, of calling a solemn resolution by the twelve assembled judges, upon a point deliberately considered, a \u201c mere\u201d <em>obiter dictum, </em>even when it is not strictly necessary to the decision. I will not, however, consume time in remarking further upon -that topic; but will at once advance three (more pertinent) propositions: First, that this resolution is an inevitable corollary from the precise point upon which the case was actually decided: Second, that if no such decision had been made, and the matter was now resting upon that resolution and the reasoning in support of it furnished, with admirable clearness, in Coke\u2019s report, without a particle of influence in point of authority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>from either the judges that adopted it, or the great jurist who, with his own manifest approbation thereof, has reported it, still it would stand <em>irrefragable; </em>these two propositions I simply submit to the court: Third, that the matter does not now rest there, but the \u201cresolution\u201d has been since confirmed in a vast multitude of cases, by solemn decision, until the doctrine has become, in the words of Mr. Jarman before quoted, \u201c admitted on all hands,\u201d \u2014 to such a degree that <em>he </em>did not think it worth while to quote authorities at all in support of it; and this proposition I shall proceed at once to maintain, by citing some out of that multitude of cases; <em>Goodwin </em>v. Goodwin, 3 Atk. 370, 1 Ves. sen. 226; <em>Denn </em>v. <em>Page, 3 </em>Dough 294, 1 Bos. <em>&amp; </em>P. 261, n.; <em>Hay </em>v. <em>Coventry, </em>3 Durnf. <em>&amp; </em>E. 33; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Romney, </em>11 East 594; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>5 Barn. &amp; Ald. 464, 1 Dowl. &amp; R. 52; <em>Ashley </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>6 Sim. 358.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-10\">Iu the first of these six cases, a testator having given his estate in Norfolk, after the death of his wife, \u201cto Joan Seaman for her life, and afterwards to her children, to be equally divided amongst them share and share alike; and, for want of such children,\u201d to the testator\u2019s right heir on the side of his father; Joan having one or more children born in the lifetime of the testator, and one or more born after his death; Lord Hardwicke held that each of her children took, by purchase, in remainder, an estate for life and no longer. In the last of .them, a testator having devised an estate to A. for life, remainder to all the children of A. as tenants in common and not as joint-tenants; and, for want of such issue, to B. for life, remainder to all the children of B. as tenants in common and not as joint-tenants; and, for want of such issue, to C. in fee; Sir Lancelot Shadwell V. C. held that the children of A. took, as purchasers, in remainder, estates for life, with cross-remainders between them for life, with remainder to B. for life, with remainder to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>children for life, with cross-remainder between them for life, with an ultimate remainder to O. in fee. And whole half dozen have (out of a much larger number of English and American cases to the like effect) ^een selected for their possessing a remarkable property, namely, that of overthrowing, simultaneously, no less than three points of opposite counsel\u2019s argument. First, in all of them, subsequent to <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>it was manifestly <em>considered, </em>and in some of them it was <em>decided, </em>as it <em>was </em>in that case, to be no way material whether the children, or sons, or daughters, or any of them, were or were not born at the date of the will or in the lifetime of the testator: agreeably to what, in that earliest case of the six, Lord Iiardwicke said: \u201cWherever there is <em>a remainder </em>to children, by a settlement or will, it is not material whether they are alive or not; for it will vest in different parts and proportions, as they come <em>in esse. </em>As to the interest <em>these </em>several children took under this devise, it clearly is as tenants in common <em>for their lives only, </em>remainder over to the heir [of the devisor] on the side of [his father]; and this according to <em>Wild\u2019s case.\u201d </em>1 Ves. sen. 227. \u2014 Next, in all of them it was held, that the first taker had not an estate tail, but only an estate for life, <em>although </em>the remainder to his or her children or sons or daughters ivas for life <em>only, without </em>a provision for <em>their </em>descendants. \u2014 Lastly, there was in each of them, though there was not (as Mr. Pettit points out) in <em>Wild\u2019s case, </em>a limitation <em>over </em>in default of such issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-6\">Under this last head the, fault of that gentleman\u2019s argument, \u2014 or rather its excellence, regarded as an effort in support of a bad cause, \u2014 consists in his not distinguishing between limitations over upon a definite, and such limitations upon an indefinite, failure of issue: Which distinction is well illustrated in one and the same case of <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Longstreth, </em>44 Penns. St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Rep. 297. There a testator devised his dwelling-hous<em>e </em>7T to one \u201cfor bis natural life, not to be sold or exchanged while he lives, and at his death to vest in his <em>heirs </em>as tenants in common; bnt should he die without issue, then the said property to descend to\u201d the testator\u2019s \u201c surviving heirsand he devised to the same person \u201c also for and during his natural life\u201d another messuage with its appurtenances, \u201c and, after his decease, the same to go to his <em>children, </em>share and share alike; but should he die without issue, then the said property to be equally divided among\u201d the testator\u2019s \u201c surviving heirsAnd, the first taker\u2019s interest in both properties having been sold by the sheriff; on a case stated for the court\u2019s opinion, it was held, 1. that the devisee took an estate tail in the dwelling-house, which estate, under the Pennsylvania statute of April 1859, became a fee simple; but 2. that he took no more than a life estate in the other messuage, the gift of it being, not to him <em>and </em>his children immediately, but to him and <em>afterwards </em>by way of <em>remainder </em>to them, and the words \u201c should he die without issue\u201d being construed to mean \u201c without <em>such </em>issue,\u201d \u2014 that is, in the latter clause, \u201cwithout <em>children;\u201d </em>while in the former it meant \u201cwithout <em>heirs </em>(issue) <em>of his body.\u201d </em>\u2014 Whether this was a <em>correct </em>interpretation of the phrase \u201c die without issue,\u201d where it occurred in each or in either of the clauses of that will, I am, in the present case, no way concerned to inquire; since the decision, right or wrong, serves equally well the purpose of mere illustration; one branch of it proceeding upon the principle, that a limitation to the first taker for life, remainder to his <em>children, </em>remainder over in default of <em>such </em>issue, to wit, <em>children, </em>gives to the first taker no more than a life estate, \u2014 as in the six English cases last cited by me; the other branch of it proceeding upon the principle, not less thoroughly settled, that a similar limitation over upon an indefinite failure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>heirs of the hody </em>(issue) of the first taker will make him. tenant in tail, \u2014 subject to the distinctions I shall now state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-9\">If land were devised, in Virginia, by the will of a testator who died before 1 Jan. 1820, to one and his heirs, or to one for his natural life, or to one (simply), with a limitation over upon his dying without issue, or without leaving issue, (these being in regard to real estate phrases of one and the same import, Sm. Ex. Int. \u00a7 538;) in each form of devise the first taker would have an <em>immediate </em>estate tail; but if, in such a will, land were devised to one for life, or to one (simply), with remainder to his children, or sons, or daughters, for life, or without definite exjiression of the <em>quantum </em>of their estate, remainder over in case the first taker should die without issue or without leaving 'issue, so expressed as to shew by the context that an <em>indefinite </em>failure of <em>issue </em>was the contemplated event, the first taker would have an <em>immediate </em>estate <em>for life </em>only, with remainder to his' children, or sons, or daughters, for life, <em>remainder </em>to the first taker himself <em>in tail, </em>(2 Jarm.

P. C. edit.

Those remarks are ostensibly the reporter\u2019s; but in truth they were dietated, if not actually written, by Lord who doubtless penned the certificate. In 3 Durnf. &amp; E. 96, <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>Buller J., as a vindication of his right to rely upon remarks m like manner appended to another certificate in Burrow\u2019s Reports, said: \u201cIt has been openly acknowledged by Lord Mansfield, and I have had repeated opportunities of hearing the same from him in private, that he has given to Sir James Burrow his own note and opinion of a case, which he could not deliver publicly in court; for it was not at that time the practice of this court to give their opinions <em>here </em>in cases which came from the court of Chancery:\u201d the \u201c practice\u201d in this respect, was altered by Lord Mansfield in 1774. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Holford, </em>Cowp. 34; see Ram on Science of Legal Judgment 216-219. And Sugden, in his Law of Vend. &amp; Purch. 2d ed. (1806), p. 560, n.; 3d ed. (1808), p. 618 n.; and in his edition (1811) of Grill. TJs. 41[84],n., says: \u201c The reasons at the end of the case of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>are -well known to have been written by Lord Mansfield.\u201d The fact, indeed, even from internal evidence alone, cannot reasonably be doubted. And, as <em>thus </em>explained, most lucidly, by Lord Mansfield himself, \u2014 whatever may be thought of the soundness of the decision, (which directly contradicted decisions previously made by very great judges, Sir Joseph Jekyll M. R., and Lord Talbot C., on the same will; see 1 Burr. 46-47, 1 Keny. 306, 317, 3 Atk. 738, 2 Ves. sen. 225, 3 Bro. P. C. edit. Toml. 180-181;) \u2014 the case no way fights-against my side in the present discussion; so far otherwise, its principle harmonizes perfectly with all the doctrine I have advanced, or shall advance, therein; being only, that <em>where </em>the court <em>holds </em>(right or wrong) the limitation over to be dependent on an <em>indefinite </em>failure of <em>issue male </em>of the first taker, <em>there </em>such first taker-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>will have an <em>implied </em>estate tail male. \u2014 And substantially to the same head are referable a class of decisions, not whereof it has cost me much time and toil to discover a true statement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-6\">The ^iem commonly cited as <em>Bifield\u2019s case, </em>Hil. 42 &amp; 43 Eliz.; which is said in 1 Burr. 46, <em>arg. Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>to be <em>\u201c </em>mentioned <em>only </em>in Lord Chief Justice Hale\u2019s argument in 1 Ventr. 231, and in no other book.\u201d In like manner, when that case of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>was before him, Lord Hardwicke said: \u201c I can find no place where the word son\u2019 has been construed to give an estate tail in the first taker, but the case of <em>Byjield </em>in the time of Queen Elizabeth, cited by Lord C. J. Hale in the case of <em>King </em>v. <em>Melling. </em>I do not know what weight to give to this case, because, though I have looked into Cro. Eliz. and all the contemporary reporters, yet I cannot find it reported, and notwithstanding it was mentioned by Lord Chief Justice Eyre in the case of <em>Dubber </em>v. <em>Trollop, </em>yet he states it from the case of <em>King </em>v. <em>Melling, </em>and so does every one who cites it in any case subsequent to <em>King </em>v. <em>Melling; </em>and therefore it is probable Hale quoted it from a manuscript: And, upon such an authority as this is, I cannot justify it to myself to construe the word <em>\u2018 </em>son\u2019 to give an estate tail in the case before me.\u201d 3 Atk. 737. (ETor, as we have seen, did the judges 'of the King\u2019s bench, who certified their opinion on that case, of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>differ from him in this; their certificate having proceeded on quite other ground.) And in another case, about the same time, Lord Hardwicke said further: \u201c I cannot help saying that it is a great misfortune to Westminster Hall, there is no report of Lord Chief Justice Hale himself of the case of <em>King </em>v. <em>Melling, </em>nor any copy of his argument, for it is <em>very imperfect </em>in Ventris, <em>especially </em>as to the cases said to have been cited by Haleor, according to another report, \u201c it is a great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>misfortune there is no report of that case by Lord Hale himself, or of his own argument; for though the <em>eases time cited </em>are often mentioned by judges, yet there <em>no certainty </em>of the <em>correctness </em>of the report.\u201d <em>Lethieullier </em>v. Tracy, 3 Atk. 746, Ambl. 223. \u2014 As to <em>Byfield\u2019s case </em>(so-called), in particular, I believe (and shall certainly render very probable, if I do not fully prove,) that there never was any such case of that name; that Hale did not cite any case by such designation in <em>King </em>v. <em>Melling; </em>that the case which Ventris has miscalled so was cited, not from any manuscript, but from a report then in print; and that we possess means of ascertaining with reasonable certainty what the point was and how it had been disposed \u2022of. Let me premise, that there never was and never \u2022could have been any <em>Hillary </em>term in any <em>two </em>regnal .years together of Queen Elizabeth, whose accession was on the 17th of. November, whereas Hillary term has .always, immemorially, begun in January and ended in February, till the commencement of the reign of William the Fourth, when it was fixed to terminate on the 31st of January or, if that were Sunday, then on the next day. Dugd. Orig. Jurid. 89-91; Tidd\u2019s Pact. 9th edit. 105-106; Tidd\u2019s New Pract. 41-44. But the 17th of November in the reign of Elizabeth, and long before and long after, always fell in the midst of Michaelmas term; which from the reign of Henry the Third at latest, probably from a time anterior to the Conquest, until the year 1641, when the statute of 16 Car. 1. c. 6, \u201c concerning the limitation and abbreviation of Michaelmas term,\u201d took effect, always (barring Sundays) began on the 9th of October and ended on the 28th of November, (Dugd. Orig. Jurid. <em>ubi supra; </em>Cow. Interp. edit. 1637, 1727, <em>voc. </em>Term;) so that any Michaelmas term in her reign, regularly holden, necessarily was in two regnal years, one ending, the other beginning, in it. And let me further premise, that there is a case, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>wMeli I would particularly call attention, of Mich. 42 &amp; 43 Eliz. in Moore 682, pl. 939. This report, under name <em>of Milliner </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>begins with stating an exception taken to the declaration, in ejectment; which excepti\u00b0n was Held, good, thus necessitating a judgment for the defendant on <em>that </em>ground, without any decision upon the merits, as we phrase it, or, as it was common in those days to say, the matter in law. Th&amp;\\ report then proceeds: \u201c In the case between <em>Biby </em>and <em>King, </em>the demise [laid in the declaration, in ejectment,] was\u201d in a form, which also was held bad, and with the like necessary result; but it was for a fault no way resembling the fault in the case of <em>Milliner </em>v. <em>Robinson; </em>which fact I particularly notice because it is a circumstance that tends to lead a reader, not upon his guard, into supposing what follows of the report to be part of the case <em>last </em>mentioned therein. And then, in immediate juxtaposition, comes the rest of the report in these words (literally translated): \u201cThe matter inlaw was, that Robinson devised to his brother John, and, if he should die leaving no son, that the land should remain to William for life, and, if he should die without issue having no son, it should remain to the right heirs of the devisor. The first brother has an estate in tail to his issues males; the second has but for life, or at any rate (saltern) to heirs females, because \u2018 having-no son\u2019 is merely contingent; y&gt;erPopham.\u201d <em>Now, </em>we read as follows in Keble\u2019s report (3 Keb. 99) of Hale\u2019s argument in <em>King </em>v. <em>Melling: \"[Wild\u2019s case </em>comes not] to this case, \u2018children\u2019 being only made <em>nomen collectivum </em>to serve the testator\u2019s intent, but the word \u2018issue\u2019 is, of its own nature; and Moore 682, pl. 939, cites <em>King </em>and <em>Bibe, </em>devise, if A. dieth, not having a son, then &amp;c., which is made tail.\u201d And in Yen-tor\u2019s report of the corresponding part of the same argument (1 Ventr. 231) we read: \u201cIt <em>[Wild\u2019s </em>case] comes not to this case; for though the word \u2018chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>dren\u2019 may he made <em>nomen colleciivum, </em>the word\u2018issue\u2019 <em>J </em>is <em>nomen colleciivum </em>itself. Hill. 42 &amp; 43 Eliz. <em>Bifield\u2019s case: </em>A devise to A. and if he dies not having a son, then to remain to the heirs of the testator; \u2018son\u2019 -was there taken to he used as <em>nomen collectivum, </em>and held an entail.\u201d Doubtless when Hale cited Moore 682, pl. 939, as Keble reports him to have done, he mentioned also the date in Moore, Mich. 42 &amp; 43 Eliz., (agreeably to what we know, from his published writings, was very much his habit;) and both that and the name <em>Biby </em>being caught imperfectly by Yentris, as might happen in many ways, he wrote down the former <em>Hillary </em>and the latter <em>Bifield, </em>in his notes; from which, after his death, the publication was made of his reports. How easily this might happen is illustrated by an anecdote immediately connected with the present subject. According to Atkyns, in his report of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>3 Atk. 738, \u201cLord Hardwicke said, after mentioning the case of <em>King </em>v. <em>Melling, </em>in Ventr. Rep., that the argument of Lord Chief Justice Hale in Yentris was not copied from his own argument, hut the arguments in the case of the <em>Seven Hundreds of Cirencester, </em>and a case upon <em>cdienations </em>were copied <em>verbatim </em>from a manuscript of Hale;\u201d the two cases alluded to being, indubitably, <em>Atkyns </em>v. <em>Clare, </em>1 Ventr. 399-412, and <em>Collingwood </em>v. <em>Pace, </em>id. 413-429; neither of which concerns alien-afeows at all, but the latter is a very famous ease concerning <em>aliens; </em>\u2014 perhaps Lord Hardwicke used the law-french phrase \u201c alien-?iees.\u201d One thing in Yentris\u2019s report is impossible to he true; the case cited could not have occurred in <em>Hill. </em>42 &amp; 43 Eliz., though the mistake in this respect has been followed, without correction, or (probably) detection, by Lord Chief Justice Eyre and his reporter, (Ambl. 454;) by Mr. Eazakerley and his reporter, (1 Atk. 433, West\u2019s Hardw. 309;) by Mr. Viner (8 Vin. Abr. 280, pl. 7, marg.;) and by Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Preston (2 Prest. Est. 551;) and, when we consider the form of the devise, conspicuously uncommon, it seems hardly possible, and, without stronger proof, altogether incredible, that <em>two </em>cases were before the court or courts, upon it, at the same term, and that l\u00edale cited them both, at once, and in the same connection, with the result of one reporter mentioning only one, and another reporter mentioning only the other, of them; especially when it was much easier to confound an unfamiliar name <em>Biby </em>with <em>Bifield, </em>than to confound (as Ventris certainly did) the familiar name of Michaelmas with the no less familiar name of Hillary. Eor one, therefore, I do not doubt that Hale did <em>not </em>vouch any manuscript report for the case cited, 'which in consequence of Ventris\u2019s inaccurate hearing now passes, and probably forever will pass, under (what is a mere pseudonym) the name of <em>Bifield; </em>and that the report he did vouch, in Moore, gave him all of what information <em>he professed </em>to have concerning the case. According to which printed report, \u201cthe matter in law,\u201d respecting the construction of the will, neither was nor could have been, at that time, decided; and all that we can can gather, even of extrajudicial opinion upon it, is what Popham held.- This was the view taken of it by Comyns, who says, in his Digest, <em>tit. </em>Devise N. 5: \u201cA devise to A., and, if he dies not leaving a son, &amp;c. A. takes in tail male. <em>Per </em>Poph. Mo. 682. 1 Ventr. 231.\u201d And from this manner of citation it is perhaps inferrible, that the Lord Chief Baron considered, as, by this time, this court peradventure considers, the case in Moore, and that cited in Ventris, to be one and the same. Circumstances, how-ever, favour .the belief, that the devise which missed receiving a judicial construction in the case, perhaps between <em>Biby </em>.and King, but more probably between <em>Milliner [Miller </em>?] and <em>Robinson, </em>was a few years afterwards, once, perhaps twice, brought again <em>sub judice, </em>between <em>Robin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>son </em>and <em>Miller [Milliner </em>?] and perhaps between parties not nominally the same; repeated actions of ejectment upon the same title and between substantially (though not nominally) the same parties having then already become common, as Coke mentions, and laments, in the preface to 8 Rep. xxv-xxviii. See Selw. N. P. 778, <em>tit. </em>Ejectment, xiv. In 3 Hugh. Abr. (published in 1662), p. 1917, pl. 16, it is said: \u201cA man devised lands to his wife for life, the remainder to his son; and if his son died without a son, that then it should remain over; it seemed to the court, that this was a good estate tail; and it was adjudged accordingly. Trin. 7 Jac. in C. B. <em>Robinson\u2019s case.\u201d </em>And this account is repeated in 2 Shepp. Abr. 48, almost <em>verbatim, </em>in substance precisely. The' close resemblance between it and what is said in 1 Ventr. 231 respecting <em>JBijield\u2019s </em>ease, there so-called, cannot escape observation; but the report in these two books, of the terms of the devise in <em>Robinson\u2019s case, </em>is unquestionably not quite accurate. The same case had been noticed in Shepp. Touehst. (first published in 1641), p. 441, in a form little satisfactory to Mr. Atherley or Mr. Preston, in both of whose respective editions the devise is printed as being \u201c to his wife for life,' and after to his son, and if his son died without issue (or having no son), then that it shall go to another.\u201d But I suspect there is Itere a misprint, probably the work of some bungling editor; though from want of access to the several editions of the Touchstone prior to the two that have been specified, I am not able to give the court positive assurance of it as a fact. Yet the proof is very persuasive ; for in another work of the same author, to wit, Shepp. Epit. (published in 1656), p. 504, the devise is set forth as being \u201c to hispwife for life, and after to his son, and if his son die without issue having [not <em>\u2022or </em>having] no son, then that the land shall go to another;\u201d and <em>ibid. </em>961, it is stated that \u201cif one devise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Ms land to Ms wife for life, and after to his son, and if his son die without issue having no son (or having no male), then that it shall go to another; by this devise the son hath an estate tail to him and the heirs males of his body. Adjudg. Tri. 7 Jac. C. B. <em>Robinson\u2019s case.\u201d </em>This latter statement, without indicating any source of information other than mss. is repealed <em>verbatim </em>in God. Orph. Leg. (first published in 1674), p. 334, of the 4th edit.; and almost <em>verbatim </em>(exactly so respecting the terms of the devise, but concluding \u201cby this the son hath an estate tail to him and the heirs [not saying males] of Ms body,\u201d) in 4 Shepp. Abr. (published in 1675), p. 45: And the substance of it is given, in a somewhat more perspicuous form <em>ibid. </em>vol. 2, p. 47, thus: \u201cif one devise land to his wife for life, and after to Ms son, and if his son die without issue having no son, then that it shall go to another; this is an estate tail to him and the heirs males of his body. And so also it is, if the words be, if he die having no male;\u201d which probably was delivered elliptically, meaning \u201c if he die [without issue,] having no male.\u201d In 2 Brown!, (published in 1652), p. 271, <em>Robinson\u2019s case, </em>the whole report is: \u201cA man devises lands to his wife for life, the remainder to his son, and if his son dies without issue, not having a son, that then it should remain over, and it seemed that this is a good estate tail, and it was adjudged accordingly.\u201d Lastly, the following is a literal translation from 1 Roll. Abr. (published in 1668, after Rolle\u2019s death,) p. 837, pl. 12: \u201c If a man devise land to his wife for life, and after to his son, and, if his son die without issue having no son, then another shall have it; the son has an estate tail to the heirs males of his body by this devise.

Of these accounts, \u2014 which are all I can find of \u201e the case, unless some to be presently mentioned are o\u00ed the same case, and which accounts I have taken pains to collate for the court\u2019s use, because the books containing them are for the most part difficult of access,\u2014 all agree concerning the decision which was made, and the term and the court in which it was made; Coke, the then recent reporter in print of <em>Wild\u2019s case, </em>being (let us remark) at the time chief justice of the Common Pleas, wherein the case was adjudicated. \u2014 In Littleton\u2019s Reports (published in 1683) of eases from the second to the seventh year of Charles the First, the fol-, lowing passages occur in reporting arguments of counsel; at p. 259, <em>Beck\u2019s case, </em>\u201cTrim 6 Jac. <em>Robinson\u2019s case, </em>Ban.

Robinson, seised of land devisable, devised it to his son, and if he should die having no issue male, the remainder to another, this adjudged tail to the son.\u201d Which notices, all corresponding as to the time, one year before the decision in the Common Pleas, and two of them stating that it was in the King\u2019s Bench, while the other is silent respecting the court, seem to show that the same judgment had been passed in the latter court as in the former, upon the same will, notwithstanding some discrepance of statement as to the terms of it, and notwithstanding in one of them it is said, \u2014 by palpable mistake, \u2014 that the wife <em>(qu. </em>son?) was held to take a fee [simple]. And perhaps the case cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>by Hale, 1 Ventr. 230, 3 Keb. 99, as <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>case, 4 Jac., may possibly be the same case, but, if the then of course mis-stated; for <em>that </em>is said to have been a devise to A. for life, and, if he died without issue, then over, as it is put in Ventris, A to J. S. and, if he should die without issue, as it is put in Keble. \u2014 Either of these two forms of devise would clearly be within a rule long since become familiar, which I have already mentioned, respecting limitations over upon au indefinite failure of issue. Upon all the other statements of the case, including that of Moore in his report of <em>Milliner </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>if it be on the same will, and indeed though it should be not on the same will, but on another, resembling it, I remark: Eirst, that while, where the limitation over is upon the first taker\u2019s dying <em>without issue not having a son, </em>or dying <em>without issue having no </em>son, or dying <em>without issue having no male, or perhaps </em>where it is upon his dying <em>without issue or having no son, </em>or upon his dying <em>without a son, </em>or, <em>not having a son, </em>or, <em>having no male, </em>or, <em>having no issue male, </em>there, if the preceding limitation to the first taker is indefinite as to duration, then such limitation over will made him tenant in tail male; yet in not one of all the books quoted is there even the least intimation of the <em>ground </em>of such a decision, except in the quotation I have before given from Ventris, namely, that in those circumstances \u201cson\u201d is a <em>nomen collectivum; </em>which, in truth, merely states what, in that case, \u201cson\u201d <em>is, </em>without even a suggestion of the cause <em>why </em>it is so. But I submit, that the true solution is the same as of the decisions in <em>Wyld </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>1 Atk. 432, West\u2019s Hardw. 308; <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Tally, </em>3 Call 354, (according to the remark of Judge Lyons, p. 361;) and, as it would seem, of <em>Butt </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>32 Engl. L. &amp; E. Rep. 575, 36 id. 571, 11 Exch. Rep. (2 Hurl. &amp; Gord.) 235, 1 Hurl. &amp; Norm. 109; to wit, the solution suggested by President Tucker in his remarks (12 Leigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>376-377, <em>Wright </em>v. Cohoon;) upon the case of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>and which are in consonance with the doctrine delivered by himself in <em>Doe d. See </em>v. <em>Craigen, </em>8 Leigh 449, cited with approbation by Judge Moncure, in <em>Tinsley </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>13 Gratt. 295; \u2014 that, \u201cthere being no words of inheritance in the devise to the son,\u201d as the devise is stated in that case of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>or to the brother, as the devise is stated in <em>Milliner </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>and no words of gift to any of his descendants, therefore none of <em>them </em>could ever \u201cget the estate unless it was construed to he an estate tail\u201d in him, \u201c though it was clear the testator postponed the devise over with a direct reference to henefitting\u201d such descendants, or some of them: Which sort of reasoning, the judges assembled in <em>Wild\u2019s case </em>had already resolved, was sufficient for adopting this kind of construction. 6 Rep. <em>17a-b. </em>See also 1 P. Wms. 57, <em>Bamfield </em>v. <em>Popham. </em>And in this way, from this cause, the word \u201cson\u201d is, under such circumstances, necessarily made <em>nomen collectimm, </em>for the nonce; since an estate tail, in its nature, cannot be descendible to fewer than all generations. But in the case at bar there is a direct and express gift to the children of the first taker, if she has any, by way of remainder, from and after the termination of her estate: which, according to the decision in <em>Wild\u2019s case, </em>abundantly confirmed as I have already shewn that it is, absolutely precludes any similar construction here. My second remark on them is, that, where such words of limitation over follow a preceding limitation <em>for life </em>(expressly) to the first taker, the single opinion intimated in them is (Moore 682), that he probably will have <em>no more than a life estate; </em>except in the citation from Litt. Rep. 259, where it is abundantly certain that the devise is mis-stated, since it differs in that particular from every one of so many other statements of the same devise: Ror, with that exception, have I met with any case, so far as I can at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Presen^ remember, that carries the point, upon such a devise, further than Popham\u2019s opinion in - Moore goes. On the contrary, while it is perfectly settled, that t . . . V . , , where an estate is devised to one for lite, with a imitation over upon an <em>indefinite </em>failure of issue of the first taker, there such taker has an estate tail, as the law was aforetime, from the first moment of the estate\u2019s vesting in such devisee; which estate is not subsequently diminished into the life estate originally nominated for him in express terms, though he die without ever having had issue, <em>(Doe </em>v. <em>Halley, </em>8 Durnf. &amp; E. 5; <em>Jiggetts </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>1 Leigh 419): Yet it is settled no whit less firmly, that where a devise is to one for life with remainder over in case he die without issue living at the time of his death or at other <em>not indefinite </em>period, this gives to the first taker, at the beginning, a mere life estate, which neither the birth of issue subsequently, nor the circumstance of such issue surviving the first taker, can enlarge into more than a life estate, even where the will does not give an estate to them; the former branch of this proposition having been solemnly decided by Lord Hardwicke, after elaborate argument, in <em>Lethieullier </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>3 Atk. 774-797, Ambl. 204, 220, 3 Keny. 40, 1 id. 56-65; since which decision the point has been always considered settled both in England and in Virginia (1 Jarm. Wills 490; Lew. Perpet. 294-295; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>6 Jur. N. S. 1045; <em>Jiggetts </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>1 Leigh 420; 3 Lom.

Rep. 127. bTow, in our case, there is an express estate for life, (and contingently somewhat longer than the first taker\u2019s own life, but not exceeding a life of another person), given, with no limitation over upon an indefinite failure of issue of the first taker: as I would proceed forthwith to prove, but that I desire first to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>notice some other authorities, specially relied on by counsel opposite.

Serjeant Bendloes\u2019s Reports were never printed, in anything like the state wherein he left them, until 1689, about a century subsequent to his decease. Meanwhile some copies and more abstracts (much resembling in manner the marginal abstracts in some modern books of reports) had been made from them, sometimes directly, sometimes <em>mediante </em>some other copy (perfect, or, as it might happen, more or less imperfect) or some abridgment; concerning which manner of multiplying what were called copies of Bendloes\u2019s reports, Serjeant Rowe says, in his preface to the publication just now mentioned of 1689: \u201cIt is manifest that those different <em>copies </em>were but different <em>notes </em>and <em>extracts </em>from the original, wherein such as collected them made use of their own judgments in the manner of abridging and in the choice of the cases; and under the same observation may not improperly fall the notes of some of the same cases, which we find in the beginning of Anderson and [ of ] Moore, and in some places in Leonard\u2019s Reports;\u201d all of which, to wit, Anderson, Moore, and Leonard, we may remark, were posthumously published, and therefore without any claim of authorship on the part of any of them. In point of fact, the first one hundred and thirty-one <em>placita </em>in 1 And. are, almost without an exception, <em>thus </em>taken either from some copy of Bendloes\u2019s <em>reports, </em>or (what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>seems more likely) from some <em>abstract </em>previously made therefrom, with an occasional condensation of, or cur-from, even such abstract. In 1661 was published a volume, beginning (p. 1) with these words (literally translated): \u201cHere follow eases reported by Serjeant Bendlowes, in the time of H. 8, E. 6, P. &amp; M., and the Queen Elizabeth; written out of his own Reports verbatimwhich statement is glaringly false, as we now have the means of knowing, (whether or not consciously false on the part of the publisher), in regard to almost, if not quite, every one of the one hundred and sixty-six cases there given, (in the publication of 1689 the cases number three hundred and two;) but there are many of the one hundred and thirty-one <em>placita </em>(before mentioned) in Anderson which agree <em>verbatim </em>with the corresponding accounts of same cases in this book; and others of those <em>placita </em>seem taken from the prototype of this volume, or (more probably) from some common prototype of both, <em>(not </em>Bendloes\u2019s original,) <em>with </em>a curtailment <em>thereof </em>by the person (whoever he was) that made the copy since published <em>xoith </em>the reports <em>of </em>Anderson. This appears, or something very like it, to have happened in regard to the <em>placitum </em>relied upon by counsel opposite in our case.

It is not law. The conflict between it and <em>Wild\u2019s ease, </em>and also between it and the case of <em>Ginger </em>v. <em>White, </em>Willes 553, was pointed out by Serjeant Frere in his edition of Douglas, published as long ago as 1813. To the same effect also was the note previously published, of learned reporters, (both afterwards raised to the bench, one in England, the other in India), to <em>Seale </em>v. <em>Barter, </em>2 Bos. <em>&amp; </em>P. 498. In 1827 Mr. Jar-man, in his supplemental volume to Pow. Dev. 495, note <em>q, </em>said: \u201c In <em>Hodges </em>v <em>Middleton, </em>Dongl. 431, Lord Mansfield and the court of King\u2019s Bench, inclined to think that where a testator [testatrix] devised to A. <em>for life, </em>and <em>after her death to her children, </em>upon condition that she or they constantly paid \u00a330 a year for a clergyman to officiate in her [testatrix\u2019s] chapel, and on failure thereof to testator\u2019s [testatrix\u2019s] own next heirs,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>and <em>in case of failure of children of </em>A. then to her [A.\u2019s] brother Gr., &amp;c.; A. had an estate tail, or that, if she an estate for life, the children took an estate tail; an^j as recoveries had been suffered by both, the alternative of these propositions was not material. <em>As </em>the .... . . \u201e limitation to the children in this case was by way or remainder, there seems to have been no ground, whether there were children or not, for holding the parent to be tenant in tail,\u201d \u2014 agreeably to what, I have before quoted Mr. Jarman as saying, is now admitted on all hands. \u201cIt is as difficult to perceive any solid ground for giving the children estates tail: The direction to pay the <em>\u00a330 </em>a year would have enlarged their devise to a <em>fee,\u201d </em>which would have conduced equally to the same result, under the particular circumstances (of recoveries suffered), as either of the other constructions. This note is retained in the first and third English editions of Jarm. Wills, vol. 2, p. 308 of the former, p. 366 of the latter, and in all the American editions, with no change but that of adding \u201c simple\u201d to the last word \u201cfee.\u201d And in 1831 Mr. Preston, in arguing <em>Broadhurst </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>2 Barn. &amp; Adol. 1, said: <em>\u201cHodges </em>v. <em>Middleton </em>was expressly overruled in a case in chancery, which has not been reported on this point, viz. <em>Charles Monck and others </em>v. <em>The Commissioners of Woods and </em>Forests.\u201d That case, therefore, in which the court, without occasion, and ' consequently without opportunity, <em>to decide </em>what estate either the mother or the children took, if either she or they took more than a life estate, whether in fee tail or in fee simple, yet contrived to mistake the law both as to the former and as to the latter, \u2014 can now serve no purpose, but to mislead such as can be misled, and to furnish others with an admonition against <em>implicit </em>reliance upon even <em>authentically recorded </em>opinions, of judges whose names , are in highest renown. \u201c <em>Quandoque bonus\u201d </em>\u2014 ; of which <em>I </em>shall still have to notice only too many specimens.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The next case, stated and commented upon by counsel opposite, is <em>Seale </em>v. <em>Barter, </em>2 Bos. &amp; P. 485; but as he has introduced a quotation from counsel\u2019s argument therein, which mentions the case of <em>Davie </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>1 Dough 321, I will first bestow some passing notice upon it. <em>That </em>was a marvellously plain case to have <em>\u2022any </em>question raised upon it; and it was so treated by Lord Mansfield, who said, after listening to counsel on both sides: \u201cI had a mind to see, whether ingenuity could raise a doubt on the one side, or on the other supply an argument to make the case plainer than it is on the face of it.\u201d The case, duly considered, only qiroves even less than what in numerable other authorities \u2022have long since established; to wit, that where a testator by his will sufficiently defines the sense he therein designs to put upon the word, he may, with effect, use any word in any sense, even if that sense be the direct opposite of its usual acceptation; just as well as our legislature could affix certain meanings to certain words and phrases, of their defining, wherever these are found in statutes enacted while the statutory definition is in force, <em>\u201c </em>unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent.\u201d <em>V. </em>C. 1849, c. 16, s. 17. In this manner, <em>real </em>property may pass under a testamentary gift of <em>\u201cpersonal </em>estates,\u201d <em>(Doe </em>v. <em>Tofield, </em>11 East 246;) and <em>personal </em>property may <em>not. Goodman </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>2 Mylne &amp; K 59. See <em>Carnagy </em>v. <em>Woodcock, </em>2 Munf. 234; <em>Tebbs </em>v. <em>Duval, </em>17 Gratt. 349, 361. \u2014 The case of <em>Seale </em>v. <em>Barter </em>turned altogether upon the codicil; whereby the testator devised all his estates to his son J. S. <em>and </em>his children lawfully <em>to be </em>begotten, J. S. being then married, but having no child; so that, <em>according to </em>the rule in <em>Wild\u2019s case, </em>as reported by Coke, (and with which, therefore, Lord Alvanley needed not to quarrel,) J. S. plainly took an estate tail; which construction assuredly was in no manner weakened by the further provisions of the codicil, that J. S. should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>have <em>power </em>to settle the same by will or otherwise on such of his children as he should think proper, (thereby the estate tail, as the court held, so far as continuance would interfere with a settlement made *n Pm\u2019suance such power;) and, for default of such issue, then to the testator\u2019s daughter E. S. and her children lawfully to be begotten, with a similar power; and, in default of such issue, to J. S. and E. S. equally between them; with a proviso that a settlement of \u00bf6200 <em>per annum </em>should be made on any woman whom his son might thereafter many, and that his estates should he chargeable therewith. The wonder is, not that this was held to give J. S. an estate tail, but that the question should have been thought capable of hearing a moment\u2019s debate after <em>Wild\u2019s case, </em>confirmed as that had been in so many cases meanwhile, (and see, since then, <em>Broadhurst </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>2 Barn. &amp; Adol. 1, remarked upon by Kindersley V. C. in <em>Davis ex parte, </em>2 Sim. N. S. 121, 9 Engl. L. &amp; E. Rep. 91; <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Roper, </em>3 Comm. Pl. (L.

There is, I believe, no copy to be found in Richmond of that hook; and from the very curt abridgment, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>report, of the ease in 9 Engl. C. L. Rep. 165-167, it is impossible for any but the brightest intellect, aided by the fullest information on this head, to be certain of discerning accurately the ground of the court\u2019s decision. But the same case is reported in 3 Dowl. &amp; R. 804-821; and from that report, containing not only full arguments of counsel, but also numerous remarks of the judges <em>inter </em>arguenclum, we may learn satisfactorily what views of the case led to the certificate which was sent. In substance the court held that the testator, not conjecturally, but certainly, <em>from, indications in the will itself, </em>designed to give interests which necessarily required an estate tail in the first taker; or, as it is reported to have been said <em>arguendo, </em>by counsel whose contention was successful against an implication of an estate tail, \u201cin <em>Mellish </em>v. <em>Mellish </em>the court read <em>\u2018 </em>son\u2019 and \u2018 daughter\u2019 as importing the whole line of issue; but that was <em>expressly </em>because the circumstances shewed that, if not so read, the estate would go out of the family; and <em>the real and undoubted intention of the testator looatd be </em>defeated,\u201d (31 Engl. L. &amp; E. Rep. 72. <em>East </em>v. <em>Twyford; </em>4 H. L. Cas. 517, <em>S. </em>C.;) and, having reached this conclusion, which <em>they </em>could not but assume to be right, even if it were in <em>other </em>men\u2019s judgments wrong, they were at liberty, nay bound, so long as they rested in it, to give the devise that effect, by the authority of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>heretofore mentioned, and \u2019of numerous other cases: \"Which, upon a like ground, were again followed in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>4 Barn. &amp; Adol. 431, 1 Nev. &amp; M. 654.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-4\">These authorities establish, that the word \u201c children\u201d <em>may </em>be <em>made </em>to mean heirs of the body or issue, the. words \u201c sons\u201d to mean heirs male of the body or issue male, and the word \u201c daughters\u201d to mean heirs female of the body or issue female, <em>for the sake </em>of accomplishing the testator\u2019s intention, whenever his <em>ascertained </em>intention requires that sense to be put on them; and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>conceive, from the context of Hale\u2019s opinion in <em>King </em>v. <em>Melling, </em>that he cited the case he did cite therein, by the name of <em>Bifield </em>or of <em>Biby, </em>to <em>this point </em>alone- But, while they do this, the same authorities inferentially shew, further, that such is <em>not </em>the primary sense, the natural, or ordinarily the legal, signification of those words; since, in order to put that sense upon them, argumentation was requisite in proof that, in the particular cases, such an intention existed. And, therefore, <em>every thing </em>entitled to the name of authority <em>concurs </em>in sustaining the position of a good text-writer, that \u201c\u2018children,\u2019 \u2018son,\u2019 [\u2018daughter,\u2019] are technically words of purchase; yet either \u2018 children\u2019 or \u2018 son\u2019 [or \u2018 daughter\u2019] will, if it is the intention, be accepted as a word of descent;\u201d just <em>as, per contra, </em>\u201c\u2018heirs\u2019 and \u2018heirs of the body\u2019 are technically words of descent; yet, if it is the intention, \u2018 heirs\u2019 or \u2018 heirs of the body\u2019 will be accepted as words of purchase.\u201d Earn on /Wills 53. That is to say, these words and phrases will not change their <em>nature, </em>while they retain their natural <em>meaning; </em>but a <em>meaning, </em>different from their natural, will be put on them, when that is necessary for accomplishing the testator\u2019s intention. But then, <em>intention, </em>in order to produce such effects, must be \u201c manifest and certain, not obscure or doubtful,\u201d as was resolved by the judges in <em>Wild\u2019s case, </em>6 Rep. 16b. Or, in the words of Lord ITardwicke, it must appear hy \u201c declaration plain, that is, not saying in so many words, but plain* expression or necessary implication, which is the same thing.\u201d <em>Garth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>2 Ves. sen. 65. Or, as Alderson B., delivering the opinion of the whole court of Exchequer, after elaborate argument and time taken for consideration, said with pains-taking precision: \u201c Upon a careful examination of the authorities we think that it may be safely laid down as a rule, that in a devise technical words, or words of definite meaning, shall always be construed according to their legal or defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>nite effect, unless, from <em>other </em>inconsistent <em>words in the will, </em>it be <em>quite dear </em>that they are used in some other definite sense. Thus, if the words \u2018 heirs of the body,\u2019 which are technical words, properly admitting only of one meaning, are used, it becomes necessary <em>to show </em>affirmatively that the testator meant <em>dearly </em>to use them as words of purchase; \u2014 it is <em>not </em>enough to raise a <em>reasonable doubt </em>whether he intended to use them as words of limitation, or to show <em>aprobable conjecture </em>that he intended to designate <em>children </em>only by that phrase.\u201d \u201c Another instance of the application of the rule may be found, in the class of cases in which \u2018sons\u2019 [or \u2018 daughters\u2019] or \u2018 children,\u2019 <em>which </em>in their proper sense <em>are words of purchase, </em>have been held to be words of limitation. There, in like manner, it must be <em>demonstrated </em>from <em>the toill affirmatively </em>and <em>dearly, </em>that by these expressions the testator? meant <em>all </em>the <em>descendants </em>[or all the male or all the female descendants] of the body to take as heirs.\u201d <em>Lees </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>1 Younge &amp; Coll. Exch. Rep. 606, 607. And, as was said by Sir Thomas Plumer M. E., if the intent be uncertain, if it be <em>in equilibrio, </em>or even in suspense or doubt, then the <em>legal </em>operation of the words <em>must </em>take effect.\u201d <em>Cholmondeley </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>2 Jac. &amp; W. 96. See further Ram on Wills 31-32, 109 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-4\">I have now noticed, I believe, every authority, which has been cited by counsel opposite as favouring that side upon the topics hitherto discussed. And I think it may be stated without danger of mistake or of serious or plausible dispute, that the discussion has established, as applicable immediately to the case in hand, the following results: \u2014 First. That although, where an estate is devised to one, either expressly for life, or indefinitely, with whatever subsequent limitations, if the testator\u2019s intention be sufficiently discovered, to provide (by means of the same subject matter of estate) .for all offspring of the first taker, or for the whole of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>any line of sucli offspring, in every successive generation descending from such first taker, or for some deprogeny within the whole of any line of such offspring, in every such generation, there, as the law was aforetime, the will would give to the first taker an \u00b0 ... estate tail, \u2014 according to circumstances, either immediately, or else in remainder after some intervening estate, \u2014 where <em>otherioise </em>the property would not be transmissible, conformably to such intention, either to descendants at all, or else to descendants more remote than those the will has <em>suo jure </em>provided for: Yet such intention is never sufficiently discovered from mere conjecture, however plausible, or however probable in itself, but must always be proved, from the will, expounded in the light of such extraneous evidence as is legally admissible; by demonstration plain; past any doubt; so as not even to leave the judicial mind in any suspense about its having been thus demonstrated; else the legal operation of the words must take effect; upon the not unnatural, nay the necessary, presumption that the technical effect of the words is intended by the testator, if a different intention he not apparent therein. \u2014 Second. That a devise to one, either expressly for life, or even indefinitely, with remainder to the devisee\u2019s children, whether expressly for life, or indefinitely touching what estate they should take, would not, as the law was before <em>7 </em>Oct. 1776, have made the first taker tenant in tail, either immediately or in remainder, by reason of an intention, <em>thence </em>presumed, of the testator, to provide for <em>all </em>the descendants of such first taker, or upon any other ground. For this the <em>decision </em>in <em>Wild\u2019s case, </em>which has never since been shaken, but on the contrary has been very frequently confirmed, is ample authority. \u2014 Third. That while an implication of such intention, as is necessary for giving such first taker an estate tail, immediately or in remainder, is sufficiently made out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>from a limitation over upon a failure of issue of the . . first taker <em>whenever, </em>at any time <em>indefinitely </em>future, it shall happen, \u2014 commonly (for the sake of brevity) styled an indefinite failure of issue; and while the same implication sufficiently results from a limitation over upon such failure of children, where the context demonstrates, with the plainness I have just now mentioned, that \u201c children\u201d is used as synonymous with \u201cissue,\u201d so as to comprehend successive generations as long as the progeny shall last; yet it is otherwise, where the limitation over is upon, what from its contrast with the foregoing is called, a <em>definite </em>failure of issue, or of \u201cchildren\u201d in the sense of \u201cissue,\u201d meaning a failure in some particular generation, or at or before some collateral epoch or event, designated: And while a limitation over, upon a failure of issue, must <em>prima fade </em>be construed as upon an indefinite failure,\u2014 which in all that, to the purposes of this case, is proved by numerous authorities collected by counsel opposite, and which authorities therefore, after this distinct admission of what- they prove, I need not notice any further; \u2014 yet it is otherwise, either where the limitation is upon a failure of \u201c children,\u201d so denominated in the will, if there be not in the context enough to force that term out of its natural and also technical signification, into the larger signification of the term \u201cissue;\u201d or even where the limitation over is upon a failure of \u201c issue\u201d or \u201c heirs of the body,\u201d so denominated in the will, if it be shown by the context to mean a failure of <em>such </em>issue, or such heirs of the body, <em>as </em>\u201c children\u201d are in the natural and technical signification of the term last mentioned; that is, immediate fruit of the first taker\u2019s own body, the <em>necessary parentage </em>of his granci-children, should any be born to him. The last in order of these propositions is inferrible from <em>Jesson </em>v. <em>Wright </em>in the House of Lords, and from our Virginia case of <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>and was actually de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>cided in <em>Doe d. Wright </em>v. <em>Jesson </em>in the King\u2019s Bench,. <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Adams </em>in the Common Pleas, and our Virginia case of <em>Prior </em>v. <em>Duncan. </em>The proposition immediately preceding it is clearly deducible <em>a fortiori </em>from the same authorities, and moreover was expressly decided in <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Goodwin, Denn </em>v. <em>Page, Hay </em>v. <em>Coventry, Foster </em>v. <em>Romney, Doe </em>v. <em>Vaughan, Ashley </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>and the Pennsylvania case of <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Longstreth.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-9\">Upon these authorities, in consonance with the soundest as well as the best settled principles, it seems clear that Plancy Perry would have had no more than an estate for the term of her own life and (contingently) the widowerhood of any surviving husband she might leave, \u2014 not an estate tail, as the law was aforetime,\u2014 even if the clause in question of her father\u2019s will were to be read as counsel opposite desires it should be; to wit, in the sense of giving a remainder to the testator\u2019s children <em>after </em>the remainder to those of Kancy Perry, though she should leave children, who, surviving both her and her last husband, should actually come into-possession of the land. Por, even then, according to the <em>lex temporis </em>(prior to 7 Oct. 1776), as the preceding authorities show, the remainder to the testator\u2019s children, would have taken effect at the termination of the' <em>Ufe estate </em>of <em>her </em>children; though <em>they </em>should have left ever so many children. These \u00bf/nmi-children of Plancy Perry would have taken no more than the grand-child' of Rowland \"Wild and his wife did; who took just nothing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-10\">' But I consider it to be very certain, that such is not either the true meaning or the legal construction of the clause under consideration; and that, on the contrary, both the former and the latter are the same as if\" the clause were in these words: \u201cI lend to my daughter (certain) land, to be possessed by her and whosoever shall lawfully claim under her, during her natural life- and the widowerhood of any surviving husband whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>she may leave; and at her death and the death or after-marriage of such surviving husband, if any, then to be equally divided among her children, if she has any; <em>otherwise, </em>then to be divided among all my children.\u201d There is room to contend, that the word \u201cthen,\u201d where it occurs the second time in this sentence, or rather in the corresponding sentence of the original, has the same meaning as where it occurs first; and that it is, in each instance, an adverb of time, denoting in a monosyllable what is expressed more at large by the phrase \u201cat such time, and so soon, as she shall be dead and no surviving husband of her shall be remaining unmarried.\u201d But I waive all dispute about that; being content to take the second \u201cthen\u201d as denoting only the contingent event of the first taker having no children. Stil lthe legal effect will be the same; and that is, to create what is now most commonly called an alternative limitation. Such limitations, or the gifts made by means of them, considered in conjunction with those for which they are contingently substitutionary, have also been called, sometimes contingencies with a double aspect, sometimes gifts upon a double contingency, sometimes devises or bequests on two alternative contingencies. Sm. Ex. Int. \u00a7 129. Under their now more common, as well as more accurate, appellation, they have been defined, and an illustrative example of them given, as follows: \u201cAn alternative limitation creates an interest that is <em>only </em>to vest <em>in case </em>the next preceding interest should <em>never vest, </em>in any way, through the failure of the contingency on which such preceding interest depends. As where a testator devises to A. for life, and, if he have issue male, then to such issue male and his heirs forever; and, if he die without issue male, then to B. and his heirs forever.\u201d Ibid. \u00a7 128; Sm. Re. &amp; Pers. Prop. 242. The case thus put for an example is the very case of <em>Loddington </em>v. <em>Kime, </em>3 Lev. 431, 1 Salk. 224, 1 Ld. Raym. 203; which Mr. Jarman, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\"both in his supplemental volume to Pow. Dev. 517-518, and in his work On Wills, vol. 2, pp. 338-339, assailed with remarkable vehemence; pronouncing it to be \u201cclearly overruled.\u201d blot that any court, or even any single judge, or any text-writer, \u2014 save himself, \u2014 has passed that sentence of condemnation upon it; but he conceived it to be not reconcileable with some subsequent decisions. This, however, was a clear mistake of that able and (in general) accurate writer; which his English editors, since his death, have, in great measure, saved me the trouble of proving, to be such, by their withdrawing from his work Oh Wills all traces thereof, and substituting instead a reconciling explanation. 2 Jarm. Wills 397-398, 3rd Lond. edit. His error was the consequence of an essential mis-statement (by him) of the case, upon that very point for which it is here adduced. The devise was to one for life, and, if he should die without issue male, then over; which undoubtedly would have given the first taker an estate tail, <em>if </em>that had been all; because then it would have been a limitation over upon an indefinite failure of issue male. But the full statement of the devise, omitting only words clearly not material on the present occasion, is as follows: \u201c As concerning my manors of Pickworth and Willoughby, I devise them to my uncle Evers Armin for his life, without impeachment of waste; and <em>in case </em>he shall have issue male, to such issue male and his heirs forever; and after the death of my uncle Evers Armin, <em>in case </em>he leaves no issue male, the manor of Pickworth to my nephew Sir Thomas Styles and his heirs forever. And as to the manor of Willoughby,\u201d concerning which the question arose, \u201cm <em>case </em>my uncle Evers Armin die without issue male, I devise it to my nephew Thomas Bernardistone and his heirs forever:\u201d thus indicating that the final limitation was not to take place whenever, at any time indefinitely future, there should happen a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>failure of the first taker\u2019s male issue; hut that it must take effect, if at all, in case (only) the first taker should not have issue, that could take at the termination the life estate given him. The case therefore, \u2014 in which it was held, that Evers Armin had but a life estate, with alternative contingent remainders limited thereon, \u2014 is a clear authority, that words, which ordinarily would import an indefinite failure of issue, yet shall not receive that interpretation where the context shows that the limitation following is not intended as a remainder, <em>after </em>a limitation to the first taker\u2019s issue shall have been spent, but is intended as an alternative limitation, <em>in case </em>that (to the first taker\u2019s issue) shall <em>never </em>vest. And if this authority should he thought to need confirmation, after Mr. Jarman\u2019s assault <em>{alio intuitu) </em>upon it, I may mention that another case after-wards arose before the court of chancery, concerning the title to the manor of Pickworth under the same will, as to which the question was, in legal effect, precisely the same as it had been concerning the manor of \u2019Willoughby in <em>Loddington </em>v. <em>Kime; </em>and it received, twenty years after the decision in that case, precisely the same answer in the House of Lords, upon appeal, in accordance with the unanimous opinion of all the then judges. <em>Barnardiston </em>v. Carter, 3 Bro. P. C. edit. Toml. 64-74, 1 P. Wms. 505-510. After which the same will was again, by fresh hill, brought before Sir Joseph Jekyll M. R., and, by appeal from his decree, before Lord Parker (afterwards Macclesfield), O.; from both of whom it also received the same construction.' <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Barnadiston, </em>1 P. Wms. 510-522. And although Levinz reports (3 Lev. 435), that \u201c before any judgment was given, the parties [in <em>Loddington </em>v. <em>Kime] </em>agreed and divided the estate;\u201d which statement, repeated from Levinz in 1 Salk. 225, has been sometimes understood as asserting (what it does not) that no judgment was ever entered, and led Lord O. J. Ryder, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>instance, into believing that the case was never deter- , . mined, notwithstanding the statement m Lord Ray-report presently mentioned, <em>(Doe </em>v. Reason, cited 3 Wils. 246): yet indubitably the fact was, as it is. s^a^e(^ ^e report of Lord Raymond, which con-eludes (1 Lord Raym. 209) with these unusual and remarkable words: \u201c And therefore judgment was given [&amp;c.] <em>for </em>judgment <em>is </em>entered upon the record for the plaintiff.\u201d The reason of which particularity will be seen in what Lord Raymond said when delivering (as chief justice) the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Weigh; </em>wherein, adverting to the passage I have quoted from Levinz, he said: This \u201cis a mistake; for I heard the opinion of the court given <em>seriatim </em>myself, viz. Pasch. 9 Wm. 3, in the year 1697, that Evers Armin took but an estate for life, because the first issue male took the [a] contingent remainder. It has also had decisions in other places; it having been brought into the court of Chancery, and by appeal thence carried into the House of Lords: The judgment given in the court of Common Pleas was in all those places confirmed, and not in the least shaken; and has been acquiesced under ever since. Judgment is entered on the roll, in C. B., Trim 5 W. &amp; M. <em>rot. </em>1551, as was: said by Eyre, C. J. in another case.\u201d Fitzg. 21-22, and <em>(in toiidem </em>verbis) Fortesc. 74-75. See also, 2 Stra. 844, 1 Eq. Abr. 183, pl. 23, more concisely to the same effect; 11 Mod. (edit. 1781, not Leach\u2019s) p. 298, Treby C. J. in <em>Scattergood </em>v. <em>Edge. </em>In 3 Wils. 240, <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Holme, </em>it is also said that Lord C. J. Be Grey, delivering the opinion of the court in that case, said, about <em>Loddington v. Kime, </em>\u201cthough both Levinz and Salkeld report that the parties agreed, and divided the estate, before judgment was given, yet it appears from a ms. report of the ease by Judge Blencowe, (which the reporter Serjeant Wilson has seen) that, after long consideration, judgment was given that Evers Armin took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>an estate for life, with contingent remainder over.\u201d . _ _ <em>m </em>___ _ And Sir Wm. Blackstone, who was one of the court that decided <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Holme, </em>in his report of that case, (2 W. Blackst. 778,) states the chief justice to have said, that <em>Loddington </em>v. <em>Kime </em>resembled \u201c <em>this </em>case in appoints. <em>That </em>was several times agitated in all courts of Westminster Hall\u201d \u2014 this, however, I cannot verify with respect to the courts of King\u2019s Bench and Exchequer \u2014 \u201cand (continues the chief justice, according to Blackstone,) at length settled in <em>Dorm. Proc. </em>by the unanimous opinion of all the judges.\u201d The real truth about the result in <em>Loddington </em>v. <em>Kime </em>is, doubtless, what-is stated in 3 Bro. P. C. edit. Toml. 66, as follows: \u201cAfter several arguments in the court of Common Pleas judgment was given in favour of Armyne Bullingham [the substantial plaintiff, though not in form such upon the record.] But both [of the substantial pai\u2019ties to the suit] being relations, they <em>after-wards </em>came to an agreement:\u201d which, as that report proceeds to narrate in detail, was effectuated by deed enrolled, and fine, and recovery. See also 1 P. Wms. 507; and observe that the date there given, of Jan. 1697, was <em>subsequent </em>to Easter term 1697, according to the civil calendar used in England till the year 1752. Ho decision, therefore, ever came under review, that brought with it a greater amount of judicial authority touching the same identical point, than this does. Moreover it was not only followed in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Holme, </em>but, furthermore, in that case, \u201cthe lord chief justice De Grey said, he should have been of the same opinion, although the case of <em>Loddington </em>and <em>Kime </em>had never been determined.\u201d 3 Wils. 243. And, without being cited, it was yet in effect followed, in our Virginia case of <em>Foxwell </em>v. <em>Craddock, </em>1 Patt. &amp; H. 250. Besides which, in Eearn. Posth. pp. 178-184, 185-190, there are two several opinions of probably the most able judge of such questions that has yet lived, (though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>never installed m a iudicial office.) to precisely the same effect, on original reasoning and without distinct or allusion to these cases or any of <em>them; </em>though certainly not unaware of those in England, all of which had arisen and been determined before his day. Butl. Fearne 225, 354-356, 373 \u2014 374. See also <em>Egerton </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>3 Comm. Bench N. S. 338, 349-354. \u2014Therefore, upon this distinct and separate ground, in addition to the ground heretofore discussed, I submit that Nancy Perry did not take more than an estate for her own life, with a contingent elongation thereof during the widowerhood of such husband as she might leave surviving.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-9\">Whether this contingent elongation would make any difference in the case of that devisee, favorable to her taking an absolute ownership in fee simple, through the medium of a constructive entail, is an inquiry which counsel opposite has not noticed, except insofar as it is involved in his discussion <em>of, </em>\u2014 Secondly, what he suggests is a difference between her title and that of Sally Stone under the same <em>will; </em>the devise in favor of the latter being of land \u201c to be possessed by her <em>and </em>any husband, she may have, upon the same terms'and conditions as Nancy Perry\u2019s.\u201d \u2014 I shall, therefore, now transfer my discussion, also, to the <em>direct </em>consideration of Sally Stone\u2019s title; though really that is, out and out, the same as Nancy Perry\u2019s.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-10\">The words in the devise to Sally, \u201cto be possessed by her <em>and </em>her (future) husband,\u201d coupled with the residue of the same clause, would not, if she had married, have given an estate of any kind to her husband ; for that consequence (of <em>giving him </em>an estate or interest <em>under the will, </em>apart from what his <em>jus mariii </em>would confer,) is annulled and absolutely stifled by the last words of the clause referring to the \u201c terms and conditions\u201d affecting Nancy Perry\u2019s land under the clause of the will concerning it: Which certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>gave to Haney\u2019s present or future husband, nothing whatever in the land, during her life or after her death, except \u2014 I was about to say, but in truth <em>it </em>did not give him even, \u2014 what he might derive from the marital right of himself or from the good pleasure of his wife. Under the former he would have the right of enjoyment during the coverture, but no longer, since of such an estate he could not be tenant by the curtesy because it was not descendible. 1 Lom.

Under the latter, if his wife chose, he might have the same enjoyment continued <em>durante viduitate sua </em>(but no longer); for, although she (as being <em>a feme </em>covert) could not, either by deed directly from her to him, or by will, give him such benefit, for want of express <em>power </em>to that effect conferred by her father\u2019s will, yet such purpose was capable of accomplishment; it might have been effected by deed from her and him to some third person, to be conveyed back for any modification of estate agreed upon, within the limits (in point of duration) of her original estate. <em>Shepperson </em>v. <em>Shepperson, </em>2 Gratt. 501; <em>Shearman\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>14 id. 96. If no such conveyance were made, and she died leaving a surviving husband, her interest in the land during his viduity would be disposable as personal assets of her estate. V. L. 1803, 1814, c. 92, s. 54; V. C. 1849, c. 130, s. 18. And that these things would not have been at all different in regard to <em>Sally\u2019s </em>husband, if she had married and left a widower, I conceive to he sufficiently clear without quoting authority. Tet beg leave to mention <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Wodhull, </em>Willes 592, for the sake of its beai'ing both on this and on at least one other question in this case. [Mr. Green particularly called attention to the penultimate paragraph of the court\u2019s opinion in p. 596.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-4\">But while I contend for this, because it seems to me-the correct construction; I cannot perceive how my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>cause would sustain detriment from admitting, that the will gave an estate in remainder,. <em>durante </em>viduitate, to respective surviving husbands (should there be such) of the testator\u2019s daughters; since it would seem \u2122Poss^eJ that such a limitation to them would any way tend to make the several devises to the respective daughters import an estate tail, or more than a life estate, in these latter. \"Whether regarded as a contingent provision made by the testator for possible widowers of his daughters, or as a contingent elongartion of their respective estates in'order to give to them, respectively, the power of making (at their pleasure) such a provision; neither way could it give, or tend to give, any one, an <em>inheritable </em>estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-6\">Counsel opposite, however, insists that, as Sally Stone might have married a man not born till after the death of her father, so that (according to him) the Rule against Perpetuities would have forbidden her children of such marriage taking as <em>purchasers; </em>therefore \u201cthe court will sacrifice the testator\u2019s minor intent, that they should take <em>by </em>purchase,\u201d in order that it may \u2014as it \u201cwill, under the doctrine of approximation or <em>cy pres, </em>\u2014 give effect to his paramount intent, that <em>all the issue </em>of his daughter should take; by giving an estate tail to such daughter, so as to enable the grandchildren to take <em>derivatively </em>through her, though they cannot be \u2022allowed to take in the particular mode pointed out by the testator.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-7\">Row the first remark I make upon this argumentation is, that it adroitly substitutes for what is certain, \u2014namely, that the testator designed bounty for his daughter\u2019s <em>children, </em>if she should have any, \u2014 what is worse than uncertain, namely, that he designed bounty for her grand-children and more remote descendants,\u2014 in three words, <em>all her issue; </em>whereas this latter intention (imputed) not only does not appear with the plainness of a perfect demonstration, but moreover is so far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>from it, that, according to the rule of the law prior to 7 Oct. 1776, the very contrary thereof does appear. Eor, according to that rule, if Sally\u2019s children had actually become possessed, under the will of their grandfather, still <em>their </em>children would have taken nothing; as is proved by <em>Wild\u2019s case, </em>and the half dozen other English cases which I have heretofore grouped together as supporting the decision in that case. \u2014 My second remark on it is, that, this unauthorized portion of the premises being subducted, the rest of the argument collapses. The will of Caleb Stone does <em>not </em>contain \u2022an attempt at giving, contrary to legal inhibition, an \u25a0estate by purchase to the children of a person not <em>in esse </em>when it was itself executed; for it requires that \u25a0they shall be the children of a person (to wit, his daughter named) who was then in existence. And, if we suppose, <em>argumenti gratia, </em>that what it does attempt is <em>equivalent, </em>because such children maybe the progeny of a father not himself born until after the death of the testator; what then ? The book quoted by the counsel in support of his contention on this point, Smith\u2019s Original View of Executory Interests, does not sustain him: Eor, after stating the law of the cases, first, \u201c where a testator devises <em>an estate tail </em>to a grandchild, by a child not yet born at the testator\u2019s death, to take by purchase, <em>and </em>he <em>appears\u201d </em>\u2014 by <em>demonstration plain </em>must of course be meant, as has been before shown, \u2014 \u201cto have intended that <em>all </em>the issue <em>of such unborn child </em>should take, so far at least as the rules of descent will permit,\u201d (\u00a7 534, 535;) and, secondly, \u201cwhere a testator attempts to create <em>a perpetual succession of life estates </em>in favor of children <em>in esse </em>and more remote descendants,\u201d (\u00a7 536 <em>a;) </em>\u2014 within neither of which classes does the present case range itself; it proceeds thus (\u00a7 536 b), \u201cbut, where there is a single intent to create <em>a limited number, only, of life estates in succession, </em>not warranted \u25a0by the K.ule against Perpetuities, <em>an estate tail will not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>be given </em>to <em>any </em>of the persons intended to take life estates.\u201d And then an illustrative case is stated as \u201cA testator.gave an estate to his son F., during his natural life; and, after him, he gave it to his eldest or any other son after him, during his natural life; and, after them, to as many of his descendants, issue male, as should he heirs of his of their bodies, down to the tenth generation, during their natural lives. It was held, that F. took <em>for life only; </em>Lord Ellenborough C. J. observing, that in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>1 Burr. 38; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Applin, </em>4 T. R. 32; <em>Doe d. Bean </em>v. <em>Halley, </em>8 T. R. 5, expressions were used denoting an intention that the lands should continue in the descendants of the first taker as long as there were any, without specifying or marking what estates such descendants should take; that this case, however, was. not a case of a particular and a general intent, but a case of a single intent to create a succession of estates not warranted by law. <em>Seaward </em>v. <em>Willock, </em>5 East 198.\u201d (See also 1 Jarm. Wills 263-264). Among authorities cited in that case is one which I have heretofore mentioned from Willes 592, <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Wodhull, </em>very forcible to the same purpose; to which I will add one other, the last that I shall state under this head. It is <em>White </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>Comyns 289, accurately stated in 3 LoM. Dig. 347 [239-240], from 6 <em>Cruis. Dig. </em>362-3 [ 296-7 ], as follows : \u201c Francis Harvey devised in these words: \u2018 I give to my son Frank Mildmay my farm called East House Farm, &amp;c. to enjoy the rents and profits thereof during the term of his natural life, with power to make a jointure of all or part, if he should marry; and after his death and jointure (if any be made) to the heir male of his body lawfully begotten, during the term of his natural life; and for want of such heir male, I give the said farm to my son Carew Mildmay\u2019 &amp;c. It was agreed, that the limitation to F. M. to enjoy and take the profits during his-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>life, and after Ms decease to the <em>heirs </em>male of his body, would make an estate tail. So, if it had been to the <em>heir </em>male of his body, in the singular number, where nothing appeared which explained the intent to the contrary. But here the intention appeared to be, that such heir male should have the land <em>only for life, </em>which \u25a0 showed that \"the testator did not intend that those words should be taken as words of limitation; and nothing appeared in the nature of the expression, which implied that they should be so. <em>H\u00e1r </em>male, or <em>next heir </em>male, were words of purchase,\u201d \u2014 certainly, however, not more than <em>child </em>or <em>children, </em>\u2014 \u201cand, in this case, where the-devise was to F. M., and after his decease [and termination of the jointure, if he made any,] to the heir male of his body, during his life, the express limitation, <em>during his life, </em>showed that he intended <em>his son </em>should have it in remainder <em>for his life only; </em>and, when he devised it over,.for want of such heir male, to C. M., this did not import that C. M. should not have it [should wait for it] till F. M. died without heirs male generally p. <em>e. </em>indefinitely], but [that he should have it] for want of <em>such </em>heir male who was to have it for life.\u201d The case was twice argued; once, with great ability, by Comyns himself, who has reported his own argument at considerable length, (pp. 291-301;) and the judgment, rendered in an inferior court, was unanimously affirmed. To the foregoing abstract of the .case let me add, the special verdict found that the testator died leaving Carew Mildmay his eldest son, and Francis (the first taker in the devise which has been recited) his second son, who was not married nor had any issue; that he subsequently suffered a recovery for the purpose of converting his estate into a fee simple, and then devised it by his will, and died; and then the contest arose between his devisee and the remainderman in his father\u2019s will, to wit, Carew Mildmay; which terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>in the manner we have seen. The parallel between that case and ours, upon the point at present tinder discussion, appears to me to be absolutely perfect: For there, as here, a father devised land to one of his younger children, who was then, and at the death of the testator, childless and unmarried, for life, with power to settle the whole land upon any wife he might afterwards have, \u2014 though she might not be born until after the death of the devisor, \u2014 for the term of her life, such being the well-known nature of all jointures; and after his death and the termination of such jointure, in case any such were made, to the descendant, yet unborn, of the first devisee, who should be his heir male, during the term of his natural life; and, for want of such issue male, over. It is true, the limitation, in our case, to Sally Stone\u2019s children, \u201cif she has any,\u201d is not expressly for life only; but counsel opposite contends it must be so construed, and this contention is absolutely necessary for his success; since, if they were construed to take a fee simple, that would effectually confine Sally Stone to the life estate nominated in the will for her, as eases almost innumerable have settled. Besides the many heretofore cited, may be mentioned a quite recent one, <em>Crofts </em>v. Middleton, 35 Engl. L. &amp; E. Rep. 466. In that case, of <em>White </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>\u2014 to pursue and complete our parallel, \u2014 the first taker, claiming to be tenant in tail, undertook to devise the land, after a recovery suffered for the purpose of converting his fee tail, and, if he had had a fee tail, with the effect of converting it, into a fee simple; as, in our case, according to the contention of appellants, Sally Stone did, under general words in her will, devise the land in question, after her fee tail therein, under the law aforetime, had been converted into fee simple, by the statute, the precise effect of which, upon estates tail coming within its operation, was, in the words of Judge Lomax, (1 Lom. Dig. 34 [28],) \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>same as if the tenant in tail had suffered a recovery:\u201d <em>v </em>And the devisee of the first taker in that case missed of getting the land, because Frank Mildmay took more than an estate for his life with a power to jointure any wife he might afterwards have, upon the whole land, for her life; as, in our ease, the devisee (so-claiming-to-be) of the first taker must likewise miss of getting the land, because Sally Stone took no more than an estate for her life with power (in effect) to \u201cjointure\u201d any husband she might afterwards have, upon the whole land, for his life, provided he should not again marry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-8\">Thus far I have conducted the argument on my part, as if the case of <em>Smith </em>v. Chapman, 1 Hen. &amp; M. 240, never had been decided. Concerning it Professor Hoffman, in the first edition (1817) of his Course of Legal Study, remarked, \u2014 and he retained the remark in his enlarged and carefully revised second edition (1836), p. 186, \u2014 \u201cthis case is the most valuable ease to be found [on the subject to which it relates] in the American reports.\u201d And it certainly was not because I dissent at all from that estimate, that I have hitherto forborne to mention the decisiou. I had a better reason. Opposite counsel devotes to it a long discussion, concluding with an assertion that \u201c the case has been overruled;\u201d as he had begun with asserting that it \u201cis the only one to be found in the books English or American, which tends to sustain the proposition that the testator\u2019s daughters took, under the will here, only estates for life and not fee tails.\u201d And I was minded to show, first, that there was abundance of other authority tending in that direction with irresistible force; and, secondly, that therefore the decision (in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman) </em>ought not to have been overruled; as I now eounter-asseverate that it has not been. The true point decided in that case is not accurately represented in the marginal abstract of the reporters; and fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>may well be found with their representation. It is as follows: \u201c A testator makes three devises (to his two sons and [his] daughter, severally), for the life of each devisee; and after his or her decease, to his or her child or children; if none, to the other two devisees for life, and then to he equally divided between their children; and [he] annexes a codicil, in which he says that, if all his children should die without issue of their bodies, his wife living, the life estate should go to his wife during her natural life, and, after her death, remainder to other persons. The two sons and daughter take each an estate for life; and the remainders over are good, and may take effect; the contingencies not being too remote.\u201d How tbe single question before the court there was, whether one' of the sons, who had died never having had a child, was seized of a mere life estate, or of some larger estate in the lands devised him; the suit being brought by his relict and her second husband to recover dower therein; and all that the court, affirming unanimously Chancellor \"Wythe\u2019s decree, could decide or affected to decide, was that the female complainant\u2019s late husband had not been seised of an estate whereof she was dowable; in other words, that his estate had been only for his life. And all that was said by any of the judges, about the limitation over in the codicil, was that it did not import an indefinite failure of issue, hut a definite failure, to take place in the lifetime of the testator\u2019s surviving wife, which the judges interpreted to mean a failure <em>at the death </em>of each first taker, respectively, <em>happening </em>in the lifetime of his own (the testator\u2019s) widow; and <em>not, </em>even then, a failure of <em>issue, </em>in the larger sense of the word, but a failure of <em>children. </em>This appears as to Judge Tucker, 1 Hen. &amp; M. 292, and as to Judge Roane, <em>ibid. </em>298 ; tbe other two judges remaining silent as to this point: <em>And so </em>the opinion of <em>the court </em>was <em>understood, </em>when another case upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>same will was recently before the present judges. On that occasion Judge Joynes, in whose opinion both his associates concurred, said, speaking of the same codicil: \u201c There the testator speaks of the contingency of all his children dying\u2018without issue of their bodies,\u2019in general terms, where <em>the meaning </em>was \u2018 without issue of their bodies\u2019 (children) living at their death, as was held by this court in the ease just mentioned.\u201d 17 Gratt. 363, <em>Tebbs </em>v. <em>Duval. </em>Interpreted <em>thus, </em>that will and its codicil contained nothing which could enlarge the life estate expressly given the first takers into an estate tail, as the law was aforetime; according to very numerous authorities I have already cited, <em>and some others, </em>cited in that case, for which reason I purposely pretermit them here. Whether it was a correct interpretation of the particular expressions there used, is an inquiry wholly foreign to the present discussion, since Caleb Stone\u2019s will contains no limitation over upon either a definite or an indefinite failure of <em>issue. </em>For this reason I shall not now consume time in debating that question, or in attempting, formally, to prove what seems to me clearly demonstrable, that that interpretation was in accordance with numerous authorities, and <em>all the best, </em>which were then extant. \u2014 To show that upon the topics hitherto discussed other American authorities may be cited not less favourable to my side than <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>is (and is confessed by counsel opposite to be), I will merely refer to <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>5 Munf. 242; <em>Grim\u2019s Appeal, </em>1 Grant 209; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Milligan, </em>45 Penns. St. Rep. 178; <em>Tongue </em>v. <em>Nutwell, </em>13 Maryl. Rep. 415; <em>Buise </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>4 Richards. Eq. Rep. 421; <em>Corbett </em>v. <em>Laurens, </em>5 id. 301; <em>Reeder </em>v. <em>Spearman, </em>6 id. 88; <em>McCorkle </em>v. <em>Black, </em>7 id. 407; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Hurt, </em>12 Georg. Rep. 357.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-6\">If it has (as I trust it has) now been demonstrated, that there was not, under Caleb Stone\u2019s will, an estate tail \u201cas the law was aforetime;\u201d then we have finally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>done, in this case, with that aforetime law; which had a gmsz-continuing existence, for the sole purpose of bringing within the universal \u201c common recovery,\u201d created by statute among us, such limitations of estates as would <em>\u201c </em>aforetime\u201d have created <em>estates tail. </em>Ro such estate being conferred, that aforetime law subsides into pure and absolute non-existence <em>as </em>constituting any part of the <em>lex temporis, </em>under which Caleb Stone\u2019s will was made. And therefore the remaining questions in this case are to be considered and treated, as if the testator had said, \u201c I lend to my daughter Sally (certain property, real and personal, described,) to be possessed,\u201d &amp;c. &amp;c., \u201c and, at her death and the death or after-marriage of any husband she may leave surviving, to be equally divided among her children, if she has any, <em>to have and to hold to them., their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, forever, </em>and, if she has none, then to be similarly divided among all my children, <em>to have and to hold, in like manner, to them, their heirs, executors; administrators, and assigns;\u201d </em>Since, under a statutory provision to which I have before adverted as in force here from 1 Jan. 1787, this was as much the legal operation and effect of his gifts over, as if he had <em>expressed </em>them <em>in toiidem et iisdem verbis.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-8\">According to numerous authorities which have been before quoted, Sally Stone\u2019s children, if she had had any to take, would have taken <em>as purchasers; </em>so that their fee-simple in remainder would not have coalesced with the life estate given her, and thus invested <em>her </em>with the fee simple under the continuing operation of' the Rule in Shelley\u2019s case, which was in force among us until 1 July 1850, (V. C. 1849, c. 116, s. 11; c. 216, s. 1;) and was not less potential to convert an express-estate for life in the first taker into a fee simple, where the remainder was (in legal effect) to such taker\u2019s heirs general, that it was to convert a like estate into a fee tail, wheije heirs of the body were the nominated re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>maindermen. But were this otherwise, it would not affect prejudicially the limitation over in favor of the testator\u2019s children; which then would take effect as an executory devise after a previous limitation of the fee simple, (not the less because such previous limitation was, not direct, but indirect, and through the operation of the Buie in Shelley\u2019s case, as, \u2014 if it were not altogether needless, \u2014 might be proved from a case which fortifies divers others of my positions, especially respecting the construction of the word \u201cchildren,\u201d <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Shackelford\u2019s heirs, </em>1 Brockenb. 130;) though such limitation would be totally cut off, if the first taker had a fee simple <em>by conversion from afee tail, </em>under our statute, in consequence of the decision in <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>1 Call 165 (with which accords the decision, upon a like statute of New York, in <em>Lott </em>v. <em>Wykoff, </em>1 Barb. 565, 2 Comst. 355;) that the courts will not, for the sake of avoiding this effect, construe that to be an executory devise grafted upon a fee simple, which before would have been a remainder limited upon an estate tail; which decision has ever since governed, and will (doubtless) always continue to govern, in eases arising upon deeds made, or upon wills of testators who died, before 1 Jan. 1820. Touching deeds subsequently made, or wills of testators who have died since, a law, which then took effect and still continues in force, has abolished, in this respect, all distinction between such metamorphosed estates tail and what I have heretofore called a natural fee simple. R. C. 1819, c. 99, s. 25, 36; V. C. 1860, c. 116, s. 9. In the sequel, at aplace more convenient for introducing such a discussion, I shall prove (as I trust) that the limita7 tion to the testator\u2019s children <em>would, </em>be good as an executory devise, <em>if it were necessary so to regard it. </em>And therefore, for the present, I conclude, that Sally Stone took, under her father\u2019s will, nothing she could <em>devise.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-4\">2. As to the slaves: The question does not necessa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>rily stand on the same legal footing as in regard to the Teal estate, though the testator by his will lends her girl Phcebe and her future increase \u201cto be possessed upon the same tei\u2019ms and condition as\u201d she would \u201chold\u201d the land which he lent her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Auy\">By the respondents, in their answer, it is insisted that this gave her an estate in the slaves for no longer period than her own life; with a limitation over, to her children, if she had any, or, if she had none, then to the testator\u2019s, to take effect <em>at her </em>death, immediately, without waiting for the death or after-marriage of any surviving husband, whom she might leave. While, on the other hand, in their petition of appeal, appellants insist that she took in the slaves <em>either </em>an absolute and unqualified ownership in the nature of a fee simple, <em>or else </em>an ownership in the nature of a- fee simple, only qualified by limiting over the property to children of her own, or alternatively to the testator\u2019s children, at her death <em>and </em>the death or after-marriage of such husband, and that, this limitation over being (according to their contention) void for remoteness, therefore her estate remained absolute, discharged of such limitation over. I cannot think that any one of all these contentions, is maintainable. Of course, I do not insist that that of the respondents is wrong. I shall he well pleased, if the court shall think it is right. But if the court shall concur with me, that it is not, then, <em>upon that hypothesis, </em>underlying all this part of - my ai\u2019gument, I shall endeavor, upon what seems to me the sound interpretation of the will, to defeat the pretensions set up for appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-9\">That there was a limitation over, valid or invalid, of the slaves as well as of the land, seems to me to be too manifest to need proving. \u25a0 And assuming it to be so, the first question in order is, <em>what manner of persons </em>could take under the description of <em>children </em>either of Sally Stone or of the testator? \u2014 As to which, I take it to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>perfectly settled that none hut children, properly so styled, could; that <em>grand- </em>children or more remote deseendants <em>could not. </em>It is true that Judge Tucker, in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>1 Hen. &amp; M. 290, speaking of the word \u201cchildren,\u201d says: \u201cIt has, in a few cases, been construod to mean grandchildren, and even children;\u201d adding,.however, \u201cbut this construction is to be admitted only where no other construction can be made.\u201d He had before delivered himself more at large to the same effect. <em>Bernard </em>v. <em>Hipkins, </em>6 Call 103. And in <em>Doe d. Thomason </em>v. <em>Andersons, </em>4 Leigh 127, there is a similar <em>dictum </em>of President Tucker. But the cases in England (and iieither of the Judges Tucker cites any other) have been examined with perfect accuracy and precision hy Mr. Jarman; who has shown that even in wills the word \u201c child\u201d never has been allowed, and consistently with the decisions cannot be allowed, to comprehend a grandchild or <em>{a fortiori) </em>any more remote descendant, except in two cases; one, where the testator shows, by the context, that he has used the word as synonymous with \u201cissue;\u201d the other, where the devise or bequest is to the children of A., a person then, to the testator\u2019s kuowledge, (which knowledge must be proved and cannot be presumed,) dead, leaving <em>only </em>grandchildren: And the later English editors of his work have shown that his conclusions are corroborated by decisions in numerous cases subsequent to the time of his \u2022writing. 2 Jarm. Wills 69-73, 1st edit; 135-139, 3rd edit. Hor can I remember any case in Virginia, wherein the word \u201cchild\u201d has been allowed larger scope; while it has been confined strictly to the natural signification, in the case of a statute, <em>(Bernard </em>v. <em>Hipkins, </em>6 Call 101;) a special verdict, <em>(James </em>v. <em>McWilliams, </em>6 Munf. 302;) and a will. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>2 Call 520; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>1 Hen. &amp; M. 240; <em>Tebbs </em>v. <em>Duval, </em>17 Gratt. 349; <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>1 Sands\u2019s Quart. Law Rev. 27, 29-30. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>And in our case there is a total absence of every circumstance that has been, at any time, thought favourable to the construction which would embrace grandchildren; since here there was no progeny (save in ProsPec^) Sally Stone, and there were plenty of other <em>children </em>of the testator both at the date of <em>his </em>will and at the date of <em>her </em>dying never-having-been-married and <em>sine prole.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-6\">\"What manner of persons they must be, who could take under the description (in this will) of either his or her children, being thus ascertained; the next inquiry is, <em>what persons </em>(of that sort)' were to take by force of the limitations contained in the clauses we are-considering. And here it must be noticed, that those clauses contain no gift to the children of either Sally Stone or the testator, but what is contained in the \u201cdirection to divide the subject among them upon -the happening of a particular event,\u201d for which reason, in the words of Judge Joynes on a recent occasion, \u201c only such can take as answer the description <em>at </em>the period of division, <em>unless </em>a contrary intention can be collected from the will.\u201d <em>Tebbs </em>v. <em>Duval, </em>17 Gratt. 364; citing <em>Leake </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 Meriv. 363; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Mackilwain, </em>1 Russ. 220; and referring also to 2 Redf. Wills 621. In that case the principle was a substantive and important, if not an indispensable, ground of the decision; and it may be.regarded as perfectly settled. In 11 Engl. L. &amp; E., Rep. 126, <em>Peard </em>v. <em>Kehewich, </em>(also reported in 15 Beav. 166,) Sir John Romilly M. R. said that, in <em>Leake </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>\u201c Sir \"Wm. Grant held, <em>no doubt in accordance with all former and subsequent decisions, </em>that there was no gift until\u201d the period appointed for division, \u201c and that the gift was only contained in the words\u201d directing it. So here. And, as I shall assume now, prove hereafter, there is in this will nothing which indicates the presence of any contrary purpose. Let us, then, ascertain by this standard <em>who </em>would, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>tmcler the clauses in question, take, were there no Rule against Perpetuities; and this upon the hypothesis aforementioned. Very clearly, no children of Stone could, unless they were alive at the death of herself <em>and </em>moreover at the termination of her surviving husband\u2019s widowerhood; and, as it was possible that the latest of these events might not happen within the compass of duration allowed by the Rule (which does exist) against Perpetuities, it follows that the limitation in favour of <em>her </em>children, as touching the slaves, was <em>ab initio </em>void. A clear authority to this effect is <em>Hodson </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>14 Sim. 558, 574. See also 34 Barb. 594, <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Evans; </em>8 Gray 86, 98-99, <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Russell. </em>But it does not thence follow necessarily, or at all, that the limitation in favor of <em>the testator\u2019s </em>children was void also. Perhaps it would have been, had he given to them upon the happening of the contingency designated; because then, the gift being to them <em>and </em>(in legal effect, as we have before seen), their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, it might have taken effect, by the terms of the gift to them, and <em>in absence </em>of any Rule against Perpetuities, no matter at how remote a period the contingent event, on which it was to depend, should happen; and so the limitation would, perhaps, have come within the doctrine of the case of <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Bp. Bath &amp; Wells et als., 2 </em>H. Blackst. 358, where the limitation condemned for remoteness was to the defendant Moore <em>and \u201c </em>his heirs and assigns forever.\u201d But the gift <em>here </em>being in fact, according to the sound legal interpretation of its terms, a gift to such <em>alone </em>of the testator\u2019s children as should be living when the complex contingency should happen whereon the gift was dependant; the necessaiy conclusion is, that abstractedly from any Rule against Perpetuities, <em>that contingency must happen </em>within a life in being at the testator\u2019s own death or within the time allowed for gestation afterwards, to wit, the life of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>of <em>his </em>children, <em>or else </em>the gift must absolutely fail, <em>by its own terms. </em>This avoids all excess of remoteness, and perfectly satisfies the Buie.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-9\">The point thus presented is (in effect) noticed by Mr. Jarman, as one which he believed not to have been, at the time of his writing, \u201cthe subject of positive decision; namely, whether a devise which, from the nature of <em>the qualification swperadded to the devisee, </em>\u2014 as in the instance of a gift to children <em>living at </em>the death of the testator, \u2014 can never extend beyond the period allowed by the rule of law, is good, though limited to arise upon an event which might, abstractedly consisidered, happen after that period, as an indefinite failure of issue; in other words, whether a bequest in a will made before 1838,\u201d \u2014 when a statutory provision took effect in England, similar to that introduced at our revisal of 1819, contained in R. C. (of that date), c. 99, s. 26, which took effect 1 Jan. 1820, and has continued in force ever since, V. C. 1860, c. 116, s. 10,\u2014 \u201c if A. shall die without issue, to B. <em>if then </em>living, is to be regarded in precisely the same light as a gift in case A. shall die without issue <em>living B.\u201d </em>1 Jarm. Wills 256, note <em>a. </em>The rest of his remarks there, as given by the editors of the third London edition of his work, blended with their own additions, (1 vol. 263,) are as follows: \u201c TJpon principle, it is difficult to perceive any solid difference between the two cases; and the opinion of Mr. Eearne seems to have been in favour of the validity of the former limitation, (Butl. Fearne 488, 500, n.;) though none of the cases cited by this distinguished writer go directly to the point. Sir Lloyd [afterwards Lord] Kenyon, in <em>Jee </em>v. <em>Audley, </em>1 Cox 326, expressly states such a limitation to be good. Sir W. Grant, though at one time he expressed doubts on the subject, (17 Ves. 483, <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Salter;) </em>seems latterly to have been of the same opinion, (2 Meriv. 133, <em>Massey </em>V. <em>Hudson;) </em>and we have the authority of Lord Broug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ham on the same side. 2 Russ. &amp; M. 406, <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Harding.\u201d </em>All these authorities, however, were only <em>dic\u00eda; </em>but, since the date of the latest of them, the cise point, in substance, has been decided in England. In the ease of <em>Greenwood </em>v. Verdon, 24 Law Journ. Rep. N. S. (or 33 Law Journ. Rep.) Oh. 65, the facts were as follows: \u201cA testator by his will, after giving certain legacies and annuities, devised and bequeathed [all the rest of his personal, and all his real, estate] to his wife and his son J. V., during their lives, and after the death of his wife to his said son J. <em>V. </em>and to his heirs and assigns forever; and from and after the decease of his, the testator\u2019s, wife, and of his said son J. Y. <em>without issue, </em>he gave and devised all the residue of his worldly property, both real and pei\u2019sonal, \u201c <em>to be equally divided amongst the then surviving legatees, share and share </em>alikeAnd it was held that J. Y. took <em>a fee simple, </em>subject to <em>an executory devise over </em>in case he should die without issue in the lifetime of any of the legatees, and <em>not an estate tail; </em>the contest being between his son, claiming as issue in tail, and his devisees in trust. In delivering his opinion upon the case, Sir William Page Wood Y. C. (since chancellor with the title Lord Hatherley) said: It is \u201cclear that, under the words \u2018 dying without issue,\u2019 unless there is something to restrain them, the testator must be taken to have intended an indefinite failure of issue, and that the limitation which was first made to the son in fee would necessarily be cut down to an estate tail. The whole point in this case arises upon the question, whether not there are words in this will sufficient to limit the words \u2018 dying without issue\u2019 to any particular definite period of failure of issue. I will say at once, that looking to the authorities, especially the case which is first of all reported as <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>2 Russ. &amp; M. 390, before Lord Brougham, and afterwards under the name of <em>Candy </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>2 Cl. &amp; Fin. 421, 8 Bligh. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>N. S. 469, in the House of Lords, I am hound to construe the words then surviving\u2019 to mean [surviving] \u00a3 at the time of the failure of issue of John the son;\u2019 the case therefore becomes narrowed to the point, whether or not, so construing the words, there is sufficient upon the face of the whole will, to show that a definite period was fixed, within which the failure of issue should, take place.\u201d \u201cWhere the limitation is, upon death without issue, among the then surviving'legatees, that is to say, to those parties expressed and named in the will who shall be surviving at that period, it must he a personal and not transmissible interest,\u201d \u2014 not transmissible to the representatives of one deceasing before such period, \u2014 \u201cand the only interest which the legatees [so described] could take would be an interest which should accrue to them from the circumstance of their having survived the period of the failure of issue; and, therefore, the period at which the parties are to take being the period at which the failure of issue takes place, I cannot look upon that as an indefinite failure of issue, but as a failure of issue to take place in the lifetime of the several parties who are so named as legatees in the will.\u201d \u201cAs regards this particular case, it is clear that the failure of issue as described in the gift over points to a period clearly within the legal limitation. It is to his then surviving legatees, share and share alike, who are all individual persons named in his will, and the true construction I apprehend to be this: \u00a3 I give to my son in fee [simple], and, if he dies without issue and there are then any legatees under my will surviving, then I give it over to those legatees.\u2019\u201d And having adjndicated this to be the true <em>construction, </em>he decided without difficulty that the fee so given was not reduced to an estate tail, but remained a fee simple, subject to a <em>valid </em>executory devise \u25a0over. And upon this and some other authorities, which I cited to them, the two judges who then com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>posed the court decided the case of <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Johnson</em>, 17 Gratt. 8. That case arose upon the will o\u00ed a testator, who had twelve children, and directed his estate to he distributed in twelve equal parts among them, and then said: \u201cIt is my will and desire, that if any of my children <em>die without heirs, </em>for their part to be equally <em>divided amongst all my children then </em>living.\u201d And it was held, that this was a good executory bequest in favour of the children surviving one who died without issue, <em>regardless </em>whether the failure of issue took place <em>at </em>the death of the child so dying, or <em>afterwards, </em>provided it were in the lifetime of any child of the testator; as Judge Moncure explained distinctly in delivering the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-17\">How the true construction of Caleb Stone\u2019s will, in view of what has been said, I take to be the same as if his words had been these: \u201cI lend to my daughter Sally\u201d certain (described) property, real and personal, \u201cto be possessed by her and any husband she may have, during her natural life and the natural life or widowerhood of any husband she may leave surviving; and <em>at </em>her death <em>and </em>the termination of such surviving husband\u2019s widowerhood by death or marriage, <em>if </em>that combination of events shall happen in the lifetime of any of my children, <em>then </em>to be divided among all my children then living, <em>unless </em>there shall also be then any child or children of Sally, in which case this limitation in favor of my children shall entirely fail of ever having effect in their favor; <em>but if </em>there shall be living any child or children of Sally, <em>when </em>she has died <em>and </em>her surviving husband has also died or again married, <em>then </em>to be divided among them, if more than one, else to go to such only one, <em>no matter whether </em>any of <em>my </em>children shall be <em>then </em>living or not.\u201d [In vindication of this as a sound legal construction Mr. Green, additionally to what had been before said, cited and commented upon the following authorities: 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Jarm. Wills 744, <em>(reg. </em>19;) <em>Spark </em>v. <em>Purnell, </em>Hob. 75; <em>East </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>2 Ves. sen. 32: <em>Covenhoven </em>v. <em>Shuler, </em>2 123, 130; Weleden <em>v. Elkington, </em>Plowd. 522; (with reference to tbe state of the law which existed ^enJ as shown in <em>Manning\u2019s case, </em>8 Rep. 94 <em>b, </em>and <em>Lampett\u2019s case, </em>10 id. 46 <em>b;) Paramour </em>v. <em>Yardley, </em>Plowd. 540; but especially the remarkable case of <em>Green &amp; ux. </em>v. <em>Hayman Rook &amp; als., </em>decided by Lord Hotthingham, imperfectly reported in any one book, yet quite intelligible by combining the reports found in 2 Chan. Cas. 10, and in 2 Chanc. Rep. 169.] The latter combination of events, to wit, the termination of Sally\u2019s life, and of her surviving husband\u2019s widowerhood, in the lifetime of some child of Sally\u2019s, <em>might </em>happen, <em>after </em>the death of <em>all </em>the testator\u2019s children; so that I see nothing in the will to require it shall happen in the lifetime of any, or within twenty-one ye\u00e1rs <em>(plus </em>even twenty-one years more) after the death of all, born in the lifetime of the testator. But the former combination of events, to wit, the termination of Sally\u2019s life, and the termination of her surviving husband\u2019s widowerhood, either or both of such terminations being subsequent to the final extinction of her issue, and all happening in the lifetime of some one or more of the testator\u2019s children, \u2014 this combination of events \u2014 could not possibly happen but in the lifetime of one or more persons, described in the will, living at the death of the testator, and actually born (at furthest) within a period of gestation thereafter. And therefore the limitation over to the testator\u2019s children <em>must </em>be within the limits allowed by the Rule against Perpetuities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-7\">This argument is assailable in one or the other of only two modes. Birst: As we have before seen, when Judge Joynes states the rule to be, \u201cthat where there is no gift to the objects, except in a direction to divide the subject among them\u201d &amp;c., \u201conly such can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>take as answer the description at the period of division;\u201d he subjoins a qualification, \u201c <em>unless </em>a contrary intention can be collected from the will;\u201d and it may be surmised that, in spite of all which has been heretofore said, a construction should be put on this will, in consequence of the testator\u2019s saying \u201c among <em>all </em>my children,\u201d that would take in not only those living when the contingent division was to be made (if ever made), but also the descendants of such as were then dead or some representatives of them. This was not unperceived before, but a notice of it was purposely postponed until now; because the present seems the most appropriate place for suggesting, that such a construction would be perfectly suicidal, and, so far from accomplishing the testator\u2019s wishes in favor (supposing <em>argumenti gratia </em>that they were in favor) of more persons than his <em>children living </em>at the period of division, it would effectually frustrate his wishes in favor of any. blow, though \u201cthe rules of construction cannot be <em>strained </em>to bring a devise within the rules of law;\u201d yet says Jarman, (On Wills, vol. 2, p. 743,) \u201cit seems that where a will <em>admits of </em>two constructions, that is to be preferred which will render it valid;\u201d and in divers passages (of the same work, vol. 1, pp. 257, 260 <em>et seq.) </em>he shews that this, not only <em>seems, </em>but <em>is </em>certainly so. Quite as strong, perhaps even stronger, in the same direction, are the doctrines and decisions of our cisatlantic courts, <em>(Pond </em>v. <em>Burgh, </em>10 Paige 155; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Jones, 2 </em>Barb. 144; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>3 Barb. Chan. Rep. 315; <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>35 N. Y. Rep. 165-166; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Bibb, </em>43 Alab. Rep. 673-674;) in one of which <em>(Pruden </em>v. <em>Pruden, </em>14 Ohio St. Rep. 254), in delivering the court\u2019s opinion upon a will, it has been said, \u201cwhen an instrument of <em>any </em>kind is <em>open </em>to two constructions, the one consistent [with], the other repugnant to, law, the former <em>must always </em>be adopted,\u201d (Co. Litt., 42 <em>a-b; Case of Churchwardens of St. Saviour\u2019s, </em>10 Rep. 67 <em>b; Hor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>ton\u2019s case, </em>cited 3 Bulstr. 193, 1 Roll.

Contr. 1st edit. 12, 15-18;) and this, it may be added, <em>\u201cut res magis valeat quampereat,\u201d </em>which, during many centuries, has been reposited among the <em>maxims </em>oi our jurisprudence. On the present occasion, however, I am content with the more moderately pronounced doctrine, on which Knight Bruce V. C. acted in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Frampton, </em>2 Collyer 336. \u201c Ought\u201d said he, <em>\u201c </em>the word survivor\u2019 to be read other?\u2019 The bequest here would, I am apprehensive, be destroyed [under the Rule against Perpetuities] by such a reading; a consequence sufficient, as it seems to me, to prevent a departure from the correct and simple sense of the word.\u201d . All I ask is an adherence .to \u201cthe correct and simple sense of the word,\u201d <em>children, </em>.in this case: As to which, besides authorities heretofore cited, some very recent and very strong may be' seen in 2 Metc. Ky. Rep. 466, <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Churchill; </em>4 id. <em>339, Sheits v. Grubbs; </em>30 Georg. Rep. <em>167, Willis </em>v. <em>Jenkins. </em>\u2014 Second: It is objected by counsel opposite, that as the limitation over to Sally Stone\u2019s children tis void for remoteness, therefore the limitation to the testator\u2019s children must also be void; and Mr. Pettit cites a <em>dictum </em>of Judge Green as conclusive upon this point. The doctrine thus broached being of extensive consequence, and involved in obscurity, nay more, in contradiction, by the language used respecting it in our books; I shall doubtless stand excused for discussing it with the fulness necessary towards a satisfactory solution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-7\">The manner in which the question arose in the case of <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Thomson, </em>1 Leigh 321, was as follows: .George Thomson, having two sons and a daughter, legitimate, and a natural son, by his will in 1803, shortly before his death, made provision for each, and . then added: \"In case all my children by my wife die <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u2022without heirs,\u201d which, as the court held, was demon-<em>71 </em>strated by the context to mean issue, \u201c my natural son Charles shall fall heir to my whole estate; and in case he also die without heirs, my estate shall be divided into six parts, and three-sixths shall go to my father\u2019s brothers that are alive, and the heirs of those that are dead (receiving no more among them than my father\u2019s brothers would have received had they been living,) two-sixths to go to C. Leland, S. Leland, L. Leland, H. Gaskins, and T. Legg, and the other sixth to go to my wife to be disposed of as she may think proper; but my wife is [first of all] to have the use of the whole so long as she lives, if all her own children,\u201d the testator\u2019s \u25a0legitimate children, \u201c die without heirs.\u201d All the testator\u2019s sons, legitimate and illegitimate, died after his death, without issue living at their respective deaths, (as the reporter\u2019s marginal abstract seems to say, the report is altogether silent as to this fact); his wife also died after him; all of them in the lifetime of his daughter, who moreover survived all her father\u2019s paternal uncles, -and all the Lelands, and Gaskins, and Legg; and then died issueless, (as the reporter\u2019s maginal abstract states, in a silence of the report as to this fact also;) leaving a will, by which she gave the bulk of her estate to .Sally \"W. Griffith, whom she constituted executrix thereof. And upon a contest, respecting only the personalty, between the latter, in her character of legatee and executrix, on the one hand, and on the other a surviving child of one of the testator\u2019s paternal uncles who -died before him, and the personal representatives of another child of the same uncle, and the respective personal representatives of the testator\u2019s other paternal uncles, who survived him, and of his widow, and of the three Lelands, and of Gaskins, and of Legg, the three judges of the Court of Appeals who sat in the case, reversing the decree of the Chancellor, held that the limitation after the death of the natural son with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>out heirs, under which alone the parties here secondly mentioned could claim, was void in its creation, for remoteness; all of them concurring, that it was after an <em>indefinite </em>failure of heirs (issue) of the natural son. And Judge Green, whose opinion alone it is at present material to consider, \u2014 the case being irrelevant, but for his <em>dictum </em>relied upon by Mr. Pettit, \u2014 in the first place gave unanswerable reasons why the court should so decide; unless, indeed, it was an answer to them that the rule \u201c <em>stare </em>decisis\u201d required an adherence to the had, but repeated, decisions of the same court (not the same judges) reported in 6 Munf. 174, 187, 301, and Gilm. 194, especially the decision in <em>James </em>v. <em>McWilliams, </em>6 Munf. 301; and which decisions, it is probable, had governed the Chancellor in making his decree then undergoing revision. The main ground of all those previous decisions, and the sole ground of that in <em>James </em>v. <em>McWilliams, </em>was, that the respective limitations over were to persons in being in the lifetime of the several testators, without any words indicating a, purpose of these latter to give an interest to the former of such kind as that, upon their several deceases, it would be transmissible to their respective personal representatives. In opposition to which Judge Green showed, first, that without such words, a bequest of personalty, not affirmatively restricted to some less interest, would carry the whole property therein owned by the testator, as effectually as an express gift to the legatee <em>and </em>his executors, administrators, and assigns, would; so that, in case of his death, it would be transmissible to his personal representatives, not only where he became possessed .thereof in his lifetime, but also where he died (if <em>after </em>the testator\u2019s death, so as to preserve the bequest from lapsing,) even before the contingent event had happened by which his title would be .perfected \u2014 wherever the bequest to him was legally valid; a plain consequence whereof would seem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>to be, that tbe decisions aforesaid reported in 6 Munf. and in Gilm., especially that in <em>James </em>v. <em>McWillliams, </em>rested upon untenable ground: And, secondly, that if the judges were to be regarded as having decided m those cases or any of them, that where a bequest expressed in that manner would not otherwise be legally valid, there it must be understood to have been given upon a failure of issue during the lifetime of such legatees over; then, apart from a serious objection that this would be \u201c straining\u201d the rules of construction for the sake of evading the Rule against Perpetuities, another perhaps more serious objection confronted the claimants under the bequest over, to wit, that the contemplated event,\" which was to give them an interest, had not happened, since there had not occurred, in the lifetime of the legatees, nominated to take under that limitation, the dying without issue which was to precede it; the daughter of the testator having outlived them <em>all. </em>And then, after giving these reasons, in the first of which all the three sitting judges, and in the second of which two of them <em>(silente quoad hoc </em>the third), expressly concurred, for reversing the decree; Judge Green proceeded to give yet another reason for it, as to which both of his companions were silent. If, therefore, this merely cumulative argument, (see <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Fry, </em>T. Raym. 237, 1 Mod. 86; <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Baylor, </em>6 Munf. 437;) of a single judge, did contain any doctrine that were unsound, \u201cit ought not to preoecupate or prejudicate a judgment.\u201d <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>Hob. 53-54. But, so far from containing anything unsound, Judge Green\u2019s words, if properly construed, with reference to the case then before him, (Ram on the Science of Legal Judgment 43-44;) furnished a ground upon which, exclusively, the decision made might have been solidly rested, and therefore, perhaps, ought to have been rested, since thus the court would have avoided calling in question, unnecessarily, their prede<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>cessors\u2019decisions. He said (1 Leigh 338): \u201c There is another ground, on which all the limitations over, in clause of the will, were clearly void. That to the testator\u2019s natural son, which preceded all the others, was accompanied with words of perpetuity: If all the other children died without heirs, he was to <em>fall heir </em>to the whole estate; and if <em>he </em>died <em>without heirs, </em>then over to those now claiming. These words give him, upon the expressed intention of the testator, as absolute an estate as if the gift had been to him <em>and his heirs, </em>in terms. So that the limitation over <em>to him, </em>upon a general failure of issue, was clearly void. And, where a <em>preceding </em>limitation is too remote, all that <em>succeed </em>it, even although limited to take effect in good time, are defeated.\u201d Which, being interpreted <em>secundum, subjectam materiem, </em>meant only this : The testator having given shares of his estate to his legitimate children, respectively, to have and to hold (in effect) to-them and their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, forever, and having afterwards so provided as that, according to the terms of his will, if, at any time indefinitely future, there should not exist issue proceeding (in any, no matter how remote, generation) from their bodies, then, after their deaths and such extinction of their issue, the shares so given them should pass over to the testator\u2019s natural son or (if he were dead when such event happened, then to) his representatives ; this limitation over, standing alone would be clearly void for remoteness: and although the same did not stand alone, but was associated with a subsequent limitation over, whose intended effect, in combination with the former, was to be such, that the limitation over in favour of the natural son and his representives should take effect in favour of the latter, if the natural son did <em>not </em>die, without issue, in the lifetime of certain other persons mentioned by name in the will, but if he <em>did </em>so die, then in favour of those per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>sons and their representatives; this could not affect in \u2022 , . . \u201e point of validity, the combined limitations or either ot them, with reference to the property given the takers, since, whether the natural son died, or did not die, without issue, in the lifetime of any of these persons, still the consequence upon the first takers and those claiming under them was to he just the same. Unless the natural son died issueless within the compass of a life in being at the death of the testator, the limitation over to him was not to be defeated in favour of these other persons; and so the limitation over in their favour was \u201c limited to take effect in good time\u201d <em>as far as concerned </em>turning into their channel what had been previously destined for him and his representatives, under the first limitation over; hut still it did not affect that first limitation, in regard to the operation thereof towards diverting into <em>some </em>fresh channel what was given to the first takers, <em>whenever, if ever, </em>they should all be dead and all their posterities extinct. Thus, equally with as without, the provision in favour of the Lelands and the rest, and no matter what might he the construction put upon that provision, whether as requiring, or as not requiring, that in.their lifetimes the natural son should he dead without issue, before <em>they </em>could take; the shares of the testator\u2019s legitimate children would be, by the terms of his will, put <em>extra commercium </em>during an <em>indefinite </em>period; so that, as long as there was issue remaining of any of them, after their deaths, no purchaser of those shares, under their title, would be sure of a good title, or of one that would not, at any moment afterwards, fail by the failure of such issue. This is precisely the mischief, which the Eule against Perpetuities was introduced to prevent or suppress (Butl. Fearne 430; Sm. Ex. Int. \u00a7 707;) and therefore, by that Eule, the legitimate children took in their respective shares, from the first, interests which were absolute, unrestricted, unfettered with any (valid) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>limitation over in favour of <em>any </em>person or persons. And correspondent to this was an opinion of Sir John M. R, delivered little more than a year before, <em>Palmer Holford, 4 </em>Russ. 403.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A02\">But in this instance that happened to Judge Green, which near two thousand years ago was noted as of common occurrence, and which theretofore had, and since has, happened, and forever will happen, constantly: <em>\u201cBrevis esse laboro, Obscurus fio.\u201d </em>Had he said, \u201cwhen a preceding limitation is too remote, all that succeed <em>and depend upon </em>it, even although limited to take effect in good time <em>so far as it (cdone) is concerned, </em>are defeated;\u201d he would have said all, that the decision, which he was concurring to make in the ease before him, required, and what was perfectly true. This would accord with what was said by Buller J. in <em>Robinson v. Hardcastle, </em>2 Durnf. &amp; E. 251: \u201cThatif a subsequent limitation <em>depended upon </em>a prior estate, which was void, the subsequent one must fall together with it;\u201d but \u201cif the subsequent limitation was <em>not dependent upon </em>the other, it might then take place notwithstanding the first was bad.\u201d And it seems to me that it is not treating Judge Green with perfect fairness and candour, to make him responsible for his <em>dictum </em>in the <em>fullest </em>extent thereof, according to the <em>broadest </em>sense of the words used. But, except for the sake of doing him justice, it no way concerns me how his <em>dictum </em>is understood. In any sense of it prejudicial to my cause, it is demonstrably not law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-7\">Taken in the sense necessary for Mr. Pettit\u2019s purpose, it derives no support from either of the cases Judge Green cites; to wit, <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Bp. Bath &amp; Wells et als., </em>2 H. Blackst. 358, and <em>Chatham </em>v. <em>Tothill, </em>7 Bro. P. C. edit. Toml. 453. I have before observed upon the fact, that in the first of these cases the limitation over, condemned for remoteness, was to the defendant Moore <em>and </em>\u201chis heirs and assigns forever;\u201d under which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>though Moore himself had died the day after the testatrix, yet his representatives, so far as the <em>terms of the gift </em>were concerned, might have taken at never so mote a period, and therefore the gift, limited in that manner, was not \u201climited to take effect in good time;\u201d as Judge Green had just before demonstrated in some remarks (1 Leigh 335-837), the substance of which I have before given. It is noticeable, that before the case of <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Bp. Bath &amp; Wells et als. </em>was brought into court,. Mr. Fearne was consulted upon the title, (Fearn. Ex. Dev. edit. Pow. vi;) and gave an opinion which accorded exactly with the decision afterwards rendered; this opinion is published by Powell in his edition of Fearne, (re-printed at Dublin, 1796, pp. 455-463, being the conclusion of a long editorial annotation which commences in p. 399;) aud it indicates clearly that Mr. Fearne considered the limitation over to be void, <em>for the sole reason </em>that <em>it </em>offended the Pule against Perpetuities, by being in <em>itself </em>too remote. But the best explanation of the decision, I have anywhere seen, is in the reported argument of counsel in the case itself. They said: \u201cIt may be perhaps contended, on the other side, that though the devise to the son of Thomas Pi\u2019octor should be void, as being too remote, yet that the devise over to Thomas Moore may take effect <em>as if </em>the prior devise <em>had not been made.\u201d </em>To this supposititious argument mark the reply given, \u2014 not that \u201cthe prior devise\u201d being too remote, <em>therefore </em>the other must be void, \u2014 no; \u201cbut the devise <em>to Moore </em>is liable to the <em>same </em>objection, <em>on account of the remoteness </em>of the contingency, <em>as the other; </em>for, <em>supposing </em>there were <em>no previous devise </em>to the son of Proctor, the devise to Moore would be to him, [his heirs and assigns, forever,] if Thomas Proctor should have no Son in <em>orders; </em>but no time is fixed <em>for his talcing order's.\u201d </em>Proctor might have many sons, the last of whom might be posthumous; by the canons of the church, none of them could take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>orders before completing Ms twenty-third year, unless-by special favour; by such favour he might as soon as \u2022 he was twenty-one, (Burn\u2019s Eccl. Law, <em>tit. </em>Ordination, iv., vol. 3, p. 27, 2d edit.;) but <em>over </em>the former of these ages he <em>might </em>at <em>any </em>time <em>during his life: </em>And, because he might, therefore the devise over in favour of Moore <em>must </em>wait for the death of <em>all </em>Proctor\u2019s sons, no matter when born, nor what longevity the longest liver of them should attain. This necessity clearly made the posterior devise even <em>more remote </em>than the prior. \u2014 In his own words, not affecting to give all or any words of all the judges or of any judge, the reporter tells us: \u201cThe court (absent Mr. Justice Bailer) were clearly of opinion that the first devise to the son of Thomas Proctor,\u201d \u2014 the first or other son of T. P. that should be bred a clergyman and be in holy orders, \u2014 \u201cwas void from the uncertainty as to the time when such son, if he had any, might take orders; and that the devise over to Moore, as it depended on the same event,\u201d\u2014 rather on the ?io?i-happening <em>ever </em>of <em>that event, </em>\u2014 \u201c was also void; for the words of the will would not admit of the contingency being divided, as was the case in <em>Longhead </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>2 Black. 704,\u201d \u2014 that is to say, the words \u201cin case Thomas Proctor should have no <em>such </em>son\u201d could not be read as if they were \u201cin case he should have <em>no </em>son, or that <em>none of the sons he might have shoidd </em>be bred a clergyman and be in holy orders;\u201d \u2014 \u201cand (continues the reporter, assigning in <em>his </em>way the reasons of the court,) there was no instance in which a limitation after a prior devise, which was void from the contingency being too remote, had been let in to take effect, but the contrary was expressly decided in the House of Lords in the case of <em>The Earl of Chatham </em>v. <em>Tothill, </em>in which the judges founded their opinion on <em>Butterfield </em>v. <em>Butterfield, </em>1 Ves. 134.\u201d \u2014 I have thus given all that is preserved of the reasons <em>attributed </em>to the court, for the sake of shewing that the <em>dictum </em>of Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Green, understood in any sense at all hurtful to my cause, has no support, not only from what was decided, hut also from what was said, in that case. The approach to such support is in the words, \u201c there was no instance in which a limitation after a prior devise, which was void from the contingency being too mote, has been let in to take effect,\u201d &amp;c. Of course, if there had been no instance <em>whatever, </em>there could not have been any wherein such a limitation was allowed to prevail, \u201c <em>even although </em>limited to take effect in good time;\u201d hut, as neither these words (of Judge Green), nor any like them, are used, the statement ensuing attributed to the court by the reporter, that \u201c <em>the contrary </em>was expressly decided in the House of Lords,\u201d does not <em>import </em>any <em>negation </em>of'the validity of such a limitation as that in our case to the children of the testator. Hor is there anything in the case of <em>Chatham </em>v. <em>Tothill, </em>or in the case of <em>Butterfield </em>v. <em>Butterfield, </em>or in any <em>dictum </em>in either, that tends to damage, in any degree, my contention. [To prove this Mr. Green examined and commented upon those cases; hut it is thought too manifest to need a report of his remarks upon them.] Similar to the decision in the case in 2 H. Blackst. 358, are the decisions in <em>Bull </em>v. <em>Pritchard, </em>1 Russ. 213, before Lord Gifford M. R., aud again 5 Hare 567, before Sir James Wigram V. C., (see 3 Myl. &amp; K. 411, <em>Bland </em>v. <em>Williams;) </em>and in <em>Joy </em>v. <em>Aspinwall, </em>23 Engl. L. &amp; E. Rep. 453, 18 Jurist 284.</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-9\">In a case, the facts whereof are material to he stated with some minuteness, for a reason that will he presently seen, by settlement previously'to the marriage of John James and Mary Barrow, widow, certain personal property (which was hers) was conveyed to trustees, for her sole and separate use during the coverture, and that, after her decease, the trustees should stand possessed \u201cfor all and every the child and children of the said Mary, <em>by John Barrow her then late husband, </em>or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>by John James her said intended husband, in such shares and proportions,\u201d &amp;c. \u201cas she should\u201d appoint; and, in default of her appointment, then to divide (whatever was not appointed) \u201c unto and amongst all and every the child and children of the said Mary,\u201d without distinction of her two marriages. Subsequently she made an appointment in favour of <em>a son by her first marriage, </em>for his life, and, after his decease, upon trust for such wife and children or child of her said son as he might leave behind him; \u201cbut in case\u201d he \u201cshould die without leaving a wife or child him surviving, then, after his decease, in trust to assign the same unto her (Mary James\u2019s) daughter Frances,\u201d who was <em>a child of the first marriage, </em>\u201c her executors and administrators.\u201d And Sir Richard Pepper Arden (afterwards Lord Alvanley) M. R. decided, first, that the appointment in favour of the son\u2019s <em>wife and children </em>was void, because they were <em>not objects of the power, </em>as had been clearly settled by previous decisions past any dispute, (2 Sugd. Pow. 6th edit. 273-278;) but, secondly, that nevertheless the limitation over in favour of the daughter, who was an object of the power, was valid, and would take effect in case the son should leave neither wife nor child surviving him; though, should he leave either, it would fail, simply because in that case the contingency would not have happened, in which (alone) the property was appointed over. <em>Crompe </em>v. <em>Barrow, </em>4 Ves. 681. A decision ever since approved. 2 Sugd. Pow. 6th edit. 78. Chance on Powers, \u00a7 1581. Why, then, should not an executory bequest, unobjectionable on the score of remoteness <em>in itself, </em>be valid notwithstanding it comes in a will after, but without any manner of dependence upon, another executory bequest <em>which is </em>void for <em>its </em>excess of remoteness ? Can the cause, which makes the limitation I have last mentioned void, be material in this respect, when it (the cause) has, towards the other limitation, no sort of connexion, either direct, or <em>indirect </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>(through some dependence of the one limitation upon the other?) On this point Mr. Jarman\u2019s opinion was always clear; and both in his edition of Pow. Dev. vol. 1, p. 401, n., and (sixteen years afterwards) in his work On \"Wills, vol. 1, p. 245, he put approvingly the very case I have last cited, as an illustration and proof that, while \u201c all limitations <em>ulterior to, </em>or <em>expectant </em>on,\u201d a devise which is void for remoteness, are also, for that reason, void; yet it is otherwise where \u201cthe devise over is limited to arise on an <em>alternative </em>event, one branch of which is within, and the other is not within, the prescribed limits.\u201d His words are: \u201c In <em>Orompe </em>v. <em>Barrow </em>a feme covert, under a power in her marriage settlement, bequeathed personal property to her son O. B. for life and, after his decease, to his wife and children, but in case he should die without leaving a wife or child him surviving, she devised it over to her daughter P. J. The bequest to the wife and children was held to be void, <em>under the rule </em>that the person claiming under an appointment must be such as would have been competent to take, if named [indicated] in the deed creating the power, on which ground the legatees in question, <em>as the children of persons </em>[a person, O. B.] <em>then unborn, </em>were not competent. It was then contended, that the ultimate limitation to P. J. must fail with that to the wife and children; but Sir B. P. Arden M. B. held otherwise; there were, he said, two alternatives; if C. B. left no wife or childi\u2019en, the limitation over, being to a good object, should take effect; if he left a wife or children, it could not take effect. It is observable that, <em>as C. B. the son was not in existence at the time of the execution of the deed creating the power </em>(which in fact was a settlement <em>previous to the marriage of his parmts), </em>the gift over to P. J. , on the event of his [C. B.\u2019s] death under the circumstances mentioned, though made to a competent person [that is, a person within the power,] was liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>to objection on account of tbe <em>remoteness </em>of the event,. on the principle acknowledged in the case (and, which, is indisputable), that the interests given by the appointment must be such as would have been Sood\u2019 ^ inserted in the power itself. The point seems to have escaped the observation of the very able judge by whom the case was decided.\u201d In <em>this </em>instance it was Mr. Jarman, not Lord Alvanley, that was inadvertent;- and, from sheer want of attention, he -fell into very gross mistakes of fact \u2014 in which, however, he was followed implicitly by Mr. Lewis in bis- very much bepraised work (9 Law Review 419, 423,) On Perpetuities, pp. 504-5, and note u; \u2014 but from all his expressions it is manifest, that, taking the facts to be as he supposed they were, he considered that Lord Alvanley would not have erred in holding the final limitation to be valid, in spite of the previous limitation being <em>void for remoteness, </em>if the final limitation had been, in the words of Judge Green, \u201climited to take effect in good time,\u201d as (for example) if it had been \u201c limited to take effect\u201d upon the death of C. B. before attaining his age of twenty-one years and without leaving wife or child surviving him. And accordingly Mr. Preston (Abstr. vol. 2, p. 170,) lays it down that, \u201c though a limitation over, <em>after and expectant on </em>a limitation which is too remote, is generally, for that reason, void; yet, if in express terms- the limitation over is to take effect, or [else] to fail, within a time to fall <em>within </em>the Buie against Perpetuities, the limitation over will be good;\u201d referring to this case of <em>Crompe v. Barrow, </em>4 Ves. 681, and to <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>5 Taunt. 500, <em>(perperam pro </em>393.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-6\">The certificates of the judges of the Common Pleas in the case last mentioned were a full and clear authority for this statement of Mr. Preston; which, when he made it (1818), was contradicted by nothing I am aware of, in the shape of authority. Circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>stances, however, which occurred in the sequel, make it proper to trace that case, from its commencement till its close, with precision. In what manner it at first \u25a0 began, we are not ai^where told, and can only conjecture. A testator, seised of freehold estates and possessed of leaseholds for long terms of ye\u00e1rs, devised &lt; and bequeathed them to the defendants \"Westcott and Johnson (and another since deceased), upon trusts, as follows: For the benefit of his grandson John James Beard and his assigns, during the term of ninety-nine years, if he should so long live; and immediately after his decease to the use of his (the said grandson\u2019s) first son and his assigns, for the like term of ninety-nine years,if he should happen so long to live, \u201cand so on, in tail male, to such first son lawfully issuing forever;\u201d and \u201cfor want, and in default, of such issue of such first son, then to the use and behoof of the second and all and every other son and sons of the\u201d said John James Beard, \u201cseverally, successively, and in remainder, one after another, as they should be in seniority of age and priority of birth, and the issue male of such sou or sons lawfully issuing, for the like term of ninety-nine years only (in case he should so long live),\u201d &amp;e. &amp;c.; \u201c and <em>in case </em>there should be no issue male of the\u201d said John James Beard, \u201cnor issue \u25a0of such issue male, at the time of his death, or <em>in' case </em>there should be such issue male at that time and they should all die before they should respectively attain twenty-one, without lawful issue male, then that\u201d the testator\u2019s grandson Joseph Beard \u201cand his assigns might receive and take the rents &amp;c. thereof for the term of ninety-nine years, if he should so long live,\u201d with limitations to his first and other sons and their issue male, precisely similar to those in favour of the first devisee\u2019s male descendants; with ulterior limitations upon default of issue male of Joseph Beard, expressed in identically the same terms as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the default whereon the limitation in his favour was grounded. John James Beard was plaintiff in a chancery suit, and the defendants were the (surviving) trustees together with others claiming or who might claim under the limitations after those in his favor; whence it appears inferrible that the suit was instituted (after a fashion very common in England, uncommon here,) to have the (valid) trusts of the will declared, ascertaining thereby the rights of the parties under it. And in answer to questions sent them, upon this ease, the judges of the Common Pleas certified their unanimous opinion, that John James Beard took an estate for ninety-nine years, determinable with his life, in the freehold estates, and also in the leasehold estates, if these latter should so long continue: that upon his death, leaving one or more sons, his first son would take a like estate for a term of ninety-nine years, determinable with his life, in the freehold estates, and in what should then remain of the respective terms for which the leasehold estates were held; \u201cthat in the event of there being no son or sons of the said John James Beard, nor issue male of such son or sons, living at the death of the said John James Beard, or there being such issue male at that time, [if] they shall all die, before they attain their respective ages of twenty-one years, without lawful issue male, the testator\u2019s grandson Joseph Beard will take a like estate in the said freehold and leasehold property, determinable as aforesaid; that upon his death, leaving one or more sons, his first son, in the events above mentioned, will take a like estate therein for ninety-nine years, determinable as aforesaid; and that in the event of there being no son or sons of the said Joseph Beai\u2019d, nor issue male of such son or sons, living at the death of the said Joseph Beard, or there being such issue male at the time, [if] they shall all die before they obtain [at. tain] their respective ages of twenty-one years,\u201d other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>devisees, as directed by the testator, would take: adding, \u201c We are also of opinion that all the other devises of those estates are void,\u201d of which, it will be O , , remembered, there were divers <em>anterior </em>to the limitation in favour of Joseph Beard, and <em>anterior </em>to the limitation in favour of those who were to take upon such default of <em>Ms </em>issue male; <em>these </em>being void <em>under the Rule against Perpetuities, </em>for none other objection whatever was pretended against them. When this certificate was returned into Chancery, the case was argued by Bomilly and Hayes in support of, and by Sugden against, it; and, \u201con'the 17th Dec. 1811, the Master of the Bolls gave the following judgment: \u2018This case stood over, in consequence of a suggestion that the certificate of the court of Common Pleas involved in it the decision of a new question, which had not undergone any particular discussion, or received any particular consideration, in that court; namely, how far the validity of a limitation over, by way of executory devise, is affected by the circumstance that the period of twenty-one years, after the duration of an estate for life, has not any connection whatever with the minority of any person taking an interest under the preceding limitations. How I do understand, that the question certainly did not receive any particular consideration in the court of Common Pleas, it being taken for granted that the rule upon this subj eet stood as it is commonly laid down in the books; namely, that the executory devise falls within the allowed limits, if the event upon which it is to take place must happen within a period of twenty-one years after the life or lives in being. I am not aware, however, that the point has been directly decided; and Lord Alvanley\u2019s doctrine in the case of <em>Thellusson </em>and <em>Woodford, </em>[4 Ves. 227, see p. 337,] is against the addition of twenty-one years, except by way of provision for the circumstance of the devisee being under age, or in <em>ventre sa mere, </em>at the expiration of the life or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>lives in being. And, as tbe question has now been. raised, and as there is that degree of sanction to the it does seem to me desirable that it should be se^ rest ^7 the decision of a court of law; so, <em>iherefore, </em>I propose to send the case back again to the court of Common Pleas, to call their attention to the point, that they may have an opportunity of pronouncing an explicit opinion upon it. I have received this information from some of the judges.\u2019 The case was accordingly sent back to the court of Common <em>Pleas; </em>who refused to hear it argued, until the point upon which their opinion was required ivas stated. Thereupon the. following question, with the approbation of the Master of the Polls, was stated to be the question for the opinion of the court,\u201d (Sugd. V. &amp; P. 7th edit. 807-808, n.; 11th edit. 1108-1110, n.;) and which ivas framed by Sugden, as he tells us (Sugd. Prop. 313, note <em>u:) </em>\u201cHow far the limitations over in the event of there being no son or sons of John James Beard, nor issue male of such son orsons, living at the death of the said John James Beard, or there being such issue male at that time, [if] they should all die before they attained their respective ages of twenty-one years without lawful issue male, were affected by <em>the </em>circumstance, that they were to take effect at the end of an absolute term of twenty-one years after a life in being at the death of the testator, without reference to the infancy of the person intended to take, or by <em>the </em>circumstance, that there might be issue of John James Beard living, at his death, to whom the estate was given by the will, but who would be incapable of taking, according to the above certificate, for whose death under twenty-one the limitation over, in the event before mentioned, must await.\u201d And after full argument and long deliberation, tbe judges, in Michaelmas term 1813, returned, to this additional and pointed question, an answer, in the terms of the question itself, reaffirming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>their former certificate. 5 Taunt. 393-414. Thus far, we may remark, apparently <em>no judicial doubt </em>existed in any quarter, respecting the soundness of the delibel\u2019ately formed and reiterated opinion of the court of Common Pleas, that a succeeding limitation might and would be valid, if \u201climited to take effect in good time,\u201d <em>though limitations preceding it were too remote. </em>But, as Sugden is reported to have said 8 March 1826, in <em>Bengough </em>v. <em>Edridge, </em>2 Cond. Engl. Chanc. Rep. 112, (from the report in 1 Simons) \u201cwhen the case was brought on before the Lord Chancellor, upon the judge\u2019s certificate, his lordship, though not without reluctance, granted a case to the King\u2019s Bench;\u201d that is to say, conceded to counsel\u2019s importunity, that a case (stated) should be sent to the last mentioned court for its opinion. This was done; and the case was there ai\u2019gued, at the sittings before Michaelmas term 1821, by Sugden against the validity of the limitations over, and by Preston for the other side, on two questions, which were, in substance and almost verbatim, the same as the questions the judges of the Common Pleas had answered. And, after time taken for deliberation, the judges of the King\u2019s Bench, in Trinity term, 1822, sent their certificate <em>in these words: </em>\u201c This case has been argued before us, and we are of opinion that John James Beard, the grandson and heir at law of John James the testator, took, under the said testator\u2019s will, an estate for ninety-nine years, determinable with his life, in the freehold estates devised to him in the first instance; and also in the leasehold estates devised, if they should so long continue; and that, upon his death, leaving one or more sons, his first-son will take an estate for ninety-nine years, determinable with his life, in the freehold estates, and what will then remain of the terms for which the leasehold estates are held. <em>We are also of opinion that all the limiijations, subsequent and expectant upon the limitation to the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>fast son of John James Beard, arc void.\u201d </em>5 Barn. &amp; Ald. 801-815. The cause then (in November 1822} on for further directions,\u201d in the court of Chan-eery; when \u201cMr. Hart and Mr. Stephen contended, \"^at com\u2019^ king\u2019s Bench had not returned a sufficient answer to the case; and that it could not be collected from their certificate, whether the circumstance, that <em>the limitations were to take effect at the end of a term of twenty-one years, without reference to the infancy of the person intended to take, </em>created such a suspense of the vesting as to render the limitations void. Mr. Sugden, for the plaintiff, insisted that the conclusion to which the court of King\u2019s Bench had come involved the decision of the point, [And] the Lord Chancellor [said]: It is impossible that the court of Kin'g\u2019s Bench should not have considered <em>that </em>point. The certificate of that court appears to me to afford a substantial answer to the questions put; and, under the circumstances of this case, I think the best thing I can do is to confirm it, and thus to help the ease to the House of Lords, if the parties think it right to take it there. The inclination of my opinion is, that the court of King\u2019s Bench is right.\u201d Turn. &amp; Buss. 25. The case did not proceed further; and what it did ultimately decide was long very much a puzzle. In Mr. Jarman\u2019s edition (1827) of Pow. Dev. vol. 1, p. 393, n., it is manifestly treated by that learned writer as a decision in favour of Lord Alvanley\u2019s opinion in <em>Thellusson </em>v. <em>Woodford; </em>as is rendered the more certain by the remark he makes upon what he says is a \u201cnote of Mr. Canning\u2019s,\u201d and which is indubitably so, though counsel (probably Preston), <em>arguendo </em>before the House of Lords, subsequently claimed benefit from it, as a note by Mr. Butler and indicating Mr. Butler\u2019s opinion. 1 Cl. &amp; Fin. 400, <em>Cadell </em>v. <em>Palmer. </em>It is distinctively marked as one of Mr. Canning\u2019s additions, (see Butl. Fearne, pref., p. ix, edit. Philad. 1826;) and is in these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>words (subjoined to Butler\u2019s note in a previous edition, which concluded with \u2022 quoting Lord Alvanley\u2019s <em>dictum </em>in <em>Thellusson </em>v. <em>Woodford): </em>\u201cBut in the case of <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>5 Taunt. 393, it was held, that an executory devise was good, though it was not to take effect till the end of an absolute term of twenty-one years after a life in being at the death of the testator, without reference to the infancy of the person intended to take.\u201d Upon which the remark of Mr. Jar-man (in 1827) was, \u201cit should be observed, that in the last edition of Mr. Butler\u2019s Fearne, 442, n., the position founded on the certificate of the Common Pleas, has <em>inadvertently </em>been suffered to pass uncorrected\u201d <em>; </em>clearly showing <em>upon what point, </em>in his judgment, the certificates of that court and of the court of King\u2019s Bench clashed. Afterwards a case, which made a decision upon <em>that </em>point inevitable, was decided by Sir John Leach V. C. in 1827, under the name of <em>Bengough </em>v. <em>Edridge, </em>1 Sim. 173; and by the House of Lords (upon appeal from his decree), in 1833, under the name of <em>Cadell </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>7 Bligh N. S. 202, 1 Cl. &amp; Fin. 372, 10 Bingh. 140, 3 Moore &amp; S. 571. In that case Sugden and Preston were again counsel on oppposite sides, and the former insisted, both before the Vice Chancellor, (2 Cond. Engl. Chan. Rep. 112,) and in the House of Lords, (1 Cl. &amp; Fin. 394-395, 408,) that the King\u2019s Bench and Lord Eldon had decided <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Westcott </em>in accordance with what we have seen was Mr. Jar-man\u2019s estimate of the result, and in accordance also with what had been Sugden\u2019s published 'opinion from an early period of his professional life, (Sugd. V. &amp; P. 556-559,'n., edit. 1806; 613-616, n., edit. 1808; Gilb. Us. 260, n., edit, by Sugd. 1811;) while the latter, in (at least,) seeming abandonment of the doctrine laid down in his work On Abstracts which I have before cited, explained away the final decision in <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Westcott </em>thus: \u201cTo understand the grounds of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>certificate [by the judges of the King\u2019s Bench] in that .. , , . case, it is necessary to consider the principle of the law to perpetuities; <em>the rule is, </em>that if oue limitation is too remote, <em>every </em>subsequent limitation <em>must </em>also be too remote, and for .that reason void. In <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Westcott </em>the party [testator] attempted to introduce in the alternative (if the expression may be used) another gift after one which was too remote; and the language of the judges is adapted to that state of the case. The decision of the court of King\u2019s Bench is reconeileable with the rules of law, because it proceeded upon, the ground, that a gift made by way of substitution, for one which is too remote, is as bad as that for which it is attempted to be substituted. That is the whole result of the certificate, and of the decision in <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Westcott.\" </em>2 Cond. Engl. Chanc. Rep. 100. And when the judges, attendant upon the Lords in <em>Cadell</em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>resolved.that, upon the point then in judgment, they would follow the certificates from the Common Pleas in <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>Bayley B., who delivered their opinion, said: \u201cThose certificates [the last of which was returned in November 1813] stood' unimpeached until 1822, when the same case was sent by Lord Eldon to the court of King\u2019s Bench; and that court certified that the same limitations, which the Common Pleas had held valid, were void, as being too-remote; but the foundation of that certificate was, that a previous limitation clearly too remote, and which was. so considered by the court of Common Pleas, made' those limitations also void which the Common Pleas had held good. The subsequent limitations were considered as being void, not from any infirmity existing in themselves, but from the infirmity existing in the-preceding limitation; and, because that was a limitation too remote, the others' were considered as being too remote also. <em>Whether the court of King's Bench gave any positive opinion upon that, I am unable to say. </em>\u2022 I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>think the court of King\u2019s Bench would have taken , i , . much more time to consider that point than they did,\u201d: \u2014 we ilave seen that they took rather more than six months after hearing arguments, \u2014 \u201cand have given it greater consideration than it received, if they had intended to differ from the certificate that had been given by the court of Common Pleas; but, when it became totally immaterial, in the construction they were putting upon the will, to consider whether they were or were not prepared to differ from the court of Common Pleas, it is not to be wondered at that that point was not so fully considered as it might otherwise have been.\u201d 3 Moore &amp; S. 584, 1 Cl. &amp; Fin. 420-421, 25 Engl. C. L. Rep. 69-70 (from the report in 10 Bingh. 140-156). According to the report in 7 Bligh N. S. 238-9, the learned and at that time aged Baron, sole survivor in 'Westminster Hall of the four judges who had signed the certificate from the King\u2019s Bench in <em>Beard </em>v. Westcott, said: \u201c But the foundation of this certificate was, that a previous limitation clearly too remote, and which was so considered by the court of Common Pleas, made those limitations also void which that court had held good; and the question, whether the limitation of twenty-one years absolutely was valid after a life in being, did not receive that full consideration which it would otherwise have done, if the determination upon that point had not been superseded by the determination upon the other.\u201d This may perhaps express more clearly what (on the whole) was meant; but it cannot be doubted that the venerable judge spoke substantially the words reported, with almost no variation, in three other reports as I have cited them: And these plainly prove that he would not, at that distance of time, venture to state positively <em>what </em>was the ground on which the court of King\u2019s Bench proceeded. Rothing that is extant, contemporaneous with the certificate itself, tends to shew that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>court then relied at all upon the ground afterwards suggested by Mr. Preston. Nevertheless we have now with <em>words, </em>delivered <em>ex cathedra, </em>which afford countenance to Judge Green\u2019s <em>dictum </em>in the broadest sense Mr. Pettit may choose to put upon it. But we i have <em>not </em>met with a <em>decision, </em>which at all favours that gentleman\u2019s cause, \u2014 I mean a decision that can abide criticism, \u2014 though we should agree that the certificate of the King\u2019s Bench, and even that Lord Eldon\u2019s inclination of opinion, in <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>rested upon the ground indicated by Mr. Preston. Apart from what seem preponderant authorities already produced, including one certificate of the Common Pleas when Lawrence J. was in that court, and another when Gibbs J. (afterwards Chief Baron, subsequently Chief Justice,) had succeeded him in it, upon that identical case; I have yet to produce other authorities, which appear quite overwhelming.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-8\">There is a case first reported before Sir Wm. Grant M. R., in 8 Ves. 12, <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Rous, </em>wherein a testatrix bequeathed personal property to trustees, upon trusts declared in these words: \u201c To the sole and separate use of my sister [Mrs.] George Cambridge during the term of her natural life, and from and after her decease to divide the same equally between my said sister\u2019s children, when they shall severally and respectively have attained the age of twenty-seven years; the share of such as shall die under that age to go to the survivors in the same manner as his or her original share; the dividends or any portion thereof, at the discretion of my executors or the survivor or survivors of them, to he employed in the education of such children. In the event of my sister Mrs. George Cambridge not leaving any child or children at the time of her death, or of the death of all the children under the age of twenty-seven years, I give and bequeath the whole\u201d over. And in all editions of Vesey Junior\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Reports, from the first English, to the last American (industriously blazoned as Mr. Charles Sumner\u2019s), there is a marginal note importing that the court <em>held </em>\u201cthe . . <em>\u00b0 </em>\u201e , , . , limitation over too remote. Which has aLso been disseminated in 2 Bridgm. Dig. 244, 2 Chitt. Eq. Dig. 808, and doubtless in other books. But nothing the kind happened then; and the precise reverse thereof happened afterwards. The hill was filed by Mrs. George Cambridge and her husband, praying (among other things), that the' limitations over, after the death of the feme plaintiff, might he declared too remote and void, and that (as a consequence of such declaration) the property might be decreed her as next of kin of the testatrix, or that it might be secured for such of the trusts of the will as were capable of taking effect. And the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, among the most eminent at the chancery bar, said (as reported 8 Ves. 17 \u2014 18) that, with respect to the question, whether the bequest over, after the estates \u201cfor life\u201d ( \u2014 so, hut it seems by mistake, \u2014 ) to Mrs. Cambridge\u2019s children, when they should severally have attained the age of twenty-seven years, &amp;c. was too remote, \u201c there was a double contingency in view; of which one [Mrs. Cambridge\u2019s] death without leaving children living at the time of her death, cannot be impeached. That point, however, it is unnecessary to decide, till the event is determined, whether she shall leave children at her death or not.\u201d Respecting it, opposite counsel said not a word. And when Sir Wm. Grant spoke to it, the reporter (probably through misapprehension on his own part, see 1 Jarm. Wills. 247), makes him deliver himself thus blunderingly: \u201c The next question\u201d is \u201cwhether the bequest over, of the property given to Mrs. Cambridge for life, he not too remote; and if so, in all events she insists, the capital is undisposed of. It is admitted by the plaintiff, that a declaration at present in her favour would he premature; for it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>said, upon one contingency, if she dies leaving issue at , \\ , , \u201e , . &amp; . her death, it will he good, the precise opposite of' the counsel should have said, and of what it is reported they did say. \u201cBut (continues the report of Sir \"Wm. Grant\u2019s remarks') in <em>that </em>case [of her leaving issue, not of her dying <em>without </em>leaving any,] it is equally clear, it will he too remote; the children not being to take till the age of twenty-seven. All, that is necessary to he done at present is, either to direct the dividends to be paid to Mrs. Cambridge for life,, with liberty to apply upon her death, or to secure the fund.\u201d 8 Ves. 24-25. So that it is certain, no <em>decision </em>upon the point was then made, whatever the Master of' the Bolls may have thrown out concerning his present impressions respecting it; as to which it is almost certain he did <em>not </em>say what the reporter attributes to him. But let opposite counsel make the most he can out of such (whether genuine or only putative), utterances, <em>in face of the fact </em>that that identical limitation over was, in due time afterwards, decided to be valid, and did actually take effect upon Mrs. Cambridge\u2019s death without issue then living. Unfortunately there has not yet been an American reprint of 25 Beavan, nor I believe has any copy of the London edition ever appeared in this part of Virginia: nevertheless, sufficient verification of the fact just now stated is found in the representations given in Law Journ. Dig. 1855-60, p. 875, and in Fisher\u2019s Digested Index 1859, p. 242, respecting the case of <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Rous </em>in 25 Beav. 409. Besides which, in numerous other instances identically the same legal proposition has been adjudicated: to wit, that where a limitation void for-remoteness is followed by limitations over, not dependent thereon, but substitutionary for it, and which are-contingently to take effect in an alternative, one branch whereof is within, the other not within, the duration allowed by the Buie against Perpetuities; there such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>limitations over are good in <em>creation, </em>and will take effect in <em>event </em>if there shall come to pass that branch of the contingency, which is not too remote. One remarkable case of this sort was <em>Leake </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 Meriv. 363, decided by Sir 'Win. Grant himself: the reporter\u2019s abstract of which needs correction, as both defective and erroneous. It should be: \u201c Gift [by will] of real and personal estate, to trustees, upon trust to apply the rents and dividends (or so much [thereof] as they should think fit) to the maintenance &amp;e. of [testator\u2019s grandson] \"W. E. E. until twenty-five; then to permit him to receive the same during his life; and, after his death, to apply the same (or so much &amp;c.) to the maintenance &amp;c. of all and every the children of W. E. E. until twenty-five respectively; then upon trust, to assign and transfer to such children so attaining twenty-five; \u2018and <em>in case </em>W. E. E. <em>shall die </em>without leaving issue living at the time of his death, <em>or </em>leaving such issue <em>and </em>all die before twenty-five, upon trust to pay &amp;c. unto and among all and every the brothers and sisters of W. E. E. [some of whom might be born after the testator\u2019s decease,] share and share alike, upon their attainment of twenty-five or marriage respectively. Followed by a gift of residue, upon trust, <em>as to one moiety, </em>to permit the testator\u2019s daughter [Mrs. Eobinson, the mother of \"W. E. E.] and her husband to receive the rents &amp;c. during their lives in succession, and, after the death of the survivor, to [their] children (except W. E. E.) <em>in the same manner as in respect to </em>the former gift : And, <em>as to the </em>other moiety, upon <em>like trust </em>for the testator\u2019s daughter [Mrs. Mitford], her husband, [and the child or children (if any) of them]: \"With survivorship between the respective grand-children [of the testator]: And, in case of the death of either of [his said] daughters without leaving issue <em>living at her decease, </em>then <em>to the children of the surviving daughter. </em>\u2014 Held, that the limitation to the brothers and. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>sisters of W. R. R., in default of issue [of him] living to attain twenty-five, was intended to include all his brothers and sisters, [whether born or not born in the lifetime of the testator, who should be] living at his [W. R. R.\u2019s] death, [provided they lived till the period of vesting in them, by the death of all W. R. R.\u2019s issue before attaining twenty-five,] and was consequently void for remoteness. \u2014 Held, <em>vested </em>interests <em>at </em>twenty-five in <em>every </em>instance, notwithstanding different expressions, there being no antecedent gift, of which it could have been the testator\u2019s intention merely to postpone the enjoyment; <em>the gift </em>being <em>oniy </em>the direction to pay at twenty-five. \u2014 [Held, Mrs. Mitford] having died <em>leaving </em>issue, <em>the moiety </em>of the residue <em>intended </em>for <em>her </em>children [was] undisposed of, as being [a limitation] void for remoteness, [because it was not to vest in them till their respective attainment of twenty-five; but] <em>the other moiety </em>[was] in contingency during the life of [Mrs. Robinson], and, <em>if she </em>should die <em>without issue, </em>[it would] be well given over to the children of [Mrs. Mitford, \u2018there being nothing in <em>this </em>bequest to make <em>it </em>too remote; and it being evident that the testator used the words <em>surviving ['daughter] </em>\u2014 in the same sense as <em>other </em>['daughter]. <em>But\u2019 </em>\u2014 per Sir \"Wm. Grant M. R. \u2014 \u2018if Mrs. Robinson shall <em>leave </em>issue, <em>this </em>half also will, at her death, be undisposed of, and divisible among the [testator\u2019s] next of kin,\u2019 (2 Meriv. 394,) <em>because </em>in that event the limitation to her own issue would come into play, which limitation is, for the same reason as the limitation to Mrs. Mitford\u2019s in a similar event is, void for remoteness.]\u201d See also <em>Minter </em>v. <em>Wraith, </em>13 Sim. 52; <em>Goring </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>16 id. 395; <em>Burley </em>v. <em>Evelyn, </em>id. 294-295; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Challis, </em>1 Ell. &amp; Ell.

H. &amp; G. 81, 16 Engl. L. &amp; E. Rep. 550; 2 Jarm. Wills 428-429. And therefore the certificate of the judges of the King\u2019s Bench, if rested upon the ground one of them (Bayley) was afterwards, as we have seen, disposed to rest it, necessarily collides with all this mass of authority; since the first branch of the contingency was unexceptionably within the line of perpetuity. Besides which, it seems to me most certain, if not perfectly manifest, that it would have been erroneous, though the contingency had been single, consisting of only what was the second branch thereof; and that the sole ground on which it can be rested, <em>creditably </em>to the judges who gave it, is that which, in the beginning, Mr. Jarman supposed was their <em>real </em>ground. In favour of <em>it </em>much might be well said, until the final decision in <em>Cadell </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>as is shown by the reported arguments in that case, (see also 1 Atkins. Conveyance. 44-49;) and in giving his opinion therein, as chancellor, in the House of Lords, Lord Brougham said after-wards in another case, he showed (he thought), very clearly, that the doctrine of an absolute term of twenty-one years had originated in a manifest error, (9 Cl. &amp; Fin. 598, <em>Phipps </em>v. <em>Ackers;) </em>which remark is repeated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>-with apparent approbation, by one whom the book it is repeated in shows (passim) to have been Lord Brougopen undisguised unfriend. Sugd. Prop. 315. The decision in <em>Cadell </em>v. <em>Palmer </em>left, in truth, for such a certificate thereafter, as the court of King\u2019s Bench \u00b0 had given in <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>no ground whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-8\">The most plausible vindication, that can be suggested, of it, on any different ground, was offered by Lord St. Lonards in the case of <em>Monypenny </em>v. <em>Dering, </em>15 Engl. L. &amp; E. Rep. 559; wherein lam compelled to quote his language from perhaps not the best report of it, not having access to the reports of Be Gex, Macnaghten &amp; Gordon; in whose second volume (p. 145 <em>et seq.) </em>the same case is reported. He said, as far as the report before me can be relied upon: \u201c In that case,\u201d <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>\u201csuccessive life estates were given to a grandson and his unborn issue, which were clearly void beyond the first son; then followed a disposition,\u201d that in the two-fold or alternative contingency which I have just now re-stated, \u201c the estate was to go over. The case was sent to the court of Common Pleas, and they were of opinion that the gifts after the gift to the unborn son of the grandson were void; but they were also of opinion that, if the event mentioned arose, the event being within the legal limits, the gift over would take effect. With that decision I could not agree; for in that case the testator never meant the gift over to take effect unless the previous persons, if they had lived, had been capable themselves of taking. I then prevailed upon Lord Eldon to send a case to the King\u2019s Bench. That coui\u2019t held that the gift over ivas void, not because it was not within the line of perpetuity, but upon <em>the express ground </em>that the limitations over were never intended to take effect unless the previous persons would,'if they had been living, have been capable of enjoying the estate, and that the testator did not intend that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>estate should wait for persons to take on a given event, where the person to take was actually in existence, but could not take; and Lord Eldon affirmed that So that where there is a gift over, which is void for perpetuity, and a subsequent independent clause on a gift over, which is within the line of perpetuity, you cannot take under the independent clause, unless you can shew that it will accord and dovetail in with the previous valid limitations.\u201d Upon which statement it is obvious to remark, that, if it be correct, his lordship, in 1852 when it ivas given forth, better remembered the ground, \u201c express ground,\u201d of the decision, than any body seems to have remembered or known or conjectured it, while the decision ivas comparatively recent; including his lordship, when as Mr. Sugden first, Sir Edward afterwards, he was counsel in all stages of the case styled, before the vice-chancellor, <em>Bengough </em>v. <em>Edridge, </em>and including also the judgb who, delivering the opinion of the judges in the same case; then styled <em>Cadell </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>had occasion to comment on what <em>himself </em>and his former associates had done in <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Westcott. </em>But a more important remark upon it is this: The solution it proposes is not areal solution. Uo claimant under the limitation over in that case ever could have occasion to pretend, that he might take <em>while </em>any person was in existence, whom the testator designed to prefer befor\u00e9 him. The <em>will </em>expressly provided, that there should be no such preferred person \u25a0in existence, when the limitation over should take effect; whether by non-existence of all such at the \u25a0death of the first taker, or by their subsequent <em>cesser </em>\u25a0of existence before they should attain twenty-one. There might indeed be born, after the death of the .testator, a son of the first taker, which son might decease in the lifetime of his father, leaving male issue that might outlive the latter; in which case, as \u2022seems, such issue could not take by purchase, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the Rule against Perpetuities would, forbid it; but what then ? If they did <em>not </em>die without issue before attaining twenty-one, the limitation over would, <em>by force of own terms, </em>fail of effect, though the person, in existence and preferred by the testator, could not enjoy the -1- , . . , . benefit which the testator designed him,at least in the mode and manner designed; and if they <em>did </em>so die, the limitation over, <em>in taking effect, </em>would not interfere with any <em>such </em>person (all such being then non-existent), but only with others or another whom meanwhile the law, <em>contrary to the testator\u2019s wish, </em>would have instated <em>ad interim </em>in what, during such <em>interim, </em>his will would (against his wish) have failed to dispose of. This would not at all clash with any <em>supposable </em>intention of his; much less with an intention <em>expressed </em>in his will, or <em>implied, </em>therefrom <em>consistently loith </em>the settled rules of construction. Nor would it depart, in any degree, from (at least the spirit of) what is universally considered allowable. It is familiar learning, that an executory devise or bequest is good, if it be \u201c within the line of perpetuity,\u201d though no preceding estate or interest be created, by the will; or though what preceding estate or estates, interest or interests, it does create, do not, nay by the terms of the will <em>cannot, </em>endure until the period or event has happened, which is appointed for the devise or bequest (executory) to become effectual.

And what conceivable difference can it make-, in reason or in law, <em>quoad hoc, </em>whether the failure to \u201c dovetail in with previous valid limitations\u201d proceeds from the testator\u2019s having made or attempted <em>no </em>previous limitations, or <em>none susceptible of such dovetailing, </em>or from his having attempted, but failed, to make soine which are not legally valid ? Is there any solid ground of objection against an application herein, of a doc- \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>trine common among civilians, that testamentary dis- \u2022 <em>\u2022 i </em>7 positions, contrary to law, <em>\u201cpro non scripiis liabentur? </em>Huber.

Grant says: \u201c It is immaterial how it happens, that any part of the property is undisposed of, whether by the death of a legatee, or by the <em>remoteness, </em>and consequent illegality, of the bequest. Either way it is residue, \u2014 that is, something upon which no other disposition of the will effectually operates. It may in words have been before given; but,if not effectually given, it is, legally speaking, undisposed of, and consequently included in the denomination of residue,\u201d <em>(Leake </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 Meriv. 393;) so as to pass to the residuary legatee, just as, according to repeated decisions, he takes whatever is attempted to be bequeathed in a manner forbidden by the statutes against mortmain, <em>(Durour </em>v. <em>Motteux, </em>1 Ves. Sen. 322; <em>Shanley </em>v. <em>Balker, </em>4 Ves. 732; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>5 Russ. 35, 2 Russ. &amp; M. 238;) unless the residuary bequest itself be contrary to legal inhibition. <em>Negus </em>v. <em>Coulter, </em>1 Dick. 326. Can it be doubted, that whatever can be given by residuary bequest may be validly made the subject of a specific testamentary disposition ? And what is to prevent either a specific or a residuary bequest <em>thereof </em>from being validly <em>postponed </em>during precisely the same period, and in precisely the same manner, as is allowed for a bequest of <em>any subject tohaiever? </em>\u2014 But I refrain, from further discussion of this point, because, as will be hereafter indicated distinctly, no <em>tenet, </em>any <em>fancy </em>can dictate respecting <em>it, </em>can interfere with any contention <em>necessary </em>for me to maintain in this cas\u00e9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-8\">In <em>Monypenny </em>v. <em>Dering </em>the testator devised real estate \u201c to the uses, intents, and purposes following (that is to say): To the use &amp;c. that my brother Phillips Monypenny shall receive and take the rents &amp;c. thereof, for and during the term of his natural life, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>impeachment of waste; and from and immediately after his decease, to the use of the first son of the body of the said Phillips Monypenny, for and during the term of his natural life; and from and immediately after his decease, to the use of the first son of the said first son, and the heirs male of his body; and in default of such issue, to . the use of all and every other the son and sons of the body of my said brother Phillips Monypenny, severally and successively, according to seniority of age, for the like interests and limitations as I have before directed respecting the first son, and his issue of the body, of my said brother Phillips Monypenny. And <em>in default of issue of the body of my said brother </em>Phillips Monypenny, or <em>in case of his not leaving any at his </em>decease, to the use of my brother Thomas Monypenny, for and during the term of his natural life,\u201d with ulterior limitations to the descendants of Thomas precisely similar to those in favour of the descendants of Phillips: \u201cAnd in failure of all such issue of my said brother Thomas Monypenny, to the use of him, his heirs, and assigns, forever.\u201d Phillips Monypenny survived the testator, and died without ever having had issue, leaving his brother Thomas surviving him. And upon a case sent out of chancery to the court of exchequer, Rolfe B., delivering the judgment of the latter court, said: \u201cIn our opinion the eldest son of Phillips Monypenny, if he had had a son, would have taken an estate for life only, and all the subsequent estates are void for remoteness. Some stress was laid in the argument, on the words giving the property over to Thomas Monypenny <em>in default of issue of my brother </em>Phillips, <em>or in case of his not leaving any at his decease. </em>It was contended, that these latter words, whatever the construction of the limitation to the children of Phillips Monypenny, made the devise to Thomas and his issue good, inasmuch as it was to take effect on an event which must happen within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>allowed period of time, namely, at the death of Phillips Monypenny, if he should <em>then </em>leave no issue, which \u2022event happened. But, looking at the whole <em>we think the real meaning of the words was only </em>this, on the death and failure of issue of my brother Phillips Monypenny, whether that failure shall occur at his own death or afterwards, I devise to Thomas; and therefore, whether the word issue, there used, is to be construed to mean issue generally, or <em>such </em>issue as had been previously designated, in either case the limitation over will be void, <em>as being </em>an attempt to create estates which were <em>to\" commence at too remote a period, </em>namely, the general failure of issue of Phillips Monypenny, or the failure of the particular issue mentioned by the testa- ' tor.\u201d 16 Mees. <em>&amp; W. </em>418, 436-7. It is manifest, the barons did not consider the limitation over void <em>b-s cause </em>it followed limitations <em>which were </em>void for remoteness ; and it seems in the highest degree probable, that had they construed the words of the will in the sense which was pressed upon them, they <em>would </em>have held the limitation over valid: As the justices of the Common Pleas <em>did, </em>upon the same case being sent afterwards to them for their opinion, (9 Man.

But, in a comparatively recent case, the testator having directed that all his property should be sold at the end of <em>thirty </em>years from his decease, and that two-thirds of the proceeds thereof should \u201c be divided amongst\u201d his \u201c children living at that period, <em>or </em>to tlieir heirs;\u201d the other third to be invested for the benefit of his wife, and after her decease to go'\u201cto such of\u201d his \u201cchildren as should then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>be living, <em>and </em>to their heirs;\u201d and the children of the testator living, at the death of his widow, which hap-. pened within the thirty years, and at the termination of that period, being the same; the vice-chancellor (Sir George James Turner) settled the construction of the word \u201cor\u201d in the first limitation to be the same as that of the word \u201c and\u201d in the second, and that therefore each branch of the gift was, in legal effect, to <em>the children </em>of the testator <em>living at </em>the respective periods indicated, and upon <em>their </em>deaths <em>afterwards </em>to their respective personal representatives; and, upon this foundation, he did not hesitate about holding that, in each branch, it was valid. <em>Lachlan </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>9 Hare 796, 15 Engl. L. &amp; E. Rep. 234. \u201cIt appears to me,\u201d said he, \u201cthat this amounts to no more than a gift to <em>such, </em>of several persons who may be <em>living at the death </em>of the testator, <em>as shall be living </em>at the end of the thirty years. The <em>legacies </em>are <em>vested at the termination </em>of a <em>life in being at the death of the testator, </em>and they are not, therefore, [therefore, not] liable to any objection on the ground of remoteness:\u201d More accurately, \u2014 should the <em>legacies never vest, </em>in consequence of there being, at the termination of the period fixed, no living child of the testa-, tor, then, <em>at </em>the death of the longest liver of <em>them, before </em>the termination of such period, <em>the present right </em>to the future proceeds of sale would have <em>forthwith </em>become <em>vested, </em>by lapse, <em>in some other person or persons, </em>(2 Lom. Ex'rs 110-116 [52-56]; 2 Wms.Ex\u2019rs, 5th edit. 1100-1119;) who might validly dispose of the same, <em>at once, </em>unless they were minors, and, in that case, as soon as they should become adult; so that, <em>quacunquevia, </em>the <em>right </em>would not be put <em>extra commereium </em>for a term of <em>suspense </em>longer than is allowed by the Hule against Perpetuities. How, can it be thought, that this gift would have been invalidated, if the testator had added that, in case there should be living at the close of the -respective periods indicated any child or grandchild or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>other descendant of some pre-deceased child of his, (an eldest son, we may suppose,) <em>then </em>his surviving children <em>not </em>take ? Or, if (going further) he had said that, in that case, the proceeds <em>should be </em>divided among descendants of such pre-deceased child, in any prescribed proportions <em>? Such </em>gift over would doubtless be void, because <em>it </em>might protract the suspense of a vesting <em>in any one, </em>for the whole term of years indicated,\u2014 which might be sixty, seventy-five, or an hundred, just as well as <em>thirty, </em>\u2014 without any <em>reference to the duration of lives in being </em>at the death of the testator. But why should that affect an <em>alternative </em>gift, which <em>by the terms of it </em>must take effect or must fail <em>within the compass of such a life? </em>One branch of the alternative being void, if the other branch is allowed to be valid, <em>the suspense of vesting is just the same, </em>as if this latter branch stood, in the will, <em>quite alone. </em>So here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-6\">I conclude, therefore, that this objection from remoteness does not in any manner affect us. But were it otherwise in regard to the slaves, still it would not invalidate our right to the land. Por, as to that, each of the limitations over was, apart from the Buie against Perpetuities, alternatively, capable of taking effect as a contingent remainder; the ease of <em>White </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>Comyns 289, heretofore stated, abundantly proves this; and whenever such is the case, it is an inflexible rule, that the limitation shall operate in that manner. Butl. Fearne 386-394; <em>Purefoy </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>2 Saund. 388; <em>Jiggetts </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>1 Leigh 402. Now no <em>remainder </em>could possibly be too remote, according to the <em>lex temporis </em>governing our ease; and it is, principally, because the reporters\u2019 marginal abstract of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>1 Hen. &amp; M. 240, suggests the contrary with respect to <em>contingent </em>remainders, that I have heretofore noted it as reprehensible. \u2014 Touching this point there has arisen of late years a controversy, \u2022which was for some time very spiritedly kept up; the short history whereof is this: In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the early part of 1843 Lord St. Leonards, then (as Sir Edward Sugden) lord chancellor of Ireland, expressed an opinion, in the course of his giving judgment the case of <em>Cole </em>v. Sewell, 2 Conn. &amp; L. 344, 4 Dr. &amp; War. 1, that remainders were not within the Rule against Perpetuities. Soon afterwards, and before the publication of any report of that judgment, Mr. Lewis, in his treatise on the Law of Perpetuity, pp. 408-417, delivered and endeavoured to maintain an opposite opinion; commencing his discussion of the subject in these words: \u201c The limitations, to which our attention has been hitherto confined, were, either executory devises and bequests, or springing and shifting uses or trusts of the like nature. And it may probably, on the first view, appear that these several classes of limitations exhaust the doctrine of- perpetuity, in respect of the seeming inapplicability of the Rule to limitations of direct <em>remainders </em>at common law. Indeed, as much has been, in effect, said by writers of even more than ordinary repute. Thus, the Commissioners on the Law of Real Property commence their observations on the subject of Perpetuities with the following statement : \u2018All future interests, <em>not being remainders, </em>are restrained in their limits, by the rules of law relating to perpetuities.\u2019 An opinion, thus sanctioned, deserves great respect; but it is conceived that, upon both principle and authority, it must be dissented from.\u201d Lew. Perp. 408. Shortly thereafter the concluding portion of Mr. Jarman\u2019s work On \"Wills was given to the profession; which contained (vol. 2, pp. 727-735), with especial reference to Sir Edward Sugden\u2019s observations in <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Sewell, </em>an explicit adherence to the doctrine that remainders might be too remote. Very soon occasion was taken, in an article of great ability, in the Jurist, (vol. 8, pt. 2, pp. 22-23,) to condemn the views of both Mr. Lewis and Mr. Jarman, the writer supporting a conclusion practically, though not in theory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>resembling that of the lord chancellor of Ireland; subsequently to which, in the course of a paper published the Law Magazine, (vol. 31, p. 362,) strictures were passed upon Mr. Jarman\u2019s observations, of like c-harac^er aQ&lt;^ tendency. Then came an affirmance by the House of Lords, of the decree in <em>Cole </em>v. Sewell, 2 H. L. Cas. 186, 12 Jurist 927: And then, almost simultaneously, came out Lord St. Leonai'ds\u2019 review of decisions in that House, under the name of a Treatise on the Law of Property as administered by the House of Lords, with a preface dated 11 Jan. 1849, and Mr. Lewis\u2019s Supplement to his Treatise on the Law of Perpetuity, with a preface dated Hilary Term of the same year; in the former of which (pp. 116-121) the writer notices the views of Mr. Jarman and Mr. Lewis, and treats the decision of the House of Lords as an affirmance of his own views; and in the latter (pp. 97 <em>et seq.) </em>Mr. Lewis struggles to maintain his, in an extended discussion, in the course of which (pp. 102-103) he remarks, \u201cit seems that there are <em>at least </em>eive <em>different views </em>entertained in the profession upon the question in dispute, although the practical conclusions do not vary to quite the same extent.\u201d Finally (so far as my information extends), comes out in 1861 the third London edition of Jarman on Wills, in which his remarks on this subject are silently suppressed, and (vol. 1, pp. 234-236) the question is treated as no longer a question, but settled and closed by the decisions of the House of Lords in <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Sewell, </em>and in another case of <em>Doe d. Winter </em>v. <em>Perratt, </em>9 Cl. &amp; Fin. 606, in favour of the views of Lord St. Leonards and those who had always agreed with him respecting it: And this, upon the short ground, that a <em>contingent femainder </em>never could have produced any such inconvenience as was designed to be prevented by the Pule against Perpetuities: <em>because, </em>until it became <em>vested </em>(and, consequently, thereupon instantly <em>alienable), </em>it was always <em>barrable, </em>by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>common law, which in this particular continued in force here till 1 Jan. 1820, when it was altered by R. C. 1819, c. 99, s. 20, 28. <em>Since </em>that time contingent remainders have been, among us, not less indestructible than executory devises and bequests; and therefore, in cases governed by the <em>new </em>law, perhaps our courts ought to bring them equally within the rule restraining remoteness. But, as our case is not affected by these comparatively recent statutory provisions, (retained as to their substance in V. C. 1860, c. 116, s. 12, 13,) I submit that the limitation over in favour of testator\u2019s children is, in regard to the land, good as a contingent remainder: And this point I willingly rest upon the authorities, and the discussions <em>(pro </em>and <em>con) </em>in the books, already referred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-4\">If, however, the court should hold that all the limitations, after that to Sally Stone, or after that (if it be so) to her and some future husband, were void; it does not thence follow, that (as counsel opposite contends) she took all the remaining ownership in (even) the slaves. As to the lands, it is plain she could no way get, by her father\u2019s will, an inheritable estate therein unless by taking an estate tail, on some or other of the grounds which have been heretofore discussed. To that subject I shall not revert further than to say, that even if she took, in the slaves, what would be an estate tail in land, and therefore would in personalty be an absolute ownership, still a limitation over, not' transcending the line of perpetuity, would be valid, just as it would have been after an express bequest of the slaves to her and her executors, administrators and assigns forever. This has been settled by very many decisions upon the precise point, \u2014 in cases where the first gift was in terms of an express estate tail, <em>(Lamb </em>v. Archer, Carth. 266, Comb. 208, Skinn. 380, 1 Salk. 225; <em>Fletcher\u2019s </em>case, 1 Eq. Abr. 193; <em>Paine </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>cited and commented on by Lord Hardwicke, 2 Atk. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>647; <em>Crooke v.

Davis, 18 Alab. Rep. 132;) \u2014 in cases where an estate realty wou^ haye been created under the operation of the Buie in Shelley\u2019s <em>casq, (Taylor v. </em>Clarke, 2 Eden 203-204; <em>Mansell </em>v. <em>Grove, 2 </em>Younge &amp; Coll. C. C. 484; <em>Darley </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>13 Comm. Bench Rep. 6 83, 24 Engl. L. &amp; Eq. Rep. 275;) \u2014 and in cases where such an estate in realty would be created by implication from the terms of the gift over, as where after a gift to the first taker indefinitely, <em>(Atkinson </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>3 P. Wms. 258: <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Irwin, 2 </em>Ball &amp; B. 435; <em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Fogleman, </em>1 Dev. &amp; Bat. Eq. Rep. 466;) or to him and his heirs, <em>(Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Pegden, 2 </em>Durnf. &amp; E. 720; <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>1 Call 338; <em>Cudworth v. Thompson, </em>3 Desauss. 256;) there was a gift over, if he should die without <em>leaving </em>issue; which is construed as importing, in dispositions of realty (as has been before pointed out) an indefinite, but, in dispositions of personalty, a definite, failure of issue of the person referred to. 2 Jarm. Wills 418-419. In the leading case of <em>Forth v. Chapman, </em>1 P. Wms. 663, the limitation over did create an implied estate tail in realty, and yet, from this differ-' ence of construction, the very same words applied to personalty, disposed of in the very same clause, made a valid bequest over of it. \u2014 Concerning the last mentioned case, indeed, there is a passage in 4 Kent\u2019s Comm. 275-276, 1st edit, which has been retained in all editions since, that I have seen, to the eleventh inclusive, (vol. 4, pp. 281-282), with only such changes as, without altering the sense, yet indicate that the passage has been retouched; and which, for reasons that will be obvious, demands a passing notice. The words of it in the first edition are as follows : \u201cThe English courts long since took a distinction between an executory devise of real and [an executory bequest] of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>sonal estate, and held that, while the words \u00a3 dying without issue\u2019 made an estate tail of real property, yet that, in respect to personal property, which was [is] transient and perishable, the testator could not have intended a general failure of issue, but [must have intended a failure of] issue at the death of the first taker. <em>This distinction </em>was raised by Lord Macclesfield in <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>and supported afterwards by such names as Lord Hardwicke, Lord Mansfield, and Lord Eldon. But the weight of other distinguished authorities, such as those of Lord Thurlow, Lord Loughborough, and Sir William Grant, is brought to bear against any such distinction. There is such an array of opinion on each side, that it becomes difficult to ascertain the balance upon the mere point of authority.\u201d And in a note it is said: <em>\u201cThe conflict of opinion, </em>-as to the validity of the distinction in <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>is very remarkable, and forms one of the most curious and embarrassing cases in the law, to those well disciplined minds that desire to ascertain and follow the authority of adjudged cases. Lord Hardwicke, (2 Atk. Rep. 314,) Lord Thurlow, (1 Bro. 188, 1 Ves. jun. 286,) Lord Loughborough, (3 Vesey\u2019s Rep. 99;) Lord Alvanley, (5 Vesey\u2019s Rep. 440,) Lord Kenyon, (3 Term. Rep. 133, 7 Term. Rep. 595,) Sir William Grant, (17 Vesey\u2019s Rep. 479,) and the court of K. B., in 4 Maul\u00e9 &amp; Selw. 62, are authorities against the distinction. Lord Hardwicke, (2 Atk. [the passage doubtless intended is in 3 Atk.] Rep. 288, 2 Ves. Rep. 180, 616,) Lord Mansfield, (Cowp. Rep. 410,) Lord Eldon, (9 Ves. Rep. 203,) and the House of Lords, in <em>Keily </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>6 Bro. P. C. 309, are authorities for the distinction. As Lord Hardwicke has equally commended, and equally condemned, the distinction, without any kind of explanation, his authority maybe considered as neutralized, in like manner as mechanical forces of equal power, operating in contrary directions, naturally reduce each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>other to rest.\u201d How, incredible as it may seem to Kent\u2019s idolaters, till they shall have taken the trouble to read for themselves, with a moderate effort of attention, the books he cites, it is nevertheless true, that -k\u00b0r&lt;l Hardwicke, Lord Eldon, and the House of Lords did <em>not, </em>in addition to Lord Macclesfield and Lord Mansfield, maintain <em>the </em>distinction he states. Though Lord Macclesfield may have been of that opinion, (and was, if Serjeant \"Williams is not mistaken in what he says 2 Saund. 388 <em>k </em>\u2014 l, note 9 to <em>Purefoy </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>6th edit.,) he did <em>not </em>maintain or advance it in <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman. </em>Lord Hardwicke, in the place first cited by Kent, (2 Atk. 314, <em>Beauclerk </em>v. Dormer,) was giving his decision <em>against such </em>distinction, but <em>not </em>against the authority of <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman. </em>Lord Eldon, in the only case before him which Kent cites, <em>(Crooke </em>v. <em>De Vandes, </em>9 Ves. 202,) said it was \u201cimpossible at this day to doubt,\u201d that the. law was <em>against </em>any such distinction. And the judges, whose opinion was delivered to the House of Lords, in the case before it of <em>Keiley </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>in the most emphatic terms, disclaimed all design of acting upon such a principle. Wilm. 312, 314. This they did by the mouth of Sir John Eardley Wilmot, chief justice of the Common Pleas: who, at <em>the </em>same time, (ibid. 313,) speaking of <em>Forth v. Chapman, </em>said: \u201c A ray of his [Lord Macclesfield\u2019s] great geuius irradiated that case.\u201d Lord Mansfield indeed would appear from the report of <em>Denn </em>v. <em>Shenton, </em>in Cowp. 410, (see p. 411;) and did thence appear to Serjeant Williams (see his note 9 to <em>Purefoy </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>2 Saund. 388 <em>k </em>\u2014 l, 6th edit.;) to have thrown out a <em>dictum. </em>favourable to that distinction; but a more correct report of the same case, in 2 Chitty 662, (cited in subsequent editions of Kent\u2019s Comm.) shews that he did not utter such <em>incorrect, </em>but a <em>different </em>and correct, <em>dictum, </em>which reads there as follows: \u201c In the case of land .there is no instance where the words' not <em>leaving </em>issue\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>are confined to having issue at his death; but it would he otherwise of personalty, for the sake of intention.\u201d And <em>this </em>was the precise distinction maintained in <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman; </em>than which case none has ever commanded more general approbation in <em>all </em>respects, or more <em>universal and exceptionless </em>approbation in regard to that branch, which relates to <em>personal </em>estate, of the distinction acted upon in it. <em>This </em>distinction, <em>not that </em>stated by Kent, was approved by Lord Hardwieke, in <em>Sheffield </em>v. <em>Orrery, </em>3 Atk. 288; <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>2 Ves. sen. 180; and <em>Southby </em>v. <em>Stonehouse, </em>ibid. 616; by lord chief justice Wilmot, delivering the opinion of the judges in the House of Lords, in <em>Keiley </em>v. <em>Fowler; </em>by Lord Mansfield, in the correct version of his <em>dictum </em>in <em>Denn </em>v. <em>Shenton; </em>and acted upon with expressions of strong approbation by Lord Eldon, in <em>Crooke </em>v. <em>De Vandes, </em>9 Ves. 203: While <em>not this, </em>but <em>that, </em>was disapproved by Lord Thurlow in <em>Bigg </em>v. <em>Bensley, </em>1 Bro. C. C. 188; and <em>Everest </em>v. <em>Gall, </em>1 Ves. jun. 286, (where he shewed a disposition favourable to <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman;) </em>by Lord Loughborough, in <em>Chandless </em>v. <em>Price, </em>3 Ves. 99; by Sir R. P. Arden, afterwards Lord Alvanley, in <em>Rawlins </em>v. <em>Goldfrap, </em>5 Ves. 440; and by Sir Wm. Grant, in <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Salter, </em>17 Ves. 479. Lord Kenyon did indeed, in <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>3 Durnf. <em>&amp; </em>E. 143, and <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Jeffery, </em>7 id. 595, show disapprobation of <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman; </em>but it was because one branch of the distinction in it made \u201c die without <em>leaving </em>issue\u201d signify an <em>indefinite </em>failure of issue so far as <em>realty </em>was concerned, instead of making it mean a failure of issue <em>at the death, </em>as it was made to mean in regard to personalty, by <em>the other branch </em>of the distinction; which latter <em>he approved, </em>in those cases, and in <em>Daintry </em>v. <em>Daintry, </em>6 Durnf. &amp; E. 314, and <em>acted upon in Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Pegden, 2 </em>id. 720, wherein he said, \u201c that, on conference with the rest of the court, they were <em>clearly </em>of opinion, on the authority of <em>Forth v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Chapman, </em>which had been <em>uniformly followed by a series \u00b0f cases doion to the present time, </em>that the limitation over the case then before them] was good;\u201d which was, personal estate, upon a dying without <em>leaving </em>lawful heir. The decision of the court of King\u2019s Bench in <em>Dansey </em>v. <em>Griffiths, </em>4 Maule &amp; S. 61, was upon that branch of the distinction in <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>which relates to <em>real </em>estate, and was in accordance with it; the struggle made in the case, unsuccessfully, being to obliterate <em>that </em>branch of the distinction, so as to make the word \u201c leaving\u201d operate in regard to realty in the same manner as, it was on all hands agreed, it must do in regard to personalty. Besides which, not only has <em>each </em>branch of the distinction, separately, been adopted and pursued in multitudes of cases since, but moreover this has happened in construing the <em>same words </em>in the <em>same clause </em>differently with respect to the two species of property; for example, as to real estate, in <em>Bamford </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>14 Comm. Bench 708, 26 Engl. L. &amp; E. Rep. 302; <em>Biss </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>40 id. 541, 2 Hulst. &amp; N. 105; see also <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Ewart, </em>7 Ad. &amp; Ell. 636, 3 Nev. &amp; P. 197; and as to personal estate, in <em>Radford </em>v. <em>Radford, </em>1 Keen 486; <em>Rathbone </em>v. <em>Dyckman, </em>3 Paige 9; see also <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>2 Ball &amp; B. 435; <em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Fogleman, </em>1 Dev. &amp; Batt.

But where, as in our case, a testator. gives (\u201c lends\u201d) personalty for life or for any less interest than what in realty would constitute an estate tail, an attempt at limiting it over, which is for any reason abortive, will not enlarge the first taker\u2019s interest, except where such attempted limitation over is void <em>as being </em>upon an indefinite failure of issue of the first taker, if this can be called an exception, seeing that <em>such </em>a limitation over would in realty create an implied estate tail. \u201c\u00a5e,\u201d said Bigelow J., delivering the opinion of the court in <em>Battle Square Church </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>3 Gray 142, 156, \u201cunderstand the rule to be, that if a limitation over is void for remoteness, it places all prior gifts in the same situation as if the devise over had been wholly omitted. Therefore a gift of the fee or the entire interest, subject to an executory limitation which is too remote, takes effect as if it had been originally limited free from any devesting gift. The general principle applicable to such case is, that when a subsequent condition or limitation is void by reason of its being impossible, repugnant, or contrary to law, the estate becomes vested in the first taker discharged of the condition or limitation over, according to the terms in which it was granted or devised; if for life, then it takes effect as a life estate; if in fee, then as a fee simple absolute.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-9\">It is true, that in <em>Tayloe </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>Jeff. 40, Barradall (at p. 42) reports himself <em>arguendo </em>to have said; \u201cI take the law to be very clear, that if a chattel is given to one for life, or the use for life, (for there is no difference,) and no remainder is limited, or a remainder that is void either in its creation or in event, the absolute property vests in the devisee for life, and can never revert back again to the representative of the testator.\u201d And that doctrine has been upheld by decision in two modern American eases, <em>State </em>v. <em>Savin, 4 </em>Harringt. 56, n., and <em>Brownfield\u2019s Estate, </em>8 Watts 468. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>But to the passage I have quoted from Barradall\u2019s argument there is appended a <em>\u201cquaere de hoe;\u201d </em>which seems to be not an interpolation of Mr. Jefferson; for it is also found in an ancient ms. copy, <em>penes me, </em>of Barradall\u2019s Reports. And when, on the 16th of Rovember 1786, Mr. Marshall was proceeding to contend, in the high court of chancery, that a gmsi-reversion could exist after a bequest for life of a slave, Wythe O. interrupted him with the question: \u201cDo you suppose, Sir, that this doctrine of a reversion in a slave, after an estate for life, will be controverted ?\u201d Which clear intimation of opinion seems to have terminated debate upon the point, not to be renewed in any subsequent stage of that case. <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Crump, </em>1 Tuck, (manuscript) Notes of Cases 23; s. c. on appeal <em>(Crump\u2019s ex\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Dudley,) </em>3 Call 507. And in March 1793, by his decree pronounced in <em>Nance </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>Wythe 4, (2nd edit. 180,) the same chancellor enforced the same doctrine <em>sub silentio, </em>treating it, in his \u201c opinion,\u201d as not even open to question. Ror has the question, so far as I know, been ever stirred again in our (Virginia) courts. But elsewhere it has been often stirred, and as often (except in the Delaware and the Pennsylvania cases before mentioned) decided in favour of such guasi-reversion in a chattel. <em>Ayres </em>v. <em>Falkland, </em>1 Ld.

In the case of <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>heretofore mentioned, the lord chancellor held a limitation over of a leasehold, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>though to take place on the death of a first taker without <em>leaving </em>issue, good; upon the distinction that such a limitation, applied to personalty, was upon a failure of issue at the death of the first taker, though the same limitation, applied to realty, would import an indefinite failure; but Sir Joseph Jekyll M. R., upon an opposite construction, had held the limitation over of the chattel real, void: And in that stage of the cause, before an appeal taken, \u201cit being debated by counsel, <em>where </em>the residue of the term vested\u201d after the death of the first taker, more precisely the two joint first takers; Peere Williams reports the master of the rolls to have \u201c declared that the subsequent words increased their interest, and gave the whole term to them, it being plainly intended to dispose of and devise away the whole term from the testator\u2019s executors; that a devise of a term Jo one for a day or an hour is a devise of the whole term, if the limitation over is void, <em>and </em>it appears at the same time that the whole is intended to be disposed of from the executors.\u201d 1 P. Wms. 665-666. How, as Sir Joseph <em>held </em>(contrary to what was subsequently the lord chancellor\u2019s opinion upon appeal,) that the limitation over of the personalty, not less than of the realty, was upon an <em>indefinite </em>failure of issue, which would create an implied estate tail in the latter; he therefore necessarily considered that it gave in the former an absolute ownership, (agreeably to many decisions theretofore made, <em>Burford </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>2 Freem. 210; <em>Anon., </em>ibid. 287; <em>Ridge </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>Bunb. 12;) which, in accordance with numerous authorities I have already cited, would <em>remain </em>absolute, where the limitation over was held void for remoteness. So that, understood <em>secundum subjectam materiem, </em>and as applied to the particular case before him, his general position, repeated in Bac. Abr. <em>tit. </em>Remainder and Reversion, A; and reproduced in President Tucker\u2019s <em>dictum </em>in <em>London </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>11 Leigh 412-413, is a mere truism. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>doctrine appears in a more imposing form in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Cooke, 7 </em>East 269, 3 Smith. 236; where the testator, possessed of a leasehold for a long term of years unexpired, bequeathed it to Thomas Cooke, son of William Cooke by Elizabeth his deceased wife, for and during the term of his natural life; and after his decease to his child or children by any woman whom he should marry, his or her (such child\u2019s) or their (such children\u2019s) executors, administrators, and assigns, forever; but upon condition that, in case the said Thomas Cooke should die an infant, unmarried, and without issue, the premises should go over to his father William Cooke and his (W. C.\u2019s) three other children by the said Elizabeth his late wife, share and share alike, his, her, and their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, forever; and Thomas having died without issue, but after his marriage and over twenty-one, Lord Ellenborough C. L, delivering the opinion of the court, said: \u201c The contingency, upon which the estate was to go ovei\u2019, was to consist of three things, the death of Thomas Cooke, \u2014 during his infancy, \u2014 without leaving wife,\u2014 or child; and, <em>as William Cooke and his children appear to have been </em>the objects .of the testator\u2019s bounty <em>next </em>to Thomas Cooke and his family, <em>it would be very strange to suppose that </em>the testator introduced into his will <em>contingencies, which might defeat WiUiam Cooke\u2019s interest, </em>without <em>an intention </em>of conferring some advantage [therefrom] on Thomas Cooke; <em>and that </em>he meant, if Thomas Cooke died an infant leaving a wife and no children, [ \u2014 if he left children, the will in express terms gave it to them \u2014 ] or should die after he attained the age of twenty-one, that <em>the limitation over should fail, </em>without <em>any advantage </em>whatever resulting <em>to Thomas Cooke: </em>And, though the disposition of a term to one for life, with a remainder over, <em>will in general entitle the first devisee to no greater interest </em>than an estate for his life, <em>if the remainder should not take effect, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the residue of the term will go to the personal representatives of the testator; yet <em>this rule will not if </em>it appear that the testator\u2019s intention was dispose of the whole -from his executors; <em>which we think was the intention </em>of the testator in this case.\u201d Nevertheless, as the matter was presented on the footing of a verdict in ejectment in favour of the plaintiff, subject to the court\u2019s opinion upon <em>a case agreed; </em>wherein it was stated, \u201cthe lessors of the plaintiff <em>claim </em>under\u201d the testator\u2019s \u201c will, <em>and </em>are <em>entitled </em>if\u2019 the limitation to William Cooke be void [ineffectual] under the facts stated;\u201d his lordship could do no more than add: \u201c And, it being <em>admitted </em>in the statement of the case, that the lessors of the plaintiff <em>are entitled, if </em>the limitation to William Cooke and his three children cannot take effect in the events which have happened, we are of opinion that there must be judgment for the plaintiff.\u201d Had the court not been trammelled with that agreement of the parties, we do not know certainly what would have been the judgment. Perhaps it is a fair inference from the language of the chief justice, that Thomas Cooke would have been held to take the whole interest in the term, transmissible (since he was dead) to his personal representatives. But, if so, nothing can be more manifest than that such judgment would have proceeded upon the ground that the testator <em>intended </em>such bounty for <em>him and his. </em>Moreover the complex event had not happened, in which it was designed by the testator the limitation over should take effect. The case, therefore, had it been so decided, would not have been authority for similarly deciding in another case, wherein the limitation over <em>would in event take effect agreeably to the testator\u2019s intention, </em>but for the reason that <em>the law </em>will not allow <em>such intention </em>to prevail, and wherein moreover <em>he did not intend, </em>so far as <em>tokens the law </em>deems sufficient indicate, <em>any benefit </em>to the first taker <em>capable of enduring longer than till such event.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Nothing in either of the printed reports of that ease furnishes a clew to discover in what manner the lessors of the plaintiff could claim under the will of the - testator. Perhaps it was under a residuary clause. Under such a clause, in <em>Andree </em>v. <em>Ward </em>and <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>1 Russ. 260-265, where a testator bequeathed a &lt; sum of stock, upon trust to pay the interest to his son during life, with a direction, if he married a woman with a fortune of a specified amount, to settle the fund upon her and the issue of such marriage, but, in case of the son\u2019s decease <em>leaving no issue </em>of his body, the stock was given over to various persons; and the son, after marrying a woman who had not the fortune required by the will, died <em>leaving issue </em>of the marriage; it being held that the son\u2019s life interest in the stock was not enlarged by implication into a <em>quasi </em>estate tail, that the issue of his marriage took no interest in the stock, and that the gifts over failed in event; the residuary legatees took. Keyes (Chatt. \u00a7 281) relies on these cases as \u201c authorities directly in point,\u201d to prove that in such cases \u201c the property reverts to theblonor or his representatives;\u201d and in effect they seem to bebo, for whatever passes under a mere residuary clause would, without such clause, go to testator\u2019s next of kin as undisposed of. At any rate there <em>are </em>authorities in point to sustain him. Thus in <em>Ibbetson </em>v. <em>Ibbetson, </em>10 Sim. 495, it was held that personalty, bequeathed on an event which was too remote, \u201cfell into and formed part of the testator\u2019s residuary personal estate from and after the death of\u201d the first taker; as appears from the terms of the decree set out in 10 Sim. 516; which decree was affirmed on appeal, 5 Myl. &amp; Cr. 26 : And this case was followed in another precisely similar, except that in the latter, for want of a residuary clause, the property went to the testator\u2019s next of kin. <em>Dungannon </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>12 Cl. &amp; Fin. 546, 10 Jurist 721; affirming in House of Lords the decision of the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>below, Flan. &amp; K. 638, 1 Dr. &amp; War. 543, n., 5 Ir.

This hypothesis we' deny, for reasons already stated; but, supposing it well founded, still, as it was not advanced in the bill, and the record does not shew that application was made, in the court below, for leave to file an amended bill, the-decree should be affirmed, and appellants left to commence (if they choose) a fresh suit with modified pretensions. [Mr. Q-reen\u2019s argument under this head, relating only to rules of chancery procedure, need not be-reported.]</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b350-11\">Moncure, P.</author>\n<p id=\"A7g\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">The court is of opinion, that under the will of Caleb-Stone, which was recorded in 1810, his daughter Sally, who died without ever having married or had any children, was entitled only to a life estate in the land and slave and future increase of the slave loaned toiler by the 10th and 11th clauses of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">The 10th clause must be read thus: \u201c 10th. I lend to my daughter Sally, 140 acres of land to be possessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>by her during ber natural life and the natural life or widowerhood of any husband she may have; and at her death and the death or after marriage of her husband, then to be equally divided among her children, if she has any, and if she has none then to be divided among all my children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">By the 11th clause the slave Phoebe and her future increase are loaned to the said Sally, on the same terms and conditions with the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">If Sally Stone had left a husband her estate would have been enlarged and extended to the death or after marriage of her husband, when it would have determined. In other words she was entitled under the will to a vested estate for her life, and to a contingent estate in remainder at and from the period of her death until the death or after marriage of any husband she might have who should survive her. But as she had no husband, the contingency never happened and her estate therefore ended at her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The language of the will is very plain, and to a mind unaccustomed to legal technicalities and difficulties, it would seem to be strange that there could be any doubt about the meaning of the testator. The difficulty arises from the word \u201c children,\u201d which is twice used in the 10th clause. And the question is asked, could the testator have intended, to give the property over only to children, to the exclusion of the descendants of any deceased child or children ? Prom the improbability of such an intention it is argued that he must have used the word \u201c children\u201d as a word of limitation and not of purchase, and that the 10th clause must be construed as if it had been a gift to Sally Stone and the heirs of her body; which would have created an estate tail in the realty, which the statute would have converted into an estate in fee simple, and an absolute estate in the personalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">blow it is very probable that if the testator had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>asked when lie gave instructions for his will, whether he intended by the use of the word \u201cchildren\u201d to exclude the descendants which might be living of any child that might be dead, supposing the will to have that effect, he would have answered \u201cHo,\u201d and would have directed such words to be used as would plainly express his intention. But whatever may be our \u2022 conjecture on that subject, we cannot give effect to any supposed intention which is not expressed by the words of the will. The most we could say in such a case is, <em>Voluit, sed non dixit. </em>We sit here not to make wills for testators but to expound them. And we must give effect to every will as it is written by the testator, provided it be legal, however strange and capricious it may seem to have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Here is an express loan to his daughter Sally during her natural life. This is plain language, and standing by itself it cannot be misunderstood. What is there in the will to change its natural meaning ? Only the word \u201c children,\u201d which twice follows it in the same clause. How this word children is just as plain as the loan for life previously given. Its meaning is, issue in the first degree, and it can generally have no other meaning unless there be other words in the will to give it such other meaning, except the rule in Wild\u2019s case applies, which is founded on peculiar reasons. A testator may use words in any sense he pleases, however different that- sense may be from their natural meaning; and therefore he may use the word \u201c children\u201d to embrace grandchildren, or other descendants, or issue indefinitely; but then it must appear from his will, at least generally, that such was his intention. We say <em>generally </em>because there may be cases in which the word \u201c children\u201d in a will would be construed to mean \u201cgrandchildren,\u201d although there might be nothing in the will to show such a meaning; as when the gift is to children, and the proof <em>de hors </em>the will, is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the testator had not, and in the nature of things could not have, children, hut had grandchildren; then the grandchildren would take under the will <em>ut res valeat quean pereat; </em>and so in the like cases. But this is not such a case. There is nothing in the will nor <em>de hors </em>the will in this case, to change the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used, and we must therefore give effect to them according to that meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">We therefore think that the word children in this will is a word of purchase and not of limitation, whether the devise over to children he void for remoteness or not; from which it follows that the estate expressly limited to the testator\u2019s daughter Sally during her natural life, &amp;c., in the former part of the 10th clause, is not enlarged into an estate in tail in the land, nor into an absolute estate in the slave and her increase, by the word \u201cchildren\u201d in the latter part of the clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">It is sufficient and only proper for us to decide in this case that Sally Stone had only a life estate in the property aforesaid, without deciding who were entitled to it at her death. We therefore do not intend to decide the latter question. The solution of that question belongs to the court in the suits which it appears are depending for the division of the land and slaves, or distribution of the proceeds of the sale thereof, among the persons entitled thereto. To those suits the appellants can be made parties, if they claim to be entitled to participate in such division or distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The view we have taken of this case renders it unnecessary for us to examine the many authorities referred to by the learned counsel who argued it. But wishing the profession to have the benefit of their arguments, which displayed extraordinary legal research, we request the reporter to publish full notes of them in his report of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">It follows, from what we have said, that the decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>of the Circuit court must be affirmed; but without prejudice to any interest which the said Sally Stone, or her representatives, may have in the said property, or any part thereof, otherwise than under the loan to her as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">The decree was as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">That Sally Stone was entitled only to an estate for her life in the land and slave Phoebe and her increase under the loan made to her by the tenth and eleventh clauses of the will of her father Caleb Stone, and that there is no error in the said decree. Therefore, without expressing any opinion on the question as to what persons were entitled to the said property at her death, and without prejudice to any interest which she or her representatives may have in the said property or any part thereof otherwise than under the loan to her as aforesaid, or to any claim which the said representatives or the appellants may assert to any such interest by becoming parties to the suit instituted and still pending, as appears from the bill, for the sale of the said property and distribution of the proceeds, or otherwise, it is decreed and ordered that the said decree be affirmed, and that the appellants do pay unto the appellees thirty dollars damages, and also their costs by them about their defence in this behalf expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Decree arrirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
