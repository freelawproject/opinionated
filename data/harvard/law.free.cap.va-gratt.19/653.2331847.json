He is not entitled to be sent before a justice for examination; but the court may proceed to try him upon the indictment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-9\">At a quarterly term of the court of Hustings of the city of Lynchburg, held by the judge thereof, in August 1869, an indictment was found against William Shelly for grand larceny. And at the same term of the court the prisoner was brought to the bar, and before being arraigned in his proper person tendered a special plea in writing, which he swore to in open court. The point made in the plea was, that he should not be called upon to answer the indictment, but the same should be quashed or abated, because he had not been examined before the mayor or any alderman of the city of Lynchburg, and remanded for the trial of the offence charged in the indictment. The court excluded the plea; and the prisoner excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-10\">The prisoner thereupon was arraigned and pleaded \u201c not guilty;\u201d and upon his trial the jury found him guilty of the grand larceny charged in the indictment, and fixed the term of his imprisonment in the penitentiary at five years; and recommended him to the mercy of the court; and the court sentenced him accordingly. To this judgment the prisoner obtained a writ of error from a judge of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b677-11\"><em>Garland and Christian, </em>for the prisoner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b677-12\"><em>The Attorney General, </em>for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Willoughby, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ-\">The prisoner having been indicted for felony in the court of Hustings, for the city of Lynchburg, and being \u201c led to the bar in the custody of the sergeant,\u201d tendered a special plea in writing, allegmm ncrnm <em>r\\&gt; </em>Lto Arrm tmiaiaaii ia ahaavi ing that coming \u201c in his own proper person,\u201d that he ought not to be tried because he had never been arrested and examined before the mayor or any aider-man of the said city. The court refused to receive this plea, and exception was taken to such refusal; and having been tried and convicted, the prisoner obtained a writ of error to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">I do not think that any erro? was committed by the court in this refusal. The record shows that the accused was in custody of the court. This also appears by the plea itself, the accused making this plea \u201cin his own proper person.\u201d I do not, therefore, think that this case comes within the provisions of the fifteenth section of ch. 207, as amended by the \u201c act to revise and amend the criminal procedure,\u201d passed April 27th, 1867. By the 2nd sec. of ch. 208, as amended by the same act, the trial of a case like this is to proceed immediately, if the accused is in custody in a court wherein he may be tried, unless good cause is shown for a continuance. The object of the said 15th section is no doubt the same as that of section 15, chapter 207, of the Code of 1860. The language is the same, except that the words \u201c indictment or information\u201d are interpolated, and which do not change the object in this respect. This object is, as it was under the former act, to provide for the accused the right to appear before some tribunal in order that he might have an immediate hearing; so that he might, if the charge should turn out to be entrely unfounded, be discharged; or that he might have some means provided for giving bail for his appearance to the court. If such means were not provided, and the court in which the accused may be tried is not in session at the time of the arrest, he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>have to be taken to iail, however unfounded and frivo- . . *11 <em>^ </em>-j \u2022.

I can find nothing in the act as amended, which leads me to think that it was intended to confer upon a magistrate or other conservator of the peace, the powers of such examining court, or to grant to accused persons the privileges of such a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">The judgment of the court below must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">Burnham, P., concurred in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">Dorman, J., dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
