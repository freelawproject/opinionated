</em>that in said fence against said road were bars, through which ingress and egress to and from said field in which stood plaintiff\u2019s house, etc., to and from said public road was secured, and that said bars on the day of January, 1887, upon which the said taking and detention, in the declaration in this cause complained of, is alleged to have taken place, were down and open and had been repeatedly so down and open during all of the said winter, down to said date; that otherwise, said fence against said road on the side of said plaintiff was sufficient ; that the fence of the defendant, upon the opposite side of the public road, was a hedge, in so defective repair that it offered no sufficient obstacle to prevent the entrance of cattle into the wheat field of said defendant; that in the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s buildings, about two hundred feet distant therefrom, ran a small water course, at which said Moffet had been accustomed daily, for upwards of one month, to water about thirty head of cattle owned by said plaintiff and kept on said farm; that said Moffet had occasionally left said cattle beside said water course for hours at a time, but that, until the day in question, during said period of upwards of one month, since said cattle had been kept up from their grazing, and daily watered as aforesaid, none of said cattle had strayed from their enclosure, or gone upon said public road; that upon the day in question, said Moffet turned out said cattle beside said stream, to drink, as usual, then departed about his other avocations upon the farm, and remained absent about one hour; that upon his return, a portion of said cattle were found to have strayed over said public road, into the wheat field of said defendant; that said Moffet, after taking care of the cattle still in plaintiff\u2019s field, went after the remaining cattle; that said defendant had theretofore seen a part of said cattle crossing said road and entering said wheat field, had seized seventeen head of the same in said field, and was impounding the same in the barn-yard of said defendant; that all of said seventeen head of cattle, so seized and impounded, were seized exclusively upon the land and wheat field of said defendant; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>that said Moffet, for 'said plaintiff, thereupon made immediate demand for return of said cattle, and said defendant did return one cow having a calf, but retained and wholly refused to deliver up the remaining sixteen head of <em>cattle;

that said defendant had his damages duly appraised at the sum of one dollar and a <em>half; </em>that said defendant, after holding said cattle for the space of thirty days, then duly advertised the same for sale; that two or three days before said advertised sale, said plaintiff sued out his writ of replevin which began this action; that said defendant, upon the day following said seizure, notified said plaintiff by messenger, by word of mouth, that he, said defendant, had seized said cattle as aforesaid; but that said defendant did not give forthwith or other notice of such taking up and impounding, by written notice to said plaintiff, the owner of said cattle, although known to him, said defendant, as such owner, nor by posting written or printed notices in five of the most public places in the school district in which said stock was taken up. It was also proven in behalf of the defendant, that during the grazing season, said cattle, or some of them, had several times escaped from their fields and annoyed the defendant. It was testified in behalf of the plaintiff by Moffet, that this escape in question, from this enclosure, was entirely unexpected, it not having before occurred since the keeping up of the cattle from their fall grazing <em>\u25a0 </em>and he said such escape was accidental, and that said cattle were not more mischievous than cattle in general.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-4\">And said plaintiff, by his counsel, did thereupon, and in accordance with his plea to said avowry, maintain and ask the Court to charge, that Chapter 452, Vol. 14, Laws of Delaware, (Eev.

It ostensibly enacts a general rule applying to the construction of all such subsidiary special laws. It is, in its scope, a remedial statute. It supplies a beneficent regulation applying to all of the district acts, in order that injustice may be prevented. (See wording of Section 2, and the expressed and implied intent of the whole act.)

'The common law principle of excluding the application of distress for cattle damage <em>feasant </em>from the case of cattle which have escaped from the grounds of the distrainor, offers a sound rule for the construction of this statute, and for confining its operation to cattle which come expressly within its terms, by being on the highways within that district at the time of seizure. The common law remedy and the statute remedy would then not conflict, but would together Cover the entire field of remedy for wandering cattle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-8\"><em>Cowles v.
