D., 1887, the above and foregoing case stated coming on to be heard, and after argument thereupon had by the counsel on both sides and after mature deliberation thereupon had by the Court, it was adjudged that upon the facts set forth in the case stated the said instrument was not binding upon the said T. R. Smith, Elias W. Shockley, of W., and G. R. Swain, and that the several judgments entered against them respectively by virtue of the warrant of attorney in said instrument are and are hereby decided to be null and void together with the executions issued thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-17\">The defendant below assigns error for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AJP\">1. That the Court below erred in deciding that the said instrument in said case stated in the record, and the matter therein contained, in manner and form, as the same are therein set forth, were not sufficient in law for the said plaintiff, to have and maintain his action against the said defendants, and that therefore the said instrument was not binding upon the said T. R. Smith, Elias Shockley of W., and George R. Swain; whereas the contrary thereof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>this plaintiff insists, that the said instrument, and the matters therein contained, in manner and form, as the same are therein set forth, were and are sufficient in law in that behalf, and that the judgment of the Court below should have been for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">2. That the Court below erred in deciding that the several judgments mentioned and set forth in said case stated, as entered in the said Superior Court versus the said defendants in error, in pursuance of a warrant of attorney, were null and void, together with the executions issued thereon; whereas the plaintiff insists that such judgments were good and valid in law, as also the executions thereon issued, and that the judgment of this Court should have been for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">3. That the judgment of the Court below on the said case stated should have been for the plaintiff and not for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">4. For that the Court erred in deciding that the instrument or bond in said case stated, commonly called a collector\u2019s bond, was invalid and void by reason of the same not having been execut\u00e9d according to the requirements of the Act of Assembly in that behalf; whereas, in the case stated, the validity of the said bond was admitted as one of the facts agreed upon by the parties thereto, and judgment could only be rendered on the question submitted in said case stated for the decision of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-8\">5. For that the Court erred in rendering judgment in said case stated in favor of the defendants in error, in this: that no matter could be considered in said case stated other than the question of law as to the affixing of the seal, since the same is expressly limited for the judgment of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-9\">6. For that the Court erred in rendering a judgment as to the liability of the sureties under the case stated, when the question under said case stated is restricted to the one single matter, whether the addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>tion of the seal to the signature of the said Stephen W. Shockley, etc., did not discharge sureties, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-6\">7. For that the Court erred in deciding that the said bond was illegal and void, under the provisions of the Act of Assembly, whereas the said bond was a valid bond and sufficient to bind the principal and sureties at common law, irrespective of any statutory provision in relation thereto.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-7\"><em>Charles M.

Bond executed by the sureties and not by the principal debtor, although in the body of it it purports to have been executed by the three, and a seal was affixed with a space opposite to it for signature of principal.

It is the fact that determines the character of the instrument, and not the assertion in the body of it that it is signed and sealed, which, whenever introduced, is done before the signing. The Court goes on further to say that if there be but one seal, and that opposite to the name of one of the parties, in the absence of all proof to the contrary it must be taken to be his seal alone. <em>\u201c\u25a0 </em>In this case it was evidently intended that the defendant Cowman should seal the instrument in question, which; from <em>accident </em>or <em>mistake, </em>appears to have been omitted.

Linn, </em>15 Peters, 290; relied upon so strongly by the other side, we confidently submit is not an authority against our position. The instrument upon which the suit was brought was a writing not sealed by either the principal or his sureties. It was held not a bond but a good contract between the parties. The Act of Congress under which this instrument was taken contains no negative words, or anything by implication or otherwise, to make void a security taken in any other form. But even in this case such eminent judges as Story, McLean and Baldwin dissented.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-6\">How under our statute <em>\u201c </em>If any person appointed a collector shall not give bond within the time limited by said court, the appointment shall be void, and another person shall be appointed in his place,\u201d and so on until the person appointed give bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-7\">Surety discharged even if variation of contract or obligation is for his benefit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-8\">Ho principle of law is better settled at this day than that the undertaking of the surety, being one <em>strictissimi juris, </em>he cannot, either at law or equity, be bound further or otherwise than he is by the very terms of his contract. Heither is it of any consequence that the alteration of the contract is <em>trivial, </em>nor even that it is for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the advantage of the surety. \u201c <em>Non hceo in faedera vmi </em>,\u201d is an answer in the mouth of the surety.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-5\">He is not bound by the old contract, for that has been abrogated by the new. Neither is he bound by the new because he is no party to it, nether can it be split into parts so as to be his contract to a certain extent and not for the residue. He is either bound in <em>toto or </em>not at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-6\"><em>Brandt on </em>Surety, 330-338; <em>Bethune. Adm. v. Dozier, </em>10 Geo., 235.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-7\">Surety stands on the very terms of his contract, and if he does not assent to any variation of it and a variation is made, it is fatal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-8\">Rule is absolute that there shall be no transaction with the principal debtor without acquainting the person who has a part interest in it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-9\"><em>Grant v. Smith, </em>46 N. Y. Rep., 93; <em>Paine v. Jones, </em>76 N. Y., 274; <em>Bangs v.

It is an act of benevolence to the obligor and of convenience to the obligee, and of emphatic use to both. Obligor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>and obligee are bound to know that if they find it convenient to change or vary the terms of the original contract they must seek the consent of the surety, and if they will not do so they take upon themselves the hazard, and thus loosen the bonds of the surety.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-5\"><em>Brandt on </em>Surety, 330.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-6\">The case of the <em>State of Ohio v. Bowman, et at, </em>10 Ohio Reports, 445, is not sustained by reason, and is unsupported by authorities. In that case, the instrument was not signed or sealed by the principal, and yet, in conclusion, the Court remarks that <em>\u201c </em>the instrument is not an imperfect bond, that it is a good statutory bond, and that if it were not, it would be a good bond at common law,\u201d which is in direct conflict with all precedents and authorities, and especially in conflict with the case of the <em>United, States v. Linn, </em>in 15 Peters, 290, cited and relied on in this case, and is certainly in conflict with the very nature and essence of a bond, one of the essentials of which is that it must be under seal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-7\">It' is confidently believed that no well adjudicated case can be found holding sureties liable on an official bond where the principal fails to execute the bond and where the statute, in express words, provides that before the appointment of the principal is complete he shall execute a bond, and if he fail to do so within the time prescribed his appointment shall be void, and another person shall be appointed in his place to fill the office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-8\">Any ruling holding the sureties liable on an official bond where the paincipal fails to execute such bond must be predicated upon the fact that the appointment is perfect and complete before giving bond, and that the requirement of a bond by the principal is not a condition precedent to his filling the office.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b163-9\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"AYr\">affirmed the decision of the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
