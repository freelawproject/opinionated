In my opinion, the stipulation signed by the attorney for the defendant only, did not authorize him to read Angier\u2019s affidavit in evidence. Had the stipulation been signed by the attorney for the plaintiff also, I do not think it would have authorized the defendant to read it in evidence, although it might have authorized its production and identification as one of the affidavits or papers upon.which Kelly, the magistrate, issued a warrant for the arrest of the plaintiff. The inference from the case on page 8, perhaps is, that the plaintiff produced the stipulation and read the defendant\u2019s affidavit in evidence, and if he did, in my opinion, this did not authorize the defendant to read Angier\u2019s affidavit in evidence, as evidence of the facts stated therein. It is plain that the reading of Angier\u2019s affidavit in evidence might materially have injured the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>I think the order dismissing the complaint should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Leonard, J. I concur. The stipulation gave the defendant no authority to read any affidavit. Nor did the reading of Giles\u2019 affidavit by the plaintiff, authorize the reading by defendant of another sworn by Angier, although annexed to the former, and forming part of the papers on which the magistrate issued his warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Clerke, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
