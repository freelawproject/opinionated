The defendants Belmont, Deane and Hooper, claim separate bills of costs on the plaintiffs' appeal from\" the judgment on the assessment of damages rendered by Judge Ingraham. By that judgment these defendants separately recovered damages against the plaintiffs as follows: August Belmont, $108,225.25; Samuel Hooper, $8,201.01; John Deane, $2,651.02. They had putinseparate answers, settingup distinct and independent interests and claims for damages; one as a lender of money upon 1ns stock, and the others as purchasers of theirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-9\">This judgment of the special term (June 30,1864), upon the assessment in favor of these defendants, gave them three separate bills of costs of appeal to the general term from the first judgment of Judge Ingraham, which denied them damages in this action, and gave costs to. neither party. From this judgment of June 30, 1864, the plaintiffs appealed to the general term as to these three defendants, with others, o The general term affirmed the judgment, \u201c with costs to the respondents who appeared on this appeal.\" The clerk taxed the costs of defendant Belmont, but refused to tax those of Hooper and Deane. From his decision this appeal is brought.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b93-10\">Thomas H.

These defendants having been compelled by the nature of the case to answer separately, and to establish by proof as they did, distinct and independent rights of action, by way of counter-claim against the plaintiffs, for which they recovered distinct awards of damages, are entitled to sepa rate bills of costs. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-5\">1. The indemnity in the nature of costs, is by the Code secured to \u201c the .party,\u201d not the attorney <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 303).</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-6\">2. The judgment of general term, fairly construed, entitled <em>each respondent </em>to costs. The judgment of special term was \u201c affirmed with costs <em>to the respondents </em>who appeared on the appeal.\u201d This is not to be literally interpreted, for if so, all the defendants combined could have but one bill of costs. It means that every respondent to -the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal\u2014that is, every defendant who had judgment in his favor, either in his individual, partnership or representative capacity, which judgment the plaintiffs had sought to get reversed, and had failed, should have his costs. In other words, every defendant who was <em>severally </em>interested to sustain the judgment in his favor, and who, if a contrary decision had been rendered at special term, <em>could have separately appealed, </em>was \u201c a respondent.\u201d Whoever was capable of being an <em>appellant, </em>was a <em>respondent </em>to the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-7\">II. The spirit, if not the letter of the Code, contemplates that defendants in such case should have separate bills of costs. Section 306 provides : \u201c In all cases when there are several defendants <em>not united in interest, </em>and making <em>separate, defences by separate answers, </em>and the <em>plaintiff fails to recover against all, </em>the court may award costs to such of the defendants as have judgment in their favor, or any of them.\u201d This section applies to a case when the plaintiff <em>\u201cfails to recover </em>against <em>all the </em>defendants.\u201d These plaintiffs did fail to recover against all the defendants. As to several the complaint was dismissed with costs. The section covers \u201c all cases\u201d of that class, legal and equita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>ble. Here the defendants may have costs if their interests are not united, and they have put in separate defences by separate answers, <em>irrespective of the number of attorneys emyloyed by them. </em>The intention was evidently to indemnify the defendant who had succeeded in maintaining his separate defence upon his separate answer, which seems very just. Here defendants not united in interest, having made separate defences by separate answers, and having recovered separate judgments for damages in the nature of counterclaims, and being respondents to appeals brought by the plaintiffs to review those separate and distinct adjudications, in each of which but one of the defendants has an interest, claim only the same indemnity. The old rule is fairly stated in 2 <em>Hoffman\u2019s Chancery </em>Practice, 86, that where the same solicitor appears' for different defendants, and separate answers are put in, <em>or other proceedings had by or for the defendants separately, </em>the taxing officer should consider whether such separate answers or other separate proceedings were necessary or proper, and if in his opinion any part of the costs occasioned thereby was unnecessarily or improperly incurred, the same shall be disallowed. <em>(Chancery rule, </em>130 ; <em>Wendell </em>agt. <em>Lewis, </em>8 <em>Paige, </em>622.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-5\">Where a separate answer, and separate defence or establishment of a cross demand was indispensable, as here, no question could arise as to the right of each defendant who obtained a decree, to costs. Where in an action of tort, there is a verdict in favor of certain of the defendants, and in favor of the plaintiff against the remaining-defendants, the defendants prevailing are entitled to costs of course, under section 305 Code, although <em>all the defendants </em>had <em>joined in a single answer (Daniels </em>agt. <em>Lyon, </em>9 JV. <em>Y. R. </em>549).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-6\">William Tracy, <em>for plaintiffs.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b95-7\">Ingraham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amn\">I think each of the defendants is entitled to tax separate bills of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
