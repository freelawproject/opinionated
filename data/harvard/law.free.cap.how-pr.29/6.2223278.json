The complaint is for a wilful and wrongful injury to plaintiff\u2019s property, which she obtained under the.will of her father, and for wrongfully and wilfully depriving her of the use of certain parts of such property. The complaint sets forth the will of her father, the injuries complained of, and then asks that the rights and interests of the parties to this action under said will (the defendant, her brother, .being a devisee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>therein) may be adjudged and determined; that the defendant may be required to remove certain obstructions he had interposed to her proper use of her property; that an injunction issue against him enjoining him from interfering therewith, and for judgment, for an injunction and for damages to the amount of $500, for the said injuries, &amp;c. The complaint sets up no alleged doubt or difference between the parties as to their true rights under said will; it presents no position of doubt, and it makes no allegation that the defendant did what he did under a claim or pretense that he had the right so to do under said will. On the contrary, all the allegations on that subject are that he did the wrongs wilfully, wrongfully and illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-5\">The gravamen of the action is the wrongs done to the plaintiff\u2019s property. There is but one count, and that asks redress for past wrongs and protection for the future. <em>Lambert </em>agt. <em>Snow </em>(17 <em>How. </em>517), has no application to such a-case. There there were two distinct causes of action, for one of which the defendants could be held to bail, and not for the other. Here are no two causes of action. The action is substantially for injuries, wilful injuries to plaintiff\u2019s property. Nor have the other cases cited by defendant\u2019s counsel any legitimate bearing here. (32 <em>Bari. </em>83 ; 1 <em>Hill, </em>225; 7 <em>Id. </em>182, <em>or 2 Cow. </em>262.) This case comes within the plain provision of the Code (\u00a7 179) for injuring property.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-6\">The order appealed from is affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
