The cases of' <em>Tracy </em>agt. <em>Talmadge </em>(1 <em>Abb. </em>460), and <em>Anonymous (10 How. </em>353), hold that there is but one supreme court, whether in general or special term, and that either branch is the supreme court within the meaning of the statute, and may exercise all the powers of that court; and the case of <em>Grade </em>agt. <em>Freeland </em>(1 <em>Corns. </em>228), holds that the general term may hear an equity case, either by rehearing or in the first instance. The -judge says : \u201c The general term should decide the cause either by ordering a rehearing, or by hearing- the matter at large in the first instance.\u201d This-' could not be done if the general term was only an appellate court.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b184-14\">There can he no doubt but that the general term is the supreme court for all purposes, except where the statute otherwise directs. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
