The plaintiff alleged that the defendant warranted the horse sound and right every way, and that he was unsound in his right hind leg, and was vicious when being shod.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-7\">The justice rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant for costs. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment to the Delaware county court, where the cause was duly referred to a referee to hear and determine. The referee reported and decided that the horse was all right as warranted by the defendant except as to the soundness of the right hind leg, and that he was unsound in that leg, which unsoundness injuriously affected his gait and travel; and that the plaintiff had sustained damages by reason of the premises to the amount of fifty dollars ; and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover that sum of the defendant, besides costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-8\">The defendant made a case containing his exceptions, which was filed and made a part of the judgment roll. After judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant appealed therefrom to this court, without making any motion for a new trial in the county court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-9\">L.

For the provisions for the review of such judgments mentioned in this section, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>must be considered as applicable to all the courts that are authorized to review them. That such is the proper construction of this section, would seem to be confirmed by the provisions of section 366 above .quoted, making applicable the practice of the supreme court to <em>all appeals </em>brought up for trial in the county court.\u2014Rep.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b73-11\">By the court, Balcom, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGe\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel has made the point that the defendant could not appeal to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>court until the county court had passed upon the exceptions on a motion for a new trial in that court. He thinks the reasoning of the- judge who delivered the opinion in <em>Carter </em>agt. <em>Werner </em>(27 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>385), in the fifth district, is more satisfactory than my .opinion in <em>Monroe </em>agt. <em>Monroe </em>(27 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>208).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">It is true I overlooked a statute in <em>Monroe </em>agt. <em>Monroe, </em>which is cited in <em>Carter </em>agt. <em>Werner. </em>But that statute (2 JR. <em>S. </em>\"423, \u00a7 78), greatly strengthens my conviction that my conclusion in <em>Monroe </em>agt. <em>Monroe, </em>was correct. Neither that statute nor the preceding sections 77, 76 and 73, have been repealed by the Code, and they are in force so far as they are applicable to civil actions that are triable in county courts <em>(Laws of </em>1847, <em>vol. </em>1, <em>p. </em>330, <em>\u00a7\u00a7 </em>36, 37).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Courts.of common pleas could grant new trials on exceptions, or on the ground that the verdict was against evidence. (2 <em>R. S. </em>208, \u00a7 1, <em>sub. </em>2; <em>Id. </em>422, \u00a7 76.) The county court may now do the same <em>{Code, </em>\u00a7 30, <em>sub. </em>13). The supreme court, before the Code, could review judgments of the court of common pleas or county court, brought up by Writ of error, on exceptions that were made part of the record, though no motion for a new trial had been made in those courts. (2 <em>R. S. </em>423, \u00a7 80; <em>Laws of </em>1847, <em>vol. </em>1, <em>pp. </em>323 <em>and </em>324, 16, 17.) The supreme court may now review judgments of the county court brought up by appeal, on exceptions that are made a part of the record, though the exceptions have not been passed upon in the former court by <em>a motion for anew trial in that court, </em>and it may reverse the judgments of such court and grant new trials therein. <em>(Laws of </em>1847, <em>vol. 1, pp. </em>323 <em>and </em>324, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 17 ; <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 344.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">An appeal will also lie to this court from an order of the county court granting or refusing a new trial in an action tried in that court. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 30, <em>sub. </em>13 ; <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 344.) But this court cannot grant a new trial(in the county court on the ground that the verdict was against evidence, until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>after a motion has been made in such court on that ground and denied, for the reason that such court must pass upon such a question, to authorize-an appeal on that ground (see <em>Whitney </em>agt. <em>Wells, </em>28 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>150). A ruling of the county court that is excepted to, is a decision of that court, and it need not be passed upon a second time in that court to authorize this court to review it; and the rulings of a-referee on the trial of a cause in the county court are deemed decisions of such court <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 272).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">These reasons, and those assigned in <em>Monroe </em>agt. <em>Monroe, </em>satisfy me that we should adhere to our conclusion in that case, and review the exceptions taken on the trial of this cause, though no motion for a new trial has been made in the county court. None of the questions made respecting the viciousness of the horse when being shod need be noticed, for the reason that the final decision of the referee on that question was in favor of the defendant. And I am of the opinion the referee did not err in any ruling he made upon the trial, on the branch of the case he decided in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">My conclusion therefore is, that the judgment in the action should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Parker and Mason, JJ., concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
