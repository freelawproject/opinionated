To which request the court refused to charge. And the plaintiff duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-8\">The plaintiff further requested the court to charge the jury that if they should find that the plaintiff had not parted with or transferred his interest in the note at the time of alleged payment, it being then long past due, the payment by defendant at the time and in the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>alleged was not a payment of the note, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover. To which request the court refused to charge. And the plaintiff duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-5\">The plaintiff further requested the court to charge the jury, that the alleged payment by defendant being to a stranger, more than six months after maturity of the note, with knowledge that the same was in -the hands of the plaintiff long after due, was under circumstances which might reasonably awaken the suspicion of a prudent person. The court refused .to charge in the words of this request (having already commented to the jury on .these facts).

To which request, and every part thereof the court refused to charge. And the plaintiff duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-7\">The jury found a verdict for the defendant.

W. Cothran, <em>plaintiff in person.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-9\">I. The court erred in' charging the jury \u201c that if they should find that the defendant had paid the note, that nothing short of fraud, not even gross negligence, if unattended with bad faith on the part of the defendant, would invalidate the payment so as to take away the rights founded thereon, and the defendant would be entitled to their verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>1. Because the charge requires that actual fraud must be proved to invalidate the payment. The charge is in the language of section 382 of <em>Story on Promissory Notes. </em>A careful examination of the cases <em>(Crook </em>agt. <em>Jadis, </em>5 <em>Barnw. &amp; Adolph. 908; Backhouse </em>agt. <em>Harrison, Id. </em>1099 ; <em>Goodman </em>agt. <em>Harvey, </em>4 <em>Adolph. if Ellis, </em>869 ; <em>Ether </em>agt. <em>Rich, </em>10 <em>Adolph, fy Ellis, </em>784; <em>Arbour </em>agt. <em>Anderson, </em>1 <em>Adolph, if Ellis, N. S. </em>498) cited by <em>Story </em>as establishing the doctrines of the text, shows that although Lord Denman uses language in giving decisions of some of these cases broad enough to sustain Judge Stout, yet neither of these cases was determined upon the point in question, nor was the point involved in either of these cases. It is submitted that a case is an authority in so far only as it is a judicial determination of the questions actually presented by the facts in the case. And further, the cases cited, and several more recent English cases relate solely to the <em>transfer </em>and not to the <em>payment </em>of negotiable paper, and Lord Denman in several of them fails to discriminate between the law applicable to the transfer of negotiable paper prior to maturity and to that past maturity. And herein consists the false basis of the so called modern English doctrine. The case of <em>Hall </em>agt. <em>Wilson </em>(16 <em>Barb. S. C. R. </em>548), was determined upon the ground <em>(p. </em>555) that the note was negotiated at an usurious rate of interest, and thereby became void. The elaborate essay of Judge Allen upon questions not at all involved in the case, is more interesting than useful or authoritative. In <em>Magee </em>agt. <em>Badger </em>(30 <em>Barb. </em>246), the question was not up in any legal form. On the trial the judge charged on a point favorable to the defendant as the law would warrant, to which he took an exception, and also had a verdict. In settling the case this exception should have been left out\u2014the party who moved for a new trial having taken no exceptions\u2014 still \u25a0 Judge Johnson deliberately pronounces a decision upon it, and cites as his authority <em>Hall </em>agt. <em>Wilson (supra). </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The question of the effect of a payment of paper past maturity was involved in neither of these cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-5\">2. The charge was erroneous for the reason that to invalidate the payment, it was only necessary to bring to the knowledge of the defendant at the time of making the payment, facts and circumstances such as ought reasonably to have awakened her suspicions and put her upon inquiry as to the validity of the holder\u2019s title. <em>(Down </em>agt. <em>Hailing, </em>4 <em>Barn. &amp; Cres. </em>330; <em>Egan </em>agt. <em>Trelfall, </em>5 <em>Dow. &amp; Ry. </em>324 ; <em>Gill </em>agt. <em>Cubitt, </em>3 <em>Barn, &amp; Cres. </em>466; <em>Snow </em>agt. <em>Peacock, </em>2 <em>Car. </em>&amp; <em>Payne, </em>11; <em>Beckwith </em>agt. <em>Corral, </em>3 <em>Bing. </em>444 ; <em>Slater </em>agt. <em>West, </em>3 <em>Car. </em>&amp; <em>Payne, </em>325 ; <em>Easley </em>agt. <em>Croclcford, </em>10 <em>Bing. </em>243 ; <em>Chaumette </em>agt. <em>Bank of England, </em>9 <em>Barn. </em>&amp; <em>Cres. </em>209; <em>Strange </em>agt. <em>Wigney, </em>6 <em>Bing. </em>677; <em>Howard\u2019s Court of Appeals Cases, </em>448 ; <em>Beltzhoover </em>agt. <em>Blackstoclc, </em>3 <em>Watts\u2019 Pa.

Many of these cases even go further than this, according to the peculiar facts of each. <em>Gill </em>agt. <em>Cubitt (3 Barn, &amp; Cres. </em>466), Avas an action on a note that had been stolen, and Abbott, C. J., before whom it Avas tried, charged the jury : \u201c 1st. Whether the plaintiff had given value for the bill, of which there was no doubt; and 2d. Whether he took it under circumstances which ought to have excited the suspicion of a prudent and careful man. If they found that he had taken it under such circumstances, then not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>withstanding he had given the full value for it, they ought to find for the defendant.\u201d The jury found a verdict for the defendant, and a rule <em>nisi </em>for a new trial having been obtained, the defendant showed cause. The cause was elaborately argued, and opinions were delivered by Chief Justice Abbott, and Justices Bayley and Holroyd. Holroyd says : \u201c I think the rule was correctly laid down to the jury. A party who discounts a bill which had been stolen, is bound to show not only that a good consideration was really and <em>Iona fide </em>given for the bill, but he must also make it appear to the satisfaction of a jury that he actually took it <em>bona fide. If he takes it with a view to profit arising from interest </em>or commission, under circumstances affording reasonable ground of suspicion, without inquiry whether the party of whom he tak\u00e9s it came by it honestly or not, then he takes it at a risk, Avhether the bill be stolen or not; he takes it at his peril. The question whether a bill or note has been taken <em>bona fide, </em>involves in it the question Avhether it has been taken Avith due caution. If the bill be taken Avithout using due means to ascertain Avhether it has been honestly come by, the party so taking on himself the risk for gain, must take the consequences if it should turn out that it Avas not honestly acquired by the person of Avhom he received it.\u201d This was decided in 1824. It should be borne in mind that the defendant paid this note for gain (Case, <em>fol. </em>41).</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-6\">The first case in this state relating to this point is that of <em>Johnson </em>agt. <em>Bloodgood </em>(1 <em>John. Cases, </em>51). This Avas an action by the assignee of the plaintiff, but in the assign- or\u2019s- name, for goods sold and delivered. Plea, non-assumpsit and payment. In an answer to a bill filed against the defendant in chancery, he stated that he purchased the note in question (which he set up in the action at Law) some time in the year 1193, Avithout stating the month, at the rate of tAvelve shillings in the pound, and for the purpose of setting it off against the present demand. <em>The </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>defendant denied that he had any notice of the assignment before or after he purchased the note. </em>At the trial before Judge Kent, the note was disallowed as a set-off, and on motion for a new trial, Badcliff, J., said: \u201cI consider it as a principle settled both in England and by our own practice, that in cases like the present, a court of law will regard the assignment of a chose in action, and protect the interest of a <em>cestui que trust </em>against every person having notice of the trust, or who is bound to take notice of it. If, therefore, the defendant <em>at the time of obtaining the note, had notice, or was bound to take notice of the trust created by the assignment, he ought not to be permitted to avail himself of the set-off. </em>The notice by which parties are affected, is either express or implied; under the head of implied notice, it has long been been held in a court of equity (1 <em>Atkyns, </em>490 ; 2 <em>Fonbl. </em>156,) <em>that whatever is sufficient to put a party upon inquiry, is good notice. </em>.This is a just and salutary rule, calculated to preserve good faith and to protect the rights of individuals, a'nd whenever the- question-of notice occurs, must be equally applicable to courts of law as to courts of equity. <em>It has in fact been adopted by courts of law, </em>and in cases similar to the present. The defence here rests upon <em>a note purchased after it had become due. This circumstance alone is a ground of suspicion, and has been held sufficient to make it incumbent on the party receiving the note to inquire and satisfy himself that it is good. If he does ?iot, he takes it at his peril, </em>subject to every equitable defence in favor of the antecedent parties against whom he may .attempt to enforce it. <em>The present case is still stronger, for he purchased the note at a discount. </em>I therefore think that in construction of law, <em>there was sufficint notice to protect the claims of bona fide creditors.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-6\">Judge Kent says, in same case: \u201cI approve of the doctrine, and adopt it as salutary and calculated to prevent fraud, as laid down in the cases of <em>Brown </em>agt. <em>Davis .Term, </em>80), and Taylor--agt. <em>Mather </em>(3 <em>Term </em>83), <em>that if </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>a hill or note he endorsed after it becomes due, it throws a suspicion on the transaction, and the endorsee must take it subject to all equities </em>that existed in favor of the maker of the note, before it was endorsed; and that if there be any attendant circumstance of fraud, the endorsee shall have every presumption turned against him ?\u201d \u201c When a note is offered for sale, aft\u00e9r it becomes due, and at a discount, what is the necessary inference ?\u201d \u201c <em>The law infers the notice, </em>being what is termed constructive notice; he (the purchaser) accordingly commits a fraud upon his creditors; he does an act <em>mala fide.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-7\">Chief Justice Lansing at page 62, says: \u201c Judge Buller. who laid down the broadest principles in the case of <em>Brown </em>agt. <em>Davis, </em>observes, \u201c that if a note is over due, though he does not say it is not negotiable, <em>yet it is out-of the common course of dealing, and does give rise to suspicion,\u201d </em>and \u201c in the case of <em>Taylor </em>agt. <em>Mather, </em>the note was endorsed after it was due, and there were many circumstances, which led the court and jury to conclude, that it was fraudulently obtained; whereupon a verdict was found for defendant. A motion for a new trial was denied on the merits, and Buller, J., said: \u201cIt never has .been determined, that a bill or note is not negotiable, after it becomes due; <em>but if there are any circumstances of fraud in the transaction, and it comes to the hands of a plaintiff by endorsement after it is due, I have always left it to the jury, upon the slightest circumstance to presume the endorsee was acquainted with the fraud.\u201d </em>Upon which Judge Lansing remarks that, \u201cI know of no cases which have shaken these principles.\u201d The motion for a new trial was denied.

The note, although dated</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>May 24, was in fact made April 22, and a memorandum of the day upon which it was made was endorsed upon it.

The neglect of the plaintiff to make any inquiry, ought to subject them to the consequences' of the transaction between the defendant and Forsaith, </em>the immediate or original parties; and as between them, it is decidedly an illegal consideration, and the motion was denied.\u201d This case was decided in 1815. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-6\">In <em>Anderson </em>agt. <em>Van Allen </em>(12 <em>J. R. </em>343), the doctrine laid down in <em>Johnson </em>agt. <em>Bloodgood, </em>is distinctly affirmed. Ch. J. Thompson says it is \u201c well settled that actual notice is not necessary. <em>If a party acts in the face of facts and circumstances which were sufficient to put him upon inquiry, he acts contrary to good faith and at his peril. </em>These principles are fully recognized by this court in <em>Johnson </em>agt. <em>Bloodgood.\u201d </em>This case was also decided in 1815.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-7\">The same question was discussed by the superior court of New York in <em>The Fulton Bank </em>agt. <em>The Phoenix Bank </em>(1 <em>Hall, </em>562). This was an action to recover on a post-note issued by defendant, which had been deposited in the mail at Charleston, to be transmitted to New York, but the mail was robbed, and the note passed into the hands of Prime, Ward, King&amp; Co., who deposited in plaintiff\u2019s bank, which credited them with the amount of it, but which had not been drawn out. On presenting the note for payment to defendant, it was refused on the ground that the note had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>been stolen, and the real owner had notified them not to pay it. The plaintiff recovered, but on motion for new trial, Judge Hoffman says at page 571: \u201cIt is a rule of law well settled, that possession of a promissory note, endorsed in blank, or payable to bearer, is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of ownership, and if the person or party having the possession, came by it <em>bona fide, </em>for a valuable consideration, in the course of his business, and without any accompanying circumstances of suspicion to put him upon his guard, or excite inquiry, he shall hold the n\u00f3te against the original. owner, even if it had been lost or stolen. <em>But it is equally well settled that if the holder of the note received it under circumstances which ought to put a man of ordinary </em>prudence. <em>upon his guard, or at least upon inquiry; </em>or if he came into a possession of it without having parted with anything of value, or without having given some new credit in exchange for the note, <em>then the maker may, </em>under proper equitable circumstances, <em>set up a defence against his right of </em>recoveryand he cites <em>Gill </em>agt. <em>Cubitt, </em>3 <em>Barn, and Cressw. </em>466; and <em>Bay </em>agt. <em>Coddington, </em>5 <em>Johns.

This was in 1829.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-7\">The case of <em>Brown </em>agt. <em>Taber </em>(5 <em>Wend. </em>566), goes much further than the. court is called upon to go in this case. That was an action in which plaintiff sought to recover as endorsee of a note payable at a bank in sixty days, made by Groat to order of and endorsed by defendant. The note was endorsed for the accommodation of Groat, to enable him to redeem the property of one of his neighbors taken in execution ; it was offered for discount at the bank by a son of the defendant, and on the bank refusing to discount it, it was returned to Groat. When it had but eighteen days to run, Groat attempted to raise money on it at the lottery and exchange office of-the plaintiff, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>cleric refused to cash the note, but on Groat\u2019s application, sold him twenty-three lottery tickets at $5 per ticket, and received the note in payment; $5 was the usual retail price for lottery tickets, except to dealers, to whom they were sold for $4; the clerk knew that Groat was not a. dealer in tickets; he was told by Groat that he had been in the bank with the note, but ctid not say for what purpose; the note had on it <em>lank </em>marks, <em>i. e. </em>the name of the maker, and time when payable, in the hand-writing of one of the bank clerks. A verdict was taken subject to the opinion of the court. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-5\">The court per Marcy, J., says that \u201cGroat, by putting the note in circulation, acted in bad faith towards the endorser ; and if the person who received it of him knew the circumstances under which it was passed, or is to be considered chargeable with notice, the plaintiff can not recover. It is not pretended that the clerk of the plaintiff who received the note had actual knowledge of the misappropriation of it; but it is insisted by defendant <em>that he knew such facts and circumstances as should have put him- on inquiry. </em>We are therefore to say whether the evidence was sufficient to charge .the plaintiff with notice of' Groat\u2019s improper conduct in. putting off the note. The plaintiff was a dealer in lottery tickets, and the note was received in payment for tickets sold Groat; the note was therefore received, it is said in the due course of business. Even if so received, there may be attendant circumstances destroying the <em>bona-fides </em>of the transaction.\u201d And the court held that sufficent circumstances were brought home to the plaintiff to have put him upon inquiry; and judgment was given to the defendant. This was in 1830.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-6\">In <em>Wardell </em>agt. <em>Howell </em>(9 <em>Wend. </em>110), the English case, <em>Gill </em>agt. <em>Cubitt (3 Barn, </em>and <em>Ores. </em>466), is cited by Justice Sutherland, with approval.

The particular attention of the court is called to this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-5\">In <em>The Belmont Branch Bank </em>agt. <em>Hoge </em>(7 <em>Bosw. </em>543), the case of <em>Pringle </em>agt. <em>Phillips, </em>is adopted and followed in the three able opinions there delivered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-6\">The question was incidentally before the court of appeals in <em>Davis </em>agt. <em>McReady </em>(17 N. <em>Y. R. </em>230). ' That was an action by an indorsee against acceptor of a bill taken before due and for value. At the time he purchased it he was informed that the consideration 'was an executory agreement by vendor to make necessary repairs to render a brig sea-worthy. The question that he purchased it under circumstances that should have put him upon inquiry was raised, but the court held that the consideration for the acceptance being legal, and that at the time of the transfer the contract to repair being yet executory, and no breach having transpired, that a subsequent breach of the contract in neglecting to make the proper repairs, did not affect plaintiff\u2019s title. Denio, J., says \u201c a party receiving a bill is not put upon inquiry unless circumstances of suspicion hgve come to his knowledge.\u201d And this is said concerning the transfer of a bill before due and for value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-8\">The case of <em>The Louisiana State Bank </em>agt. <em>Orleans Navigation Co. </em>(3 <em>Louis. Repts.), </em>decided in 1848; much later than the English cases, is a very strong case in favor of the plaintiff in this case. It is there held that \u201c Express notice is not necessary to charge the hold\u00e9r with what the law considers to be notice of any defect or infirmity in a note or bill so as to let in a defence against a holder for value; it is sufficient, if the attending circumstances are of such a character as to cast a shade on the transaction and to put the holder on inquiry.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-9\">3d. Because if at the time of making the payment, the defendant had notice of the infirmity of the holder\u2019s title, the payment was nugatory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The case of <em>Williamson </em>agt. <em>Brown </em>(15 <em>N. </em>F. <em>R. </em>354), although a case pertaining to real property, establishes the rule that must necessarily dispose of this case. It determines beyond all possibility of doubt, that the question is not one of fraud but of good or bad faith. Bad faith is not synonymous with fraud; bad faith involves moral turpitude only, while fraud is an indictable offence ; and it is a principle of universal application that a party can not establish a defence based upon her own <em>mala fides. Mala fides </em>is the absence of good faith; but it does by no means always follow that a party not exercising good faith is necessarily guilty of a fraud. Therefore, if the defendant, at the time of making the alleged payment had notice of the infirmity of the holder\u2019s title to the note\u2014if she was in possession of facts and circumstances sufficient to put her upon inquiry in that behalf, and , omitted to make all necessary and proper inquiries\u2014it is a case in which the law declares that she had notice\u2014and a failure to make proper inquiries to ascertain whether the holder was entitled to receive payment of the note, was such an absence of good faith as would deprive the alleged payment of all force as against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-5\">At page 362, Selden, J., says: \u201c The true doctrine on this subject is that where a purchaser has knowledge of any fact, sufficient to put him on inquiry as to the existence of some right or title in conflict with that he is about to purchase, he is presumed either to have made the inquiry, and ascertained the extent of such prior right, or to have been guilty of a degree of negligence equally fatal to his claim, to be considered as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-7\"><em>Parsons </em>in his recent <em>Treaties on Bills and Notes, </em>after an elaborate discussion of the authorities, lays down the law thus: \u201c The <em>bona fide </em>holder of a lost, stolen or tortiously transferred note or bill, transferable by mere delivery, and not over due or otherwise apparently dishonored, who has taken it without knowledge, or actual or construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>tive notice of the loss or fraud, in the usual course of business, and for a full and valuable consideration, has a perfect title to that bill or note against the true owner.\u201d (2 <em>Parsons on Bills and Notes, </em>27 9; <em>Bay </em>agt. <em>Coddington, </em>20 <em>J. R. </em>637.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-5\">This is unquestionably the law, plainly and succinctly stated. But the learned commentator has here stated a proposition applicable to bills or notes transferred before maturity, and not at all applicable to those transferred <em>after </em>maturity; for he says on the same page, \u201c where the defect in title appears on the face of the lost or stolen instrument at the time of the transfer, as where it is transferred <em>after it is due (Down </em>agt. <em>Hailing, </em>4 <em>Barn, fy Cres. </em>330 ; <em>Weathered </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>9 <em>Texas, </em>622), or after dishonor, the party obviously has constructive notice of his assignor\u2019s infirmity, and can have no better title than he. It is an obvious case of transfer with notice, and. follows the ordinary rule of paper over due, or otherwise defective.\u201d <em>(Ayer </em>agt. <em>Hutchins, </em>4 <em>Mass. </em>370 ; <em>Wiggin </em>agt. <em>Bush, </em>12 <em>J. R. </em>306; <em>Fowler </em>agt. <em>Brantly, </em>14 <em>Peters, </em>318 ; <em>Goodman </em>agt. <em>Simons, </em>20 Hom. 343.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-6\"><em>Down </em>agt. <em>Hailing {supra), </em>was the case of a lost check taken by the defendant, a shopkeeper, in the usual course of business, in payment of goods, giving the balance in change <em>five days after date. </em>In an action brought by the person who had lost the check against the shopkeeper (he having drawn the money on it), it was held that the jury were properly directed to find for the plaintiff if they thought the defendant had taken the check under circumstances which ought to have excited the suspicion of -a prudent man. Bayley, Justice, says : \u201c I think this case was left to the jury very favorably for the defendant. There is no question whatever in the case, if the distinction between bills over due and not due be adverted to. If a bill, note or check, be taken after it is due, the party taking it can have no better title to it than the party from whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>he takes it; and, therefore, cannot recover upon it if it turns out that it has been previouly lost or stolen.\u201d Holroyd, J., says : \u201c This check must be considered in the same light as a bill taken after it is due. Now it has been frequently held that a party taking such a bill or note, takes it at his peril. In many of the cases where the title to stolen bills or notes has come in question, <em>they have been taken before they were due, </em>and <em>then </em>it may have been a proper question to submit to the jury whether they were taken <em>mala fide </em>or <em>bona fide.\u201d </em>And Abbott, C. J., says : \u201c The check came into the hands of the defendant five days after its date. We are \u00f3f opinion that an instrument of this nature coming to the hands of a party <em>so long after its date, </em>is to be considered in the same light as a bill of exchange over due, and in such a case it is incumbent on the party who takes the instrument under such circumstances, to show <em>that the party from whom he took it had a good title to it.\u201d </em>At the time of the alleged payment in this case, the note was <em>seven months past due !</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-7\">If these cases are to be followed, and I have met with no case in which they are even questioned, and I have examined about every reported case in England and the United States bearing upon this question, there cannot be a doubt but what the charge was erroneous, and that the plaintiff was on the evidence entitled to \u00e1 verdict. The cases in this state cited under my second proposition, have never been overruled or even questioned. I have no doubt but what Judge Story, in laying down the rule as contained in the charge in this case, had reference solely to promissory notes transferred before maturity. While his doctrine as pertaining to that class of transfers maybe substantially correct, yet the authorities cited by him do not sustain his text. * The rule is correctly laid down by Parsons, as above quoted. The fundamental error of Lord. Denman\u2019s doctrine is, that he does not discriminate between the negotiation of bills before maturity and after maturity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>As applied to the former his doctrine is substantially sound, while as to the latter it is simply absurd. And here consists the principal error in the charge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-5\">II. The court erred in refusing to charge the jury when requested by the plaintiff, \u201c that if they should find that the note was lost or stolen from the plaintiff, that the payment by the defendant at the time and in the manner alleged, was not a payment thereof as against the plaintiff, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover.\u201d If I have correctly stated the law in my first point, that if the payment was made under circumstances which ought reasonably to have excited defendant's suspicion, and led her to inquire, and by failing to make proper and necessary inquiries to ascertain the extent of the holder\u2019s right to the note, there was an absence of good faith in making the payment, and that by accepting a transfer of the note long after due, she had notice of the infirmit) of the holder\u2019s title. It follows as a natural sequence that if the facts and circumstances known to her at the time were sufficient <em>to have actually excited her suspicions and put her upon inquiry, </em>and she neglected to make proper effort to ascertain whether or not the holder was entitled to receive payment, in making the payment there was not only an absence of good faith in her, but positive bad faith.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-6\">To incontestably establish the fact that her suspicions <em>were aroused </em>by the circumstances under which payment was demanded, <em>to such an extent as to put her upon inquiry, </em>it is only necessary to refer to her own testimony, from which <em>(fol. </em>35 <em>and fol. </em>40) it appears that <em>she actually soiight the advice of an attorney. </em>The rule is well established that \u201c a party in possession of certain information will be chargeable with a knowledge of all facts which an inquiry, suggested by such information, prosecuted with due diligence, would have disclosed to him.\u201d <em>{Williamson </em>agt. <em>Brown, </em>15 N. <em>Y. R. </em>354, 364 ; <em>Whitbread </em>agt. <em>Boulnois, </em>1 <em>You. &amp; Coll. Ex.

Co. </em>agt. <em>Halsey, </em>4 <em>Sandf. S. C. R. </em>565 ; <em>Small </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>583.) It therefore became a question of law for the court, and <em>not of </em>fact <em>for the </em>jury to determine\u2014the defendant having by her own testimony convicted herself of an act of bad faith in paying the note under the circumstances under which it was paid. The plaintiff was entitled to the charge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-5\">When her suspicions became aroused\u2014when doubt rose in her mind as to her right to pay the note to this stranger under the circumstances of the case\u2014bearing in mind that the plaintiff had been her counsel,\u00bb and manager of her business for years, and was then absent in the army of the Potomac, and that she was intimate in plaintiff\u2019s mother\u2019s family; that they resided but two hours\u2019 ride on the cars distant from her, between whom there was communication by mail twice a day; she having been informed by Mrs. Cothran but a short time previous to this stranger\u2019s presenting this note, that plaintiff had left it with her to live upon in case he never returned from the army ; I say, does not the law demand of her that in the exercise of good faith towards the plaintiff, she should have made the inquiry of Mrs. Cothran whether <em>or not </em>the note had been transferred. Had she made the inquiry, the whole fraud would have been detected at once. But instead of making the slightest inquiry in the direction where she knew she would readily have been informed of the larceny, she studiously avoided making any inquiry at all, and in that she was guilty of bad faith, which is entirely fatal to her defence <em>(Williamson </em>agt. <em>Brown, </em>15 <em>N. Y. R. </em>354, <em>per </em>Paige, <em>J).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-6\">It has frequently been determined in our court of appeals and supreme court, in actions to recover damages for injuries occasioned by negligence, that if the negligence of the plaintiff contributed to the injury, that his action cannot be sustained. \u25a0 As a corollary from the above, does it not follow that if the defendant\u2019s want of good faith in any manner contributed to the perpetration of this fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>upon the plaintiff, her defence is unavailing, and the alleged payment a fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-5\">III. The court erred in refusing to charge the jury \u201c that if they found that the alleged payment was made by the defendant without reasonable caution, and out of the usual course of business, and the plaintiff had not parted with his interest in the note, but had been deprived thereof by fraud, the plaintiff was entitled to recover.\u201d A payment in the usual course of business means a payment by the proper person to the lawful holder at the maturity of the paper, and at the place where it is payable. (2 <em>Parsons on Bills, </em>208 ; <em>Story on Promissory Notes, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 275, 380.) A payment out of the usual course of business is always at the peril of the party paying, and payment of a note long past due is a payment out of the usual course. <em>(Byles on Bills, </em>288, <em>'kill Am. Ed.; </em>2 <em>Parsons on </em>Bills, 212.) \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-6\">A party purchasing a piece of paper past due takes it as a dishonored paper, and subject to any defence that may exist between the original parties. And for that matter it makes no difference whether he purchased it in good faith or in bad faith. He has taken it out of the usual course of business. A note past due has a cloud of dishonor attached to it, and it has ceased to come within the protection that the law affords to commercial paper negotiated before due. <em>(Wheeler </em>agt. <em>Guild, </em>20 <em>Pick. </em>545 ; <em>Down </em>agt. <em>Hailing, </em>4 <em>Barn. </em>&amp; <em>Gres. </em>330.) And a party paying a note long past due occupies no better position than a party pui'chasing. In fact, it is laid down in <em>Byles on Bills </em>(288, <em>note h), </em>that <em>\u201c </em>there is at present no authority for saying that a party honestly paying, is in as good a situation as a party honestly discounting.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-7\">A payment without reasonable caution means a payment made in the absence of good faith. Reasonable caution and good faith mean, substantially the same thing, except that the former is embraced in the latter.

A party cannot close his eyes to facts and circumstances brought home to his knowledge, from which he must have known the existence of facts entirely inconsistent Avith AA'hat he claims, and then claim that by reason of his having avoided making any inquiry, he acted in good faith.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-5\">There was a circumstance connected with this note that was not only suspicious to the last degree, but a circumstance from which <em>she must have known </em>that this holder had fraudulently acquired possession of this note.

The learned judge before whom the cause was tried, remarked in submitting the case to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>jury, \u201c that it seemed to be conceded on all hands that the note had been stolen from plaintiff\u2019s house.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-5\">The case of <em>Williamson </em>agt. <em>Brown [supra), </em>establishes the law that a party being possessed of information, is chargeable with a knowledge of all the facts which an inquiry suggested by such information, prosecuted with due diligence, would have disclosed to him; and the case of <em>Johnson </em>agt. <em>Bloodgood, </em>having held that a party purchasing a note long past due took it at his peril, and did an act <em>mala fide; </em>and <em>Brown </em>agt. <em>Taber, </em>having determined that a party purchasing a note with the maker\u2019s name and the date of maturity marked thereon by a banker\u2019s clerk, and the note not yet due, had sufficient notice of the infirmity of the holder\u2019s title to defeat his recovery thereon, notwithstanding he paid full value.

The court erred in refusing to charge the jury \u201c that the alleged payment by defendant being to a stranger, more than six months after maturity of the note, with knowledge that the same was in the hands of the plaintiff long after due, was under circumstances which might reasonably awaken the suspicion of a prudent person.\u201d The fact that the note was long past due, was a circumstance sufficient to excite the suspicion of a prudent person. <em>[Johnson </em>agt. <em>Bloodgood, </em>1 <em>Johns.

It was a dishonored note, and out of the usual course of business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-7\">The fact that defendant knew that the note was held by the plaintiff a long time after it had matured, was sufficient to have awakened her suspicion when it was presented by a stranger\u2014she knowing at the time of the presentment that plaintiff was absent in the army. The fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>that the note was presented by a stranger whom defendant had neither seen or heard of before; the note being for so large an amount, and he declaring that he had got it under such circumstances that if promptly paid he could afford to throw off the interest, about an hundred dollars. Would it not reasonably awaken the suspicion of any solvent honest person, to have an utter stranger approach him and say, sir, I hold a note against you for $2,400, which is past due over six months, but I got it under such circumstances that if promptly paid, I can afford to throw off the interest ? And all this too, before the maker had in the least pleaded time or his inability to pay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-5\">Isn\u2019t it a little, suspicious that he should propose to throw off over $100 before he asks for payment at all. Let us see what she says about this transaction. At fol. 41, she testifies: \u201cWhen the man to whom I paid this note first came, he asked me if my name was Mrs. Collins, I said it was; he said he was Mr. Judson; said he had a note payable to George W. Cothran; I said it was my note; he said <em>he had got it under such circumstances that he could afford to throw off the interst if promptly paid; </em>I told him I would see what I could do about it, and would let him <em>know; </em>I never saw the man before ; when he came the second time, I told him I should be unable to pay him more than $1,900, and asked him to take note for $500 <em>at three years ; </em>I asked him if he considered it prompt enough to throw off the interest; he said he did.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-7\">If his proposition to throw off an hundred dollars of interest if promptly paid, was a ground of suspicion, wasn\u2019t it doubly suspicious \u2014 didn\u2019t it stamp the transaction with fraud, when he said that $1,900 in money and a bare promissory note at three years \u2014 a thing so unusual and out of the usual course of business \u2014 was payment sufficiently prompt to induce him to throw off an hundred dollars of interest on a note then long past due, and against a person of such extensive means and undoubted credit as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Mrs. Collins ? Did he not know that he could have en- ' forced payment at once? Was. not the fact that she, on s\u00ae short a call, had produced $1,900, evidence sufficient to satisfy his mind that the note was good ? Why then take a new note, and at three years ? Why not indorse the payment on the note, and hold it instead of taking a new one ? The answer is obvious to the least thinking mind. He had acquired possession of the note fraudulently and wanted to get rid of it, and she wanted to get her name off from the note before the discovery by the plaintiff of the larceny.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-5\">Can any honest man after carefully reading her evidence, say that he believes that she acted in good faith in making this payment ? or even that she ever made any payment at all in fact, b.ut rather that this whole affair of payment was a mere device, manufactured by a crafty and designing woman, who had acquired possession of the note herself in a surreptitious manner, that she could avail herself of the testimony of her daughter to defeat a recovery on the note, and a conviction on the charge of larceny. Do you believe her when she testifies that she didn\u2019t take this note from Mrs. Cothran\u2019s house ? . Do you believe when she testifies that she paid this note.in good faith, that she testifies truly ? Had any other person than Mrs. Collins stolen this note, do you think that the gold and silver that lay loose in the same drawer would not have been taken also ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-6\">Y. The court erred in refusing to charge the jury, \u201c that if they should find that.the plaintiff had not parted with or transferred his interest in the note at the time of the alleged payment, it being then long past due, the payment by defendant at the time and in the manner alleged was not a payment of the note, and the plaintiff .was entitled to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-7\">1.

I believe we are all of opinion that gross negligence only would not be a sufficient answer where the party has given consideration for the bill. Gross negligence may be evidence of <em>mala fides, </em>but it is not the same thing. <em>We have shaken off the last'remnant of the contrary doctrine. </em>When the bill has passed, to the plaintiff, without any proof of <em>bad faith </em>in him, there is no objection to his title.\u201d In <em>Utter </em>agt. <em>Rich </em>(10 <em>Adolp. &amp; Ellis, </em>784), Lord Denman said, three years later (1889): \u201c With respect to the doctrine laid down in <em>Gill </em>agt. <em>Cubitt (supra), </em>and other cases, we adhere to the more recent decisions, and to what is said in <em>Goodman </em>agt. <em>Harvey, </em>that gross negligence alone would not be a sufficient answer; that it may be evidence of <em>mala fides, </em>but is not the same thing.\u201d <em>(See also Arbonin </em>agt. <em>Anderson, </em>1 <em>Adolp. </em>&amp; <em>Ellis, N.

That case related to personal chattels. In <em>Arbonin </em>agt. <em>Anderson (supra), </em>Patterson, J., in speaking of a similar case, said : \u201c That was a case where cattle had been fraudulently obtained. <em>Goods are one thing, negotiable instruments </em>another.\u201d There is no authority for saying that the property in a negotiable instrument might not pass from a party who stole it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-5\">Judge D\u00fcer\u2019s opinion has <em>been </em>expressly repudiated by <em>every </em>recent American case and elementary writer <em>(authorities before cited). </em>See also 2 <em>Parsons on Motes and Bills, </em>219, where the whole question is elaborately and ably discussed, and in the text and notes of all the authorities both English and American (including the <em>obiter </em>opinion of Judge Duer), cited and commented upon, and the conclusion stated that the law is settled both in England and America, as follows : \u201c The title of such holder is not defeated by proof that he was negligent, or even grossly negligent in taking the note or bill, and that he omitted to make inquiries which common prudence would have dictated. But while gross negligence is not itself <em>mala fides, </em>it may be evidence thereof for a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-7\">II. The rule protecting the holder of negotiable paper, as now settled, should be extended even with more favor to the payment of a note or bill by a maker or acceptor, and the charge of the court was therefore clearly right, and no stronger than the uniform and established rule required <em>(see authorities before cited). </em>The charge was in the language of <em>Story on Bills, section </em>382. <em>Edwards on Bills, </em>538, states the same rule explicitly. He says : V And the rule appears to be now well settled that nothing short of fraud or bad faith in the party paying a note or bill will render the payment ineffectual. It has been held that even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>gross negligence, unaccompanied by bad faith, will not defeat the title of a purchaser for value, <em>and there is no ground </em>for requiring of the maker or acceptor, or his agent, anything more than good faith in the payment of a note or bill.\u201d The word notice means the same as knowledge (20 <em>How. </em>365, <em>per </em>Clifford, J). If the maker <em>knew </em>that the holder stole the note, or obtained it fraudulent), or found it, or held it under such circumstances as would prevent <em>his </em>recovering it, then the payment would be in bad faith, otherwise not. It is well settled that <em>mala fides </em>only will prevent a recovery by the holder. <em>(Comstock </em>agt. <em>Hoag, </em>5 <em>Wend. </em>600; 6 <em>Mass. </em>430.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-5\">III. The several requests to charge were properly refused by the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-6\">1. The first request ivas that if the jury should find that the note had been stolen, then the payment Avas invalid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-7\">2. \"That if the jury should find that the plaintiff had not parted with his interest in the note, it being past due, then the payment Avas invalid, and the plaintiff Avas entitled to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-8\">3. That the payment being to a stranger, with knowledge that the same Avas in the hands of the plaintiff after due, was under circumstances Avhich might reasonably awaken the suspicion of a prudent person.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-9\">The court refused to charge in these Avords, having already commented to the\" jury on these facts. 1. It was a disputed fact on the trial whether defendant did know that plaintiff held the note after it AAas due; and-if-that Avas material, it is presumed that the court charged accordingly. 2. But it Avas immaterial Avhether the plaintiff knew that the holder obtained it after it Avas due or'not. It was necessary to know that the holder had no title. 3. A conclusive ansiver to the request is, that it Avas of no consequence whether the circumstances Avould \u201c <em>awaken the suspicions of a prudent person \u201d </em>or not. We have seen that suspicion is\" not sufficient\" to defeat a payment. 4. But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>court did put all these circumstances to the jury for them to consider on the question of bad faith.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-5\">4. The last request was, that if the jury found that the payment was made under suspicious circumstances, without reasonable caution, and out of the usual course of business, and the plaintiff had not parted with his interest in the note, but had been deprived thereof by fraud, the plain tiff was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-6\">This is sufficiently answered by previous points and authorities. It is presumed that the court charged correctly on all other subjects not specifically stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-7\">IV. A new trial should be denied, with costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b150-8\">By the court, Grover, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAk\">The only questions in this case arise upon the exceptions to the charge of the judge, and to his refusals to charge as requested. These exceptions present the question whether payment of a note, which has been lost or stolen from the owner, by the maker to the finder or thief, without fraud ; in other words, under the belief that he was the true owner, but under circumstances showing that the maker was grossly negligent in not learning the facts, and which would have excited suspicion in an ordinary person, is available as a defence against the real owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The judge upon the trial held, and so instructed the jury, that such payment constituted a defence against the owner. Such I understand to be the fair construction of the charge. The plaintiff insists as one ground why such payment is not good, that it was made after the note became due. .It is well- settled that a party purchasing a note or bill after the same becomes due, takes it subject to all defences the maker or other parties would have against the party from whom he purchases. But this doctrine, I think, has no application to payment made to a party in possession, by the party liable. The rule as to a purchaser is founded upo.n-.a presumption that valid notes or bills \u00e1re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>paid bjr'tlie parties liable thereon at the time they become due, and that non-payment at that time is notice to all. subsequently acquiring title to the paper, that the same is for some reason invalid, or that there is no subsisting cause of action thereon. But the maker of a note has no reason for supposing from the fact that he has not paid the same when due, that the title of the possessor is invalid. Indeed, notes are very rarely paid before due, and cases of presentment for payment before that time are still more rare.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">At one time it was the rule in England that payment made to a purchaser or a party in possession, under circumstances calculated to excite the suspicions of a prudent man as to liis ownership, was not good as against the real owner who had lost the paper, or from whom it had been stolen <em>(Gill </em>agt. <em>Cubitt, </em>3 <em>Barn, Cress. </em>466). Quite a number of cases were decided'in the same way upon the authority of that case, applying the same rule. In late cases the English judges modify the rule by holding that circumstances calculated to excite suspicion of a prudent man by a purchaser of a bill or note <em>before </em>due, was not sufficient to destroy the title of the purchaser, but to have that effect such purchaser must have been grossly negligent (C<em>rooks </em>agt. <em>Jadis, </em>5 <em>Barn. </em>\u00a7 <em>Adolp. </em>909). Finally, in still later cases, the rule was still further modified by holding that such purchaser must purchase in bad faith, and that gross negligence was not sufficient to destroy his title. <em>(Goodman </em>agt. Harvey, 4 <em>Adolp. &amp; Ellis, </em>870; <em>TJther </em>agt. <em>Rich, </em>10 <em>Adolp. &amp; Ellis, </em>748.) These cases relate to the title of a purchaser before due, of a lost or stolen paper. I think the rule should be the same in case of payment by the party liable, though made after due, as in the case of a purchaser before due.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We have seen that notes are not paid until or after-due usually, and there is surely as much reason that the party liable should be unembarrassed in making payment, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>that he should be protected in paying to one in possession, and <em>prima facie </em>entitled to receive it, as that a purchaser in the usual course of business, for value, should be protected in his title. Indeed, if any distinction should be made, I think the rule should be more favorable to the party making the payment. He must act at once, not only to preserve his credit but to protect himself from the trouble and expense of a suit, while the purchaser would merely lose a bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The doctrine of the charge is fully sustained by <em>Story on </em>Motes, <em>section </em>382; <em>and Id. on Bills, section </em>438 ; and by <em>Edwards on Bills, </em>538. The same doctrine is recognized in <em>Hall </em>agt. <em>Wilson </em>(16 <em>Barb. </em>548), and in <em>Magee </em>agt. <em>Badger </em>(30 <em>Barb. </em>247). The weight of authority is decidedly in favor of the doctrine held by the judge in. his charge. Upon principle, I think that doctrine correct. There would be no safety in paying paper to anybody but the payee, if in determining the validity of such payment an inquiry must be gone into whether the party making it has been negligent, or whether the circumstances would have excited the suspicions of a prudent man. If such Avas the law, parties liable on commercial paper Avould often be greatly embarrassed. But adopting the text of the charge, that the payment should be held valid unless the party making it did so fraudulently; in other words, made it in bad faith, or presuming that the person to whom it Avas made Avas not the owner, Ave have a fixed determinate rule that can never leave the party liable to pay in doubt as to Avhat course to adopt. He will not be compelled to run the hazard of an uncertain Iuav suit. Indeed, I think that if the court should adopt the rule that a party should not tie protected in paying his paper to the possessor, when the circumstances Avere such as to excite suspicion as to his OAvnersliip, or put him on inquiry, they ought to hold that .such facts constitute a defence to an action .brought by such possessor, although the real owner, until a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>time had elapsed for making the inquiry, otherwise the law would cast upon the party liable the burden of either losing his money if he paid, and it turned out that the possessor was not the owner, or if he refused, to pay the costs of a law suit if it turned out he was the owner. Yet no one will contend that such circumstances will sustain a defence for a moment. A holder of a negotiable note is not required to present any evidence of ownership other than the possession, to authorize him to demand and receive payment. Hence, I think, it follows that the charge is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial must be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b117-16\">Note.\u2014This is a very important and interesting question, and this decision is probably the only reported case of the kind.\u2014Rep.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b153-6\">Daniels, J., <em>dissenting.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AgB\">The plaintiff brought this action to recover the amount due upon a promissory note made by the defendant on the 15th of July, 1862, payable in twenty days to the plaintiff or bearer, with semi-annual interest. It remained in his possession and in the possession of his mother for him, until after January 12th, 1863, and between that time and the 16th of February, was feloniously stolen, and on that day was paid by the defendant to a stranger, who derived title under the person committing the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The evidence tends to show that the defendant knew the note continued to be owned by the plaintiff after it became due. There would probably be no impropriety in assuming such to be the fact, since in addition to the other evidence on that subject, she substantially concedes it in her letter written under date of the 11th of August. But that assumption is not necessary, for she has been exonerated from the plaintiff\u2019s claim by payment to the person who held the note. It is true as a general proposition, that not even gross negligence, if unattended with <em>mala fides </em>on the part of the maker or other party paying the note, will invalidate the payment so as to take away the rights founded thereon. <em>(Story on Promissory Notes, \u00a7 </em>381; 2 <em>Parsons on Bills and Notes, </em>272, 273.) But in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>bring the present case within the protection of this rule, the payment should appear to have been made <em>at the maturity of the note, </em>or so near that - time as to show that the holder acquired it before it became due. The rule declared by <em>Chitty </em>in his work on <em>Bills, at page </em>394, is as follows: \u201c In general, when the holder of a bill or note indorsed in blank or payable to bearer, loses or is robbed of'it, and the person finding or stealing it presents it to the drawer <em>at the time it is due, </em>and he pays it <em>bona fide, in the course of business, </em>without knowing of the loss or robbery, such payment-will discharge him.\u201d <em>(See also pp. </em>255, 256.) The rule is stated in the same manner by <em>Parsons, Bills and Notes (vol. </em>2, 212, 213). He says : \u201c Payment to a wrong party of a note or bill long dishonored, or of a check long after it was drawn, does not discharge the payer.\u201d If payment be made either before the paper matures or long after it has become due, <em>it is made out of the usual course of business, and will not discharge the party paying, unless to a person actually entitled to receive the money. (Byles on Bills, </em>271; <em>Story on Promissory notes, </em>384; 2 <em>Parsons on Bills and Notes, </em>214,\u2019215.) This is implied by <em>Chitty, </em>in his statement of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">When a person presents the bill or note for payment at its maturity, his apparent right to payment indicated by the production of the paper, is suificient to entitle the maker or acceptor to rely upon his title in making payment. Any other rule would be inconvenient in the transaction of the affairs of business where negotiable paper is made to perform many of the offices of currency. If the maker or acceptor were bound to ascertain at the peril of making payment again, the actual rights of the person who demands it at maturity, intolerable delays and embarrassments would intervene, leading to multitudes of controversies, and the frequent dishonor of obligations that the necessities of the public require to be met promptly at maturity. Much of the real business value of this paper would be thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>destrojmd. It is not only convenient, but necessary to the utility of negotiable paper, that the law should protect the party paying at maturity, where the person receiving payment appears from the posssession of the paper to be entitled to it. But where the paper has been long due, the necessities of the rule cease. For its utility as currency in business affairs is at an end. It is essential to that use of it, that the holder for value, in good faith, should be protected, notwithstanding the person transferring the paper to him was without title.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The same rule applies which protects the payment to one without title, when made at maturity. The production of the paper by the holder, without anything indicating his want of title, is sufficient to confer a complete title upon the purchaser. Where the paper, however, has become due, the attribute is lost which will enable the seller to confer a better title than his own upon the buyer. And the law affecting the rights of parties to other personal property then becomes applicable. Hie only difference being that negotiable paper still retains its negotiability, so that the holder having title can negotiate that title to another. But the indorser is presumed to be acquainted with the circumstances affecting its validity in the hands of the person who was h.older when it became due, and consequently must stand in his character. <em>(Williams </em>agt. <em>Matthews, </em>3 <em>Cow. R. </em>260 ; <em>Andrews </em>.agt. <em>Pond, </em>13 <em>Curtis\u2019 U. S. Decisions, </em>49, 50 ; <em>Goodman </em>agt. <em>Simonds, </em>20 <em>How. V. S. R. </em>365, 366.) The rule as stated by <em>Parsons on Bills and Notes (vol. </em>2, 219), is, \u201c that where the defective title appears on the face of the lost or stolen instrument at the time of transfer, or where it is transferred after it is due or after dishonor, the party obviously has constructive notice of his assignor\u2019s infirmity, and can have no better title than lie.\u201d This places him precisely where the law applicable t\u00f3 sales of other kinds of personal property would, if the article sold is not negotiable. Pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>session alone, in that case, is not sufficient to protect the pei\u2019son who mistakenly acts upon the faith of it. Those who buy, .and those who pay upon the assurance arising from that circumstance, do so at their peril. While possession is presumptive evidence of title, it is liable to be overthrown by any one maintaining a paramount right. The presumption is alike which applies to the possession of a stolen horse and to the possession of an over-due note. As to personal property generally, the rule is well settled that the actual owner cannot be concluded, or his title affected by the disposition made of it by a wrong-doer, or any one acquiring it through him <em>(Wooster </em>agt. <em>Sherwood, </em>25 N. F. <em>R. </em>286, 287). It follows that the person who received the payment from the defendant did it without authority. \u2022 He had no title to the note, because it was acquired under the felonious taker, and long after it became due. No action could have been maintained upon it by him against the defendant. That infirmity distinguishes this case from all those relied upon to sustain the defence. The paper in them was received before its maturity and for value, which was sufficient to entitle the holder to enforce collection by action, and of course would justify a voluntary payment. Unless the paper properly falls within that class, or is presented for payment when it matures, the maker is not protected in paying, if it appears that the holder was not actually authorized to receive it. Production of the paper by the person demanding payment, will only be sufficient where it is done in the usual course of business, which, in judgment of law, is at the time of its maturity. Where the payment is made long after the paper becomes due, the party relying upon it to make the defence successful, must satisfy the jury that it was made to one actualty authorized to receive it. By the ruling at the circuit, that was excluded from the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The verdict should be set aside and a new trial granted.</p>\n<author id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Marvin, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Apo\">also delivered an opinion mainly devoted to an analysis of the authorities cited by Judges Grover and Daniels, as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Cases cited by Grover, J., <em>Gill </em>agt. <em>Cubitt </em>(3 <em>Barn. S\u00a1 Cress. </em>446). Brother Grover speaks of this case as a case where payment was made under suspicious circumstances, &amp;c.,to one possessing the paper, &amp;c., not being valid against the real owner who had lost it, and from whom it had been stolen. The stolen bill was not paid by the acceptor, but' it was discounted by a broker, and he as indorser brought the action against the acceptor, who defended, and had a verdict. The question for the jury was whether the plaintiff took <em>the bill under circumstances which ought to have excited the suspicion of a prudent and careful man. </em>(It was this position which the subsequent cases overruled.) The question whether a payment by the acceptor at maturity or <em>afterwards, </em>without notice, was not in the case. In that case notice of the loss or theft was given, and the acceptor defended.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Brother Daniels quotes from 2 <em>Parsons on Bills and Notes, </em>212, 213, thus : \u201c Payment to a wrong party of a note or bill long dishonored, or of a check long after it was drawn, does not discharge the payee.\u201d <em>Parsons </em>cites only <em>Scoby </em>agt. <em>Ramsbottom </em>(2 <em>Camp. </em>485), and his chapter on checks. This case is stated in a note on page 80. \u201c A check had been torn in pieces by the drawer and thrown <em>aside; </em>these pieces were pasted together on another slip of paper, the rents, however, being quite visible, and the face of the check soiled and dirty. This check was presented by a stranger and paid without inquiry, and the bank was held liable to the drawer, the position of the instrument being sufficient notice of cancellation.\u201d The text in <em>Parsons, pages </em>79,80, is : \u201c If a bank pays a check which was cancelled and the cancelling remains, or a check which had been torn 'to pieces and then pasted together, or one which is so long over due as to be staled or other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>wise justifying suspicion and inquiry, he pays it at his own peril.\u201d He cites only <em>Scoby </em>agt. <em>Ramsbottom.. Parsons on page </em>212, speaks of paying a note to a thief or finder, not discharging the payer unless made in good faith, without knowledge or direct means of knowledge, and <em>in the usual course of business. </em>He cites <em>Miller </em>agt. <em>Race </em>(1 Burrows, 452), where a <em>bona fide </em>holder of a stolen note was allowed to recover, though the banker had notice of the theft. He cites <em>Pearson </em>agt. <em>Hutchinson </em>(2 <em>Camp. </em>211; 6 <em>Esp. </em>126 ; <em>see these cases').</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Brother Daniels cites <em>Chitty on </em>Bills, 394, to the same effect as Parsons, and <em>Chitty </em>cites the same cases and <em>Bevan agt. Hill </em>(2 <em>Camp. </em>381). 'Let us see what these cases are. The case <em>of Pearson </em>agt. <em>Hutchinson </em>(3 <em>Camp, and </em>6 <em>Espinasse), </em>was an action <em>at law </em>against the acceptor of a bill lost after it was indorsed, and it not appearing to have been destroyed; it was held that the action would not lie, 'though a bond of indemnity was tendered. <em>Brown </em>agt. <em>Hill </em>(2 <em>Camp. </em>381). The buyer of stock had given his check, the vendor lost it, and the vendee refused to pay without an indemnity. The bankers failed four months after, with funds of the drawer of the check in their hands to answer it. It was held that the vendor of the stock could not maintain an action against the vendee for the price of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">These cases do not show that the payment of a note by the maker after it is due, to one who presents it for payment, will be invalid in case the party to whom it was paid was not a <em>bona fide </em>holder. There must be some notice or circumstances beyond the mere fact that the note was past due. Indeed, the modern authorities as to the title of a holder of a bill or note, go to the extent of the charge, that nothing short of fraud will defeat his title. And these cases are cited by <em>Story </em>by way of analog), in cases of payment and discharge of the note. It is true that this rule requiring fraud to defeat the title of the holder, applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>only to those cases where the note or bill was transferred before maturity, for if transferred after maturity, the holder always takes it subject to the equities between the parties to the note. The maker of the note must pay it to some one. The possession of the note is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of title, whether the note is due or not, and I concur in the opinion that the maker, in the absence of fraud on his part, may safely pay it to any one who presents it for payment. If the evidence is clear, as in the case of the can-celled check, that the presenter for payment had no title, the payment of it would be a fraud upon the true owner. It would be a payment in bad faith. This was a question for the jury, and it was fairly submitted. I think there was no error in the charge, and I concur with brother Grover, that a new trial should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Davis, P.
