Shears (defendant) was convicted in a bench trial on separate indictments charging two offenses of cocaine possession with intent to distribute, two related firearm charges and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. He complains on appeal that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence gathered during an unlawful search and seizure and wrongfully convicted him of the two cocaine offenses arising from a single act of possession. He also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the marijuana conviction. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence is uncontradicted. Hampton Police Detective Olen Payne, assisted by Detectives John Decker and others, was pursuing an arrest of Clyde Boyce on \u201coutstanding murder warrants.\u201d Planning to entice Boyce into custody, police enlisted an informant to telephone Boyce, a known narcotics dealer, and solicit a drug purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>from him. After the informant confirmed the contact with Boyce, the detectives secreted themselves in and about the informant\u2019s mobile home and awaited Boyce\u2019s arrival to consummate the transaction. Boyce reputedly delivered drugs \u201cmoments\u201d after a \u201ccall,\u201d and, within a \u201cfew minutes,\u201d an automobile arrived and defendant exited and entered the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Hidden in the rear of the residence, Detective Payne observed defendant and heard him declare, \u201cThis better not be no set up,\u201d to someone in the kitchen area. Although Payne had never before seen either Boyce or defendant, defendant\u2019s appearance was consistent with the physical description of Boyce which, together with the attendant circumstances, prompted Payne to mistakenly identify defendant as Boyce. Intending to then effect an arrest of Boyce, Payne, assisted by other officers, forced defendant to the floor and handcuffed him. Immediately thereafter, police discovered a \u201csmall bag\u201d of cocaine on the kitchen floor, \u201cright at that point where [defendant] initially was standing.\u201d A \u201csimilar bag\u201d was found by Detective Burton in defendant\u2019s trouser pocket during a search incidental to arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">While still at the scene, Detective Burton advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and asked, \u201chow long had he been selling crack cocaine?\u201d Defendant responded, \u201ca couple of weeks,\u201d and provided Burton with the address of a residence which he shared with his uncle, Mollow Shears, the individual who had accompanied defendant to the informant\u2019s trailer. Based upon this information, Detective Decker then obtained and executed a search warrant for the Shears\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The ensuing search revealed a large cache of narcotics and handguns, together with \u201cpersonal papers\u201d belonging to defendant, located in one of two bedrooms in the home. Documents related to defendant included his operator\u2019s license, birth certificate, GED diploma and current motor vehicle registra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>tion. Also in this room, Decker found numerous \u201cplastic bags\u201d containing cocaine, plastic bags concealing twenty-eight individual 'packages of marijuana, aggregating 86.6 grams at analysis, a \u201cpager,\u201d $1,517.50 in cash and coin, and several firearms. A \u201cset\u201d of scales was found in the kitchen area of the home. Additionally, a pistol \u201cbox\u201d was discovered in the bedroom bearing the make, model and serial number of a firearm discovered in the car which brought defendant to the informant\u2019s trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">THE SEARCH</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Defendant first contends that the trial court erroneously declined to suppress all evidence seized by police, arguing that it resulted from an \u201cillegal\u201d initial arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Upon appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va. App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991); <em>Reynolds v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 430, 436, 388 S.E.2d 659, 663 (1990). Determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause require <em>de novo </em>review on appeal. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). However, a trial court\u2019s \u201cfindings of historical fact\u201d should be reviewed only for \u201cclear error.\u201d Moreover, \u201cdue weight\u201d must be given to \u201cinferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers,\u201d and to \u201ca trial court\u2019s finding that [an] officer was credible and [that his or her] inference was reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Defendant\u2019s argument implicitly acknowledges the long recognized principle which permits warrantless searches of persons lawfully arrested. However, his assertion that the police lacked probable cause to arrest in this instance ignores the inherent authority of the outstanding felony warrant which generated the police action. Probable cause justifying the arrest of the person named in the warrant was established upon the issuance of that process. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-72. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>While the record does not confirm that Detective Payne actually possessed the warrant, he was, nevertheless, privy to its contents and existence and, therefore, both empowered and duty bound to arrest the named accused, Clyde Boyce. <em>Crowder v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 151, 152-53, 191 S.E.2d 239, 239-40 (1972); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-81. The ruse employed by the detectives to lure Boyce to the trailer would not have tainted his arrest pursuant to the existing warrant. <em>See Limonja v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 532, 538-39, 383 S.E.2d 476, 480 (1989) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>495 U.S. 905, 110 S.Ct. 1925, 109 L.Ed.2d 288 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">These principles are equally controlling \u201c[i]f the police have a valid arrest warrant for one person and they reasonably and in good faith arrest another.\u201d <em>United States v. McEachem, </em>675 F.2d 618, 621 (4th Cir.1982) (citing <em>Hill v. California, </em>401 U.S. 797, 802-04, 91 S.Ct. 1106, 1110-11, 28 L.Ed.2d 484 (1971)); <em>see also </em>3 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search &amp; Seizure </em>\u00a7 5.1(g), at 56-57 (3d ed. 1996). Thus, given probable cause to arrest Boyce pursuant to the warrant, \u201cthe only issue is whether [Detective Payne\u2019s] mistaken belief that [Boyce] and [defendant] were one and the same person was reasonable and in good faith.\u201d <em>McEachem, </em>675 F.2d at 621; <em>see also Hill, </em>401 U.S. at 802-04, 91 S.Ct. at 1110-11; <em>DeChene v. Smallwood, </em>226 Va. 475, 479, 311 S.E.2d 749, 751, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 857, 105 S.Ct. 184, 83 L.Ed.2d 118 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">It is uncontroverted that the detectives were vested with the authority of the warrant for Boyce when defendant was arrested at the informant\u2019s trailer. The informer was instructed to telephone Boyce, an individual known to police as a drug dealer reputed for quick response to solicitations. Within minutes after the informer advised the detectives that he had contacted Boyce as directed, defendant arrived and entered the trailer. The detectives had previously seen neither defendant nor Boyce, but defendant\u2019s appearance was consistent with Boyce\u2019s \u201cgeneral description,\u201d and his comments were suggestive of an impending narcotics transaction. Under such circumstances, the police clearly acted both in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>faith and reasonably in arresting defendant, as Boyce, albeit in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">DOUBLE JEOPARDY</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Defendant next argues that the cocaine possessed at the informant\u2019s trailer and at his residence constituted a single offense, a \u201clong transaction of illegal possession,\u201d multiple prosecutions for which violated the double jeopardy proscriptions of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\"><em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 165, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2225, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977); <em>see </em>U.S. Const. amend. V; Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8; <em>Sullivan v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 844, 846, 433 S.E.2d 508, 509-10 (1993) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201cThe issue of multiple punishments actually arises in two contexts. First, two or more statutes ... proscribe ... particular ... conduct as criminal offenses. Second, ... conduct may constitute more than one violation of a single criminal proscription.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 590, 593, 347 S.E.2d 152, 154 (1986) (citations omitted). Here, defendant asserts that he was unconstitutionally punished by convictions on two indictments arising from a single criminal enterprise, the possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u201cWhen considering multiple punishments for a single transaction, the controlling factor is legislative intent.\u201d <em>Kelsoe v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 197, 199, 308 S.E.2d 104, 104 (1983). The legislature \u201cmay determine the appropriate \u2018unit of prosecution\u2019 and set the penalty for separate violations.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>Jordan, </em>2 Va.App. at 594, 347 S.E.2d at 154. Therefore, although multiple offenses may be the \u201csame,\u201d an accused may be subjected to legislatively \u201cauthorized cumulative punishments.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>It is judicial punishment in excess of legislative intent which offends the double jeopardy clause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-248, the General Assembly declared it \u201cunlawful for any person to ... sell, ... or possess with intent to ... sell ... a controlled substance.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A). Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) prescribes the punishment for \u201c[a]ny person who violates this section with respect to a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The gravamen of the offense is clearly possession of the specified drug with the requisite intent. Thus, each distinguishable incident of the offending conduct constitutes a \u201cunit of prosecution\u201d for violation of the statute. <em>See, e.g., Kelsoe, </em>226 Va. at 198-99, 308 S.E.2d at 104 (defendant convicted of three violations for simultaneously brandishing the same firearm at three persons); <em>Sullivan, </em>16 Va.App. at 847-48, 433 S.E.2d at 510-11 (defendant convicted of two robberies, and related firearm offenses, from two clerks at the same video store); <em>Jordan, </em>2 Va.App. at 597, 347 S.E.2d at 156 (defendant convicted of two robberies, and related firearm offenses, from employees of a single restaurant).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Here, defendant does not dispute on appeal that he actually possessed cocaine at the informant\u2019s trailer for purposes of immediate distribution to a prospective buyer. Manifestly, such conduct constitutes a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248 separate from the constructive possession of like drugs elsewhere, despite a similar criminal purpose. Hence, defendant committed two distinct violations of a single criminal proscription and was appropriately subject to attendant cumulative punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>SUFFICIENCY</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Lastly, defendant asserts that the evidence failed to establish the requisite intent to distribute the marijuana. In reviewing this challenge to the conviction, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Defendant\u2019s conviction required the Commonwealth to prove that he \u201c \u2018intentionally and consciously possessed\u2019 [marijuana], either actually or constructively, with knowledge of its nature and character, together with the intent to distribute it.\u201d <em>Wilkins v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 293, 298, 443 S.E.2d 440, 444 (1994) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Josephs v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 87, 99-102, 390 S.E.2d 491, 497-99 (1990) <em>(en </em>banc)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">[Possession of a controlled substance may be actual or constructive. \u201cTo support a conviction based upon constructive possession, \u2018the Commonwealth must point to evidence of acts, statements, or conduct of the accused or other facts or circumstances which ... [prove] that the defendant was aware of both the presence and character of the substance and that it was subject to his dominion and control.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7qA\"><em>McGee v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 317, 322, 357 S.E.2d 738, 740 (1987) (citations omitted). \u201cBecause direct proof of [the] intent [to distribute] is often impossible, it must be shown by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 524, 371 S.E.2d 156, 165 (1988). Circumstances relevant to proof of an intent to distribute include the \u201cquantity of drugs and cash possessed, the method of packaging,\u201d <em>Poindexter v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 730, 735, 432 S.E.2d 527, 530 (1993), and the presence of paraphernalia related to distribution. <em>Hambury v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 435, 438, 350 S.E.2d 524, 525 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Here, a search of defendant\u2019s residence disclosed no less than 86.6 grams of marijuana, packaged in twenty-eight individual plastic bags, in a bedroom of defendant\u2019s residence together with several documents, important and personal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>defendant, and substantial cash and firearms. Elsewhere in the residence, police discovered scales. Significantly, defendant admitted to Detective Burton that he was then actively involved in the narcotics trade. Such evidence, considered with other facts and the circumstances established in the record, clearly supports the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant constructively possessed the marijuana found in his bedroom with the intent to distribute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-8\">.
