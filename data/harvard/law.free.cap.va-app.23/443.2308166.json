We hold that it does not, and we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">On February 2, 1995, Joe Edgar Wilson was stopped and charged with driving on a suspended or revoked license in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-301. On the same day, his vehicle was impounded administratively for thirty days pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-301.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 8 Wilson received written notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the impoundment, and he petitioned the general district court for review on February 16. The next day a hearing was held and Wilson\u2019s petition to rescind the impoundment was denied. At the end of the administrative impoundment period, Wilson was required to pay approximately $350 in removal and storage costs to the approved private towing company in order to release his vehicle. A date was set for trial on the underlying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Wilson filed a plea of former jeopardy, but the general district court on March 16, 1995, overruled the plea and convicted Wilson of driving on a suspended license. Wilson appealed to the circuit court, renewing his plea of former jeopardy. He argued that the administrative impoundment of his vehicle constituted punishment in a separate proceeding for the same offense, and that therefore a second punishment would place him twice in jeopardy. On June 15, 1995, after a hearing on the issue, the judge overruled his plea. At a trial on June 21, 1995, Wilson was convicted of driving on a suspended license and sentenced to six months in jail and a $200 fine. His license was also revoked for one year. He appeals his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The United States Constitution provides that no person \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. \u201cThat is, the Double Jeopardy Clause \u2018prohibits merely punishing twice or attempting a second time to punish criminally, for the same offence.\u2019\u201d <em>Witte v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014,\u2014, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 2204, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995) (quoting <em>Helvering v. Mitchell, </em>303 U.S. 391, 399, 58 S.Ct. 630, 633, 82 L.Ed. 917 (1938)). Wilson contends that the administrative impoundment of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>vehicle constituted punishment, placing him in jeopardy for the purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause so as to prohibit the second criminal sanction against him for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The Double Jeopardy Clause applies only if an action imposes punishment. Until recently, most courts determined whether a sanction constituted \u201cpunishment\u201d by extracting a general definition of punishment from various Supreme Court cases. The Supreme Court in these cases discussed whether particular sanctions are punishment for the purposes of a particular constitutional protection. <em>See Department of Revenue v. Kurth Ranch, </em>511 U.S. 767, 114 S.Ct. 1937, 128 L.Ed.2d 767 (1994) (marijuana tax in context of Double Jeopardy); <em>Austin v. United States, </em>509 U.S. 602, 113 S.Ct. 2801, 125 L.Ed.2d 488 (1993) (civil forfeiture in context of Excessive Fines Clause of Eighth Amendment); <em>United States v. Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989) (civil fine in context of double jeopardy). State and federal courts determined whether a sanction constituted punishment only after studying all of the cases and applying elements of each to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Our own recent double jeopardy case anent administrative license suspensions, <em>Tench v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 200, 462 S.E.2d 922 (1995), undertook a similar analysis. <em>Tench </em>examined the goals of the sanction and whether they were remedial or punitive, a \u201cstandard\u201d derived from <em>Halper </em>and developed in successive cases. While we recognized that <em>Austin </em>did not concern double jeopardy and did not control, we ultimately rested our decision on teachings from both <em>Halper </em>and <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>holding that \u201cthe automatic suspension of Tench\u2019s operator\u2019s license had a remedial purpose and thus did not constitute punishment under the standard established in <em>Halper </em>and reaffirmed in <em>Kurth Ranch.\u201d Id. </em>at 208, 462 S.E.2d at 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">We were not alone in this understanding. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit looked to <em>Kurth Ranch, Austm, </em>and <em>Halper </em>for a definition of punishment in <em>United States v. $105,089.23, </em>33 F.3d 1210 (9th Cir.1994). The Ninth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>believed that a reading of those cases as a whole formulated \u201ca new test for determining whether a nominally civil sanction constitutes \u2018punishment\u2019 for double jeopardy purposes.\u201d <em>$4,05,-089.23, </em>33 F.3d at 1218-19. The Sixth Circuit adopted a similar rationale in <em>United States v. Ursery, </em>59 F.3d 568 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The Supreme Court reversed both decisions. <em>United States v. Ursery, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996). The Court criticized the Courts of Appeals for \u201cmisreading\u201d <em>Halper, Austin, </em>and <em>Kurth Ranch. Ursery, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 116 S.Ct. at 2144. <em>Ursery </em>effectively limited the discussions of \u201cpunishment\u201d outlined in each of those three cases \u201cto the specific contexts of each particular case ... and often inapplicable to other contexts.\u201d <em>Gress v. Board of Parole, </em>143 Or.App. 7, 15, 924 P.2d 329, 333 (1996) (explaining application of <em>Ursery </em>to sex offender registrations).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\"><em>Halper </em>involved a civil penalty. The rule announced in <em>Halper </em>declared that when a civil penalty \u201cbears no rational relationship to the goal of compensating the Government for its loss, but rather appears to qualify as \u2018punishment\u2019 in the plain meaning of the word,\u201d then a court must compute the government\u2019s damages to determine if the penalty was excessive. <em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. at 449-50, 109 S.Ct. at 1902. If the penalty is \u201cso extreme and so divorced from the Government\u2019s damages,\u201d then it may constitute punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 442, 109 S.Ct. at 1898. The Court in <em>Ursery </em>limited this rule to the context of this type of sanction because of the unique characteristics of a fixed-penalty provision. <em>Ursery </em>also limited the holding in <em>Austin, </em>reiterating that \u201c[t]he holding in <em>Austin </em>was limited to the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, and we decline to import the analysis of <em>Austin </em>into our double jeopardy jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 116 S.Ct. at 2147. Finally, <em>Kurth Ranch </em>concerned a tax statute, which \u201cserve[s] a purpose quite different from civil penalties, and <em>Halper\u2019s </em>method of determining whether the exaction was remedial or punitive \u2018simply does not work in the case of a tax statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>511 U.S. at\u2014, 114 S.Ct. at 1948 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>(quoting <em>id. </em>at \u2014, 114 S.Ct. at 1950 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting)); <em>see Ursery, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 116 S.Ct. at 2144.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Unfortunately, not all civil sanctions fit neatly into the categories of monetary civil fines, civil forfeitures, or tax statutes. Other sanctions imposed may include sex offender registration, administrative license suspensions, and suspensions from program participation. The administrative vehicle impoundment in the instant case lies within this miscellaneous group.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">A temporary impoundment of a vehicle is not a forfeiture, although it has characteristics of a forfeiture. Being temporarily deprived of one\u2019s vehicle until one pays a fee to release it also resembles a civil penalty. As such, at first glance neither <em>Halper </em>nor <em>Ursery </em>clearly controls this issue.2</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Justice Stevens, dissenting in <em>Ursery, </em>contended that <em>Hal-per </em>announced a \u201cgeneral rule for applying the Double Jeopardy Clause to civil proceedings.\u201d <em>Ursery, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 116 S.Ct. at 2156 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Attractive as that approach may be, the majority explicitly rejected it. <em>Id. </em>at -n. 2, 116 S.Ct. at 2145 n. 2. The Court objected to an application of <em>Halper </em>in a forfeiture context on two main grounds: (1) <em>Halper </em>involved an <em>in personam, </em>proceeding rather than an <em>in rem </em>proceeding; and (2) the goals of a fixed-penalty provision differed materially from the goals of a forfeiture. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 116 S.Ct. at 2144.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">\u201cThe narrow focus of <em>Halper </em>followed from the distinction that we have drawn historically between civil forfeiture and civil penalties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A civil penalty is an <em>in personam </em>proceeding; a civil forfeiture is an action <em>in rem. </em>In the former the wrongdoer is punished; in the latter the property is proceeded against, found guilty, and condemned. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 116 S.Ct. at 2145 (citing <em>Various Items of Personal Property v. United States, </em>282 U.S. 577, 580-81, 51 S.Ct. 282, 283-84, 75 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>558 (1931)). Thus, the wrongdoer is not subject to a second <em>in personam </em>penalty, and his constitutional rights are not offended. \u201c[T]he Double Jeopardy Clause applies only to <em>in person-am </em>punishments of the wrongdoer and not <em>in rem </em>forfeitures----\u201d <em>Ursery, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 116 S.Ct. at 2150 (Kennedy, J., concurring); <em>see Various Items, </em>282 U.S. at 581, 51 S.Ct. at 283-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The Court in <em>Ursery </em>also noted that the purposes of the sanction in <em>Halper </em>differed from those in <em>Ursery. Halper </em>involved a fixed-monetary penalty. \u201cCivil penalties are designed as a rough form of \u2018liquidated damages\u2019 for the harms suffered by the Government as a result of a defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Ursery, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 116 S.Ct. at 2145; <em>see Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 148, 153-54, 76 S.Ct. 219, 222-23, 100 L.Ed. 149 (1956). Whether the penalty becomes so extreme or so divorced from the nonpunitive goals of the sanction so as to constitute \u201cpunishment\u201d may be determined by balancing the government\u2019s harm against the civil penalty. <em>Ursery, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 116 S.Ct. at 2145. Because the fixed-monetary penalty must be weighed against the government\u2019s losses, those losses must be quantified. This methodology does not transfer easily to a civil forfeiture analysis. <em>Ursery, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 116 S.Ct. at 2145. \u201c[I]t is virtually impossible to quantify, even approximately, the non-punitive purposes served by a particular civil forfeiture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Without the ability to quantify the government\u2019s losses, as in the case of a civil penalty, the <em>Halper </em>approach founders.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">We refuse to apply <em>Halper </em>in the case before us for the same reasons. The administrative impoundment of Wilson\u2019s vehicle was an <em>in rem </em>proceeding, not an <em>in personam </em>proceeding. \u201cActions <em>in personam </em>and actions <em>in rem </em>differ in that the former are directed against specific persons and seek personal judgments, while the latter are directed against the thing or property or status of a person and seek judgments with respect thereto as against the world.\u201d <em>O\u2019Hara v. The Pittston Co., </em>186 Va. 325, 336, 42 S.E.2d 269, 275 (1947) (quoting 1 C.J.S. <em>Actions </em>\u00a7 52). A proceeding against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>property and not the owner is <em>\u201cin rem </em>wholly and not <em>in personam. </em>It is not a criminal proceeding. It is a civil case.\u201d <em>Quidley v. Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 1029, 1036, 59 S.E.2d 52, 56 (1950). Wilson was personally placed in jeopardy and punished only once: at his trial for the offense of driving without a valid license. When his vehicle was administratively impounded, it was the subject of the action, not the driver. From the outset, the <em>in rem </em>character of the impoundment distinguishes this sanction from that in <em>Halper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><em>Halper\u2019s </em>balancing also has no place in this case. Wilson\u2019s vehicle was not impounded to compensate the government for harms done, but rather to prevent Wilson from violating the law again and to ensure the safety of the Commonwealth\u2019s citizens. We cannot quantify the value of these nonpunitive purposes, nor, for that matter, can we quantify the value of Wilson\u2019s deprivation of property for thirty days. Thus, a balancing is impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The Louisiana Court of Appeals encountered this same issue with an administrative license suspension and came to the same conclusion: \u201cIn the context of this case, <em>Halper </em>does not apply. It would be impossible to apply a methodology which involves an accounting of the Government\u2019s damages and costs to determine whether the suspension of one\u2019s driving privileges is remedial or punitive.\u201d <em>State v. Sonnier, </em>679 So.2d 1011, 1012 (La.Ct.App.1996); <em>accord Ex parte Avilez, </em>929 S.W.2d 677 (Tex.Ct.App.1996). Likewise, cases of disbarment and suspensions from participation in government programs have applied <em>Ursery\u2019s </em>analysis. <em>See United States v. Glymph, </em>96 F.3d 722 (4th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Borjesson, </em>92 F.3d 954 (9th Cir.1996). \u201cIn the case of ... a non-monetary sanction, quantification is out of the question. <em>Ursery, </em>not <em>Halper, </em>must guide us.\u201d <em>Borjesson, </em>92 F.3d at 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Following the same rationale that led the Supreme Court to the traditional two-part test in <em>United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. 354, 104 S.Ct. 1099, 79 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>361 (1984), and its forebears, we undertake our Double Jeopardy analysis in the manner of Ursery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\"><em>Ursery </em>used a two-part test taken from <em>89 Firearms. </em>First, the court must decide whether the legislature intended the sanction to be criminal or civil. Secondly, even if the legislature intended the sanction to be civil, the court must examine whether the sanction is \u201cso punitive in form and effect as to render [it] criminal despite [the legislature\u2019s] intent to the contrary.\u201d <em>Ursery, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 116 S.Ct. at 2148.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">The General Assembly doubtless intended this to be a civil proceeding. As noted above, the impoundment of Wilson\u2019s vehicle was an <em>in rem </em>proceeding. \u201c[A]ctions <em>in rem </em>have traditionally been viewed as civil proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 116 S.Ct. at 2147 (quoting <em>89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. at 363, 104 S.Ct. at 1105). The action targets the vehicle, not the driver; criminal proceedings are not involved at this stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">If the object of the action was not sufficient to classify the sanction as civil, other indications exist that the administrative impoundment was created as a civil proceeding. The provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>sions of the section allow the impoundment of the vehicle through a summary administrative procedure. The arresting officer, not a judge, impounds the vehicle. The vehicle is automatically released after thirty days if the owner does not intervene. Creation of these \u201cdistinctly civil procedures\u201d signals a clear intent for the impoundment to be civil rather than criminal. <em>Id. </em>at -, 116 S.Ct. at 2148; <em>cf. Simmons v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 118, 475 S.E.2d 806 (1996) (holding that in an administrative license suspension, \u201c[w]hat is involved is neither more nor less than the term administrative suspension implies, an administrative act, not a judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction\u201d); <em>Nicely v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 327, 477 S.E.2d 11 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The \u201cinnocent owner\u201d exceptions under Code \u00a7 46.2-301.1(B) do not affect the result without more indication of an intent to punish. <em>See Ursery, </em>\u2014U.S. at\u2014, 116 S.Ct. at 2149. Similarly, the fact that the impoundment was tied to criminal activity holds no import. <em>See id.; 89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. at 365-66, 104 S.Ct. at 1106-07. \u201cBy itself, the fact that a forfeiture statute has some connection to a criminal violation is far from the \u2018clearest proof necessary to show that a proceeding is criminal.\u201d Ursery,\u2014U.S. at\u2014, 116 S.Ct. at 2149. Additionally, Code \u00a7 46.2-301.1 does not require the Commonwealth to prove <em>scienter </em>before impounding the vehicle, another characteristic of a civil proceeding. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">Under the <em>Ursery </em>framework we next inquire into the actual effect of the sanction. A civil forfeiture may yet be subject to the double jeopardy prohibition if the \u201cclearest proof\u2019 indicates that the forfeiture is \u201cso punitive either in form or effect\u201d as to equate to a criminal proceeding. <em>89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. at 365, 104 S.Ct. at 1106; <em>United States v. Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 248, 100 S.Ct. 2636, 2641, 65 L.Ed.2d 742 (1980); <em>see Flemming v. Nestor, </em>363 U.S. 603, 617, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 1376, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960). This standard allows certain punitive effects, as long as important nonpunitive goals are served. <em>Ursery, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 116 S.Ct. at 2148.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Nonpunitive goals in the instant case are evident. Wilson had lost his privilege to drive before this incident; he drove nevertheless. Relieving him of his vehicle for thirty days served numerous remedial purposes. Without his vehicle he cannot engage in an activity that he was legally barred from undertaking. Thirty days without the temptation to drive may force Wilson to change his antisocial lifestyle, which he was required to do the first time his license was suspended and which he apparently did not do. The remedial purposes of the administrative impoundment far outweigh any incidental punitive effects that may be felt by the defendant. <em>Cf. Brame v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 122, 476 S.E.2d 177 (1996) (reaching the same conclusion in the case of an administrative license suspension). Thus, the sanction is not \u201cso punitive\u201d as to render it criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">For the reasons stated, we hold that the administrative impoundment of Wilson\u2019s vehicle did not place him in jeopardy for the purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Accordingly, we affirm his subsequent conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-11\">. Code \u00a7 46.2-301.1 became effective July 1, 1994. It authorizes the administrative impoundment of a motor vehicle being driven by any person who (i) has had his license suspended or revoked for driving while intoxicated or (ii) has been adjudged as an habitual offender based in whole or in part on an alcohol-related offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">Upon arrest of such a person driving after his privilege to drive has been suspended or revoked, the arresting law-enforcement officer impounds the vehicle for thirty days. \u00a7 46.2-301.1(A). The statute requires notice of the impoundment to be served on the arrested person, and that person may petition the general district court for review of the impoundment. \u00a7 46.2-301.1(A-C). The general district court must give this matter precedence over all other matters on the docket. If the person proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the arresting officer did not have probable cause to issue the warrant, the court shall rescind the impoundment. \u00a7 46.2-301.1(B). Likewise, any dismissal or acquittal of the underlying charge automatically rescinds the impound<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ment. \u00a7 46.2-301.1(D). In case of rescission, the Commonwealth must pay or reimburse the person for reasonable costs of the impoundment. Otherwise, the costs of impoundment, including removal and storage expenses, must be paid by the offender prior to the vehicle\u2019s release. \u00a7 46.2-301.1(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b498-13\">. <em>Ursery </em>handed down a rule for civil forfeitures only. <em>See Deutschendorf v. People, </em>920 P.2d 53, 59 (Colo.1996) (finding <em>Ursery </em>limited to the civil forfeiture context); <em>People v. Ratliff, </em>282 Ill.App.3d 707, 218 Ill.Dec. 391, 395, 669 N.E.2d 122, 126 (1996) (same). An administrative vehicle impoundment is not a forfeiture, yet we are confident that the test outlined in <em>Ursery </em>imports well into this area. The Court in <em>Ursery </em>stated that it employed the \"two-part test used in <em>89 Firearms.\" </em>Ursery,-U.S. at-, 116 S.Ct. at 2147. This two-part test evolved from a line of Supreme Court cases concerning both civil fines and civil forfeitures. <em>Id. </em>at-, 116 S.Ct. at 2151 (Kennedy, J., concunring). <em>89 Firearms </em>cites without distinction cases about civil fines for tax evasion, <em>Helvering v. Mitchell, </em>303 U.S. 391, 58 S.Ct. 630, 82 L.Ed. 917 (1938), civil penalties in a self-incrimination context, <em>United States v. Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 100 S.Ct. 2636, 65 L.Ed.2d 742 (1980), and forfeiture of citizenship in a Sixth Amendment context, <em>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963). <em>89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. at 362-65, 104 S.Ct. at 1104-06.
