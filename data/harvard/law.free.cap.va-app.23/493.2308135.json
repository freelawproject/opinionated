Strawbridge, a professional engineer, and the State Building Code Technical Review Board appeal a circuit judge\u2019s decision reversing a ruling of the Review Board and referring the case back to the Chesterfield County Board of Building Code Appeals for a ruling on the merits. We must decide: (1) Whether Chesterfield County had standing to appeal the decision of the Review Board to the circuit court; (2) whether Strawbridge had standing to appeal the decision of the County Board of Appeals to the Review Board; (3) whether the Review Board had jurisdiction; and (4) whether the Review Board\u2019s ruling was erroneous. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the circuit judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Tomac Corporation, a builder, hired Strawbridge to inspect concrete pours at a residential construction project in Chesterfield County. The inspection was required by the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code (\u201cUSBC\u201d) and had to be made on-site when concrete was poured for a building\u2019s foundation. An inspector is required to examine the concrete\u2019s strength and customarily uses a tool known as a \u201cslump cone\u201d for that measurement. Although these inspections are ordinarily conducted by Chesterfield County employees, the County also accepts inspections by private engineers such as Straw-bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">While traveling to the site, Strawbridge\u2019s vehicle became disabled. The builder sent a truck to bring Strawbridge to the site. When Strawbridge arrived at the site, the trucks were ready to pour concrete. However, Strawbridge discovered that he had inadvertently left his slump cone in his vehicle. To prevent further delay, Strawbridge conducted a visual slump test. During the test, William Dupler, a County building official, arrived at the site and noticed that Strawbridge was not using a slump cone. He asked Strawbridge to conduct the tests with a slump cone. Strawbridge obtained his slump cone from his vehicle and continued testing the concrete with the slump cone.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Upon receiving Strawbridge\u2019s inspection report, Dupler rejected the tests. He informed Strawbridge in writing that he would not accept the report and would no longer accept any concrete pour inspections from Strawbridge. Dupler also required Tomac to obtain further tests using an alternative method. Those tests confirmed Strawbridge\u2019s report that the concrete met the County\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Strawbridge appealed Dupler\u2019s decision to the County Board of Appeals and requested that the County Board of Appeals reverse Dupler\u2019s decision to bar him from conducting inspections. Ruling that the appeal was not authorized by the USBC, the County Board of Appeals dismissed the case. Strawbridge appealed that decision to the Review Board. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Review Board directed Strawbridge to submit a statement of facts demonstrating that his case was governed by the USBC and it also ordered the County to submit a reply to Straw-bridge\u2019s statement. Based upon the submissions, the Review Board decided that it had jurisdiction and conducted an evidentiary hearing. The Review Board then ruled \u201cthat the building official acted arbitrarily under Section 107.1 of the USBC when he rejected the technical data submitted by Mr. Strawbridge, and that the building official may not summarily reject any future engineering reports made by Mr. Straw-bridge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Pursuant to the Administrative Process Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), Code \u00a7 9-6.14:1, the County appealed to the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County. The County alleged that (1) the Review Board incorrectly decided that it had jurisdiction to review the inspection decision, (2) the Review Board erred in ruling on the merits of the appeal and should have remanded the case to the County Board of Appeals, and (3) the Review Board incorrectly reversed the inspection decision. Strawbridge and the Review Board filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the County lacked standing to bring the action in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The circuit court judge denied the motion to dismiss, heard the appeal, and ruled that the Review Board had jurisdiction solely to determine whether the County Board of Appeals should have dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Thus, the judge found that the Review Board should not have decided the merits of the appeal and remanded the case to the Review Board with instructions that the County Board of Appeals should decide the merits of the case. Strawbridge and the Review Board appealed to this Court from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The General Assembly statutorily established the framework for the adoption and enforcement of the USBC. The Code directs the Board of Housing and Community Develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ment, a state agency, \u201cto adopt and promulgate a Uniform Statewide Building Code [USBC].\u201d Code \u00a7 36-98. Except as provided by the building code statutes, the USBC \u201cshall supersede the building codes and regulations of the counties, municipalities and other political subdivisions and state agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to this mandate, the Board of Housing and Community Development adopted a set of regulations entitled the \u201cVirginia Uniform Statewide Building Code\u201d [USBC].</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The General Assembly specified that \u201c[e]nforcement of the [USBC] shall be the responsibility of the local building department\u201d and that each local building department must establish a local board of Building Code appeals. Code \u00a7 36-105. \u201cAppeals from the local building department concerning application of the [USBC] ... shall first lie to the local board of Building Code appeals.\u201d Code \u00a7 36-105. The General Assembly also established the Review Board and gave it \u201cthe power and duty to hear all appeals from decisions [of the local board of Building Code appeals] arising under application of the Building Code.\u201d Code \u00a7 36-114. The USBC contains regulations consistent with the building code statutes. <em>See </em>USBC \u00a7\u00a7 102,103, and 116 (formerly \u00a7\u00a7 116 and 117).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The Review Board and Strawbridge contend that the County did not have standing to appeal the Review Board\u2019s decision to the circuit court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Proceedings of the Review Board are governed by the APA. Code \u00a7 36-114. The APA states that \u201c[a]ny ... party aggrieved by and claiming unlawfulness of a case decision ... shall have a right to the direct review [of the decision] by an appropriate and timely court action.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16(A). Thus, the County may appeal if (1) the Review Board\u2019s decision constitutes a \u201ccase decision,\u201d (2) the County was a named party in the Review Board proceeding, and (3) the County was aggrieved by the agency ruling. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The Review Board\u2019s decision was a \u201ccase decision\u201d because it was an \u201cagency proceeding or determination that ... a named party ... either is, [or] is not ... in compliance with any existing requirement for obtaining or retaining a ... right or benefit.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4(D) (defining \u201ccase decision\u201d). In ruling that the \u201cbuilding official acted arbitrarily under Section 107.1 of the USBC,\u201d the Review Board decided that Dupler, the County\u2019s building official, was not in compliance with the USBC, and, therefore, he did not have the right to reject Strawbridge\u2019s reports. In addition, this was a case decision because it included an application of the law to the facts of this particular case. <em>See Kenley v. Newport News Gen. &amp; Non-Sectarian Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>227 Va. 39, 45, 314 S.E.2d 52, 55 (1984) (holding that a letter written by the State Health Commissioner was a case decision because the Commissioner \u201capplied the rules and regulations to the facts\u201d gathered at a previous meeting).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The County was a named party in the Review Board\u2019s proceeding because the Review Board\u2019s decision was styled, <em>Randall A. Strawbridge, P.E. v. County of Chesterfield. </em>More importantly, the record establishes that the County participated throughout the Review Board\u2019s proceedings. The Review Board directed the County to respond to Strawbridge\u2019s statement of facts. The County attorney represented the County in the proceeding, presented an opening statement, and had the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses. Indeed, Straw-bridge appealed the case to the Review Board because of the action of officials acting on behalf of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Finally, the County was \u201caggrieved\u201d by the ruling. \u201c \u2018The word \u201caggrieved\u201d in a statute ... refers to a substantial grievance, a denial of some personal or property right, ... or the imposition upon a party of a burden or obligation.\u2019 \u201d <em>D'Alessio v. Lukhard, </em>5 Va.App. 404, 408, 363 S.E.2d 715, 718 (1988) (citations omitted). The Review Board\u2019s decision denied the County the right to \u201csummarily reject any future engineering reports made by ... Strawbridge.\u201d Before this ruling, the County, by its appointed official, adopted a policy to reject any reports submitted by Strawbridge. Obviously, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the Review Board\u2019s decision forced the County to change its policy. By ordering the County to consider Strawbridge\u2019s reports, the Review Board imposed an obligation on the County and, thus, the County was aggrieved. Therefore, we find that the County met the requirements to appeal the Review Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The County argues that Strawbridge did not have standing to appeal Dupler\u2019s decision. However, the regulations provide as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The owner of a building, the owner\u2019s agent, or any other person, firm or corporation directly involved in the design and/or construction of a building or structure may appeal to the local Building Code Board of Appeals within 90 calendar days from a decision of the building official when it is claimed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">1. The building official has refused to grant a modification which complies with the intent of the provisions of the USBC; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">2. The true intent of the USBC has been incorrectly interpreted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">3. The provisions of the USBC do not fully apply; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">4. The use of a form of construction that is equal to or better than that specified in the USBC has been denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">\u00a7 116.7 (currently \u00a7 116.5, as amended).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">The County claims that Strawbridge cannot be classified as an \u201cowner of a building, the owner\u2019s agent, or any other person, firm or corporation directly involved in the design and/or construction of a building or structure.\u201d That argument lacks merit because the inspections were an integral part of the construction process. The evidence proved that the builder requested Strawbridge to perform the inspection and paid for his services. In addition, Strawbridge\u2019s inspection was a critical prerequisite to the construction of the home because the USBC requires the inspection of concrete pours. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Strawbridge directly contributed to the construction because without his test the building would not have complied with USBC standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The County also contends that the appeal does not involve the \u201cdesign and/or construction of a building\u201d because Straw-bridge appealed the decision to bar him from future projects and not the rejection of his inspection report. That contention is not supported by the record. As evidenced by the Review Board\u2019s ruling, Strawbridge appealed both the rejection of the specific inspection report and the rejection of any future reports. Furthermore, the County ignores the substance of Dupler\u2019s action. In his letter to Strawbridge, Dupler rejected the inspection report and also refused to accept any further concrete inspection reports. These decisions were intertwined.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Strawbridge\u2019s initial letter to the County Board of Appeals properly raised the issue and stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">I am writing to request a review and reversal of the Building Official\u2019s decision to stop my firm from making concrete pour inspections for house footings in Chesterfield County. His decision was based on circumstances which occurred in connection with [my inspection of a residence on May 11,1993].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The propriety of Dupler\u2019s decision to bar Strawbridge from making future inspections turned on the inadequacy of the May 11 report. If Dupler erred in refusing to accept that report, he also erred in using that report as grounds to bar Strawbridge from making future reports. Obviously, the County Board of Appeals was required to examine both of Dupler\u2019s decisions together. We hold, therefore, that Straw-bridge meets the regulation\u2019s requirement of \u201cany other person ... directly involved in the ... construction\u201d and had standing to appeal Dupler\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Strawbridge and the Review Board claim that the circuit court judge erred in ruling that the Review Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>lacked jurisdiction to decide the merits of Strawbridge\u2019s appeal. The Code states that \u201cno appeal to the ... Review Board shall lie prior to a final determination by the local board of Building Code Appeals.\u201d Code \u00a7 36-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">At a hearing on July 20, 1993, the County Board of Appeals voted \u201cthat we do not hear ... Strawbridge\u2019s appeal based upon Sec. 116.7 [\u00a7 116.5 as amended] of the Virginia Uniform Statewide Budding Code.\u201d In addition, the letter from the local board to Strawbridge contained the following language, now required by USBC \u00a7 116.8.1: \u201cUpon receipt of this decision, any person who was a party to the appeal may appeal to the ... Review Board by submitting an application to the State Board____\u201d The County Board of Appeals clearly intended its dismissal to constitute a final and appealable determination. <em>Cf. Marchant &amp; Taylor v. Mathews Co., </em>139 Va. 723, 733, 124 S.E. 420, 423 (1924) (\u201c[T]he order by its very terms is not final.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Furthermore, the County Board of Appeals determination \u201cthat [Strawbridge\u2019s] appeal was not within the confines of ... Sec. 116.0 of the USBC\u201d was the equivalent of a dismissal order and was a final determination of the appeal. <em>See Daniels v. Truck &amp; Equip. Corp., </em>205 Va. 579, 585, 139 S.E.2d 31, 35 (1964) (\u201cA final order is one which disposes of the whole subject, gives all the relief contemplated, ... and leaves nothing to be done in the cause.... \u201d). In deciding not to hear the case, the County Board of Appeals decided to take no further action regarding the case. That ruling was a final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The County cites no authority for its argument that, after the Review Board determined that the County Board of Appeals erred in dismissing Strawbridge\u2019s appeal, the Review Board was required to remand the case to the County Board of Appeals for a ruling on the merits. Neither the Code nor the USBC requires the Review Board to remand in such an instance. We hold, therefore, that the Review Board did not err in conducting a hearing and issuing a ruling on the merits of Strawbridge\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">The County argues that the Review Board erred in ruling that Dupler acted arbitrarily. The principle is well established, however, that in reviewing proceedings governed by the APA, \u201cagency action is presumed valid on review, and the burden rests \u2018upon the party complaining\u2019 to overcome this presumption.\u201d <em>Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., </em>15 Va.App. 271, 277, 422 S.E.2d 608, 611 (1992) (quoting Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17). On review of an agency\u2019s decision, the sole question regarding \u201cfactual issues is whether substantial evidence exists in the agency record to support the agency\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 242, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1988). \u201cThe court may reject the agency\u2019s findings of fact \u2018only if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would necessarily come to a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Atkinson v. Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Comm\u2019n, </em>1 Va.App. 172, 176, 336 S.E.2d 527, 530 (1985) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The evidence at the Review Board hearing created a question of fact\u2014whether the testing performed by Strawbridge met the standards of the USBC\u2014uniquely suited for the Review Board\u2019s expertise. Robert A. Hill and Edward C. Drahos, professional engineers, attested to the accuracy of visual slump tests. Strawbridge testified concerning the events of that day and explained that a professional could measure slump accurately without a slump cone. Thus, the record contained credible testimony that visual inspection by an engineer can be an accurate and effective means 'of testing the slumping of concrete. Furthermore, tests conducted after the concrete pour confirmed the accuracy of Strawbridge\u2019s visual test. The Review Board found that Dupler acted arbitrarily in rejecting Strawbridge\u2019s report and ruled that the County could not summarily reject any future reports filed by Strawbridge. We find no evidence that would justify overturning the Review Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">For these reasons, we reverse the trial judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
