Rizzo, Jr. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Orange County (circuit court) set aside the denial and remanded the matter for further proceedings. The circuit court\u2019s order was the subject of an appeal to this Court, which, in material respects, affirmed the circuit court\u2019s remand. VRS again denied benefits; Rizzo again appealed to the circuit court, which granted Rizzo\u2019s motion for summary judgment and remanded the matter to VRS to calculate and implement the disability benefits. VRS appeals the order granting summary judgment. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">Rizzo applied to VRS for disability benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 51.1-156.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> VRS denied Rizzo\u2019s application. Following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>appeal to the circuit court and subsequent appeal to this Court, the matter was remanded for further proceedings. On remand, the parties attempted to resolve the matter through \u201cinformal\u201d adjudication, conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7 9-6.14:11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:12 (governing \u201cformal\u201d adjudication).<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number><footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>A VRS representative conducted a hearing on April 25, 1995. At that hearing, Rizzo incorporated all of his evidence adduced at the previous administrative hearing and introduced further medical evidence of his psychiatrist, Dr. Robert S. Brown, Jr., to establish his disability. The following day, the agency representative notified VRS that he would forward the transcript of Dr. Brown\u2019s testimony as soon as he received it. VRS received the transcript on May 26 with a request from the agency representative that VRS forward the transcript to its Medical Board. On June 19, VRS forwarded the transcript of Dr. Brown\u2019s testimony to the Medical Board and requested that the Board comment on all the medical evidence. On July 11, VRS received correspondence from the Medical Board, requesting permission to forward the evidence for review by Dr. Merritt Foster. On July 26, VRS consented, requesting the Medical Board to forward the evidence to Dr. Foster. The Medical Board forwarded the evidence to Dr. Foster on August 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">On August 21, 118 days after the hearing, VRS acknowledged receipt of correspondence from Rizzo, notifying VRS that a decision was due. In response, VRS stated that it would ask the Medical Board to advise Doctor Foster to \u201cmove forward.\u201d On September 29, thirty-nine days after it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>received Rizzo\u2019s first notice, VRS received a second notice from Rizzo that a decision was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">On September 27, the Medical Board forwarded a report from Dr. Foster to VRS, noting that the Board adopted Dr. Foster\u2019s report. VRS forwarded the report to the agency representative on October 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">On October 6, Rizzo wrote the agency representative and VRS to inform them that, because more than thirty days had elapsed since he first notified VRS that a decision was due, a decision had been \u201cdeemed\u201d in his favor pursuant to Code \u00a7 9-6.14:ll(D). VRS responded on October 22, arguing that Rizzo misinterpreted the statute and that the \u201cproceeding\u201d envisioned in that section was not concluded until VRS received the Medical Board\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">On November 6, the agency representative recommended that Rizzo be granted benefits. Later that day, however, the VRS issued a decision denying benefits. Rizzo appealed the substance of VRS\u2019s decision to the circuit court and also filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that, pursuant to Code \u00a7 9\u20146.l4:ll(D), a decision had been \u201cdeemed\u201d in his favor because VRS had failed to resolve the matter within the prescribed time limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The court granted Rizzo\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">the General Assembly, by using the phrase \u201cfrom the date of the informal fact-finding proceeding\u201d in the statute intended that the 90 day period begin to run in a case such as the case at bar when the agency representative holds the fact-finding hearing. Otherwise, the agency representative and the agency\u2019s medical board would wholly control the time of decision and the limitation in the statute would be practically meaningless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">On appeal, we must determine the point in the adjudication process from which the time limitations of Code \u00a7 9-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>6.14:11(D) begin to run. We find that the legislature intended those time limitations to begin running at the close of the fact-gathering stage of the adjudication process.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">VRS is established and governed by Chapter 1 of Title 51.1 of the Virginia Code. VRS is an administrative agency subject to Virginia\u2019s Administrative Process Act (VAPA), codified in Chapter 1.1:1 of Title 9. VAPA\u2019s purpose is \u201cto supplement ... basic laws conferring authority on agencies ... [to] decide cases____ [VAPA] does not supersede or repeal additional procedural requirements in such basic laws.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:3. In that light, Article 3 of VAPA governs \u201ccase decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">As with any adjudication, the \u201ccase decision\u201d process imposes two general requirements on the agency personnel responsible for determining a case. The personnel must first oversee the process by which relevant information is gathered. The responsible person or persons must then formulate and render a determination based on that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Article 3 provides two mechanisms by which an agency gathers the factual information necessary to decide a case. In one instance, agencies \u201cascertain the fact basis for their decisions of cases through informal conference or consultation proceedings.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:ll(A). The statute refers to this type of fact-gathering as an \u201cinformal fact-finding proceeding,\u201d <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:ll(D),(E), which leads to the rendering of an \u201cinformal fact-finding decision.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:ll(C). In the other instance, the \u201cformal proceeding,\u201d agencies \u201cafford opportunity for the formal taking of evidence upon relevant fact issues.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:12(A),(G),(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Once the agency has completed its fact-gathering responsibility, it then renders a decision. The mechanics of the latter responsibility depend, in part, on whether a hearing officer, as defined in Article 3.1, presides over the \u201ccase decision proceeding.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.14:ll(D),(E), 9-6.14:12(G),(H), 9-6.14:14.1.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Where a hearing officer presides over a case decision proceeding, whether informal or formal, the hearing officer typically recommends findings and a decision to the agency. Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.14:ll(E), 9-6.14:12(0,(D),(E),(H). In such cases, after receipt of the recommendation, the agency must render a decision. Where no hearing officer presides over a case decision proceeding, the intermediate, recommendation stage is eliminated, and decision-making responsibility falls directly to the \u201cboard, commission, or agency personnel responsible for rendering a decision.\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.14:ll(D), 9-6.14:12(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">We find a distinction between the agency\u2019s responsibility for fad&gt;gathering, whether accomplished informally or formally, and its responsibility for rendering a decision based on the facts it gathers. In short, the fact-gathering stage, whether it is conducted informally or formally, provides the basis for which the case will be decided.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">VAPA prescribes the time by which an agency must render a decision. Where the case involves no hearing officer, the agency must render a decision within ninety days from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>date of the case decision proceeding, whether it be an informal conference or consultation proceeding or a formal evidentiaryproceeding. Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.14:ll(D), 9-6.14:12(G). The statute provides an exception where the agency representative responsible for rendering a decision becomes incapacitated. In such cases, the time limit is reset and commences from the date that new agency personnel are assigned or a new proceeding is conducted. Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.14:ll(F), 9-6.14:12(1). Where, by contrast, a hearing officer presides over the fact-gathering, the hearing officer must make a recommendation within ninety days of the date of the case decision proceeding, unless good cause is shown for the delay. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:14.1(D). From that point, the agency has thirty days, without exception, to render a decision. Code \u00a7\u00a7 9\u2014 6.14:11(E), 9-6.14:12(H). We find these time limitations to govern the agency\u2019s decision-rendering responsibility. They do not address the fact-gathering role of the agency but, instead, begin to run/rom the date .the fact-finding proceeding is completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Article 3, providing general rules for agency adjudications, does not, and could not, address the scope of the fact-gathering proceeding in each case. Rather, such a determination will depend on the nature of the case, the case record, and the basic law governing the agency. While a one-day hearing, whether informal or formal, may be all that is needed to gather the relevant factual information, a case may require further steps. Indeed, the Revisers\u2019 Note to Code \u00a7 9-6.14:11 states that in addition to conferences or consultations, \u201c[t]o the extent that basic laws permit, agencies may also proceed on the basis of inspections, tests, or elections, followed by such conference-consultation procedure as the case issues may require.\u201d Thus, contrary to the finding of the trial court, we find that the legislature clearly intended that the fact-finding process could encompass more than a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">In the present case, VRS was not authorized to render a decision until it had received the report of the Medical Board pursuant to Code \u00a7 51.1-156, upon which Rizzo based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Ms application. TMs step m the process was of a factgathermg nature as the report would contain relevant information upon wMch VRS would render its decision. Accordrngly, we find that the time requirements of Code \u00a7 9-6.14:11(D) did not begin to run until VRS received the Medical Board\u2019s report. Applying those requirements to this case, it is clear the trial court erred in granting Rizzo\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Accordingly, the decision is reversed and remanded for further proceedings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-11\">.

Code \u00a7 9-6.14:12 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">A. The agency shall afford opportunity for the formal taking of evidence upon relevant fact issues in any case in which the basic laws provide expressly for decisions upon or after hearing and may do so in any case to the extent that informal procedures under \u00a7 9-6.14:11 have not been had or have failed to dispose of a case by consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">C.
