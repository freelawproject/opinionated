LesCallett contends that the commission erred in ruling that <em>\u201ca </em>claimant must show \u2018that the loss of use [of the legs] is quantifiable] since a specific incapacity rating is required before permanent partial or total disability benefits may be awarded.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Rozansky &amp; Kay Construction Company (Rozansky) contends on appeal that the commission erred in finding (1) that LesCallett had reached maximum medical improvement, (2) that the medical evidence supports a finding that LesCallett is totally and permanently disabled, and (3) that a vocational expert was not required on the issue of LesCallett\u2019s ability to be gainfully employed. We affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">On July 10, 1985, LesCallett was injured at work while removing a large cornerstone from the bed of a delivery truck. Since that time, he has been unemployed and has undergone back surgery eight times. He cannot walk over one hundred feet without pain and cannot stoop, bend, or climb stairs. This disability results directly from his work-related injury. LesCallett has received 500 weeks of temporary total disability benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-500.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">In support of his application for benefits for permanent and total loss of use of his legs, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-503(C), LesCallett presented letters from his treating physicians stating that his physical condition was permanent and that it rendered him totally and permanently disabled and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>unable to perform gainful employment. Denying him compensation under Code \u00a7 65.2-503, the deputy commissioner and the full commission, on review, held that although LesCallett was permanently and totally disabled from any gainful employment, he had failed to prove a quantified loss of use of his legs, as required in <em>Cafaro Construction Co. v. Strother, </em>15 Va.App. 656, 657-58, 426 S.E.2d 489, 490 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Code \u00a7 65.2-503 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">C. Compensation shall be awarded pursuant to \u00a7 65.2-500 for permanent and total incapacity when there is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">1. Loss of ... both legs ... in the same accident; '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">D. In construing this section, the permanent loss of the use of a member shall be equivalent to the loss of such member, and for the permanent partial loss or loss of use of a member, compensation may be proportionately awarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u201c \u2018[A]n award under Code [\u00a7 65.2-503] is not dependent upon a claimant\u2019s incapacity for work. That section is intended to provide benefits in the nature of indemnity for the loss of a scheduled body member.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cafaro, </em>15 Va.App. at 662, 426 S.E.2d at 493 (citation omitted). \u2019 \u201cIn order to establish entitlement to [ ] compensation under Code \u00a7 65.2-503, the claimant [is] required to present evidence rating the functional loss of use of his legs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Proof of the functional loss of the member, not industrial incapacity, is required for an award of benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-503.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Dr. Lavin stated in his September 14, 1995 letter that \u201cMr. Les Callett\u2019s [sic] physical condition has rendered him totally and permanently disabled\u201d and that he \u201cdoubt[ed] that [LesCallett] could use both of his lower extremities to any substantial degree for gainful employment.\u201d Dr. Mathews stated in a letter to LesCallett\u2019s attorney that he believed LesCallett had chronic intractable low back and leg pain and was totally and permanently disabled. He further stated that LesCallett\u2019s whole body impairment was 100% and that of that percentage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>his legs constituted a \u201csignificant proportion.\u201d Dr. Mathews did not separately calculate or otherwise address the degree of impairment of LesCallett\u2019s legs because \u201cit is secondary to lumbar nerve dysfunction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">LesCallett testified that he could walk with the assistance of a cane no further than fifty to one hundred feet without pain, that he could not stoop, bend, or climb stairs, that his wife puts his socks and shoes on him, and that his legs are like \u201crubber bands\u201d that just give way on him. His testimony was uncontroverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">This case is controlled by <em>Cafaro. </em>Although LesCallett produced evidence that he was industrially disabled and that the disability in his legs was a substantially contributing factor to that disability, he failed to quantify a functional loss of the legs that could be translated into loss of those members pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-503(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The issues raised by Rozansky address findings of fact that are supported by evidence. Under familiar principles, these findings cannot be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The decision of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
