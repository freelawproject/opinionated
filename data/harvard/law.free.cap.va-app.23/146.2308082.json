Appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to sustain one of the firearm convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">Upon familiar principles, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">On April 21,1993, at approximately 4:05 a.m., taxicab driver Christopher Rodgers (Rodgers) was dispatched to pick up an individual. Rodgers, unable to locate the specific address given to him by the dispatcher, was approached by appellant, and appellant indicated that he had called the cab. Appellant entered the cab and directed Rodgers to pull up to a house two doors away. Appellant told Rodgers that he was waiting for a friend to come out of the house and that he wanted Rodgers to take them to their destination. After waiting about two or three minutes, Rodgers suggested that he blow the cab\u2019s horn to signal the person inside the house. Appellant answered, \u201cNo, that\u2019s all right, that\u2019s all right.\u201d A few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>seconds later, appellant added, \u2018You know this is a stickup, don\u2019t you?\u201d Rodgers \u201ckind of looked over [his] shoulder and [asked] what?\u201d Appellant repeated, \u201cThis is a stickup. Don\u2019t look back, I[\u2019ll] butt you in the head, you know.\u201d At the same time, Rodgers felt a metal object against the back of his neck, and he testified that he \u201cfigured [the metal object] was a gun.\u201d When asked whether he actually saw a gun, Rodgers responded, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t see a gun.\u201d Another cab driver, Michael Ezeigbo, testified that at approximately 5:40 a.m. on April 14, 1993, appellant and some accomplices robbed him at gunpoint after calling and requesting a cab.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">It shall be unlawful for any person to use or attempt to use any ... firearm or display such weapon in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit ... robbery____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">To convict an accused under this statute, \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove that the accused actually had a firearm in his possession and that he used or attempted to use the firearm or displayed the firearm in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit robbery or one of the other specified felonies.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 215, 218, 441 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1994) (footnote omitted). Possession of a firearm is an \u201cessential element\u201d of the offense, and the fact that a victim merely thinks or perceives that the accused was armed is insufficient to prove actual possession. <em>Id. </em>at 219, 441 S.E.2d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, we do not hold that <em>Yarborough </em>does not require the evidence to show an accused \u201c\u2018actually\u2019 used a gun to consummate the crime.\u201d Rather, in reliance on <em>Yarborough, </em>we hold that proof of \u201cactual\u201d possession of a firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 may be established by circumstantial evidence, direct evidence, or both. <em>See id. </em>at 216-19, 441 S.E.2d at 343-44 (circumstantial evidence that accused actually possessed firearm insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence). <em>See also McBride v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 730, 735, 473 S.E.2d 85, 87 (1996) (circumstantial evidence sufficient to support conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u201cCircumstantial evidence ... is evidence of facts or circumstances not in issue from which facts or circumstances in issue may be inferred.\u201d 1 Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 12-1 (4th ed. 1993); <em>see also Ryan v. Maryland Casualty Co., </em>173 Va. 57, 62, 3 S.E.2d 416, 418 (1939) (citation omitted) (\u201cCircumstantial evidence is proof of a series of other facts than the fact in issue, which by experience have been found so associated with that fact, that, in the relation of cause and effect, they lead to a satisfactory and certain conclusion\u201d). Direct evidence, on the other hand, is \u201c[e]vidence that directly proves a fact, without an inference or presumption, and which in itself, if true, conclusively establishes that fact.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>460 (6th ed. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u201cCircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1109, 104 S.Ct. 1617, 80 L.Ed.2d 145 (1984). \u201c[W]here the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence as to an element of an offense is wholly circumstantial, \u2018all necessary circumstances proved must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence and exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moran v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 310, 314, 357 S.E.2d 551, 553 (1987) (citation omitted); <em>see also Dukes v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 119, 122, 313 S.E.2d 382, 383 (1984); <em>Wilkins v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 293, 298, 443 S.E.2d 440, 444 (1994). However, the Commonwealth \u201c\u2018is not required to disprove every remote possibility of innocence, but is, instead, required only to establish guilt of the accused to the exclusion of a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>Cantrell v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 269, 289, 373 S.E.2d 328, 338 (1988) (quoting <em>Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 523, 526-27, 351 S.E.2d 598, 600 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>(1986)). \u201cThe hypotheses which the prosecution must reasonably exclude are those \u201cwhich flow from the evidence itself, and not from the imagination of defendant\u2019s counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289-90, 373 S.E.2d at 338-39 (quoting <em>Black v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 838, 841, 284 S.E.2d 608, 609 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In <em>Yarborough, </em>the victim testified to seeing \u201csomething protruding\u201d from Yarborough\u2019s jacket pocket during the incident, which Yarborough called a \u201cstickup.\u201d 247 Va. at 216-17, 441 S.E.2d at 343. Although the victim believed Yarborough had a gun in his pocket, she never saw or felt a firearm. <em>Id. </em>Yarborough never stated he had a gun, and the police found no firearm in Yarborough\u2019s possession, although they later found an unopened can of beer in his jacket pocket. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The issue on appeal to the Supreme Court was whether the circumstantial evidence that Yarborough actually possessed a firearm was sufficient to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of testimony that a firearm was actually seen, and in light of the hypothesis that the victim could have mistaken the beer can for a firearm, the Court found that the evidence \u201ccreate[d] merely a suspicion of guilt,\u201d which clearly failed to \u201cexclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218-19, 441 S.E.2d at 344. Accordingly, the Court reversed the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 219, 441 S.E.2d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Here, the evidence established that (1) appellant twice told Rodgers, \u201cthis is a stickup\u201d; (2) appellant threatened to \u201cbutt\u201d Rodgers in the head if Rodgers turned around; (3) Rodgers felt a . metal object which he thought was a gun against the back of his neck; and (4) appellant took part in a similar robbery a week before in which a firearm was used. In light of this evidence, the trial court, as trier of fact, could reasonably have inferred that appellant \u201cactually\u201d possessed a firearm while robbing Rodgers.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Determining whether an alternative explanation is a \u201creasonable hypothesis of innocence\u201d is a question of fact. <em>Cantrell, </em>7 Va.App. at 290, 373 S.E.2d at 339. Based on familiar principles, this Court does not substitute its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>judgment for that of the trier of fact. <em>Cable v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 236, 239, 415 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1992). The trial court\u2019s judgment -will not be set aside unless it appears that the judgment is plainly wrong or without supporting evidence. Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>Josephs v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 87, 99, 390 S.E.2d 491, 497 (1990) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Here, the trial court found no alternative hypothesis which could reasonably explain that the metal object appellant possessed while robbing Rodgers was anything but a firearm. We cannot say the trial court\u2019s finding is plainly wrong or without support in the record. Unlike <em>Yarborough, </em>where the Supreme Court found that the circumstantial evidence of guilt clearly failed to exclude the reasonable hypothesis that the victim mistook the can of beer the police found in defendant\u2019s pocket for a firearm, we find no reasonable, innocent hypothesis in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Having concluded that the evidence is sufficient to support the finding beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant \u201cactually\u201d possessed a firearm, we find the evidence clearly supports the finding that appellant \u201cused or attempted to use the firearm or displayed the firearm in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit robbery.\u201d <em>See Yarborough, </em>247 Va. at 218, 441 S.E.2d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b199-9\">BAKER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ayp\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">While finding it difficult to disagree with the rationale of the majority, I find it more difficult to hold that <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 215, 441 S.E.2d 342 (1994), does not require that the evidence must show that the accused \u201cactually\u201d used a gun to consummate the crime. In <em>Yarborough, </em>the victim testified that the robber said \u201cthis is a stickup,\u201d while holding his hand on something that caused the victim to believe that Yarborough had a gun. Holding that this evidence was insufficient to sustain Yarborough\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the Supreme Court stated, \u201cwe <em>reject </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>... the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals\u201d that \u201c \u2018actual sighting of the weapon is unnecessary for a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217-18, 441 S.E.2d at 343-44 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Thereafter, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, a penal statute, must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth and in favor of an accused. When so construed, we think that, to convict an accused of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the Commonwealth must prove that the accused <em>actually </em>had a firearm in his possession and that he used or attempted to use the firearm or displayed the firearm in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit robbery or one of the other specified felonies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 218, 441 S.E.2d at 344 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">If a writ is sought in this case and the Supreme Court refuses to grant it, I will concede that circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to prove \u201cthe actual sighting\u201d required by that Court in <em>Yarborough. </em>However, until then, I am of the opinion that this case must be reversed and dismissed for want of evidence to support the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
