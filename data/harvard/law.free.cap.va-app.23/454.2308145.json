We find no error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Hoverter was indicted for the first degree murder and abduction of Valerie Smelser. On July 3, 1995, the parties entered into a plea agreement. The Commonwealth agreed not to bring any \u201cfurther charges against [Hoverter] arising out of the circumstances involving the abuse, neglect, and death of Valerie Smelser, including, but not limited to any charge of alleged sodomy.\u201d Hoverter agreed to plead guilty to the murder and abduction charges, pursuant to <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970). The agreement provided that on the murder charge, Hoverter would be sentenced \u201cto serve a specific term of imprisonment to be determined by the Court after preparation of a Pre-Sentence Report\u201d and that on the abduction charge, he would receive a ten year suspended sentence. Hoverter retained the right to withdraw his pleas if the trial court rejected the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">On July 25, 1995, Hoverter and the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney presented the plea agreement to the trial court. The following dialogue occurred between the trial court and Hoverter:</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">BY THE COURT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">Q Tell me your full name sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\">A Norman Hoverter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-12\">Q What is your age Mr. Hoverter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-13\">A Fifty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-14\">Q Your date of birth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-15\">A 6/12/45.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Q What is the last grade of school you completed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">A Sixth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">Q Sixth grade.

Have you had enough time to discuss with your attorneys any possible defenses that you might have to either of those charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-21\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-22\">Q Have you discussed with your attorneys whether you should plead not guilty or guilty? Have you discussed that with your attorneys? I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-23\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-24\">Q All right. After these discussions did you decide yourself that you should plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>A Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">Q Okay. The question is whether you made the decision or somebody forced you to make the decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">Q You made it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">Q Are you entering those pleas of guilty freely and voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">Q Are you entering those pleas of guilty because you are in fact guilty of the crimes charge[d]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-12\">A No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney then stated a summary of the evidence that the Commonwealth would present in support of the charges. The trial court then resumed its dialogue with Hoverter as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">BY THE COURT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-15\">Q Mr. Hoverter, are you pleading guilty because this is the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and you don\u2019t want to take the risk that you would be found guilty by a jury on that evidence beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-17\">Q Do you understand that by pleading guilty, you are not entitled to a trial by jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-18\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-19\">Q Do you understand by pleading guilty you give up your right not to incriminate yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-20\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-21\">Q Do you understand by pleading guilty you give up your right to confront and cross examine your accusers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-22\">A Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-23\">Q Do you understand by pleading guilty you give up your right to defend yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-24\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Q Are you presently serving a penitentiary sentence or on probation or on parole?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">Q Has anyone connected with your arrest and prosecution such as the police or the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney or any other person in any manner threatened you or forced you to enter these pleas of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">Q Have they made any promises concerning your pleas of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">Q Do you understand that if you are sentenced consecutively on these charges, the maximum punishment for these crimes is life plus 10 years in prison plus all court costs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">Q Are you satisfied with Ms. Perka\u2019s and Mr. Solak\u2019s services and their representation of you in these matters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-12\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-13\">Q Do you understand by pleading guilty you may waive any right to appeal the decision of this Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-14\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-15\">Q Mr. Hoverter the Court has been handed what is essentially a two page plea agreement with an attached five, six page acknowledgment of rights, both of which bear your signature or appear to bear your signature under the date of July 3, 1995. Is this in fact your signature Mr. Hoverter on these two documents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-17\">Q And you signed these on July 3?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-18\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-19\">Q At the time you signed this plea agreement particularly had you read the plea agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>A Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">Q Do you read and write?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">A Some, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">Q And were you able to read this by yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">Q Okay, you were assisted by your attorneys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">Q You could read part of it and couldn\u2019t understand some of the words and they helped you with those?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-12\">A Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-13\">Q In addition to reading it in the manner you described, did your attorneys explain to you and describe for you the contents of the plea agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-14\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-15\">Q So that at the time you signed this plea agreement on July 3rd and as you stand here now, did you have and do you have a full and complete understanding of the terms and conditions of this plea agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-17\">Q And does this agreement contain the full and complete agreement entered into among you, your attorneys and the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-18\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-19\">Q You understand the Court may accept the plea agreement or may reject the plea agreement or may defer any decision to either accept or reject until there has been an opportunity to consider a presentence report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-20\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-21\">Q Do you understand that if the Court accepts the plea agreement, the Court will include in [its] judgment and sentence a sentence provided for in the plea agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-22\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-23\">Q Do you understand that as far as the sentence provided for in the plea agreement, the only limitation on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>sentence to be imposed in the plea agreement is that the 10 year sentence on the abduction charge be suspended, there isn\u2019t any limitation on the life sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">Q And that the Court could impose anything from 20 years to life on that charge without restriction by the plea agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">Q And the Court could suspend all, part, or none of any sentence imposed on that charge without restriction by the plea agreement. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">Q Do you understand that if the Court rejects the plea agreement, you will not be bound by the plea agreement? You will be given an opportunity to withdraw your pleas of guilty and if you do that, your trial may be held before another judge of this Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-12\">Q Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-13\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-14\">Q Do you understand that if the Court rejects the plea agreement and you are given the opportunity to withdraw your plea of guilty and you don\u2019t do. that, you continue in your pleas of guilty, then the sentence imposed may be more severe than that contained in the plea agreement? Do you understand that also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-15\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-16\">Q Have you understood all the questions I have asked you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-17\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-18\">Q Do you have any questions for the Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-19\">A No sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-20\">Whereupon, Hoverter was arraigned on both charges and on each charge pleaded, \u201cGuilty of the Alford Plea.\u201d The trial court found the \u201cpleas of guilty to be freely, intelligently and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>voluntarily made with an understanding of the nature of the charges and the consequences of the pleas and [accepted the] pleas at [that] time.\u201d The trial court deferred acceptance or rejection of the plea agreement pending receipt of a presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Following Hoverter\u2019s arraignment, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney gave a press conference. A newspaper reported that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney stated at the press conference that he never intended to charge Hoverter with sodomy and that he lacked sufficient evidence to bring such a charge. On August 10, 1995, Hoverter moved to withdraw his guilty pleas. He alleged that he had entered into the plea agreement desiring to avoid prosecution for sodomy and upon the understanding that the Commonwealth would prosecute him for sodomy unless he pleaded guilty to murder and abduction. He further alleged that his decision to plead guilty was based upon the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s false assertion that the Commonwealth intended to charge him with sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">On August 25, 1995, the trial court conducted a hearing on Hoverter\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney testified that his statements regarding a sodomy charge, as reported in the newspaper, were incorrect. He testified that he had sufficient evidence to bring such a charge, intended to do so, and had authorized the Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney to proceed. The Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney testified that he had prepared a sodomy indictment and intended to present it to the July 6,1995 grand jury. Special Agent Shevokas testified that he had been notified to appear before the grand jury on July 6, 1995 to present the sodomy charge. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found \u201cno evidence ... of any misrepresentation to the defendant of any material fact that would have induced him to enter into the guilty plea.\u201d The evidence supported this finding. The trial court accepted the plea agreement and sentenced Hoverter in accordance with it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">In the absence of statutory regulation or established practice, whether or not an accused should be allowed to with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>draw a plea of guilty for the purpose of submitting one of not guilty is a matter that <em>rests within the sound discretion of the trial court </em>and is to be determined by the facts and circumstances of each case____ [T]he motion should not be denied, if timely made, and if it appears from the surrounding circumstances that the plea of guilty was submitted in good faith under an honest mistake of material fact or facts, or if it was induced by fraud, coercion or undue influence and would not otherwise have been made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\"><em>Parris v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 321, 324, 52 S.E.2d 872, 873 (1949) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-296 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere may be made only before sentence is imposed or imposition of a sentence is suspended; but to correct manifest injustice, the court within twenty-one days after entry of a final order may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Hoverter moved to withdraw his guilty pleas before sentence was imposed. Thus, his motion was timely under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Hoverter asserts no honest mistake of material fact or facts. He contends that the Commonwealth induced his pleas by fraud or coercion when it represented to him that it would prosecute him for sodomy when, according to the newspaper account of the press conference, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney never intended to prosecute him for sodomy and lacked the evidence to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">The evidence adduced at the hearing on Hoverter\u2019s motion does not support his contention. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney acknowledged that he may have misspoken at the press conference, noting that it was an excited and confused event. However, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney testified that had there been no plea agreement, he fully intended to prosecute Hoverter for sodomy and had authorized his assistant to seek an indictment on that charge. This testimony was corroborated by the Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and by the state police investigator who was scheduled to appear before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the grand jury. This testimony supports the trial court\u2019s finding that, regardless of what may have appeared in the newspaper report, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney made no misrepresentation to Hoverter and that Hoverter\u2019s guilty pleas were not based on fraud or coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u201c[T]he finding of the judge, upon the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their evidence, stands on the same footing as the verdict of a jury, and unless that finding is plainly wrong, or without evidence to support it, it can not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Yates v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 140, 148, 355 S.E.2d 14, 16 (1987) (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">\u201cThe plea of guilty to a serious criminal charge should be freely and voluntarily made, and entered by the accused, without a semblance of coercion, and without fear or duress of any kind, and the accused should be permitted to withdraw a plea of guilty entered unadvisedly when application therefor is duly made in good faith and sustained by proofs____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\"><em>Parris, </em>189 Va. at 325, 52 S.E.2d at 874 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Before accepting Hoverter\u2019s guilty pleas, the trial court examined him conscientiously and thoroughly. That examination leaves no room for doubt that Hoverter\u2019s pleas were freely and voluntarily made, were entered by him without a semblance of coercion and without fear or duress of any kind. Hoverter alleged misrepresentation, but his proof failed to support that allegation. The evidence established that the Commonwealth dealt openly and honestly with Hoverter in negotiating the plea agreement, that the Commonwealth withheld or misrepresented no material fact, and that the Commonwealth scrupulously discharged its duties under the plea agreement. The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the Commonwealth made no misrepresentation of any material fact to Hoverter to induce the plea agreement and his guilty pleas. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hoverter\u2019s motion to withdraw his pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Hoverter next contends that the trial court violated his constitutional right to due process by denying him funds to employ a mental health expert to prepare for sentencing. On August 10, 1995, the trial court conducted a hearing on Hoverter\u2019s motion for the appointment of <em>\u201ca </em>mental health expert to conduct a psychological evaluation\u201d for his sentencing hearing. Hoverter\u2019s counsel stated that they needed the expert \u201cto determine if psychological or mental health mitigation evidence exists,\u201d and, if so, \u201cto aid him in the development and presentation of such evidence for the sentencing proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">After considering the representations and argument presented by counsel, the trial court denied the motion. It ruled that \u201cthere has been no showing of either necessity or that such evidence would likely be a significant factor in the determination of the appropriate sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Whether to provide a defendant expert assistance at state expense lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the burden is on the defendant to show that this discretion has been abused. <em>O\u2019Dell v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 672, 687, 364 S.E.2d 491, 499, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 871, 109 S.Ct. 186, 102 L.Ed.2d 154 (1988). An indigent defendant\u2019s constitutional right to the appointment of an expert at state expense is not absolute. Rather, \u201can indigent defendant who seeks appointment of an expert witness, at the Commonwealth\u2019s expense, must demonstrate that the subject which necessitates the assistance of the expert is \u2018likely to be a significant factor in his defense,\u2019 and that he will be prejudiced by the lack of expert assistance.\u201d <em>Husske v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 203, 211-12, 476 S.E.2d 920, 925 (1996) (quoting <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68, 82-83, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 1096, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985)). Hoverter was required to show a particularized need for the requested services and that he would be prejudiced by the lack of expert assistance. <em>See id. </em>at 211-12, 476 S.E.2d at 925-27. He failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Hoverter alleged no existing mental illness. He demonstrated no way that the services of an expert might constitute a significant factor in his defense. He showed no prejudice resulting from the non-appointment of an expert, nor did he explain why the detailed presentence investigation would not sufficiently reflect any \u201cmitigation evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">At most, we surmise, Hoverter hoped that a psychological examination would support a decision for leniency at the sentencing hearing. However, a mere hope or suspicion that favorable evidence may result from an expert\u2019s services does not create a constitutional mandate. <em>See id. </em>at 211-12, 476 S.E.2d at 925-26. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">For these reasons we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
