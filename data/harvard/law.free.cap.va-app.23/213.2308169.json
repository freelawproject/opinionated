As part of appellant\u2019s sentence, appellant was requested to register with local law enforcement officers as a sex offender pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1. Appellant contends that because Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1 was enacted after the offenses occurred, the trial court violated his federal and state constitutional rights against the imposition of an <em>ex post facto </em>law. We disagree with appellant and affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">Following a trial on July 9, 1990, a jury found appellant guilty of rape and malicious wounding. The Supreme Court of Virginia reversed these convictions and remanded the case for retrial. <em>See Kitze v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 283, 435 S.E.2d 583 (1993). On July 1, 1994, Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1 became effective. Appellant pled guilty to both charges at his second trial on August 26, 1994. The trial court sentenced appellant to serve forty years in prison with ten years suspended on the rape conviction, and ten years in prison with five years suspended on the malicious wounding conviction. In addition, the trial court required appellant to register with the Sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Offender Registry of the Department of State Police, in accordance with Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\"><em>EX POST FACTO </em>LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The United States Constitution, article 1, \u00a7 10, and the Virginia Constitution, article 1, \u00a7 9, prohibit the Commonwealth from enacting <em>ex post facto </em>laws. These constitutional prohibitions on <em>ex post facto </em>laws apply only to statutes that impose <em>penalties, Collins v. Youngblood, </em>497 U.S. 37, 41, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 2718-19, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990), or where the challenged change in the law \u201calters the definition of criminal conduct.\u201d <em>California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014,\u2014n. 3, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 1602 n. 3, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">In deciding whether or not a law is penal, [the United States Supreme] Court has generally based its determination upon the purpose of the statute. If the statute imposes a disability for the purposes of punishment\u2014that is, to reprimand the wrongdoer, to deter others, etc., it has been considered penal. But a statute has been considered nonpenal if it imposes a disability, not to punish, but to accomplish some other legitimate governmental purpose. The Court has recognized that any statute decreeing some adversity as a consequence of certain conduct may have both a penal and a nonpenal effect. The controlling nature of such statutes normally depends on the evident purpose of the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-11\"><em>Trop v. Dulles, </em>356 U.S. 86, 96, 78 S.Ct. 590, 595-96, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958)(plurality opinion) (footnotes omitted); <em>Snyder v. State, </em>912 P.2d 1127, 1130 (Wyo.l996)(holding that registration of sex offenders under the Wyoming Sex Offenders Registration Act does not offend the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">The statutory scheme under which appellant was required to register as a sex offender creates a Sex Offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Registry in the Commonwealth. The purpose of the Registry is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">to assist the efforts of law-enforcement agencies to protect their communities from repeat sex offenders and to protect children from becoming the victims of repeat sex offenders by helping to prevent such individuals from being hired or allowed to volunteer to work directly with children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-390.1(A). Every person convicted on or after July 1,1994, of a sex crime such as rape is required to register with the Department of State Police within thirty days from release from confinement. Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1(A). A knowing and intentional failure to register is punishable as a Class 1 misdemeanor, Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1(E), and could expose the sex offender to contempt of court charges for failure to abide by the Commonwealth\u2019s laws during a period of suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">We hold that the sex offender registration requirement is <em>not </em>penal and that the General Assembly \u201cintended to facilitate law enforcement and protection of children. There was no intent to inflict greater punishment [on the convicted sex offender].\u201d <em>Snyder, </em>912 P.2d at 1131. Protecting the public and preventing crimes are regulatory, not punitive, purposes. <em>Artway v. Attorney General of State of New Jersey, </em>81 F.3d 1235, 1264 (3d Cir.l996)(citing <em>De Veau v. Braisted, </em>363 U.S. 144, 160, 80 S.Ct. 1146, 1154-55, 4 L.Ed.2d 1109 (1960)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">Here, the solely remedial purpose of helping law enforcement agencies keep tabs on these offenders fully explains requiring certain sex offenders to register. Registration may allow officers to prevent future crimes by intervening in dangerous situations. Like the agent who must endure the snow to fetch the soupmeat, the registrant may face some unpleasantness from having to register and update his registration. But the remedial purpose of knowing the whereabouts of sex offenders fully explains the registration provision just as the need for dinner fully explains a trip out into the night. And the means chosen\u2014registration and law enforcement notification only\u2014is not excessive in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>way. Registration, therefore, is certainly \u201creasonably related\u201d to a legitimate goal: allowing law enforcement to stay vigilant against possible re-abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><em>Artway, </em>81 F.3d. at 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Other states considering this issue have reached the same result. For example, the Court of Appeals of Minnesota recently concluded \u201cthat [Minnesota\u2019s sex offender] registration statute does not impose an affirmative disability, has not historically been viewed as punishment, and does not advance the traditional aims of punishment.\u201d <em>State v. Manning, </em>532 N.W.2d 244, 248 (Minn.Ct.App.1995). Similarly, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire held that \u201cthe [New Hampshire] sexual offender registration [requirement] inflicts no greater punishment\u201d upon the sex offender and does not violate <em>ex post facto </em>principles. <em>State v. Costello, </em>138 N.H. 587, 643 A.2d 531, 534 (1994). In <em>State v. Ward, </em>123 Wash.2d 488, 869 P.2d 1062, <em>1068, 1074 (1994)(en </em>banc), the Supreme Court of Washington held that both the purpose and effect of Washington\u2019s sex offender registration requirement were not punitive. <em>See also Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 N.J. 1, 662 A.2d 367 (1995) (holding that New Jersey\u2019s sex offender registration requirement had a totally remedial purpose); <em>People v. Adams, </em>144 Ill.2d 381, 163 Ill.Dec. 483, 581 N.E.2d 637 (1991)(holding that Illinois\u2019 sex offender registration requirement does not constitute punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">While registration might impose a burden on a convicted sex offender, registration is merely a remedial aspect of a sex offender\u2019s sentence. As the Supreme Court of New Jersey held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">[t]he fact that some deterrent punitive impact may result, does not ... transform [sex offender registration] provisions into \u201cpunishment\u201d if that impact is an inevitable consequence of the regulatory provision, as distinguished from an impact that results from \u201cexcessive\u201d provisions, provisions that do <em>not </em>advance the regulatory purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A68\"><em>Poritz, </em>662 A.2d at 405 (footnote omitted). Any potential punishment arising from the sex offender\u2019s failure to register <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>is prospective and does not punish him or her for past criminal activity. <em>See Jones v. Murray, </em>962 F.2d 302, 310 n. 3 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 977, 113 S.Ct. 472, 121 L.Ed.2d 378 (1992).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Similarly, a potential contempt violation for failure to abide by the trial court\u2019s sentencing order, which could lead to a reimposition of any suspended jail time and a revocation of parole and probation rights, is prospective. In <em>Costello, </em>the defendant was prosecuted for violating the terms of his probation by failing to register as a sex offender. The Supreme Court of New Hampshire stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">[T]he defendant\u2019s argument with respect to the added burden he suffers is that he is being prosecuted for an act (not registering) that was not illegal when he committed the underlying sexual assault. This misconstrues the appropriate <em>ex post facto </em>analysis. In fact, the defendant is being prosecuted for an act, failure to register, that was itself an offense when the defendant committed it, which presents no problems of retrospectivity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-8\"><em>Costello, </em>643 A.2d at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Most of the cases discussed above involve situations where the registration requirement was <em>not </em>imposed as part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>defendant\u2019s sentence, but rather was imposed subsequently.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This does not alter our analysis of whether the registration requirement constitutes punishment. Merely because a trial court imposes the registration requirement as part of a sentence does <em>not </em>convert a non-punitive statute into a punitive statute. For example, in <em>People v. Starnes, </em>273 Ill.App.3d 911, 210 Ill.Dec. 417, 653 N.E.2d 4, <em>appeal denied, </em>163 Ill.2d 581, 212 Ill.Dec. 434, 657 N.E.2d 635 (1995), the trial court\u2019s sentencing order required the defendant to register as a firsts time sex offender, even though at the time of the offense, Illinois required only second-time sex offenders to register. The Illinois Court of Appeals rejected the defendant\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>argument, holding that the registration requirement did not constitute punishment, even where it was imposed as part of the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id., </em>210 Ill.Dec. at 419, 653 N.E.2d at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the sex offender registration requirement does not violate the constitutional prohibitions against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. We therefore affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-10\">. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held in <em>Jones, </em>with regard to sanctions for failure to provide a DNA sample:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">Suffice it to say that whatever punishment or disadvantagement is imposed results, not by reason of conduct that took place <em>before </em>enactment of the statute, so as to become retrospective, but from conduct that occurred <em>after </em>enactment in refusing to comply with a reasonable regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-12\"><em>Jones, </em>962 F.2d at 310 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">Furthermore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-14\">[t]he mark of an ex post facto law is the imposition of what can fairly be designated punishment for past acts. The question in each case where unpleasant consequences are brought to bear upon an individual for prior conduct, is whether the legislative aim was to punish that individual for past activity, or whether the restriction of the individual comes about as a relevant incident to a regulation of a present situation____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-15\"><em>Snyder, </em>912 P.2d at 1131 (citing <em>De Veau, </em>363 U.S. at 160, 80 S.Ct. at 1154-55).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\">. Other state statutes allow a court to impose the registration requirement retroactively, after the sex offender\u2019s original sentence is imposed. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:7-2b(l)(West 1995); Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9A.44.130 (West 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b266-7\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AC3\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The issue in this case is not complicated. The evidence proved that Jeffrey Theodore Kitze committed acts in 1989 that led to indictments for rape and malicious wounding. At that time, Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1 had not been enacted. Kitze was tried in 1990 and convicted of rape and malicious wounding. His convictions were reversed on appeal and remanded for a new trial. <em>See Kitze v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 283, 435 S.E.2d 583 (1993). At that time, Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1 had not been enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>On remand and during the course of the new trial in August 1994, Kitze pled guilty to both charges. Prior to the commencement of the second trial, Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1 became effective. In pertinent part, the statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A81\">Every person convicted on or after July 1,1994, for a felony in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-61, [,rape?] shall be required <em>as a part of the sentence imposed upon conviction </em>to register with the Department of State Police. The order shall also impose a duty to keep the registration current in accordance with this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1(A)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In sentencing Kitze upon his plea of guilty, the trial judge\u2019s order stated that \u201c[i]t is further ORDERED, in accordance with Virginia Code Section 19.2-298.1, that the defendant register with the Sex Offender Registry of the Department of State Police within thirty days from the date of his release from incarceration and to keep the registration current in accordance with said section.\u201d This statutorily mandated penalty did not exist as an aspect of sentencing when Kitze committed the criminal offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The Constitution of the United States provides that \u201c[n]o State shall ... pass any <em>... ex post facto </em>Law.\u201d Art. I, \u00a7 10. \u201cIt is settled, by decisions of ... [the Supreme] Court ..., that any statute ... which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission, ..is prohibited as <em>ex post facto.\u201d Beazell v. Ohio, </em>269 U.S. 167, 169-70, 46 S.Ct. 68, 68, 70 L.Ed. 216 (1925). \u201c[T]he Latin phrase <em>\u2018ex post facto\u2019 </em>literally encompasses any law passed \u2018after the fact,\u2019 [;thus,] it has long been recognized by ... [the Supreme] Court that the constitutional prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws applies ... to penal statutes which disadvantage the offender affected by them.\u201d <em>Collins v. Youngblood, </em>497 U.S. 37, 41, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 2718, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990). \u201c[T]wo critical elements must be present for a criminal or penal law to be <em>ex post facto: </em>it must be retrospective, that is, it must apply to events occurring before its enactment, and it must disadvantage the offender affected by it.\u201d <em>Weaver v. Graham, </em>450 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>U.S. 24, 29, 101 act 960, 964, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981). Thus, the Constitutional prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws \u201cforbids the application of any new punitive measure to a crime already-consummated.\u201d <em>Lindsey v. Washington, </em>301 U.S. 397, 401, 57 act 797, 799, 81 L.Ed. 1182 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The Constitution of Virginia also mandates \u201cthat the General Assembly shall not pass ... any <em>ex post facto </em>law.\u201d Art. I, \u00a7 9. The following principle was stated long ago by the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">[T]he phrase <em>ex post facto </em>law, as used in the constitution, is ... applicable ... to criminal and penal laws, which impose a punishment for previous acts which were not punishable at all when committed, or not punishable to the extent or in the manner prescribed. So that <em>ex post facto </em>laws relate to penal and criminal proceedings which inflict punishment or forfeitures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\"><em>Town of Danville v. Pace, </em>66 Va. 1, 25 Gratt. (66 Va.) 1, 9 (1874).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">In this case, the trial judge <em>ordered </em>\u201cas a part of the sentence imposed upon [Kitze\u2019s] conviction\u201d that Kitze register with the State Police and maintain a current registration. I believe that the sentencing requirement, mandated by Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1(A), is penal in character and is an <em>ex post facto </em>law when applied to persons who committed offenses prior to July 1, 1994. \u201cThe critical question ... is whether the new provision imposes greater punishment after the commission of the offense, not merely whether it increases a criminal sentence.\u201d <em>Weaver, </em>450 U.S. at 32 n. 17, 101 S.Ct. at 966 n. 17. Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1(A) requires the sentencing judge to order registration as an incident of conviction. The statutory requirement imposes a burden only by virtue of the felony conviction, and it \u201cmakes more onerous the punishment for crimes committed before its enactment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36, 101 S.Ct. at 968. Registration as a sex offender is a mandatory requirement to be imposed by the sentencing judge following each felony conviction, and it may be enforced by criminal contempt or by any other power available to the criminal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>In an early case, the United States Supreme Court stated that the \u201cdeprivation of any rights, civil or political, previously enjoyed, may be punishment.\u201d <em>Cummings v. Missouri, </em>71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277, 820, 18 L.Ed. 356 (1867). Indeed, state imposed \u201cregistration has traditionally been viewed as punitive.\u201d <em>State v. Noble, </em>171 Ariz, 171, 829 P.2d 1217, 1222 (1992). <em>See also State v. Payne, </em>633 So.2d 701, 703 (La.App. 1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>637 So.2d 497 (La.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The constitutional prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws extends to all penalties and punishments; it does not just apply to terms of imprisonment. Any changes in the law which infringe upon \u201csubstantial personal rights\u201d are <em>ex post facto </em>violations. <em>Malloy v. South Carolina, </em>237 U.S. 180, 183, 35 S.Ct. 507, 508, 59 L.Ed. 905 (1915). Indeed, insubstantial changes in fines and other penalties imposed at sentencing have been found to be violative of the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. <em>See Matter of Appeal in Maricopa County Juvenile Action No. J-92130, </em>139 Ariz. 170, 677 P.2d 943, 946 (App.l984)(Statute disadvantages an offender and therefore violates the constitutional prohibitions against <em>ex post facto </em>laws when it, requires Court to levy a \u201crehabilitati[ve] ... monetary assessment\u201d not in effect at the time the offense was committed); <em>Eichelberger v. State, </em>323 Ark. 551, 916 S.W.2d 109, 112 (1996) (retroactive increase in restitution requirements violated prohibitions against <em>ex post facto </em>laws); <em>People v. Rayburn, </em>258 Ill.App.3d 331, 196 Ill.Dec. 598, 603, 630 N.E.2d 533, 538 (1994)(statute requiring levy of mandatory assessment for the family abuse fund upon conviction was an <em>ex post facto </em>increase in punishment); <em>State v. Kaster, </em>469 N.W.2d 671, 673-74 (Iowa 1991)(ten dollar increase in a civil damages assessment that was required to be levied upon a person convicted of unlawfully taking fish was a prohibited <em>ex post facto </em>enhancement of punishment); <em>State v. Short, </em>177 W.Va. 1, 350 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1986)(change in statute after date of offense that granted the ability to enforce an order of restitution beyond the period of probation violated the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Citing <em>People v. Starnes, </em>273 Ill.App.3d 911, 210 Ill.Dec. 417, 653 N.E.2d 4, <em>appeal denied, </em>163 Ill.2d 581, 212 Ill.Dec. 434, 657 N.E.2d 635 (1995), the majority rules that registration requirement is not punishment when imposed as a part of a criminal sentence. <em>Starnes </em>held, however, \u201cthat defendant has waived his constitutional challenge.\u201d 210 Ill.Dec. at 419, 653 N.E.2d at 6. The portion of the opinion relied upon by the majority is pure <em>dicta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Furthermore, I disagree with the majority\u2019s view that \u201cregistration is merely a remedial aspect of a sex offender\u2019s sentence.\u201d While registration may serve a remedial purpose under certain circumstances, when it is imposed as a requirement of a felony sentencing order it also \u201cdisadvantage^] the offender,\u201d as does requiring the defendant to pay fines or restitution, <em>Weaver, </em>450 U.S. at 29, 101 S.Ct. at 964, and therefore, constitutes punishment. Thus, applying Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1 retroactively to Kitze increased his punishment and violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">By extending the scope of Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1(A) to persons convicted on or after July 1, 1994, for a proscribed felony committed before July 1, 1994 (the effective date of the act), the General Assembly enacted an <em>ex post facto </em>law. As to Kitze, the imposition of that requirement is a punishment for a past criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that the statute\u2019s application to Kitze is unconstitutional as a violation of the <em>ex post facto </em>clauses of both the United States and Virginia Constitutions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
