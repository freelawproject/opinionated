Crawford appeals his convictions for (1) carnal knowledge of a child between thirteen and fifteen years of age, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-63; and (2) crimes against nature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-361. Crawford contends that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a continuance after the judge allowed the prosecution to amend the indictment to conform to unexpected testimony. A panel of this Court, with one judge dissenting, held that the error was harmless and affirmed the convictions. <em>See Crawford v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 663, 472 S.E.2d 658 (1996). Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-116.02(D), the Court convened en banc to reconsider the question presented. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Crawford was indicted for (1) feloniously having sexual intercourse with a child under age thirteen, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-61; and (2) feloniously causing a child under age thirteen to perform fellatio on him, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1. The indictment charged that the events occurred in 1983 when the child, his daughter, was under age thirteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">During the jury trial, the daughter testified that she could not recall whether the alleged offenses occurred in the summer of 1983 or 1984. At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, Crawford moved to strike the evidence. He argued that the evidence failed to prove that the daughter, who was bom in 1971, was under thirteen at the time of the alleged offenses. In response, the Commonwealth agreed that the evidence failed to prove the year in which the offenses occurred and requested that the trial judge allow the trial to proceed on the offenses of (1) carnal knowledge of a child between thirteen and fourteen years of age, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-63; and (2) \u201ccrimes against nature,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-361. Over Crawford\u2019s objections, the trial judge granted the Commonwealth\u2019s request pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-231, which allows indictments to be amended at any time before a jury returns a verdict, provided the amendment does not change the nature or character of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Crawford then asserted that the amendment operated as a surprise and requested a continuance pursuant to another provision of Code \u00a7 19.2-231. Crawford argued that the amendment of the indictment required him to defend charges covering a different time period and precluded him from gathering relevant medical or alibi evidence. Ruling that Crawford was not surprised by the amendments, the trial judge overruled Crawford\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the jury convicted Crawford on both counts of the indictment, as amended. Consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict, the judge sentenced Crawford to serve ten years in the penitentiary for statutory rape and twenty years in the penitentiary for committing \u201ccrimes against nature.\u201d A judge of this Court granted Crawford\u2019s appeal from the trial judge\u2019s ruling that denied Crawford\u2019s request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-231 states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">If there be any defect in form in any indictment, presentment or information, or if there shall appear to be any variance between the allegations therein and the evidence offered in proof thereof, the court may permit amendment of such indictment, presentment or information, at any time before the jury returns a verdict or the court finds the accused guilty or not guilty, provided the amendment does not change the nature or character of the offense charged. After any such amendment the accused shall be arraigned on the indictment, presentment or information as amended, and shall be allowed to plead anew thereto, if he so desires, and the trial shall proceed as if no amendment had been made; <em>but if the court finds that such amendment operates as a surprise to the accused, he shall be entitled, upon request, to a continuance of the case for a reasonable time.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9e\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">The record and the transcript clearly establish that neither the Commonwealth nor Crawford expected the testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the alleged events may have occurred in 1984. The indictment charged that the child was under the age of thirteen and alleged conduct that occurred during a period in 1983. After the indictment was amended, Crawford was placed in the position of defending himself against offenses alleged to have been committed during a different time period. Thus, the facts that were relevant to Crawford\u2019s defense were necessarily different. As a result, Crawford was deprived of the opportunity to identify and present alibi and other exculpatory evidence for 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Moreover, Crawford adequately demonstrated to the trial judge that the manner of defending himself against the new charges would have changed. Crawford informed the trial judge that a continuance would have allowed him to seek alibi witnesses or other alibi evidence proving his whereabouts during the revised period in question. Crawford also stated that a continuance would have provided him the opportunity to review the victim\u2019s medical records from the summer of 1984 to discredit her allegations. No contrary evidence supported the trial judge\u2019s finding of lack of surprise. <em>Cf. Willis v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 430, 438-39, 393 S.E.2d 405, 409 (1990). Thus, the trial judge erred in finding that the amendments did not operate as a surprise upon Crawford.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-231 states that if an amendment surprises the accused, the accused <em>\u201cshall he entitled, </em>upon request, to a continuance of the case for a reasonable time.\u201d (Emphasis added). The principle is well settled that \u201c[w]hen the word \u2018shall\u2019 appears in a statute it is generally used in an imperative or mandatory sense.\u201d <em>Schmidt v. City of Richmond, </em>206 Va. 211, 218, 142 S.E.2d 573, 578 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">The General Assembly has mandated in Code \u00a7 19.2-231 that a finding of \u201csurprise\u201d entitles the accused to a continuance as a matter of right. <em>See Willis, </em>10 Va.App. at 438, 393 S.E.2d at 409. In so doing, the legislature reasonably determined that any amendment that surprises the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>necessarily burdens an accused\u2019s constitutional right \u201cto call for evidence in his favor.\u201d Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8. The right to call for evidence in one\u2019s favor \u201cguarantees an accused sufficient time to investigate and evaluate the evidence ... for trial.\u201d <em>Lomax v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 168, 172, 319 S.E.2d 763, 765 (1984). In this context, we conclude that \u201cthe term \u2018shall\u2019 is mandatory and reflects the General Assembly\u2019s intention that there be no discretion in complying with [the] statute, except as provided in the statute itself.\u201d <em>Brunty v. Smith, </em>22 Va.App. 191, 194-95, 468 S.E.2d 161, 163 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">By directly linking the finding of \u201csurprise\u201d to an entitlement to a continuance, the legislature has declared that a surprise caused by amending an indictment at trial <em>per se </em>prejudices the accused. To alleviate that prejudice, a trial judge must grant the accused a continuance for a reasonable period of time. Accordingly, we hold that when the trial judge permitted the Commonwealth to amend the indictment, the amendment operated as a surprise to Crawford and required the trial judge to grant Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 19.2-231 motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">ELDER and ANNUNZIATA, Judges, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">For the reasons stated in the panel\u2019s majority opinion, Judges Elder and Annunziata dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
