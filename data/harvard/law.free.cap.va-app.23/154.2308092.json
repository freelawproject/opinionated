Sinclair iiyured his eye in a work-related incident. He appeals from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission\u2019s award granting him permanent partial disability benefits but allowing his employer, Shelter Construction Corporation, a credit for his pre-existing, uncorrected visual acuity. Sinclair contends that he should have been awarded one hundred percent, rather than fifty percent, permanent partial disability. Although the commission did not err in granting a credit, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>hold that the commission misapplied Rule 13 of the Rules of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission when it reduced Sinclair\u2019s award below one hundred percent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The facts are undisputed. Sinclair, a carpenter employed by Shelter Construction, sustained an injury by accident when a circular saw propelled a piece of wood into his right eye. Prior to the injury, Sinclair had a visual acuity measurement of 20/80 in his right eye, corrected to 20/20 with eyeglasses. As a result of the injury by accident, Sinclair\u2019s right eye developed a hyphema. His vision in that eye deteriorated to 20/300. With eyeglasses, his vision is now corrected to 20/30.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In his claim for benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-503(B)(14), Sinclair alleged a one hundred percent loss of vision. Shelter Construction agreed that Sinclair\u2019s post-injury uncorrected vision acuity was 20/300. However, it contends that because Sinclair\u2019s pre-injury measurement of 20/80 amounted to a fifty percent loss of visual acuity according to Snellen\u2019s Chart, as adopted in Rule 13, he suffered only a fifty percent loss of visual acuity as a result of the injury. The deputy commissioner ruled that Sinclair suffered a one hundred percent loss of vision. Finding that Sinclair\u2019s preexisting visual deficiency did not materially affect his overall ability to perform his work, the deputy commissioner ruled that Shelter Construction was not entitled to an offset for Sinclair\u2019s pre-injury visual acuity measurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">On review, the commission found that Shelter Construction was entitled to an offset for Sinclair\u2019s pre-existing 20/80 visual acuity measurement because it exceeded the level of compensability. The commission awarded Sinclair compensation for a fifty percent loss of vision in his right eye because his preinjury acuity was fifty percent on Snellen\u2019s Chart.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">\u201c \u2018[CJonclusions of the Commission upon questions of law, or mixed questions of law and fact, are not binding on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>[appeal].\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Waynesboro v. Harter, </em>1 Va.App. 265, 269, 337 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1985) (quoting <em>Brown v. Fox, </em>189 Va. 509, 517, 54 S.E.2d 109, 113 (1949)). For purposes of determining compensation for permanent loss under Code \u00a7 65.2-503, the following rules apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\">[T]he permanent loss of the use of a member shall be equivalent to the loss of such member, and for the permanent partial loss or loss of use of a member, compensation may be proportionately awarded. Compensation shall also be awarded proportionately for partial loss of vision or hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-503(D). The commission has adopted Snellen\u2019s Chart for measuring vision acuity loss. <em>See </em>Commission Rule 13. We must decide whether under Rule 13 Sinclair is entitled to fifty or one hundred percent disability resulting from his compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In <em>Walsh Construction Co. v. London, </em>195 Va. 810, 80 S.E.2d 524 (1954), the Supreme Court stated that because the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cis silent as to whether corrected or uncorrected vision should be the basis for determining the extent of eye injuries, it should be interpreted and applied in a practical and common-sense manner so as to accomplish the purposes of the act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817, 80 S.E.2d at 528. In <em>London, </em>the employee had a pre-injury visual acuity of 20/200 correctable to 20/20. As a result of an accident and subsequent infection, the employee\u2019s eye was removed. <em>Id. </em>at 812, 80 S.E.2d at 525-26. Although the employee\u2019s uncorrected pre-injury vision loss was one hundred percent on Snellen\u2019s Chart, the Supreme Court awarded full disability for the loss of the eye. The Court reasoned that the employer was not entitled to a credit for the employee\u2019s pre-existing one hundred percent vision loss because the employee had \u201clost the source of his vision and all means of correcting the eye to normal use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818, 80 S.E.2d at 528. The loss was so severe that the employee\u2019s pre-existing vision loss was inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Before the commission, Sinclair alleged that he did not wear eyeglasses at work to perform his pre-injury work and that his pre-existing, uncorrected visual acuity was not disabling. Shelter Construction did not dispute Sinclair\u2019s claim but, instead, asserted that with the aid of eyeglasses Sinclair could still perform his work. The deputy commissioner found \u201cthat Sinclair ... was not required to wear corrected lenses in his job prior to the injury.\u201d The commission\u2019s decision did not address this aspect of the record. Significantly, however, the commission made no findings contrary to the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The employee\u2019s ability to perform without eyeglasses has some bearing on the resolution of this case because of the similarity to the circumstance in <em>Owen v. The Chesapeake Corporation, </em>198 Va. 440, 94 S.E.2d 462 (1956). The evidence in this case proves, as in <em>Owen, </em>\u201cthat prior to the accident [Sinclair] was selling to the industry uncorrected vision, and that after the accident, without the aid of glasses, the vision in [the injured] eye had been reduced to a fraction which by Snellen\u2019s Chart is equivalent to industrial blindness.\u201d 198 Va. at 442, 94 S.E.2d at 463. Also significant in this case is the magnitude of the loss that Sinclair suffered in the incident. Indeed, although the employee in <em>London </em>wore eyeglasses prior to the accident and had uncorrected vision acuity of \u201c20/200, which is tantamount to a total loss of vision,\u201d 195 Va. at 817, 80 S.E.2d at 528, the Court allowed the employer no credit. Despite proof in <em>London </em>that the employee was industrially blind before the accident, the Court determined that the employee\u2019s pre-existing visual impairment was minuscule in comparison to the loss caused by the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In <em>Virginia Fibre Corp. v. Moore, </em>17 Va.App. 691, 440 S.E.2d 432 (1994), a hearing loss ease, this Court addressed <em>London. </em>We stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\"><em>[London </em>] does not stand for the principle that loss to a sense organ should be measured by pre-injury and post-injury function. Rather, <em>[London </em>] involved a comparison of pre-injury and post-injury utility. The \u201cpractical and common sense\u201d result reached by the Supreme Court in <em>[Lon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>don </em>] was that where a pre-existing injury to or disability in a sense organ did not materially affect the employee\u2019s overall ability to use the organ, no benefit would accrue to the employer for any pre-injury disability to the organ. The [employee] in <em>[London </em>] received full compensation for his eye injury even though he had poor, but correctable, eyesight prior to the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">17 Va.App. at 692-93, 440 S.E.2d at 433 (quoting, in part, <em>London, </em>195 Va. at 818, 80 S.E.2d at 528). Thus, we declined to allow a credit to the employer because the employee\u2019s preinjury hearing loss was not shown to have affected his ability to use his hearing. In so holding, we ruled that Moore\u2019s preinjury condition was not one that implicated \u201cthe provision in the Code that relieves an employer from liability for that portion of a compensable injury that pre-existed the employer-employee relationship and the injurious work-related exposure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 440 S.E.2d at 434. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-505.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Important also <em>to </em>the resolution of this appeal is our decision in <em>Creative Dimensions Group, Inc. v. Hill, </em>16 Va.App. 439, 430 S.E.2d 718 (1993), a case not cited by the commission. Citing <em>Owen, </em>we acknowledged in <em>Hill </em>\u201cthat the degree of vision loss should be determined without regard to any artificial aid or corrective device.\u201d 16 Va.App. at 441, 430 S.E.2d at 720. Indeed, we ruled that \u201c\u2018[t]he Legislature has not required that eye loss be determined on the basis of corrected vision and we have no authority to impose such a requirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445, 430 S.E.2d at 722 (citation omitted). The <em>Hill </em>decision relied upon the following general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201c[L]oss <em>of </em>use should be judged on the basis of uncorrected vision ... and that therefore loss of use will not be ruled out because some correction is achieved. Indeed, an award for total blindness in one eye has been upheld although use of an optical lens had restored a \u2018substantial function of the eye.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">16 Va.App. at 443, 430 S.E.2d at 721 (quoting 2 Arthur Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 58.13(f), at 10-492.140 to .147 (1992) (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The evidence proved that prior to the injury Sinclair\u2019s vision loss measured a reading of 20/80 on Snellen\u2019s Chart. However, his impaired vision did not affect his ability to perform carpentry work until the accident worsened his vision. After the accident, Sinclair\u2019s vision loss measured a reading of 20/300 on Snellen\u2019s Chart. That reading exceeds the 20/200 fraction contained on the Snellen\u2019s Chart of Rule 13, which indicates one hundred percent loss of vision. Although the Snellen\u2019s Chart shown in Rule 13 contains no readings in excess of 20/200, the evidence proves that Sinclair\u2019s post-injury visual acuity reading is 20/300 on Snellen\u2019s Chart. Indeed, the loss of visual acuity in Sinclair\u2019s eye attributable to the accident, i.e., the difference between his pre-existing Snellen\u2019s Chart reading and his post-injury Snellen\u2019s Chart reading is 20/220. That amount exceeds the fraction reading for industrial blindness on the Snellen\u2019s Chart contained in Rule 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Rule 13 states that \u201c[a]ny other deviation from normal vision caused by the injury shall be considered.\u201d By considering Sinclair\u2019s post accident vision acuity of 20/300 to be the same as a reading of 20/200 on the Snellen\u2019s Chart, the commission failed to consider the actual deviation from normal vision. Moreover, as in <em>London, </em>Sinclair has been deprived of 20/20 corrected vision as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">We hold, therefore, that by subtracting Sinclair\u2019s pre-existing vision acuity reading (20/80) from his post-injury vision acuity reading (20/300), the employer is given the benefit of the provision of Code \u00a7 65.2-505 and Sinclair is given the benefit of the deviation from normal vision as required by Rule 13. Accordingly, under a proper application of Rule 13 and Code \u00a7 65.2-505, Sinclair\u2019s loss of visual acuity resulting from the injury far exceeds the minimum threshold for industrial blindness and entitles him to one hundred percent permanent partial disability. Therefore, we reverse the decision of the commission and remand this case to the commission for an award consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
