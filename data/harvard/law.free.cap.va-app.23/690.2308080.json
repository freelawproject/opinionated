We hold that a specific remand for attorney\u2019s fees is required and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">In a prior appeal, <em>O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>20 Va.App. 522, 458 S.E.2d 323 (1995), we affirmed the trial court\u2019s equitable distribution rulings set out in a final decree of divorce entered August 15,1994. No award of or reference to attorney\u2019s fees was included in the remand order. Following the resolution of the appeal, the Clerk of the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>mailed to the parties an order affirming the trial court\u2019s ruling and included an itemized statement of costs for the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Appellant subsequently filed a motion in the trial court for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs she had expended in the appeal. On March 29, 1996, the trial court denied the motion on the ground that the court did not \u201chave jurisdiction to do what [counsel is] asking____ [T]he issue of determination of counsel fees has not been remanded to the trial court for determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in finding that, absent language of a specific mandate remanding the issue to the trial court, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees incurred in an appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AbPI\">This Court\u2019s order disposing of the appeal stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUU\">For reasons stated in writing and filed with the record, the Court is of opinion that there is no error in the judgment appealed from. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. The appellant shall pay to the appellee damages according to law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">This order shall be certified to the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">The Clerk\u2019s itemized statement of costs provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-11\">[A]ppellee shall recover from the appellant <em>costs </em>in this case as follows: Attorney\u2019s fee: (Code \u00a7 14.1-196) $50.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>[and] Appellee\u2019s brief: (Code \u00a7 14.1-182) $60.12.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\">Taxing of costs in this proceeding is <em>not to be considered a determination of an award of attorney\u2019s fees </em>or other costs for services rendered or expenditures made in connection with this appeal to which any party <em>may </em>be entitled in an award by the trial court under the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-99 and 20-103.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The term \u201ccosts\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] pecuniary allowance, made to the successful party (and recoverable from the losing party), for his expenses in prosecuting or defending an action or a distinct proceeding within an action. Generally, \u2018costs\u2019 <em>do not include </em>attorney fees <em>unless such fees are by a statute denominated costs or are by statute allowed to be recovered as costs in the case.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>312 (5th ed. 1979) (emphasis added). The attorney\u2019s fee contemplated by Code \u00a7 14.1-196 is a statutorily mandated \u201ccost.\u201d The Clerk\u2019s itemized statement of costs clearly directs that \u201cMaxing of costs in this proceeding is <em>not to be considered a determination of an award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201d </em>and the Clerk\u2019s statement of costs does not authorize a trial court to award <em>sua sponte </em>attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Additionally, appellant contends that no specific remand is required because Code \u00a7 20-99 gives the trial court authority in a divorce case to award attorney\u2019s fees for the appellate level as it states that \u201c[c]osts may be awarded to either party as equity and justice may require.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-99(5). Appellant asserts that the term \u201ccosts\u201d includes counsel fees and relies primarily on <em>Craig v. Craig, </em>115 Va. 764, 80 S.E. 507 (1914), for the proposition that no specific remand is necessary. In <em>Craig, </em>however, the Supreme Court of Virginia remanded the issue of attorney\u2019s fees specifically \u201cwith leave to counsel for appellee to prosecute their claim for compensation____\u201d <em>Craig, </em>115 Va. at 765, 80 S.E. at 507. Additionally, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Ingram v. Ingram, </em>217 Va. 27, 225 S.E.2d 362 (1976), is misplaced. <em>Ingram </em>dealt with the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees awarded for efforts at trial, not on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Appellant cites no case in which a trial court has awarded attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal without a specific remand and particularized instructions to do so. <em>See Gottlieb v. Gottlieb, </em>19 Va.App. 77, 96, 448 S.E.2d 666, 677 (1994) (\u201cWe remand the case, however, for the limited purpose of determining the amount wife should be awarded for attorney\u2019s fees she incurred in this appeal.\u201d); <em>Via v. Via, </em>14 Va.App. 868, 873, 419 S.E.2d 431, 434 (1992) (\u201c[U]pon remand, the court is directed to enter an appropriate award of attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered to [wife] in the trial court, as well as on appeal.\u201d); <em>Sanford v. Sanford, </em>19 Va.App. 241, 250-51, 450 S.E.2d 185, 190-91 (1994) (\u201cWe remand the case to the trial court for a determination and award of attorney\u2019s fees due [wife] for the enforcement proceeding, including an amount for that part of the appeal devoted to the enforcement.\u201d); <em>see also Hughes v. Hughes, </em>173 Va. 293, 306, 4 S.E.2d 402, 407-08 (1939) (\u201c[W]e reverse the decree of the trial court, and remand the case, ... [t]hat the trial court .... (3) [f]ix a reasonable compensation to be paid counsel for the wife, for services rendered in the trial court and in this court.\u201d); <em>Allen v. Allen, </em>166 Va. 303, 308, 186 S.E. 17, 19 (1936) (\u201cWe think that an additional $100 should be allowed ... the wife\u2019s attorney, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the preparation of the brief and the argument in this court. With the additional order for the payment of the attorney fee allowed, the decree of the lower court is affirmed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The rationale for the appellate court being the proper forum to determine the propriety of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for efforts expended on appeal is clear. The appellate court has the opportunity to view the record in its entirety and determine whether the appeal is frivolous or whether other reasons exist for requiring additional payment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-12\">. Appellant also argues that the trial court further erred in ruling that Code \u00a7 20-99 applies only to fees incurred in connection with support matters. This mischaracterizes the finding of the trial court, stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-13\">But the concept of attorney's fees has always been tied basically to the issue of <em>support for the party needing it. </em>It's got to be\u2014it\u2019s not just a matter of being a penalty for losing. It\u2019s got to be a\u2014it\u2019s got to be some kind of sense of need for support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-14\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-15\">[I]n any other contract dispute or automobile accident case, attorney\u2019s fees are not awarded unless there is some contractual provision or statutory basis for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-16\">And I don't think that the statutory bases that you've pointed out to me is enough to justify departing from the standard rule of support as the determinant in the award of attorney's fees. Accordingly, if I had jurisdiction I would deny the motion and I\u2019ll leave it at that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-17\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\">. Code \u00a7 14.1-196 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">The clerk of the court wherein any party recovers <em>costs </em>shall tax the same.
