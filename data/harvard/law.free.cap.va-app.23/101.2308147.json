Rhodes, Sr. partial disability benefits for permanent hearing loss caused by his employment. Allied Fibers asserts that in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>The Stenrich Group v. Jemmott, </em>251 Va. 186, 467 S.E.2d 795 (1996), Rhodes\u2019 hearing loss is not a compensable disease under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because it is a gradually incurred injury or a cumulative trauma condition. Alternatively, Allied Fibers argues that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations, that the commission erred by remanding the case to the deputy commissioner to take additional evidence on whether Rhodes\u2019 hearing loss is a disease, and that the record does not establish \u201c[b]y clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that [Rhodes\u2019 hearing loss] arose out of and in the course of employment,\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-101. We do not address Allied Fibers\u2019 alternative claims because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jemmotb </em>mandates our holding that gradually incurred industrial hearing loss is a noncompensable, cumulative trauma condition or injury. Accordingly, we reverse the commission\u2019s award and. dismiss Rhodes\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">In awarding Rhodes benefits, the commission relied upon the opinions of Dr. Aristides Sismanis, Dr. W. Copely McLean, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>and Dr. Fred T. Shaia, all of whom diagnosed Rhodes as suffering from bilateral sensorineural hearing loss due to noise exposure. \u201cSensorineural hearing loss originates in the inner ear\u201d or cochlea. Robert A. Dobie, M.D., <em>Medical-Legal Evaluation of Hearing Loss </em>29 (1993). Exposure to noise causes the stereocilia on the outer hair cells in the cochlea to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1o\">lose their stiffness and hence their ability to vibrate in response to sound; this causes a reversible hearing loss (temporary threshold shift, or TTS). After <em>repeated hazardous exposures, </em>the stereocilia become permanently damaged, the hair cell dies, and permanent threshold shift (PTS) occurs. The more intense <em>and prolonged </em>the exposures, the greater the degree of outer hair cell loss. <em>Eventually, </em>inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers will be lost as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 135 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Thus, typical noise-induced hearing loss is a gradually incurred impairment resulting from cumulative trauma.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">Noise damage to sensorineural hearing belongs under the general heading of traumatic injury because it is strictly a physical force. However, it does not fit the classic definition of injury, namely a sudden event produced by immediate trauma.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\"><em>Attorney\u2019s Textbook of Medicine </em>\u00a7 84.65 (Roscoe N. Gray &amp; Louise Gordy, eds., 3d ed., 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In <em>Jemmott, </em>the Supreme Court reiterated that \u201c[a] definition of either \u2018injury\u2019 or \u2018disease\u2019 that is so broad as to encompass any bodily ailment of whatever origin is too broad because it would make unnecessary and meaningless the two categories specifically set forth in the Act.\u201d 251 Va. at 194, 467 S.E.2d at 799-800 (quoting <em>Holly Farms v. Yancey, </em>228 Va. 337, 340-41, 321 S.E.2d 298, 300 (1984)). <em>See also Merillat Indus., Inc. v. Parks, </em>246 Va. 429, 433, 436 S.E.2d 600, 602 (1993). Consequently, the Court rejected <em>The Sloane-Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary </em>definition of disease that we adopted in <em>Piedmont Mfg. Co. v. East, </em>17 Va.App. 499, 438 S.E.2d 769 (1993), as being too broad. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>rejecting a purely medical definition of \u201cdisease,\u201d the Court noted that the meaning of disease under the Act is a mixed question of law and fact, and that \u201cjust because a doctor opines that a particular impairment is a disease does not necessarily make it so.\u201d <em>Jemmott, </em>251 Va. at 198, 467 S.E.2d at 801. The Court further held that \u201can impairment resulting from cumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion ... must be classified as an injury, not a disease, and ... under <em>Merillat, </em>is not compensable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 467 S.E.2d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Rhodes contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Jemmott </em>applies only to cumulative trauma conditions caused by repetitive motion. However, Rhodes \u201coverlooks the fact that the opinion represents a clear refusal \u2018to broaden the scope of the Act to include job-related impairments arising from repetitive motion <em>or cumulative trauma.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>at 199, 467 S.E.2d at 802 (quoting <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 433, 436 S.E.2d at 601-02) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court\u2019s holding is clear and unequivocal, and leaves no doubt that in Virginia cumulative trauma conditions, regardless of whether they are caused by repetitive motion, are not compensable under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Both this Court and the commission have long held that hearing loss caused by exposure to noise at work is a compensable disease. <em>See Bader v. Norfolk Redevelopment &amp; Hems. Auth., </em>10 Va.App. 697, 700, 396 S.E.2d 141, 143 (1990); <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Breeding, </em>6 Va.App. 1, 8-9, 365 S.E.2d 782, 786-87 (1988); <em>Hale v. Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>59 O.I.C. 112 (1981); <em>Mullins v. Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>58 O.I.C. 253 (1978); <em>Lee v. Norfolk Gen. Hosp., </em>57 O.I.C. 226 (1977); <em>Rodahaver v. Allegheny Airlines, </em>56 O.I.C. 270 (1975). However, when the Supreme Court reversed this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jemmott, </em>it also vacated and remanded to this Court <em>Tara K Coal Co. v. Glenn Collier, </em>Record No. 1327-95-3, 1995 WL 686093 (Unpublished, November 21,1995), in which this Court had held that sensorineural hearing loss was proved to be an occupational disease. Viewed in this context, we conclude that the holding in <em>Jemmott </em>logically leads to the conclusion that a hearing impairment resulting from cumulative trauma is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>disease under the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that hearing loss caused by prolonged exposure to noise at work is a noncompensable gradually incurred injury. Accordingly, we reverse the commission\u2019s award of benefits and dismiss the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\">. As a result of <em>Jemmott, </em>Virginia, departs from the course followed by the overwhelming majority of the states in holding that carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) caused by employment and hearing loss caused by exposure to occupational noise are not compensable. <em>See 4 </em>Arthur \u25a0 Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>App. B, Table 12A (1995) (occupational hearing loss). <em>See also </em>Addendum to this opinion (listing states that have allowed employees to recover for CTS caused by employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">We also note that the Indiana Court of Appeals has held that cumulative trauma conditions, including hearing loss, are not occupational diseases under the Indiana workers' compensation scheme. <em>See Duvall </em>v. <em>ICI Americas, Inc., </em>621 N.E.2d 1122, 1124-27 (Ind.Ct.App.1993) (cumulative trauma conditions); <em>Martinez v. Taylor Forge &amp; Pipe Works, </em>174 Ind.App. 514, 368 N.E.2d 1176, 1179-80 (1977) (hearing loss). However, cumulative trauma conditions, such as caipal tunnel syndrome and occupational hearing loss, are compensable under the Indiana Act as injuries because the Indiana courts have interpreted that statutory phrase \"injury ... by accident\" to mean accidental injury and, thus, to include gradually incurred injuries. <em>See Evans v. Yankeetown Dock Corp., </em>491 N.E.2d 969, 973-75 (Ind.1986); <em>Four Star Fabricators, Inc. v. Barrett, </em>638 N.E.2d 792, 795 (Ind.Ct.App.1994); <em>Duvall, </em>621 N.E.2d at 1126. Ordinarily, these decisions would be significant because \"[t]he Virginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is based upon the Indiana statute, so ... the construction placed upon the Indiana law by the courts of that state merits our consideration.\u201d <em>Barksdale v. H.O. Engen, Inc., </em>218 Va. 496, 499, 237 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1977). Nevertheless, although the Virginia definition of \"injury\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-101 employs language nearly identical to that in the Indiana statute, <em>see </em>Ind.Code Ann. \u00a7 22-3-2-2(a) (Burns 1992), by court decision gradually incurred injuries are not compensable under the Virginia Act. <em>Morris v. Morris, </em>238 Va. 578, 589, 385 S.E.2d 858, 865 (1989). We are bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s unequivocal rulings. <em>Roane v. Roane, </em>12 Va.App. 989, 993, 407 S.E.2d 698, 700 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b151-6\">COLEMAN, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ARo\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">I agree with the majority that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>The Stenrich Group v. Jemmott, </em>251 Va. 186, 467 S.E.2d 795 (1996), compels us to hold that sensorineural hearing loss caused by prolonged exposure to noise in the workplace is not a disease. I reach this conclusion, not because hearing loss is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>inconsistent with a definition of disease that the Supreme Court has set forth, but because <em>Jemmott </em>classifies \u201cjob-related impairments arising from repetitive motion <em>or cumulative trauma </em>\u201d as gradually incurred injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 199, 467 S.E.2d at 802 (emphasis added). Accordingly, because occupational hearing loss is consistent with the definition of a gradually incurred injury, it is not a disease, and because gradually incurred injuries that result from cumulative trauma are not compensable under the Act, Walter Rhodes\u2019 hearing loss is not compensable even though it arose out of and in the course of his employment. Although I agree with the majority, I write separately to express my concern that even though today\u2019s decision is mandated by Supreme Court precedent, it is inconsistent, in my opinion, with the expressed intent of the legislature\u2019s 1986 amendment to the Act. Furthermore, the decision is inconsistent with the decisions of the commission and the Court which the legislature did not see fit to change during its 1986 study and revisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">When the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was first enacted in 1918, \u201c[c]ompensation for disease \u2018in any form\u2019 was excluded except Vhere it resulted] naturally and unavoidably from [an] accident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jemmott, </em>251 Va. at 192, 467 S.E.2d at 798. Thus, only diseases that were the consequence of or secondary to an industrial accident were compensable. In 1944, the General Assembly provided a schedule of occupational diseases, and a condition other than an injury by accident was not compensable under the Act unless it was listed in this schedule. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-47 (repealed 1970); <em>Morris v. Morris, </em>238 Va. 578, 584, 385 S.E.2d 858, 862 (1989). The legislature abolished the schedule of compensable diseases in 1952, but then reenacted it in 1958. In 1969, a study committee appointed by the General Assembly recommended eliminating the schedule of diseases. Report of the Virginia Advisory Legislative Council, <em>Matters Pertinent to the Industrial Commission of Virginia, </em>Va.H.Doc. No. 17, at 6 (1969). Significantly, the committee\u2019s recommendation was based on its finding that the schedule was too restrictive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">The schedule of occupational diseases as set out in \u00a7 65.1-47 attempts to be all-inclusive. However, the only possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>effect the schedule can have is to eliminate a disease which may in fact be an occupational disease.... <em>The elimination of the schedule insures the most comprehensive coverage of occupational diseases; </em>yet the employer is not prejudiced because the disease must in fact be an occupational disease, arising out of and in the course of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The General Assembly accepted this recommendation and repealed the schedule of occupational diseases, replacing it with a statutory scheme for coverage of occupational diseases that has remained essentially unchanged since 1970. 1970 Va.Acts. 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Beginning in 1958 and continuing until the legislature eliminated the schedule of occupational diseases in 1970, the schedule included tenosynovitis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>1958 Va.Acts 457. Tenosynovitis, like carpal tunnel syndrome, is a type of tendon-sheath disorder and is \u201cusually caused by the constant repetition of stereotype movements.\u201d David F. Tver &amp; Kenneth A. Anderson, <em>Industrial Medicine Desk Reference </em>282 (1986); <em>see also Lamberson v. Phillips Oldsmobile, Inc., </em>63 O.I.C. 212, 214 (1984) (finding that CTS is \u201cknown as tendinitis or tenosynovitis in the area of the median nerve and the carpal tunnel\u201d). Thus, the schedule of diseases, which was the precursor to the current statutory scheme, was not limited to conditions caused by infectious biological agents or exposure to environmental hazards, but in fact, included a cumulative trauma condition resulting from repetitive motion. Considering the legislative history which shows that the General Assembly eliminated the schedule of diseases for the expressed purpose of expanding rather than restricting coverage of the Act, the interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.2-400 rendered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Supreme Court in <em>Jemmott </em>and applied by us today is not in accord, in my opinion, with the expressed legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Today\u2019s holding departs from prior decisions of the commission and this Court, both of which have held that hearing loss from prolonged exposure to noise is a disease, albeit an ordinary disease of life rather than an occupational disease. Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Western Electric Co. v. Gilliam, </em>229 Va. 245, 329 S.E.2d 13 (1985), the commission routinely awarded claimants benefits for hearing loss caused by exposure to noise at work. <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Breeding, </em>6 Va.App. 1, 8, 365 S.E.2d 782, 786 (1988); <em>see Hale v. Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>59 O.I.C. 112 (1981); <em>Mullins v. Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>58 O.I.C. 253 (1978); <em>Lee v. Norfolk Gen. Hosp., </em>57 O.I.C. 226 (1977); <em>Rodahaver v. Allegheny Airlines, </em>56 O.I.C. 270 (1975). In <em>Gilliam, </em>the Supreme Court held that an ordinary disease of life was not compensable under the Act regardless of its causal connection to the claimant\u2019s employment. Relying on that decision, we held that hearing loss was a noncompensable ordinary disease of life. <em>See Belcher v. City of Hampton, </em>1 Va.App. 312, 338 S.E.2d 654 (1986). Soon after <em>Gilliam </em>was decided, however, the General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 65.2-401<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (formerly Code \u00a7 65.1-46.1), which allows claimants to receive compensation for ordinary diseases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>of life that are sufficiently connected to their employment. The legislative intent in enacting Code \u00a7 65.2-401 was to restore the law as it existed prior to <em>Gilliam. Island Creek Coal, </em>6 Va.App. at 9, 365 S.E.2d at 787; Report of the Joint Subcommittee Studying Workers\u2019 Compensation, H.Doc. No. 27, at 8 (1986). Consequently, we have interpreted Code \u00a7 65.2-401 to provide compensation for gradually incurred hearing loss from prolonged noise exposure as an ordinary disease of life. <em>Bader v. Norfolk Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth, </em>10 Va.App. 697, 700, 396 S.E.2d 141, 143 (1990); <em>Island Creek, </em>6 Va.App. at 8-9, 365 S.E.2d at 786. The General Assembly has not acted to reverse this interpretation. Generally, \u201c[w]e presume that the legislature is cognizant of the interpretation the statute has been given by this Court ... and of the commission\u2019s application of Virginia precedent.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>City of Norfolk v. Lillard, </em>15 Va.App. 424, 430, 424 S.E.2d 243, 247 (1992); <em>see also Peyton v. Williams, </em>206 Va. 595, 600, 145 S.E.2d 147, 151 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201c[t]he General Assembly created the Workers\u2019 Compensation scheme as a carefully balanced societal exchange between the interests of employers, employees, insurers, and the public.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. at 584, 385 S.E.2d at 862. Today\u2019s decision reverses a relatively longstanding practice of both the commission and this Court of awarding benefits for occupational hearing loss, even though the legislature\u2019s approval of treating occupational hearing loss as a compensable disease was reflected in its 1986 amendments to the Act, and subsequent acquiescence to this Court\u2019s interpretation of those amendments. In my view, reversal of the award in this case, which I agree is mandated by <em>Jemmott, </em>does not \u201cadhere to the view that it is peculiarly within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>province of the General Assembly to adjust the balance of competing interests inevitably involved when such a fundamental policy change is contemplated.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. at 588, 385 S.E.2d at 864. Nevertheless, I am constrained to concur in the majority\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Addendum</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Alabama: Ala.Code \u00a7 25-5-1(9) (1975) (injury); <em>Neely Truck Line, Inc. v.
