For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">The facts are uncontested. Mr. Zahid and appellant were married in December 1983. Their son, Raja Zahid Jr., was born December 1986. After they separated, custody of Raja Jr. was determined in an October 19, 1994 hearing in the Fairfax Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court in which both parties were represented by counsel. In a Novem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>ber 9, 1994 order, the judge ordered joint legal and physical custody of Raja Jr. and specified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">The child shall be released to his father\u2019s physical custody on Saturday, October 22, 1994 at 11:00 AM and shall continue to be in his father\u2019s physical custody except for periods of visitation with his mother, as herein outlined, until the second semester begins in the child\u2019s Wisconsin school____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">After this Fall 1994-1995 semester, Raja will live with his mother during the school term each year and his father during the summer school vacation----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">$$$$$$</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">The father shall take or send the child to visit the mother in Wisconsin December 2nd through 4th, 1994. The mother shall have the child with her and is to arrange transportation, etc. for a holiday visit from the day school is out in Virginia through December 29th at 10:00 PM, when she is to return Raja to the father in Virginia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Mr. Zahid took his son to Wisconsin for appellant\u2019s fall visitation on December 2, 1994 and left two plane tickets with appellant so that she could return the child on December 4, 1994 as required by the court order. Appellant failed to return the child to his father. She informed Mr. Zahid that she would not return Raja Jr. because he had an ear infection and she did not want him to travel by air. She later agreed to bring Raja Jr. back by train. Relying on this representation, Mr. Zahid purchased two train tickets for the return trip. Appellant again refused to relinquish the child. Appellant then agreed to deliver the child to Mr. Zahid if the transfer occurred at the Amtrak Station in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on December 9, 1994. Mr. Zahid travelled to Wisconsin, waited for Raja Jr. and appellant at the station, but they never appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">On December 14, 1994, a Wisconsin court enforced the Virginia decree and required appellant to \u201cforthwith and without delay place the child Raja E. Zahid into the actual and</p>\n<p id=\"AqL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>physical custody and control of Raja M. Zahid.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather than comply, appellant absconded with the child to California on December 24, 1994, and then to Colorado four days later. In March 1995, appellant was arrested in Colorado for the abduction of Raja Jr., and returned to Fairfax, Virginia for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">II, JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, appellant moved to strike the evidence and argued <em>inter alia </em>that neither jurisdiction nor venue was properly laid in Fairfax, Virginia, because the place of the child\u2019s abduction was Wisconsin. The trial court denied the motion to strike and stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auc\">The gravamen of [18.2-49.1] is not taking a child. I don\u2019t think the statute even uses the word taking a child or abduction. It says withholding a child. Withholding the child from the child\u2019s custodial parent. And the withholding is where the child\u2019s supposed to be and if the child is supposed to be here, this is where the offense occurs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ1\"><em>* </em>* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">[What makes 18.2-49.1 a felony] is that the child is withheld <em>outside </em>the Commonwealth. But the Commonwealth is where the child was supposed to be and that\u2019s the gravamen of the offense. Both jurisdiction and venue are here because this is where the parent lived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">At the close of all the evidence, the court denied the renewed motion to strike by appellant\u2019s counsel and additionally found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">I didn\u2019t hear any reason why [appellant] went to California or Colorado except to withhold the child ... in violation of the [c]ourt [o]rder. She violated not one, but two [o]rders. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>There was an [o]rder in Virginia and there was one in Wisconsin. The Wisconsin [o]rder was issued after the events that she says occurred, that she says gave her reason to fear that her husband would take the child to Pakistan had occurred. So, whatever those issues were could and should have been raised'in the Wisconsin hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">[S]he got an [o]rder from Wisconsin saying take the child back\u2014give the child back, and she violated that [o]rder as well as the Virginia [ojrder. She knew of the two [o]rders. She intentionally withheld the child without legal excuse. So, it was wrongful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">The violation of the [c]ourt [ojrders was clear and significant. This is the very type of behavior that the statute is designed to prevent. There may be a whole lot of social policy reasons why this ought not to be a felony, but I don\u2019t do social policy; I do law. And she violated the law and I find her guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Appellant argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to try her for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-49.1(A) because her act of withholding the child occurred outside the confines of the Commonwealth. Appellant contends that the locus of where the child is \u201cwith[held] from the child\u2019s custodial parent,\u201d rather than where the custody order was entered, controls jurisdiction. The clear language of the statute contradicts this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">(A) Parental Abduction/Custodial Interference Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">\u201cA primary rule of statutory construction is that courts must look first to the language of the statute. If a statute is clear and unambiguous, a court will give the statute its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Loudoun County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. v. Etzold, </em>245 Va. 80, 85, 425 S.E.2d 800, 802 (1993). The General Assembly specified that Code \u00a7 18.2-49.1(A) applies to any person who withholds a child outside of Virginia from the child\u2019s custodial parent in violation of a Virginia court order, if the custodial parent resides in Virginia. The statutory language demonstrates the General Assembly\u2019s intent to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>criminal an act occurring outside of Virginia that causes harm within.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Subsections A and B of Code \u00a7 18.2-49.1, although similar in language, are different in effect. The legislature outlined two degrees of custodial interference. The degree of offense is determined by the location of the detention or abduction. If it occurs within the territorial boundaries of the Commonwealth, under subsection B, it is a misdemeanor. The act that elevates the offense from a misdemeanor to a felony occurs only when the child is <em>\u201cwithheld </em>\u201d from a custodial parent <em>\u201coutside of the Commonwealth.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-49.1(A) (emphasis added). The gravamen of the offense is the <em>withholding </em>of the child from the custodial parent <em>outside </em>the Commonwealth. The clear intent of the statute is to punish more severely those who withhold a child from its rightful custodian when the detention is accomplished outside of Virginia, thereby further restricting the custodial parent\u2019s ability to retrieve the child. The underlying policy for this statute, like that of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1738A, is to deter, if not prevent, child snatching.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">While we have not previously addressed this precise issue, other jurisdictions with similar statutes hold that the custodial parent\u2019s residence and the place of issuance of the custody decree provide a sufficient jurisdictional nexus regardless of where the actual abduction or detention occurs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>In Vermont, the child custody interference statute provides in pertinent part, \u201c[a] person commits custodial interference by taking, enticing or <em>keeping </em>a child from the child\u2019s lawful custodian.\u201d Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, \u00a7 2451(a) (1995) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court of Vermont, in a factually similar case, construed the statute to \u201cexplicitly contemplate[ ] application to a person who has kept a child outside of Vermont.\u201d The court specifically rejected defendant\u2019s argument that the statute \u201crefers only to those who \u2018snatch\u2019 a child in Vermont and then leave the state to avoid detection,\u201d and found that \u201c[t]he only plausible interpretation of [the statutory] language is that the statute is intended to apply to a person ... who <em>keeps </em>a child <em>outside </em>Vermont when the child\u2019s lawful custodian is a resident of Vermont.\u201d <em>State v. Doyen, </em>\u2014 Vt.\u2014, 676 A.2d 345, 346 (1996) (emphasis added). The court found further grounds for jurisdiction because the result of defendant\u2019s conduct (i.e., the custodial parent losing custody) was \u201cnot incidental to the offense charged, but [was] in fact an element of the offense as defined by statute.\u201d <em>Id., </em>676 A.2d at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In construing the Alaska statute addressing custodial interference, the Court of Appeals of Alaska stated, \u201c[t]he crime of custodial interference was designed to protect any custodian from deprivation of his or her custody rights.\u201d <em>Strother v. State, </em>891 P.2d 214, 220 (Alaska Ct.App.1995). \u201cAlaska\u2019s custodial interference statutes embody the rule that, when a child is entrusted to joint custodians, neither custodian may take exclusive physical custody of the child in a manner that defeats the rights of the other joint custodian.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223. The Alaska statute uses the phrase \u201ctakes, entices, or keeps [a] child ... from a lawful custodian\u201d to describe the prohibited act. The court further held that \u201cif a parent takes custody of the child and exercises that custody in a manner that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>defeats the custody rights of the other parent, unlawfully \u2018keeping\u2019 the child from the other parent, then the parent\u2019s conduct constitutes the actus reus of custodial interference.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 224. We find this analysis equally applicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>(B) Extraterritorial Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Code \u00a7 19.2-239 defines the jurisdiction of the circuit courts of Virginia in criminal cases and provides that \u201c[t]he circuit courts, except where otherwise provided, shall have exclusive original jurisdiction for the trial of all presentments, indictments and informations for offenses committed within their respective circuits.\u201d Generally, charges may be tried only in the circuit courts having territorial jurisdiction over the locations in which the crimes occurred and in which venue is laid. <em>Curtis v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 622, 629, 414 S.E.2d 421, 425 (1992). \u201c[The crime] must take place within this State to give our courts jurisdiction.... Every crime to be punished in Virginia must be committed in Virginia.\u201d <em>Farewell v. Commonwealth, </em>167 Va. 475, 479, 189 S.E. 321, 323 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">While the traditional view of jurisdiction requires a completed intrastate act, the Virginia Supreme Court has addressed the question of jurisdiction to prosecute an offense not fully executed in Virginia but resulting in immediate harm within the Commonwealth. \u201c[A]ctual physical presence in a state is not necessary to make an individual amenable to its criminal laws if the crime is the \u2018immediate result\u2019 of the accused\u2019s act; under such circumstances, the accused may be tried in the state\u2019s courts <em>even though actually absent at the time the act was committed.\u201d Moreno v. Baskerville, </em>249 Va. 16, 19, 452 S.E.2d 653, 655 (1995) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Travelers Health Ass\u2019n v. Commonwealth, </em>188 Va. 877, 891, 51 S.E.2d 263, 268 (1949)). \u201c \u2018It has long been a commonplace of criminal liability that a person may be charged in the place where evil results, though he is <em>beyond the jurisdiction </em>when he starts the train of events of which the evil is the fruit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gregory v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 89, 94, 360 S.E.2d 858, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>861 (1987) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Travelers Health, </em>188 Va. at 892, 51 S.E.2d at 269) (Virginia had jurisdiction because the fraudulent disposal of a truck outside Virginia was contemplated by the statute, where the harm the statute intended to prevent occurs in Virginia, regardless of where the fraudulent intent is formed), <em>aff'd, </em>237 Va. 354, 377 S.E.2d 405 (1989). \u201cWhere harm is caused in Virginia by criminal acts partially committed within this Commonwealth, such acts can be prosecuted here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Jurisdiction may exist where the immediate harm occurs, even if the criminal act does not physically occur there.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Additionally, in defining extraterritorial jurisdiction, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]cts done outside a jurisdiction, but intended to produce and producing detrimental effects within it, justify a state in punishing the cause of the harm as if [defendant] had been present at the effect, if the state should succeed in getting him within its power.\u201d <em>Strassheim v. Daily, </em>221 U.S. 280, 285, 31 S.Ct. 558, 560, 55 L.Ed. 735 (1911). <em>See also United States v. Steinberg, </em>62 F.2d 77, 78 (2d Cir.1932) (no constitutional violation to charge accused in the United States, where he posted fraudulent letter in Canada).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In the instant case, appellant lawfully obtained custody of the child for a limited visitation pursuant to the November 9, 1994 Virginia court order. Appellant willfully violated the valid court order requiring her \u201cto return Raja to the father in Virginia\u201d by originally withholding the child in Wisconsin and later absconding with him to California and Colorado. Even though appellant\u2019s original detention and later removal of the child occurred outside the Commonwealth, the immediate harm of depriving Mr. Zahid of custody of his son occurred within Virginia. Thus, Virginia properly exercised jurisdiction over appellant pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-49.1(A) and 19.2-239.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">III. VENUE</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Lastly, appellant argues that the trial court also erred in finding that venue was properly laid in Fairfax County, because Code \u00a7 19.2-244 does not fix venue at a place other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>than where the crime occurred, and no crime occurred in Virginia. c</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, the prosecution of a criminal case shall be had in the county or city in which the offense was committed.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-244. Venue is reviewed to determine \u201cwhether the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is sufficient to support the [trial court\u2019s] venue findings.\u201d <em>Cheng v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 36, 393 S.E.2d 599, 604 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u201cAt common law the proper venue of a crime was the county where it was committed and this rule has been generally recognized by courts or established by Constitutions. But, in the absence of a constitutional limitation, it is generally held that the Legislature has power to fix the venue of criminal prosecutions in a county or district other than that in which the crime was committed.\u201d <em>Howell v. Commonwealth, </em>187 Va. 34, 40-41, 46 S.E.2d 37, 40 (1948) (citation omitted). To prove venue, the Commonwealth must \u201cproduce evidence sufficient to give rise to a \u2018strong presumption\u2019 that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the court, and this may be accomplished by either direct or circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Cheng, </em>240 Va. at 36, 393 S.E.2d at 604 (quoting <em>Pollard v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 723, 725, 261 S.E.2d 328, 330 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Under Code \u00a7 18.2-49.1(A), the General Assembly clearly provided that venue exists where the crime of custodial interference occurred, i.e., where the harm resulted as a direct and immediate consequence of the violation of the court order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the instant case, the evidence established that Mr. Zahid was a resident of Fairfax County at the time of the abduction and that the child was to be returned to Fairfax County pursuant to a valid and enforceable Fairfax custody order. The harm contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-49.1(A) was clearly established as occurring in this locus. Thus, the trial court properly found venue in Fairfax, Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-13\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-49.1(A) provides that \"[a]ny person who knowingly, wrongfully and intentionally <em>withholds a child from the child\u2019s custodial parent </em>in a clear and significant violation of a court order respecting the custody or visitation of such child, <em>provided such child is withheld outside of the Commonwealth, shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-11\">. Appellant admitted her awareness of the Virginia court order, but attempted to justify withholding Raja Jr. from Mr. Zahid. She alleged that Mr. Zahid slapped her face on December 2, 1994, and told her that she would never see her son again because he planned to take the child to his native country of Pakistan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b483-6\">. <em>See </em>N.J.
