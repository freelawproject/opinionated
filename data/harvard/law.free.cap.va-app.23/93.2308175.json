Defendant complains on appeal that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence resulting from an unlawful search and challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the requisite knowledge and intent to distribute the offending drugs. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">On December 14, 1994, Newport News police executed a search warrant for an apartment occupied by Linda Williams.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The warrant sought evidence pertaining to a robbery and murder unrelated to the instant offense, including <em>\u201ca </em>handgun, ammunition, gold ring ..., cellular telephone and gold chain.\u201d When police entered the residence, defendant, then a visitor seated in the \u201cliving room,\u201d and Ms. Williams were the only persons present. While several officers searched \u201cupstairs,\u201d Detective V.D. Williams and another officer \u201cmaintained visual observation\u201d of defendant and Ms. Williams \u201cdownstairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Shortly after the search commenced, defendant asked Detective Williams for permission to leave the apartment. Because defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t have anything to do with the search warrant ...the detective agreed and defendant proceeded toward the door. It was a \u201ccold day,\u201d and Ms. Williams reminded defendant, clad only in \u201cpants and shirt,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t forget your jacket.\u201d Defendant then \u201cturned around ..., picked up [a] jacket\u201d which was \u201claying across the back portion of a chair\u201d located in the \u201ccenter of the living room,\u201d and exited the apartment. Detective Williams quickly realized that the jacket, which was on the chair when the officers entered the residence, had not yet been searched and stopped defendant \u201cfive steps\u201d beyond the threshold of the apartment. Defendant was holding the jacket in his hand, and the detective, after explaining the need to search it, \u201cobtained\u201d the jacket from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>As Detective Williams began to search, defendant became \u201cvery fidgety\u201d and \u201cstarted towards the jacket,\u201d prompting the detective to \u201ctake a couple of steps back.\u201d Inside the left pocket, Detective Williams discovered \u201ctwo tubes\u201d containing crack cocaine concealed within a \u201cblack glove,\u201d but no paraphernalia with which to ingest the drug. A subsequent search of defendant\u2019s person incidental to arrest revealed $454 in a trouser pocket. Newport News Detective Richard Gaddis testified, without objection, as an \u201cexpert in reference to drugs and their sale and possession.\u201d He noted that the cocaine was \u201ccut\u201d into \u201c50 to 75 rocks,\u201d which \u201cnormally sold on the street individually, ... [at] about 40 bucks a piece,\u201d having an aggregate weight of \u201capproximately 25 grams\u201d and total value of $2,500 to $3,000. Gaddis opined that this quantity of \u201ccut rocks\u201d was inconsistent with the possession of crack cocaine for personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Defendant testified that he had visited with Ms. Williams for only a \u201ccouple of minutes\u201d prior to the arrival of the police. He admitted ownership of the jacket, but denied knowledge of the cocaine, claiming the jacket had been in the residence for several days. Defendant, then unemployed, explained that the cash was his \u201cmother\u2019s rent money,\u201d which, though due on the \u201cfirst of the month,\u201d remained in his possession on December 14 because \u201cshe trusts me.\u201d At the conclusion of defendant\u2019s testimony, the \u25a0 trial court commented that it \u201cjust doesn\u2019t believe\u201d defendant, that he \u201chad no credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">SUPPRESSION OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Upon appeal from a trial court\u2019s refusal to suppress evidence, we must review the record in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, the Commonwealth in this instance, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991); <em>Reynolds v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 430, 436, 388 S.E.2d 659, 663 (1990). The findings of the court will not be disturbed unless \u201cplainly wrong,\u201d <em>Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. at 1067, 407 S.E.2d at 48, and the burden is upon the appellant to show that the disputed ruling constitu\u00ed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ed reversible error. <em>Reynolds, </em>9 Va.App. at 436, 388 S.E.2d at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">It is uncontroverted that the jacket was resting on a chair located in the living room when the police entered the apartment, and defendant conceded that it was subject to search under authority of the warrant. Nevertheless, relying upon <em>Lett v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 191, 372 S.E.2d 195 (1988), he contends that, once police permitted him to take possession of the jacket and remove it from the premises, \u201cthere was no probable cause to search\u201d the garment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, defendant\u2019s argument overlooks evidence that Detective Williams authorized defendant to leave the apartment before defendant claimed or obtained possession of the jacket. Defendant\u2019s attention was first directed to the jacket by Ms. Williams after the detective had acceded to his request. Within moments thereafter, Detective Williams recalled that the jacket had not been searched and stopped defendant, then only a few steps beyond the apartment door, for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Defendant\u2019s implicit assertion that the authority of the search warrant dissipated with his exit from the apartment is without merit. It is well established that \u201c[a] lawful search of premises described in a warrant \u2018extends to. the entire area in which the object[s] of the search may be found----\u2019\u201d <em>Kearney v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 202, 205, 355 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1987) (quoting <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 820, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 2170, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982)). \u201c \u2018[A] search may be as extensive as reasonably required to locate the items described in the warrant.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cA warrant to search a [premises] would support a search of every part of the [premises] that might contain the object of the search.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>456 U.S. at 821, 102 S.Ct. at 2171. Moreover, \u201ca warrant to search ... carries with it the limited authority to detain the occupants of the premises while a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>proper search is conducted.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 705, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 2595, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981). Thus, once the police have initiated a search pursuant to a warrant, persons may not subvert its lawful purposes by removing articles properly within its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Here, in executing the search warrant of Ms. Williams\u2019 residence, the police were directed to a handgun, ammunition, a gold ring, a cellular telephone, and a gold chain. The jacket in issue was initially \u201cbereft of any external indicia of ownership,\u201d clearly a \u201cplausible repository\u201d for those items sought by the police and, concededly, subject to search while it remained within the apartment. <em>See United States v. Gray, </em>814 F.2d 49, 51 (1987). Under such circumstances, it would be absurd to later exclude the jacket from the embrace of the warrant simply because defendant was inadvertently allowed to carry it a few feet beyond the entryway.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Accordingly, we find that a search of defendant\u2019s jacket was within the ambit of the warrant, and the trial court properly admitted the attendant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Defendant further contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction. Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The judgment of a trial court, sitting without a jury, is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will be disturbed only if plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe weight which should be given to evidence and whether the testimony of a witness is credible are questions which the fact finder must decide.\u201d <em>Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Defendant\u2019s conviction required the Commonwealth to prove that he \u201c \u2018intentionally and consciously possessed\u2019 the drug, either actually or constructively, with knowl-</p>\n<p id=\"A6JQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>edge of its nature and character, together with the intent to distribute it.\u201d <em>Wilkins v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 293, 298, 443 S.E.2d 440, 444 (1994) (quoting <em>Josephs v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 87, 99-102, 390 S.E.2d 491, 497-99 (1990) <em>(en </em>banc)). \u201cBecause direct proof of [the] intent [to distribute] is often impossible, it must be shown by circumstantial evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 524, 371 S.E.2d 156, 165 (1988). Circumstances relevant to proof of an intent to distribute include the \u201cquantity of drugs and cash possessed, the method of packaging, and whether [defendant] himself used drugs.\u201d <em>Poindexter v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va. App. 730, 735, 432 S.E.2d 527, 530 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">When the police initially entered the apartment, the jacket was draped over a living room chair. Although defendant was dressed only in \u201cpants and a shirt\u201d and it was \u201ccold outside,\u201d he clearly intended to leave without his jacket. Once reminded of the jacket, however, defendant acknowledged ownership and took possession of it. When confronted by the detective, he became \u201cfidgety\u201d and moved toward the jacket during the search. From such evidence, the trial court properly inferred that defendant entered the residence wearing the jacket and removed and placed it on the chair. Later, the police entered the premises and defendant, aware of the presence and nature of the contraband concealed within, attempted to disassociate himself from it. The record further established that the \u201ccut\u201d and quantity of cocaine were inconsistent with personal use, and no evidence suggested that defendant was a cocaine user. Moreover, the cash discovered on defendant\u2019s person and his untruthfulness to both police and the court were indicative of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Thus, sufficient evidence in the record supports the finding that defendant consciously possessed the cocaine, aware of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>nature and character, together with the requisite intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-8\">.
