Appellant contends that (1) his convictions on multiple counts of operating an illegal gambling establishment violated his rights against twice being placed in jeopardy for the same offense, and (2) the trial court improperly admitted evidence of appellant\u2019s prior felony convictions from Tennessee in the sentencing phase of his bifurcated trial. We disagree with appellant and affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">Appellant and his father conducted an illegal gambling operation in Wise County beginning in November 1994. Virginia ABC Board. Special Agent Johnnie Burke testified that he attended card games conducted by appellant, where bets were placed, on five occasions between November 18,1994 and December 18, 1994. Burke testified that on four separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>occasions\u2014November 18, December 2, December 3, and December 10, 1994, respectively\u2014gross receipts from each gambling enterprise exceeded $2,000. On December 18, 1994, after Agent Burke was in appellant\u2019s establishment for approximately ten minutes, law enforcement officers entered the premises to execute a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The Commonwealth indicted appellant for eight separate offenses. Count 1 alleged that appellant conspired to operate an illegal gambling establishment, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-328. Count 2 alleged that appellant conducted an illegal gambling enterprise in substantial continuous operation for more than thirty days, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-328. Counts 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 each alleged that appellant operated an illegal gambling activity where the gross revenue was $2,000 or more in a single day, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-328. These counts related to the dates of November 18, December 2, December 3, December 10, and December 18, 1994, respectively. Count 8 alleged that appellant unlawfully gambled, a misdemeanor violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-326.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">At a pretrial hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to quash, appellant argued that the Commonwealth improperly charged him -with separate offenses in Counts 2-7, in violation of the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-328 and double jeopardy principles. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion. At appellant\u2019s bifurcated trial, the Commonwealth agreed to <em>nol prosse </em>Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">After hearing evidence, the jury convicted appellant on Counts 3-6\u2014operating an illegal gambling establishment having a gross revenue of at least $2,000, for the dates November 18, December 2, December 3, and December 10, 1994, respectively. Because the evidence did not establish a gross revenue of at least $2,000 for Count 7, appellant was convicted of simple operation of an illegal gambling establishment. The jury also convicted appellant on Count 1 (conspiracy) and Count 8 (misdemeanor gambling). Appellant did not appeal his convictions on Counts 1 and 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>During the trial\u2019s sentencing phase, the Commonwealth presented evidence that in 1987, appellant had been convicted in Tennessee on two counts of attempted felony kidnapping. The conviction orders contained a certification from the deputy clerk of the court but did not contain a judge\u2019s certification. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objection that the sentencing orders were improperly authenticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">At the trial\u2019s punishment phase, the jury recommended (1) a fine of $1,000 for the conspiracy conviction; (2) a one year period of incarceration and a fine of $500 for <em>each </em>of the four charges relating to the operation of a gambling establishment where the gross revenues exceeded $2,000 on a particular day; and (3) a fine of $1,000 for the charge relating to simple operation of a gambling establishment (Count 7). Appellant moved to set aside the verdicts on double jeopardy grounds. The trial court overruled the motion and sentenced appellant in accordance with the jury\u2019s recommendations. Appellant now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">DOUBLE JEOPARDY ARGUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The constitutional prohibition of double jeopardy consists of three separate guarantees: (1) it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2)' it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>Illinois v. Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 415, 100 S.Ct. 2260, 2264-65, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980); <em>Tyler v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 702, 706, 467 S.E.2d 294, 296 (1996). In this case, we concern ourselves with the third guarantee, as appellant argues that he received multiple punishments for one continuing illegal gambling transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Appellant bases his argument on the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-328 (entitled \u201cConducting illegal gambling operation; penalties\u201d), the Code section on which Counts 3 through 7 were predicated. Code \u00a7 18.2-328, in pertinent part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6-\">The operator of an illegal gambling enterprise, activity or operation shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. However, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>such operator who engages in an illegal gambling operation which (i) has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess of thirty days or (ii) has gross revenue of $2,000 or more in any single day shall be fined not more than $20,000 and imprisoned not less than one year nor more than ten years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Appellant contends that the statute\u2019s first sentence addresses the proscribed behavior\u2014namely, the act of operating an illegal gambling enterprise, activity, or operation. A defendant convicted of this offense is guilty of a Class 6 felony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant next asserts that the statute\u2019s second sentence provides two sets of circumstances under which an offender is subject to <em>enhanced punishment. </em>Under appellant\u2019s theory, his five separate convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-328 amounted to unconstitutional multiple punishments for the same offense, which was the one continuing act of operating an illegal gambling enterprise, activity, or operation. While certain aspects of appellant\u2019s argument are correct, his ultimate conclusion on this issue of first impression lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">We agree with appellant that Code \u00a7 18.2-328 proscribes one crime and sets forth that crime\u2019s elements in the first sentence. To convict a defendant under Code \u00a7 18.2-328, the Commonwealth need prove only that the defendant operated an illegal gambling enterprise, activity, or operation. We also agree with appellant that under two sets of circumstances, a defendant may receive an enhanced penalty for operating an illegal gambling enterprise, activity, or operation: (1) where the enterprise operates for over thirty days, or (2) where the enterprise grosses at least $2,000 in a single day.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">None of this means, however, that the Commonwealth cannot charge a defendant with multiple violations of this Code section, using the first sentence as the predicate for the multiple charges. Under appellant\u2019s analysis, a defendant who operated an illegal gambling enterprise for 365 consecutive days, earning daily revenues of over $2,000, would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>guilty of no more criminal conduct than a defendant who operated an illegal gambling enterprise for one night, earning $2,000. This conclusion is untenable. We believe that the General Assembly intended to allow the Commonwealth to elect to charge a defendant with multiple counts of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-328, where the evidence proves that the statute was violated at distinct and separate times. For example, if a person operated an illegal gambling activity on Friday night, was arrested for this offense, and then returned to operate an illegal gambling activity on Saturday night, this person could be indicted for two distinct violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-328. If the person\u2019s activities grossed him or her more than $2,000 on each night, that person would also be subject to two enhanced sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Our analysis is supported by the similar statutory scheme in Code \u00a7 18.2-248, which punishes drug offenses. Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A) states that \u201cit shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture, sell, give, distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture; sell, give or distribute a controlled substance or an imitation controlled substance.\u201d Like the first sentence of Code \u00a7 18.2-328, section (A) sets forth the proscribed crime and provides the crime\u2019s elements. Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) then provides the punishment, stating that any person violating this statute with respect to a Schedule I or II drug shall \u201cbe imprisoned for not less than five nor more than forty years and fined not more than $500,000.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-248(F) provides for alternate punishment, stating that any person violating this statute with respect to a Schedule III, IV, or V drug \u201cshall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\u201d Just as in Code \u00a7 18.2-328, Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A) punishes a criminal act, and sections (C) and (F) provide various degrees of punishment. And just as a defendant may be charged with multiple violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-328, a defendant may be charged with multiple violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-248, when the drug transactions occur at separate times. <em>See, e.g., Able v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 542, 431 S.E.2d 337 (1993) (defendant convicted of two separate counts of cocaine distribution in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248, after undercover officer pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>chased cocaine from defendant on May 10 and May 14, 1991); <em>Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 260, 430 S.E.2d 543 (1993) (defendant convicted of two separate counts of cocaine distribution in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248, after he sold drugs on June 6 and June 8, 1991).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Similarly, as the Commonwealth points out, a defendant may be convicted of multiple violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-256, the narcotics conspiracy statute, even where there was only one agreement to distribute several illegal drugs over a two year period. <em>Wooten v. Commonwealth, </em>235 Va. 89, 368 S.E.2d 693 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u201cConcededly, because [Code \u00a7 18.2-328] is penal in nature, it must be strictly construed, and any ambiguity or reasonable doubt as to its meaning must be resolved in [appellant\u2019s] favor.\u201d <em>Mason, </em>16 Va.App. at 262, 430 S.E.2d at 543. \u201cThis does not mean, however, that [appellant] is entitled to a favorable result based upon an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262, 430 S.E.2d at 544 (quotation and citation omitted). The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the challenged convictions as violative of the double jeopardy prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">INTRODUCTION OF OUT-OF-STATE CONVICTIONS Following appellant\u2019s convictions during the bifurcated trial\u2019s guilt phase, the trial court commenced a \u201cseparate pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>ceeding limited to the ascertainment of punishment\u201d in accordance with Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. \u201cCode \u00a7 19.2-295.1 provides, in pertinent part, that \u2018the Commonwealth shall present\u2019 to the jury during the sentencing phase of a bifurcated trial \u2018the defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions by certified, attested or exemplified copies of the record of conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gilliam v. Commonwealth </em>21 Va.App. 519, 521, 465 S.E.2d 592, 593 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">During the sentencing phase in this case, the Commonwealth introduced two certified conviction orders from the Criminal Court of Sullivan County, Tennessee. Each order stated that appellant had been convicted of \u201cattempt to commit felony of kidnapping\u201d on September 30, 1987. Each order also stated that the Clerk of the Court \u201ccertifiies] that the above and foregoing one page contains a full, true and correct copy of the judgment of Court rendered in the above case, on the day stated, as the same appears of record in my office.\u201d The signature of the criminal court\u2019s deputy clerk appeared in the signature block beneath this statement on each order.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">We hold that the trial court properly admitted these copies of appellant\u2019s conviction records pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. Under prior decisions of this Court, the two orders were properly \u201ccertified\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. For example, in <em>Carroll v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 686, 396 S.E.2d 137 (1990), we held that the Commonwealth did not prove that a prior habitual offender order was properly \u201ccertified\u201d or \u201cauthenticated\u201d where the order did not establish in what capacity a certain \u201cPeggy B. Elmore\u201d signed the order. Here, this problem did not present itself; the orders were signed on behalf of the Clerk of the Criminal Court of Sullivan County by a \u201cKathleen Holt,\u201d Deputy Clerk. <em>See Durrette v. County of Spotsylvania, </em>22 Va.App. 122, 468 S.E.2d 128 (1996) (discussing attestation requirements); <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 506, 413 S.E.2d 75 (1992) (discussing authentication requirements); <em>Owens v. Commonwealth </em>10 Va.App. 309, 391 S.E.2d 605 (1990) (holding that a conviction order was properly certified and attested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>where it was stamped \u201cA COPY, TESTE: WILLIAM T. RYAN, CLERK\u201d and undersigned by the deputy clerk). We find unpersuasive appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court should have applied the more stringent certification requirements of Code \u00a7 8.01-389(AI), a statutory section contained in the \u201cCivil Remedies and Procedures\u201d title of the Code when a specific statute, Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, merely requires that the order be \u201ccertified, attested <em>or </em>exemplified.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\">. A Class 6 felony carries a term of imprisonment ranging from zero to five years and/or a maximum $2,500 fine. Code \u00a7 18.2\u201410(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b435-8\">. In <em>Mason, </em>the defendant received an enhanced punishment, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) on his second offense, which had been committed two days after the first offense. Appellant contended that he was not subject to enhanced punishment because he had not been convicted previously of a drug offense before he was tried for the second offense. We rejected this argument and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">To construe the statute as Mason suggests would enable an offender to engage in a spree of drug sales over an extended period of time prior to his apprehension and to receive the status of a first offender as to each violation. Such an interpretation would be contrary to the clear legislative intent and unreasonably restrictive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-10\"><em>Mason, </em>16 Va.App. at 263, 430 S.E.2d at 544 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">We believe that the same logic holds in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b437-10\">. At the time of trial, Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A1) required that records of other states must be certified by the judge in addition to the clerk to be admissible. Since that time, the statute has been amended to eliminate the requirement that the judge certify the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b437-7\">COLEMAN, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Av5\">concurring in part, dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">I concur in Part II of the majority decision. However, in my opinion, the trial court erred during the sentencing phase of the bifurcated trial by admitting two documents which purported to be conviction orders from the Criminal Court of Sullivan County, Tennessee. These orders had not been properly authenticated as required by Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A1), as it read at the time of trial. Therefore, I dissent from the holding in Part III of the majority\u2019s opinion and would remand the case for resentencing by another jury in accordance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">A written order or record of a judicial proceeding from another court that is offered to prove the content of the document is hearsay and is inadmissible evidence unless authorized by statute or by a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See Owens v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 309, 311, 391 S.E.2d 605, 607 (1990)(\u201c \u2018[t]he underlying rationale which justifies admitting facts contained in official records as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>exception to the hearsay rule is that the concern for reliability is largely obviated because the nature and source of the evidence enhance the prospect of its trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Ingram v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va.App. 335, 338, 338 S.E.2d 657, 658-59 (1986))). Code \u00a7 8.01-389 provides that a properly authenticated and certified record of a court or judicial proceeding \u201cshall be received as prima facie evidence\u201d of the record. Thus, this statute codifies as part of the official records exception to the hearsay rule judicial \u201crecords\u201d which are properly authenticated, <em>Owens, </em>10 Va.App. at 311, 391 S.E.2d at 607; and, it also provides how records from courts of the Commonwealth and foreign jurisdictions are to be authenticated and certified; and it further codifies the legislature\u2019s recognition of. the constitutional requirement that Virginia courts shall give full faith and credit to the judgments of the courts of a sister state. Moreover, Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A1) provides that an official record of a court of another state shall be \u201cauthenticated by the clerk of the court where preserved to be a true record, <em>and similarly certified by a judge of that court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Where, as here, the required certification by a judge of the Criminal Court of Sullivan County, Tennessee was missing, the order was not properly authenticated as required by Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A1) and it should not have been admitted into evidence. <em>See Carroll v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 686, 396 S.E.2d 137 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The majority concludes that the more stringent double authentication or exemplification requirements of Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A1), as it read at the time of appellant\u2019s trial, did not control in this case because Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, which is a specific statute, requires only that the order be \u201ccertified, attested <em>or </em>exemplified.\u201d (Emphasis added). The majority concludes that Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 permits the admission of an order from any jurisdiction that has been certified or attested without the required double certification necessary to exemplify a foreign judgment order. The majority reasons that Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, which contains no requirement for double certification, is the statute that specifically deals with the admission of judgment orders in sentencing proceedings, therefore, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>controls over Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A1), the general statute controlling the certification, attestation, and exemplification of orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">This is not a situation, however, in which two statutes deal with the same subject matter and, therefore, the principles of statutory construction require that the specific statute controls over the general statute. Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 does not address and does not govern <em>how </em>judicial records are to be certified, authenticated, or exemplified\u2014authentication being the necessary requirement to establish trustworthiness of a document in order to qualify it under the official records hearsay exception. Instead, Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 merely specifies that a defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions are admissible in the bifurcated sentencing procedure and shall be proven by certified, attested or exemplified copies of the record of conviction; this statute does not undertake to define <em>how </em>records are to be \u201ccertified, attested or exemplified.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-389 is the only statute that controls how judicial records are to be \u201ccertified, attested or exemplified\u201d in order to be admissible. In order for a judicial record to be \u201ccertified, attested or exemplified\u201d so as to be admissible the proponent of the evidence must comply with the requirements of Code \u00a7 8.01-389, which the Commonwealth failed to do in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Accordingly, I would hold that error occurred during the sentencing phase of the trial, which error was not harmless, and I would remand this case to the trial court for resentencing by a jury empaneled in accordance with Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b437-11\">. In 1996 Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A1) was amended. Under the revised statute, the Tennessee orders with only a single certification would be admissible. Thus, although the orders would now be admissible on remand, they were inadmissible at the time of trial, in my opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
