Martin, Assistant Attorney General (James S. Gilmore, III, Attorney General, on brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-5\">Present: FITZPATRICK and ANNUNZIATA, JJ., and DUFF, Senior Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b469-6\">ANNUNZIATA, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Page County, appellant, Terry Roger Skipper, Jr., was convicted of forcible rape and forcible sodomy. Appellant was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment on each charge, and the trial court suspended ten years of the sodomy sentence. We awarded appellant an appeal limited to the question \u201cwhether the trial court erred by limiting <em>voir dire </em>of the jurors so as to deny appellant a fair trial.\u201d Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Appellant was charged with the forcible rape and forcible sodomy of a sixteen-year-old female. On the morning of trial, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a motion requesting that \u201cthe rights of the venire be protected by enlarging the time and questions of defense counsel during <em>voir dire.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">The court agreed with the contention of appellant\u2019s counsel that effective <em>voir dire </em>could be accomplished only through counsel\u2019s interaction with prospective jurors. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-358. The court also stated that it would allow appellant\u2019s counsel to ask any question \u201cthat has a tendency to elicit whether or not a juror can be fair and impartial.\u201d However, the court stated that it would not allow counsel to conduct individual <em>voir dire </em>unless a juror\u2019s response required it.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The court then requested counsel to submit their proposed <em>voir dire </em>questions for the court to review and rule on out of the presence of the jury. In so doing, the court intended to preclude objections and arguments during the course of <em>voir dire. </em>In addition to counsel\u2019s <em>voir dire, </em>the court stated that it would ask the \u201ctraditional questions\u201d from the judge\u2019s bench book and would prepare a questionnaire for the jurors so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>they could privately address whether they or anyone in their family had been the victim of sexual assault or had been accused of such an offense. The court reiterated its practice of withholding questions of individual jurors until it had received individual responses. Appellant raised no objection to the court\u2019s proposed procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u2022 Appellant\u2019s counsel submitted four questions to the court, the following two of which are at issue on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azn\">(1) Can anyone imagine why a not-guilty person would not testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">(2) Who has children? For those with children, have you ever caught them in a he to excuse what they were not permitted to do?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The court ruled that the first question was too general and refused to permit its presentation to the jury. In lieu of the proffered question, the court stated that it would instruct potential jurors that a defendant was not required to take the stand, and it would ask whether that fact would affect the jurors\u2019 ability to sit fairly and impartially. Appellant\u2019s counsel declined the court\u2019s offer, stating that he wanted to ask a broad question to determine the jurors\u2019 attitudes, beliefs, and biases. The court ruled that the question as framed was inappropriate. During <em>voir dire, </em>the court asked the potential jurors whether they could accept and follow the law that the defendant is not required to produce any evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">The court stated that it did not understand the purpose of the other question at issue. In response, appellant\u2019s counsel proffered the defense\u2019s theory of the case: that the young victim lied to her mother about having been sexually assaulted because she had been engaged in prohibited conduct at the time of the alleged offense. Appellant\u2019s counsel stated that he wanted to ask individual follow-up questions to determine the circumstances surrounding any lies told by the prospective jurors\u2019 children, again intending to elicit juror \u201cbias\u201d or \u201cprejudice.\u201d The court refused the proposed question, finding that it was irrelevant to determining the prospective jurors\u2019 ability to be fair and impartial. During <em>voir dire, </em>however, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>allowed appellant\u2019s counsel to ask whether any potential jurors had children. The court then asked the jurors with children whether the fact that they had children would affect their ability to sit fairly and impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">At the close of <em>voir dire, </em>appellant\u2019s counsel reiterated his objection to the scope of <em>voir dire. </em>He argued that the court\u2019s refusal to allow him to ask the questions as proffered prevented him from inquiring into the prospective jurors\u2019 \u201cattitudes and beliefs\u201d and, as a result, both he and the Commonwealth could make their peremptory strikes only on the basis of impermissible stereotypes in violation of <em>J.E.B. v. Alabama, </em>511 U.S. 127, 114 S.Ct 1419, 128 L.Ed.2d 89 (1994).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s limitation on the scope of <em>voir dire </em>denied him his right to trial by an impartial jury under Article 1, \u00a7 8 of the Virginia Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. However, appellant does not rely on the law developed under these two constitutional provisions to support his argument. Rather, appellant contends that the scope of <em>voir dire </em>is defined and governed in this case by equal protection principles and rules enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), and its progeny. Appellant argues specifically that the trial court\u2019s limitation on <em>voir dire </em>in the present case compelled the parties to make their peremptory strikes based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>on impermissible stereotypes and, therefore, violated his right to trial by an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In support of his position that equal protection principles govern this case, appellant cites <em>J.E.B. v. Alabama, </em>511 U.S. 127, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 128 L.Ed.2d 89 (1994), in which the United States Supreme Court held that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits discrimination in jury selection on the basis of gender. Specifically, appellant posits his claim that equal protection principles govern this Court\u2019s review of claimed error made in conducting <em>voir dire </em>on the following statement of the <em>J.E.B. </em>Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">If conducted properly, <em>voir dire </em>can inform litigants about potential jurors, making reliance upon stereotypical and pejorative notions about a particular gender or race both unnecessary and unwise. <em>Voir dire </em>provides a means of discovering actual or implied bias and a firmer basis upon which the parties may exercise their peremptory challenges intelligently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\"><em>J.E.B., </em>511 U.S. at \u2014, 114 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The language from <em>J.E.B </em>relied upon by appellant does not support his contention. Rather, <em>J.E.B. </em>simply recognizes the logical and practical consequence of <em>Batson </em>and its progeny; if peremptory strikes must now be explained, it follows that <em>voir dire </em>of the venire will be the primary tool by which parties will gather information about the venire to explain their choices. Moreover, in reviewing <em>J.E.B. </em>in its entirety, we find it does not mandate a constitutionally grounded, expanded scope of <em>voir dire </em>and does not displace, either explicitly or implicitly, constitutional principles governing the scope of <em>voir dire. </em>Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has specifically underscored the distinction which must be made between Fourteenth Amendment and Sixth Amendment principles as they apply to <em>voir dire. See Holland v. Illinois, </em>493 U.S. 474, 487, 110 S.Ct. 803, 811, 107 L.Ed.2d 905 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">That <em>voir dire </em>\u201cplays a critical function\u201d in ensuring juror impartiality has long been recognized under Virginia law. <em>See Reynolds v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 157, 164, 367 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>S.E.2d 176, 180 (1988) (citation omitted). The principles which govern the review of error in the trial court\u2019s conduct of <em>voir dire </em>are likewise well-established. <em>See Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 513, 523, 273 S.E.2d 36, 42 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1011, 101 S.Ct. 2347, 68 L.Ed.2d 863 (1981) (\u201cUnless the [court\u2019s] refusal to ask a question amounts to a denial of due process or otherwise impinges upon the right to a fair and impartial jury ... a trial court [may] use its discretion in determining whether to ask questions proposed by either the Commonwealth or the defendant\u201d) (citations omitted). These principles require that a trial court \u201cafford a party a \u2018full and fair\u2019 opportunity to ascertain whether prospective jurors \u2018stand indifferent to the cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buchanan v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 389, 401, 384 S.E.2d 757, 764 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1063, 110 S.Ct. 880, 107 L.Ed.2d 963 (1990) (quoting <em>LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 581, 304 S.E.2d 644, 653 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063, 104 S.Ct. 744, 79 L.Ed.2d 202 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">However, proper limitations on a party\u2019s right to examine prospective jurors may be imposed. \u201c \u2018[A] party has no right, statutory or otherwise, to propound any question he wishes, or to extend <em>voir dire </em>questioning <em>ad infinitum.\u2019 \u201d Chichester v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 311, 325, 448 S.E.2d 638, 647 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 115 S.Ct. 1134, 130 L.Ed.2d 1095 (1995) (quoting <em>LeVasseur, </em>225 Va. at 581, 304 S.E.2d at 653); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-358 (counsel has right to ask \u201cany relevant question to ascertain whether [a prospective juror] is related to either party, or has any interest in the cause, or has expressed or formed any opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice therein\u201d). A trial court\u2019s decision regarding the scope of <em>voir dire </em>is a matter committed to the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion, which will be upheld on appeal \u201c[w]here [the trial court] affords ample opportunity to counsel to ask relevant questions and where the questions [it] actually propound[s] ... [are] sufficient to preserve a defendant\u2019s right to trial by a fair and impartial jury.\u201d <em>Buchanan, </em>238 Va. at 401, 384 S.E.2d at 764. The objecting party bears the burden of demonstrating that the trial court abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>discretion in limiting the scope of <em>voir dire, see Chichester, </em>248 Va. at 325, 448 S.E.2d at 647, and must show that the jury panel lacked impartiality or that the jury selection process the court employed was prejudicial. <em>See Beavers v. Commonwealth, </em>245 Va. 268, 277, 427 S.E.2d 411, 418, <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 859, 114 S.Ct. 171, 126 L.Ed.2d 130 (1993). These principles remain unchanged by <em>J.E.B. </em>and our decisions decided under it. <em>See, e.g., Riley v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va. App. 330, 464 S.E.2d 508 (1995) (addressing Equal Protection principles, not whether scope of <em>voir dire </em>was proper).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">We find that the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to appellant\u2019s proposed questions did not deprive appellant of trial by an impartial jury, nor did the selection process prejudice appellant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">Trial courts are not required to allow counsel to ask questions which are so ambiguous as to render the answers meaningless. To be permissible, counsel\u2019s questions must be relevant in that they are such as would necessarily disclose or clearly lead to the disclosure of relationship, interest, opinion, or prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\"><em>Buchanan, </em>238 Va. at 401, 384 S.E.2d at 764 (citations omitted). In <em>Buchanan, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow the defendant\u2019s counsel to ask the following question: \u201cFrom what you have read or heard about this case in the newspapers, what impression do you have about this case?\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained its reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">To ask a prospective juror his impression of a case may, through a circuitous route, lead finally to a disclosure of opinion or prejudice. But, as noted above, to be relevant, a question to a prospective juror must necessarily disclose or clearly lead to the disclosure of opinion or prejudice. We do not think the ... question is of that kind. It is ambiguous and unfocused. It does not, for example, ask whether, based on news coverage, the prospective juror had formed an impression as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, or an impression as to whether defendant should or should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>executed, or an impression as to whether defendant was justified in his actions. Instead, Buchanan\u2019s proposed question appears to be an invitation to a rambling discourse on a broad range of emotions. In short, the start of a fishing expedition. However, to launch upon a fishing expedition of a prospective juror\u2019s general feelings about a case is not the aim of <em>voir dire. </em>The question was properly rejected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 402, 384 S.E.2d at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We adopt this reasoning in affirming the trial court\u2019s action in the present case. Asking jurors whether they could \u201cimagine\u201d why an accused would not take the stand is strikingly similar to \u201can invitation to a rambling discourse on a broad range of emotions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree with the trial court that such a question was ambiguous and unfocused and its rejection did not deny appellant his right to an impartial jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">We also find no basis for appellant\u2019s contention that he was denied an impartial jury because the trial court refused his request to ask whether any prospective juror having children \u201cever caught them in a lie to excuse what they were not permitted to do,\u201d and under what circumstances. Appellant was permitted to inquire as to which prospective jurors had children. Additionally, the court inquired whether the fact that a juror had children would affect that juror\u2019s ability to sit impartially. While the question appellant proffered to the court was related to his theory of the defense, we cannot say his inquiry, framed so broadly, would \u201cnecessarily disclose or clearly lead to the disclosure\u201d of partiality, bias, or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">In short, the record fully supports the trial court\u2019s decision to refuse to allow appellant to ask the questions at issue on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nothing in the record suggests that the trial court\u2019s limitation on the scope of <em>voir dire </em>denied appellant an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Accordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\">. At trial, appellant also objected to the Commonwealth\u2019s peremptory strikes on the ground that they were gender-based in violation of <em>J.E.B. </em>The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objection. Appellant limited his appeal to the following question: \u201cWhether the trial court erred by limiting <em>voir dire </em>of the jurors so as to deny appellant a fair trial.\u201d Accordingly, we decline to address whether the strikes violated <em>J.E.B.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-9\">. \u201d[I]n criminal prosecutions a man ... shall enjoy the right to a ... trial[ ] by an impartial jury____\u201d Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b471-11\">. \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a trial[ ] by an impartial jury____\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\">. Furthermore, the trial court inquired of the prospective jurors whether they would be able to abide by the law that appellant was not required to produce evidence in the case. This inquiry was sufficient to ferret out a prospective juror\u2019s inability to render a verdict unaffected by appellant's failure to present evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b476-14\">. In his brief, appellant also complains that the trial court \u201cbarred any interaction [between appellant\u2019s counsel and the jury] unless the <em>[voir dire </em>] question was in writing, previously approved by the Court, and, most likely, communicated by the trial judge instead of the lawyer.\u201d As such, appellant complains that he was precluded from asking other specific questions. Appellant has no grounds to complain. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18. The trial court asked that the proposed <em>voir dire </em>questions be presented in writing for its review, to preempt objections and arguments in front of the jury during <em>voir dire. </em>Appellant did not object. Furthermore, appellant failed to raise in the trial court the questions he now claims he was precluded from asking. Finally, it is clear from the record that appellant was not prevented from asking any relevant follow-up questions. The court stated that it would allow appellant to ask <em>any </em>question relevant to determining juror bias.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
