Appellant exited his truck completely nude. Boone told him to stop but appellant reentered his truck and sped off. Boone pursued but lost sight of appellant. Officer John J. Kiernen (Kiernen) became involved in the pursuit and chased appellant to the intersection of Route 29 and Waples Mill Road, where appellant\u2019s truck struck another pickup truck. After the crash, appellant again left his truck, and Kieman instructed him not to move. Appellant attempted to run from the accident, and Kieman tackled and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Mark H. Griffin (Griffin), the driver of the track that was hit, was carrying two passengers, Alan Cox (Cox) and Laura Wakefield (now Laura Griffin) (Wakefield). Griffin, Cox, and Wakefield were all taken to Fairfax Hospital for treatment of their injuries caused by the accident. Griffin sustained the \u201clife threatening\u201d injuries of a cerebral contusion and a bruis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ing of the brain. Cox suffered a fracture of his twelfth thoracic vertebra, a fracture of the end of his ulnar bone, a minor concussion, and a cerebral concussion. Cox wore an arm cast and a partial body brace for more than three months and was continuing rehabilitation at the time of trial. Wake-field sustained lacerations of an upper eyelid and finger, contusions of her chest and abdominal walls, and a mild cerebral concussion. The victims were hospitalized for five, four, and three days respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">At trial, the trial court denied each of the Commonwealth\u2019s proffered jury instructions defining \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d The court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">I believe that Virginia is a state ... [in which] words that don\u2019t need defining we don\u2019t define, words like preponderance of the evidence we do because it\u2019s not an ordinary parlance meaning word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">But constantly the jury comes back and asks about the meaning of words in our instructions and we constantly tell them to their everlasting distress, words are given their ordinary meaning in [E]nglish and we don\u2019t define them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">And I think to try to define words that haven\u2019t been previously defined and that have a meaning to people or otherwise it would be to[o] vague to be in a statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Appellant argues that Code \u00a7 46.2-817 is unconstitutionally vague and violates his right to due process because the phrase \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d does not give a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited and invites arbitrary enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">\u201cIt is a basic rule of statutory construction that a word in a statute is to be given its everyday, ordinary meaning unless the word is a word of art.\u201d <em>Stein v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 65, 69, 402 S.E.2d 238, 241 (1991). <em>See also Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 533 (1994) (holding \u201cemotional distress\u201d constitutional because it is a \u201ccommon and well-recognized legal term that has been judicially narrowed by existing Virginia law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>In analyzing a void-for-vagueness argument, we employ a two-pronged test. \u201c \u2018[A]n act creating a statutory offense ... must specify with reasonable certainty and definiteness the conduct which is commanded or prohibited, that is, what must be done or avoided, so that a person of ordinary intelligence may know what is thereby required of him.\u2019\u201d <em>Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 228, 235, 380 S.E.2d 17, 21 (1989) (quoting <em>Hancock v. Cox, </em>212 Va. 215, 218, 183 S.E.2d 149, 151 (1971)). Additionally,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">the statutory language must not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. [This] ... \u201cmore important aspect of [the] vagueness doctrine\u201d ... forbids the impermissible delegation of \u201c \u2018basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory applications.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\"><em>Commonwealth v. Carter, </em>21 Va.App. 150, 153-54, 462 S.E.2d 582, 584 (1995) (citations omitted). \u201cWhen, as here, a statutory challenge does not implicate a constitutionally protected right, the \u2018narrow question is whether [the legislation] is vague as applied to the defendant[\u2019s] conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153, 462 S.E.2d at 584 (quoting <em>Woodfin v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 89, 92, 372 S.E.2d 377, 379 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1009, 109 S.Ct 1649, 104 L.Ed.2d 163 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Applying this standard, we hold that the phrase \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d is not unconstitutionally vague. The statute satisfies the two-pronged void-for-vagueness analysis because: (1) ordinary individuals are placed on notice as to what behavior is proscribed, and (2) the language is specific enough so that it does not unduly encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. Moreover, the phrase \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d has been used in other Virginia statutes and case law. <em>See, e.g., Pancoast v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 28, 33, 340 S.E.2d 833, 836 (1986) (\u201cThe common law defense of duress excuses acts which would otherwise constitute a crime, where the defendant shows that the acts were the product of threats inducing a reasonable fear of immediate death or serious bodily injury.\u201d); <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 983, 986, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>252 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1979) (holding that in rape cases, a victim must prove non-consent by physically resisting, but need not \u201c \u2018resist to the utmost of her physical strength, if she reasonably believes resistance would be useless and result in serious bodily injury to her\u2019 \u201d). <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-371 and 18.2-369. Additionally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining both that appellant was placed on notice as to what conduct the statute proscribed and that the injuries that appellant inflicted were sufficiently grave to constitute \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">. Appellant was also convicted of driving with a revoked operator's license after having been adjudicated an habitual offender, and failing to stop after an accident. Appellant also pled guilty to driving while intoxicated (third or subsequent offense within ten years). These convictions are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">. Code \u00a7 46.2-817, the speeding to elude statute, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">Any person who, having received a visible or audible signal from any law-enforcement officer to bring his motor vehicle to a stop, drives such motor vehicle in a willful or wanton disregard of such signal so as to interfere with or endanger the operation of the law-enforcement vehicle or endanger other property or a person, or who increases his speed and attempts to escape or elude such law-enforcement officer, shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">If <em>serious bodily injury </em>to another results from a violation of the preceding paragraph, the offender shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.
