The dispositive issue in both cases is whether the trial court erred in finding that it had no jurisdiction to consider an appeal of the seven-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>day suspension of each appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license under Code \u00a7 46.2-891.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Both appellants were arrested for driving while intoxicated in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, Nicely on May 17, 1995 and Via on June 2, 1995. Each appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended for seven days pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2. Both requested the general district court to review the license suspension and to issue a witness subpoena for the arresting officer. The general district court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to quash the subpoena for the arresting officer and affirmed the suspension of each appellant\u2019s license. Appellants then appealed to the circuit court and moved to dismiss the underlying driving while intoxicated charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The circuit court found that it had no jurisdiction to consider either appellant\u2019s appeal or motion to dismiss. Appellants argued that the general district court\u2019s affirmance of the seven-day suspension of their drivers\u2019 licenses pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 constituted a final, appealable decision. The circuit court determined that no criminal appellate jurisdiction existed under Code \u00a7 16.1-132 because \u201cnone of the appeal predicates for appeal [were] present.\u201d Additionally, the circuit court found that no civil appellate jurisdiction existed under Code \u00a7 16.1-106 because the general district court\u2019s order was interlocutory in nature and thus not appeal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>able. The court dismissed both appeals without prejudice and remanded the cases to the general district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2(A) requires the automatic seven-day suspension of the driver\u2019s license of any person arrested for driving while intoxicated if the driver fails a breath test administered pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, or any person who refuses to take a breath test as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-268.3. \u201c[W]hen the driver either fails the breath test or refuses to take it, he or she is taken before a magistrate and a warrant is issued for the driver\u2019s arrest. Upon issuance of the warrant, the magistrate automatically suspends the accused\u2019s driving privilege [for seven days] pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2.\u201d <em>Tench v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 200, 203, 462 S.E.2d 922, 923 (1995) (en banc). \u201cAny person whose license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle has been suspended ... may, during the period of the suspension, request the <em>general district court </em>of the jurisdiction in which the arrest was made to review that suspension.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2(0 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In <em>Tench, </em>we characterized the automatic seven-day suspension of a driver\u2019s license under Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 as a \u201ccivil license suspension.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204, 462 S.E.2d at 923. In determining whether the automatic license suspension violated the double jeopardy clause, we held that an \u201cautomatic license suspension under Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 is a remedial sanction because its purpose is to protect the public from intoxicated drivers and to reduce alcohol-related accidents. Therefore, the sanction of license suspension does not constitute punishment for purposes of double jeopardy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205-06, 462 S.E.2d at 924 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The Supreme Court recently put to rest any remaining question on the issues of double jeopardy, collateral estoppel, res judicata, and estoppel by judgment in the context of the administrative suspension of a driver\u2019s license pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2. <em>See Brame v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 122, 476 S.E.2d 177 (1996) and <em>Simmons v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 118, 475 S.E.2d 806 (1996). In <em>Brame, </em>the Court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>that \u201cthe remedial purpose of Virginia\u2019s seven-day administrative suspension provision is so clear and compelling that it overrides any incidental punitive effect the provision may have.\u201d Therefore, even where the Court assumed \u201cwithout deciding that Brame\u2019s two sanctions resulted from the same incident and that the subsequent sanction was imposed in a separate proceeding ... [defendant\u2019s] rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause were not violated by the subsequent judicial suspension of his license for one year.\u201d <em>Brame v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 122, 125-26, 132, 476 S.E.2d 177, 179, 183 (1996). Additionally, the Supreme Court of Virginia has recognized that the suspension or revocation of a license is not \u201can added punishment for the offense committed. It is civil and not criminal in nature.\u201d <em>Prichard v. Battle, </em>178 Va. 455, 462,17 S.E.2d 393, 395 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u2018\u201cA primary rule of statutory construction is that courts must first look to the language of the statute. If a statute is clear and unambiguous, a court will give the statute its plain meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tross v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 362, 377-78, 464 S.E.2d 523, 530 (1995) (quoting <em>Loudoun County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. v. Etzold, </em>245 Va. 80, 85, 425 S.E.2d 800, 802 (1993)). Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 provides that, during the period of suspension, the general district court may review the administrative suspension of a driver\u2019s license. However, Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 does not provide a further right of review in the circuit court. To resolve whether a driver may appeal that suspension beyond the general district court, we must decide whether the administrative suspension of a driver\u2019s license pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 is a final adjudication subject to appeal in the circuit court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u201cA final order is one that disposes of the whole subject, gives all the relief contemplated, and leaves nothing to be done in the cause save to superintend ministerially compliance with the order.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Morgan, </em>19 Va.App. 538, 540, 452 S.E.2d 370, 371 (1995). When a driver\u2019s license is suspended pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2, the suspension is a temporary sanction \u201cto protect the public from [an] intoxicated driver[ ] and to reduce alcohol-related accidents.\u201d <em>Tench, </em>21 Va.App. at 205, 462 S.E.2d at 924. A driver whose license is suspended under Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 must still face trial on the underlying criminal charges and any punishment upon conviction. The administrative suspension of a driver\u2019s license for failing a breath test or refusing to take one is not a final adjudication of criminal charges, but merely an administrative civil sanction designed to remove the driver from the highways of this state. It is subject only to the administrative review allowed by Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 to the general district court. Thus, the circuit court in these cases properly found that it did not have jurisdiction to review the seven-day suspension of appellants\u2019 licenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Simmons v. Commonwealth </em>controls the instant case. The Court declared that \u201cby no stretch of the imagination can it be said that an administrative suspension of an operator\u2019s license for failure to take a blood or breath test is a <em>judgment </em>rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction. What is involved is neither more nor less than the term administrative suspension implies, an administrative act, not a <em>judgment </em>by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Simmons v. Commonwealth, 252 </em>Va. 118, 120-21, 475 S.E.2d 806, 807 (1996). It necessarily follows that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>general district court\u2019s affirmance of the administrative suspension is <em>not &amp; judgment </em>of the general district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Additionally, Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-106 and 16.1-132 set forth the relevant appellate jurisdiction of the circuit courts. Code \u00a7 16.1-106 provides the civil appellate jurisdiction of the circuit courts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">From any order entered or judgment rendered in a court not of record in a civil case in which the matter in controversy is of greater value than fifty dollars, exclusive of interest, any attorney\u2019s fees contracted for in the instrument, and costs, or when the case involves the constitutionality or validity of a statute of the Commonwealth, or of an ordinance or bylaw of a municipal corporation, or of the enforcement of rights and privileges conferred by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (\u00a7 2.1-340 et seq.), there shall be an appeal of right, if taken within ten days after such order or judgment, to a court of record. Such appeal shall be to a comet of record having jurisdiction within the territory of the court from which the appeal is taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Under this provision, appellants do not have a right to appeal to the circuit court because an administrative license suspension under Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 does not involve a monetary controversy, or a statute\u2019s validity or constitutionality. Code \u00a7 16.1-132 defines the criminal appellate jurisdiction of the circuit courts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">Any person convicted in a district court of an offense not felonious shall have the right, at any time within ten days from such conviction, and whether or not such conviction was upon a plea of guilty, to appeal to the circuit court. There shall also be an appeal of right from any order or judgment of a district court forfeiting any recognizance or revoking any suspension of sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Under this section, appellants also do not have the right to appeal their administrative license suspensions because: (1) at the time of their appeal, neither appellant had been \u201cconvicted\u201d of a misdemeanor, and (2) neither case involved the forfeiture of recognizance or revocation of a suspended sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>tence. Thus, the circuit courts have no appellate jurisdiction over a general district court\u2019s review of an administrative license suspension pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Accordingly, because neither appellant had a right to appeal the administrative suspension of his or her driver\u2019s license to the circuit court, the cases are dismissed. The circuit court\u2019s orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">. The Commonwealth argues that these cases should be transferred to the Supreme Court of Virginia for resolution because this Court has limited jurisdiction over civil appeals. However, in a case similar to the instant case, the Virginia Supreme Court recently held that \"because a <em>charge </em>of unreasonably refusing to submit to a blood or breath test is not criminal but administrative and civil in nature, an appeal lies directly to [the Virginia Supreme Court].\u201d <em>Brame v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 122, 125, 476 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1996) (emphasis added). The rationale of <em>Brame </em>is that the underlying <em>charge </em>controls the appeal. In <em>Brame, </em>the underlying charge was civil. In the instant case, the underlying charge is criminal and falls under Code \u00a7 18.2-266. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 17-116.05:1(A) (\"Any aggrieved party may present a petition for appeal to the Court of Appeals from (i) any final conviction in a circuit court of a traffic infraction or a crime, except where a sentence of death has been imposed\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-6\">. Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2(C) provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he court's findings are without prejudice to the person contesting the suspension or to any other potential party as to any proceedings, civil or criminal, and shall not be evidence in any proceedings, civil or criminal.\u201d An administrative license suspension pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 may occur as part of a civil refusal case under Code \u00a7 18.2-268.3, or in a criminal driving while intoxicated case under Code \u00a7 18.2-266. If a driver has his license suspended for refusing to submit to a breath test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.3, the nature of the underlying proceeding is civil, and the Supreme Court of Virginia has jurisdiction over any appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\">. Because we hold that the administrative suspension proceeding is part of the underlying criminal charge, any driver who has his or her license suspended under Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 has no right to appeal that determination until <em>after </em>a final adjudication of the criminal charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
