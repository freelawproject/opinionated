On appeal, she contends that the trial court erroneously declined to suppress evidence resulting from an unlawful \u201cno-knock\u201d entry incidental to the execution of a search warrant and improperly received into evidence items omitted from the related inventory. Defendant also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions. Finding no error, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">In accordance with well established principles, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. On the evening of December 14, 1994, Portsmouth police executed a search warrant for defendant\u2019s residence. The affidavit of Detective Tammy Early given in support of the warrant, together with Early\u2019s independent investigation, established that a confidential and reliable informant had observed \u201cDebbie\u201d distribute cocaine from the premises within the immediately preceding seventy-two hours. The informant further advised that \u201cDebbie\u201d distributed cocaine daily to \u201cvarious persons\u201d and \u201cmay possibly be in possession of a .38 handgun,\u201d was \u201cknown to have a .38.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Defendant\u2019s son, Duane, reportedly was her cocaine supplier and resided within \u201cone city block.\u201d Duane frequently \u201cstay[ed]\u201d with defendant, often walking to her residence, and had recently been arrested for discharging a firearm into an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>unoccupied vehicle. When the warrant was executed, police were unable to determine if Duane was present on the property. Confronted with the \u201cthreat of two weapons,\u201d Early concluded that execution of the warrant by \u201cknocking and announcing\u201d would imperil the police officers and, therefore, authorized a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry, utilizing a \u201cramming\u201d device.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Upon entering the residence, police observed defendant running from the living room into the kitchen. She was detained, and the ensuing search revealed cocaine, marijuana, and related paraphernalia throughout the home. A recent Virginia Power bill and a \u201cnotice\u201d from Western Union, both addressed to defendant at the residence, were found on a desk in the living room, .and cocaine was secreted in the \u201cenvelope slot\u201d of the desk. In the kitchen, eleven bags of cocaine were discovered in a drawer, and four bags of marijuana were hidden in a flour canister. A \u201cbig piece\u201d of crack cocaine rested in plain view atop a dresser in the \u201cfront bedroom,\u201d together with two bags containing a total of seventy-one empty smaller plastic bags. , Five bags of marijuana were also found in the bedroom, two inside a women\u2019s jewelry box, and three in a dresser drawer. Women\u2019s clothing, a pocketbook, jewelry, and underwear were also located in the room. A single bag of marijuana was discovered in a bathroom medicine cabinet. Cash totalling $232 was gathered from defendant\u2019s \u201cpurse\u201d and elsewhere in the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Officer Rivera prepared an inventory of the property seized during the raid, but neither the Virginia Power nor Western Union documents were listed. Rivera attributed the omissions to \u201cinadvert[ance],\u201d \u201can oversight on [his] part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Rivera qualified as an expert in \u201cthe methods and devices used to distribute narcotics\u201d in the City of Portsmouth and testified that the quantity of the cocaine discovered in the residence, no less than 12.9 grams having a total value of approximately $1,290, and the related packaging and paraphernalia were inconsistent with possession for personal use. He further testified that the quantity and packaging of the marijuana were also inconsistent with personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Defendant moved to suppress all evidence obtained during the search, arguing that it was the fruit of an improper no-knock entry, and objected to the Virginia Power and Western Union exhibits because each had been excluded from the inventory. However, after consideration of memoranda of law and attendant argument of counsel, the trial court overruled both motions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">In reviewing the ruling on a suppression motion, we assess the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable to ... the prevailing party below,\u201d the Commonwealth in this instance, and the decision of the court will be disturbed only if plainly wrong. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). Our consideration of the record includes evidence adduced at both trial and suppression hearings, if any. <em>See DePriest v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 577, 588, 359 S.E.2d 540, 542-43 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 985, 109 S.Ct. 541, 102 L.Ed.2d 571 (1988). To prevail on appeal, the defendant must \u201cshow ... that the denial of [his] motion ... constitute^] reversible error.\u201d <em>Motley v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 439, 440-41, 437 S.E.2d 232, 233 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The Fourth Amendment requires \u201c \u2018that searches and seizures be reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, \u2014, 115 S.Ct. 1914, 1916, 131 L.Ed.2d 976 (1995) (quoting <em>New Jersey v. TLO, </em>469 U.S. 325, 337, 105 S.Ct. 733, 740, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985)); <em>see </em>Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 10. \u201c[T]he reasonableness of a search of a dwelling may depend in part on whether law enforcement officers announced their presence and authority prior to entering.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at\u2014, 115 S.Ct. at 1916; <em>see id. </em>at-, 115 S.Ct. at 1918. \u201cGenerally, police officers, before resorting to forced entry into premises to be searched under warrant, must attempt to gain admits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>tance peaceably by announcing their presence, identifying themselves as police officers and stating their purpose.\u201d <em>Heaton v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 137, 138, 207 S.E.2d 829, 830 (1974). While this \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule doubtless \u201cgives notice to the suspects of the officers\u2019 presence and the suspects\u2019 possible impending apprehension, it .., discourages violence and volatile confrontations and encourages orderly executions of search warrants.\u201d <em>Hargrave v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 320, 323, 464 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1995); <em>see Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 102, 104, 189 S.E.2d 678, 679 (1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1116, 93 S.Ct. 918, 34 L.Ed.2d 700 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">However, \u201c[ejxceptions to the rule ... permit officers to make an unannounced entry where they have probable cause to believe that their peril would be increased if they announced their presence or that an unannounced entry is necessary to prevent persons within from escaping or destroying evidence.\u201d <em>Heaton, </em>215 Va. at 138, 207 S.E.2d at 830. \u201cAs an articulated legal standard, probable cause deals with probabilities concerning the factual and practical considerations in everyday life as perceived by reasonable and prudent persons.\u201d <em>DePriest, 4 </em>Va.App. at 584, 359 S.E.2d at 543 (quoting <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 857, 862, 252 S.E.2d 326, 329 (1979)). \u201c[Ojfficers are not required to possess either the gift of prophecy or the infallible wisdom that comes only with hindsight. They must be judged by their reaction to circumstances as they reasonably appeared to trained law enforcement officers to exist when the decision to enter was made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Woody, </em>13 Va.App. 168, 171, 409 S.E.2d 170, 172 (1991) (citing <em>Keeter v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 134, 141, 278 S.E.2d 841, 846, <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1053, 102 S.Ct. 598, 70 L.Ed.2d 589 (1981)). The Commonwealth bears the burden of proving probable cause in support of an unannounced entry. <em>See Heaton, </em>215 Va. at 138, 207 S.E.2d at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Here, a confidential and reliable informant had observed a recent drug sale at defendant\u2019s residence, an activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>common to the premises, where defendant reputedly possessed a handgun. Defendant\u2019s son and drug supplier, Duane, resided nearby, was often at defendant\u2019s home and had been arrested ten days previously for shooting into an unoccupied vehicle. When the warrant was executed, Duane\u2019s whereabouts were unknown to the police. The officers were, therefore, cognizant that two firearms were possibly present in the Residence, each in the possession of a drug dealer, one of whom had recently been charged with a weapons violation. Accordingly, Early\u2019s conclusion that a knock and announce entry would endanger police was reasonable and prudent and supported by the necessary probable cause to justify the disputed no-knock entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE OMITTED FROM INVENTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-57 provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\">The officer who seizes any property [pursuant to a search warrant] shall prepare an inventory thereof, under oath. An inventory of any seized property shall be produced before the court designated in the warrant. The officer executing the warrant shall endorse the date of execution thereon and shall file the warrant, with the inventory attached ... and the accompanying affidavit, ... within three days after the execution of such search warrant in the circuit court clerk\u2019s office, wherein the search was made____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Although the Virginia Power and Western Union exhibits were omitted from the inventory prepared and filed by Officer Rivera, noncompliance with Code \u00a7 19.2-57 does not require suppression of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">\u2018While violations of state procedural statutes are viewed with disfavor, ... neither the Virginia Supreme Court nor the legislature has adopted an exclusionary rule for such violations[ ] ... where no deprivation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights occurred.\u201d \u201c \u2018[Historically, searches or seizures made contrary to provisions contained in Virginia statutes provide no right of suppression unless the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>supplies that right.\u2019 \u201d ... Code \u00a7 19.2-57 does not expressly command the suppression or exclusion of evidence for a violation of the statute. Moreover, [defendant] does not allege that his constitutional rights were violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-5\"><em>West v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 679, 692, 432 S.E.2d 730, 738-39 (1993) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">In assessing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The judgment of a trial court, sitting without a jury, is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will be disturbed only if plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See id. </em>The credibility of a witness, the weight accorded the testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely for the fact finder\u2019s determination. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">[Possession of a controlled substance may be actual or constructive. \u201cTo support a conviction based upon constructive possession, \u2018the Commonwealth must point to evidence of acts, statements, or conduct of the accused or other facts or circumstances which tend to show that the defendant was aware of both the presence and character of the substance and that it was subject to his dominion and control.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-9\"><em>McGee v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 317, 322, 357 S.E.2d 738, 740 (1987) (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Drew v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 471, 473, 338 S.E.2d 844, 845 (1986)). Circumstantial evidence of possession is sufficient to support a conviction provided it excludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. <em>See Tucker v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 141, 143, 442 S.E.2d 419, 420 (1994); <em>McGee, 4 </em>Va.App. at 322, 357 S.E.2d at 740; <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 598, 604-05, 347 S.E.2d 163, 167 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Although mere proximity to drugs is insufficient to establish possession, it is a circumstance which may be probative in determining whether an accused possessed such drugs. <em>See Lane v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 713, 716, 292 S.E.2d 358, 360 (1982); <em>Eckhart v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 447, 450-51, 281 S.E.2d 853, 855 (1981); <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 1, 9, 421 S.E.2d 877, 882 (1992) (reh\u2019g <em>en banc). </em>Ownership or occupancy of the premises is likewise a circumstance probative of possession. <em>See Drew v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 471, 473, 338 S.E.2d 844, 845 (1986) (citing Code \u00a7 18.2-250). Thus, in resolving this issue, the Court must consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances disclosed by the evidence.\u201d <em>Womack v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 5, 8, 255 S.E.2d 351, 353 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Here, defendant was alone in the residence and ran from the living room to the kitchen as police entered the home. Contemporary documents, personal to defendant and addressed to the subject premises; were discovered on a desk in the living room, together with cocaine. Eleven bags of cocaine were found in a kitchen drawer. A \u201cbig piece\u201d of crack cocaine was in plain view on a dresser located in a bedroom, together with women\u2019s clothing, underwear, and jewelry. Numerous bags of marijuana were discovered in the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. The only reasonable hypothesis arising from such evidence is that defendant constructively possessed the cocaine and marijuana found both in plain view and stashed throughout her residence, aware of the nature and character of the drugs. <em>See Wymer v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 294, 300-01, 403 S.E.2d 702, 706-07 (1991) (evidence of constructive possession sufficient where accused and another occupied a residence, and drugs and paraphernalia were with accused\u2019s possessions).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to prove intent to distribute the drugs is also without merit. \u201cBecause direct proof of intent is often impossible, it must be shown by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 524, 371 S.E.2d 156, 165 (1988). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>\u201cIn proving intent, various types of circumstantial evidence may be appropriate\u2014evidence concerning the quantity of drugs and cash possessed, the method of packaging, ... whether appellant himself used drugs,\u201d <em>Poindexter v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 730, 734-35, 432 S.E.2d 527, 530 (1993), and the absence of evidence suggestive of personal use. <em>See Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1, 4, 244 S.E.2d 748, 749 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Officer Rivera testified that the method of packaging and the quantities of both the cocaine and marijuana were inconsistent with personal use. He also testified that the presence of seventy-one empty small baggies suggested an intent to package and distribute the drugs. Finally, the officers found no paraphernalia or other items related to personal use of the drugs. Such evidence was sufficient to support the finding that defendant possessed the offending drugs with the requisite intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-14\">. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention that this ruling resulted solely from a recitation in the affidavit that defendant \"may possibly be in possession of a .38 handgun,\u201d the trial judge expressly confirmed his consideration of \u201call the facts and testimony ... rendered in the case.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
