Appellant contends: (1) the trial court erred in finding that his blood alcohol test, administered one hour after his arrest, established a presumption of his blood alcohol content when he was operating his motor vehicle; (2) the trial court improperly denied his proffer of evidence meant to explain why he performed poorly on field sobriety tests; and (3) the General Assembly\u2019s use of the words \u201cillegally consuming alcohol\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1(A) required the Commonwealth to prove the source of the alcohol he consumed. Because the trial court committed no error, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">On July 23, 1994, at 2:14 a.m., Deputy W.P. Jones of the Amelia County Sheriffs Office stopped a vehicle driven by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>appellant. The stop occurred at an administrative roadblock. Appellant admitted that he had consumed two beers and was under age twenty-one. Appellant did not state when he had consumed the alcohol or disclose the source of the alcohol he had obtained. Jones arrested appellant for operating a motor vehicle after illegally consuming alcohol under age twenty-one. Appellant did not pass the field sobriety tests administered by Jones. At least one hour after being arrested, appellant underwent a blood alcohol test. The Commonwealth introduced the certificate of analysis, which showed that appellant\u2019s blood alcohol level registered at .02 percent at the time the test was administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Appellant was tried in the Circuit Court of Amelia County on October 5,1994, for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1. Appellant argued that the Commonwealth had to introduce evidence that his blood alcohol level was .02 percent at the time he operated his vehicle. The trial court rejected this argument. The trial court also refused to allow appellant to proffer evidence as to why he failed his field sobriety tests, reasoning that such evidence was irrelevant in light of the statutory language. The trial court also ruled that the Commonwealth did not need to prove that the alcohol was consumed illegally. The trial court found appellant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">PRESUMPTION OF ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in applying a presumption that his blood alcohol level one hora1 after operating the vehicle was the same as when he operated the vehicle. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Neither this Court nor the Supreme Court has addressed the issue of whether Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1 creates a rebuttable presumption that a defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content while driving was the same as indicated by the results of a subsequently administered test. However, based on <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 291, 381 S.E.2d 11 (1989), and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>progeny, we hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1 creates such a presumption. Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-266.1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 18.2-266(i),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which contain similar language, each make it \u201cunlawful\u201d for a driver to operate a motor vehicle while the driver\u2019s blood alcohol content is at or above a certain level. In <em>Davis, </em>this Court held that Code \u00a7 18.2-266\u00ae creates a rebuttable presumption \u201cthat the blood alcohol concentration while driving was the same as indicated by the results of the subsequent test.\u201d 8 Va.App. at 300, 381 S.E.2d at 16. <em>See also Lemond v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 687, 692, 454 S.E.2d 31, 34 (1995); <em>Kehl v. </em>Common<em>wealth, </em>15 Va.App. 602, 605, 426 S.E.2d 127, 129 (1993). We hold that this logic applies with equal force to Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">. III.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">PROFFER OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">As this Court has stated in cases involving prosecutions under Code \u00a7 18.2-266\u00ae, a defendant may rebut the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>presumption that the blood alcohol concentration measurement accurately reflected the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol concentration at the time of driving. <em>Commonwealth v. Ayers, </em>17 Va.App. 401, 404, 437 S.E.2d 580, 582 (1993); <em>Lemond, </em>19 Va.App. at 693, 454 S.E.2d at 35. Thus, in cases involving prosecutions under Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1, \u201c[a] defendant ... may introduce evidence to show that, despite his blood alcohol concentration of at least 0.10 percent on a subsequently administered test, his blood alcohol concentration at the time of driving was less than 0.10 percent.\u201d <em>Ayers, </em>17 Va.App. at 404, 437 S.E.2d at 582. A defendant \u201cmay challenge the test results by competent evidence, such as, for example, that he had not consumed enough alcohol in the relevant time to reach the level indicated by the chemical test results.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>8 Va.App. at 300, 381 S.E.2d at 16. However, evidence tending to prove that the defendant was not under the influence, such as adequate performance on field sobriety tests, is irrelevant and inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>In this case, therefore, the trial court did not err in refusing to allow appellant to explain his physical condition and his poor performance on the field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">PROOF OF \u201cILLEGAL CONSUMPTION\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">For the reasons stated in <em>Mejia v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 173, 474 S.E.2d 866 (1996) <em>(en </em>banc), we hold that the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike the evidence, which was grounded on the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to prove that his consumption of alcohol was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1(A) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">It shall be unlawful for any person under the age of twenty-one to operate any motor vehicle after illegally consuming alcohol. Any such person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.02 percent or more by weight by volume or 0.02 grams or more per 210 liters of breath but less than 0.08 by weight by volume or less than 0.08 grams per 210 liters of breath as indicated by a chemical test administered as provided in this article shall be in violation of this section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-10\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-266 states \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to drive or operate any motor vehicle, engine or train (i) while such person has a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or more----\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b210-12\">. Appellant also contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-269, entitled, \"Presumptions from alcohol content of blood,\u201d applies to Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014266(ii) but does not apply to Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1. While this assertion is accurate, it does not affect the issue at hand. Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014266(ii) punishes offenders who drive under the influence of alcohol and utilizes Code \u00a7 18.2-269's presumptions to prove intoxication. In contrast, Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1 does not concern itself with offenders who drive under the influence. Instead, Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1 punishes offenders whose blood alcohol content measures between .02 and .08 percent. Therefore, we hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-269\u2019s presumptions are irrelevant to proving a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b211-10\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Anf\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">For the reasons stated in my dissent to <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 291, 381 S.E.2d 11 (1989), I would hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1 does not create a presumption \u201cthat the blood alcohol concentration while driving was the same as indicated by the results of the subsequent test.\u201d 8 Va.App. at 300, 381 S.E.2d at 16. Until the General Assembly enacts a rebuttable presumption for Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1, \u201cI find nothing in either the text or logic of [Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1] that leads me to conclude the General Assembly intended anything other than that guilt would be proved beyond a reasonable doubt according to the normal processes of human reasoning and experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 381 S.E.2d at 17-18 (Benton, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Because I do not believe Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1 creates a rebut-table presumption, I would find the trial judge erred in barring evidence of Charles\u2019 physical condition and performance on field sobriety tests. The Commonwealth administered the breathalyzer test an hour after the officer stopped Charles. During this one hour period, the level of Charles\u2019 intoxication may have fluctuated. Evidence of his physical condition at the time of the stop was probative of whether he operated the vehicle when his breath contained .02 grams or more of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Where the statute bars a person from operating a vehicle with a certain bodily alcohol content and the test is not performed until after that person ceases to operate the vehicle, then evidence of the driver\u2019s physical condition may be probative of the driver\u2019s level of intoxication when operating the vehicle. Thus, I would also hold that the trial judge erred in refusing to admit the evidence of Charles\u2019 physical condition. The statute does not create a rebuttable presumption regarding the scientifically measured alcohol level.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">I dissent from Part IV for the reasons stated in my dissent to <em>Mejia v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 173, 474 S.E.2d 866 (1996) <em>(en banc). </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1(A) requires the Commonwealth to prove the accused <em>\u201cillegally </em>consumed] alcohol.\u201d The Commonwealth introduced no evidence concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>circumstances of Charles\u2019 consumption of alcohol. Therefore, the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Accordingly, I would reverse Charles\u2019 conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
