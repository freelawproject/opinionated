He argues that his prior robbery conviction should not have been counted as a prior larceny conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-104 because robbery is not a larceny or an offense deemed to be larceny or punished as larceny. He further argues that the court erred in finding that the probative value of admitting appellant\u2019s prior robbery conviction as a robbery rather than a prior larceny conviction outweighed the prejudicial impact. Because we agree with appellant\u2019s first contention, we reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">On June 4, 1995, appellant was arrested for petit larceny by a police officer who observed appellant enter a 7-Eleven Store and take a bottle of Boone\u2019s Farm wine and a candy bar and exit the store. Appellant was prosecuted for third petit larceny offense on the basis of two prior convictions, a petit larceny conviction in 1992 and a robbery conviction in 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">At trial, appellant moved <em>in limine </em>to preclude the Commonwealth from proceeding on the charge as alleged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>indictment on the ground that his prior robbery conviction was not a proper predicate offense for enhancement purposes under Code \u00a7 18.2-104. The trial judge denied the motion. Appellant then moved the court to restrict the Commonwealth from referring to appellant\u2019s conviction as a robbery conviction and offered to stipulate that he previously had been convicted of a larceny offense. The trial judge ruled that the Commonwealth was not required to accept the stipulation and that the prior robbery conviction order was admissible to prove a predicate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-104 is a recidivist statute that enhances the sentence of a person convicted of a third larceny-type offense by converting a petit larceny offense from a misdemeanor to a class 6 felony. The issue in this case is whether appellant\u2019s prior conviction for robbery is a proper predicate offense for enhancement purposes under Code \u00a7 18.2-104. We hold that it is not.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">The principles of statutory construction require us to ascertain and give effect to the legislative intent. The plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction; a statute should never be construed so that it leads to absurd results. In addition, penal statutes must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth and applied only in those cases clearly falling within the language of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiS\"><em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424-425 (1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Both the language and recent history of Code \u00a7 18.2-104 demonstrate that the General Assembly did not intend to include robbery as a predicate offense for enhancement purposes. The General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 18.2-104 in 1994 in response to our decision in <em>Snead v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 643, 400 S.E.2d 806 (1991). Prior to the amendment of Code \u00a7 18.2-104, the scope of predicate offenses that would enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence was narrow. The predicate offenses that enhanced the sentence of a defendant were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>expressly limited to shoplifting under Code \u00a7 18.2-103 or a \u201clike offense,\u201d grand larceny under Code \u00a7 18.2-95, and petit larceny under Code \u00a7 18.2-96. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Snead, </em>we reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-104, holding that the crime of \u201cuttering a bad check\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-181 and shoplifting under Code \u00a7 18.2-103 were not \u201clike offenses.\u201d 11 Va.App. at 648, 400 S.E.2d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The General Assembly responded by amending Code \u00a7 18.2-104 in 1994. A draft of the proposed amendment stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">Because of judicial disagreement regarding the meaning of the term \u201cthe like offense,\u201d some arguable \u201clike offenses\u201d were not prosecuted or deemed not subject to prosecution by the judiciary under the \u201cthree-time loser\u201d law. This bill expands the predicate crimes to include all larceny and fraud offenses and substantially similar offenses whether committed in or outside the Commonwealth. It would no longer be limited to shoplifting, but would subsume all larceny and fraud crimes of whatever \u201cvalue\u201d or punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">House 557, 1994 Reg.Sess. (on file with Commonwealth of Virginia, Division of Legislative Services) (Draft of Jan. 21, 1994). Indeed, the General Assembly\u2019s amendment of Code \u00a7 18.2-104 expanded beyond shoplifting, grand larceny and petit larceny the nature of predicate offenses that can be considered for enhancement purposes. Under the amended version, predicate offenses now include: (1) \u201cany offense of larceny;\u201d. (2) \u201cany offense deemed ... larceny;\u201d (3) \u201cany offense ... punishable as larceny;\u201d and (4) \u201cany substantially similar offense in any other jurisdiction.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-104 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">In light of the manner in which the General Assembly tailored the amendment of 1994 to react to <em>Snead, </em>we do not believe the General Assembly intended to include robbery as a predicate offense. <em>Snead </em>held that \u201cuttering a bad check\u201d was not a predicate offense because it was neither larceny under Code \u00a7 18.2-95 and Code \u00a7 18.2-96 nor shoplifting under Code \u00a7 18.2-103, even though it was, and still is, deemed a larceny by the statute making it an offense. <em>Snead, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>11 Va.App. at 648, 400 S.E.2d at 808.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By responding to <em>Snead, </em>the General Assembly apparently intended the amendment of Code \u00a7 18.2-104 to expand the types of predicate offenses used for enhancement purposes to include those crimes, such as uttering bad checks, that are expressly deemed or punished as larceny in the Code but were not covered by the restrictive language of the prior version of Code \u00a7 18.2-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Based upon both the history and language of the present version of the statute, we hold that robbery is not a proper predicate offense for enhancement purposes under Code \u00a7 18.2-104. Robbery is neither deemed nor punished as larceny in the Code. \u201cIn Virginia, robbery is a nonstatutory crime which continues to be defined by the common law.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 590, 594-595, 347 S.E.2d 152, 155 (1986) (citing <em>Pritchard v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 559, 561, 303 S.E.2d 911, 912 (1983); <em>Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 253, 254,105 S.E.2d 149,150 (1958)). Robbery is punished by a sentence of confinement for between five years and life in a state correctional facility, Code \u00a7 18.2-58, while both grand larceny and petit larceny are punished differently. Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-95,18.2-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In addition, robbery and larceny are in distinct provisions in the Code. The term \u201clarceny\u201d as it appears in this penal statute must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth. <em>Branch, </em>14 Va.App. at 839, 419 S.E.2d at 424. Although regulated by statute, both larceny and robbery continue to be defined by the common law. <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 948, 957, 408 S.E.2d 540, 545 (1991) (larceny); <em>Durham v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 166, 168, 198 S.E.2d 603, 605 (1973) (robbery). While our Supreme Court has said that \u201crobbery is larceny from the person, or in his presence, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>violence or intimidation,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the common law treats robbery and larceny as distinctive crimes. <em>Butts v. Commonwealth, </em>145 Va. 800, 811, 133 S.E. 764, 767 (1926) (citing Wm. L. Clark, Jr., <em>Handbook of Criminal Law </em>323 (2d ed. 1902)); <em>of Whitley v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 66, 73, 286 S.E.2d 162, 166 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 882, 103 S.Ct. 181, 74 L.Ed.2d 148 (1982), <em>reh. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1137, 103 S.Ct. 771, 74 L.Ed.2d 984 (1983) (stating that robbery as defined at common law \u201cis a crime against the person of the victim rather than a crime against property\u201d). Moreover, the General Assembly maintained the distinction between robbery and larceny when it placed its regulation of the two crimes in the Code. Robbery is classified as a crime against the person, while larceny is categorized as a crime against property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have said that \u201cit is significant that robbery is denominated as a crime against a person in the codification of our criminal statutes.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 590, 596, 347 S.E.2d 152 (1986). The General Assembly did not codify robbery as a crime against property because it \u201cwas concerned about the violence and fear aspect of the offense and not merely the protection of property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, when construing the statute against the Commonwealth, robbery is neither \u201clarceny\u201d nor an offense \u201cdeemed or punished as larceny,\u201d and we hold that the crime of robbery is not a proper predicate offense under Code \u00a7 18.2-104, a recidivist statute intended to enhance the punishment of persons who are convicted of multiple larcenies.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Because we find that appellant\u2019s prior robbery conviction is not a proper predicate offense for enhancement purposes under Code \u00a7 18.2-104, his conviction of third offense petit larceny is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\">. The statute criminalizing the utterance of a bad check reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">Any person who, with intent to defraud, shall make or draw or utter any check ... upon any bank ... knowing at the time of such making, drawing, uttering ... that the maker or drawer has not sufficient funds in ... such bank ... for the payment of such check ... <em>shall be guilty of </em>larceny____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-181 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\"><em>.

A robbery indictment, therefore, necessarily \u201cincludes all elements of whatever larceny offense it charges, whether grand or petit____\u201d <em>Motors v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 470, 472, 417 S.E.2d 314, 315 (1992). We concluded in <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>that robbery is distinct from larceny because the larceny is accomplished through the use of violence or threat of harm. 14 Va.App. 203, 206, 415 S.E.2d 446, 448 (1992). Thus, robbery is larceny in it most egregious form. Therefore, I would hold that robbery is \u201can offense of larceny\u201d or \u201can offense deemed to be larceny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on our holding in <em>Snead v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 643, 400 S.E.2d 806 (1991), is unpersuasive because <em>Snead </em>interprets the predecessor statute to Code \u00a7 18.2-104. As amended, the statute no longer contains the limitations upon which the <em>Snead </em>ruling was based and now encompasses any prior larceny offense or any offense deemed or punishable as larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">I would also hold that the trial judge did not err in refusing to require the Commonwealth to accept appellant\u2019s stipulation that he previously had been convicted of a larceny offense. The Commonwealth is not required to accept a stipulation. <em>Essex v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 168, 442 S.E.2d 707 (1994). We reached the same conclusion in <em>Glover v. Commonwealth, </em>where the defendant, like appellant here, argued that the evidence of his prior offense was not necessary to obtain a conviction, given his offer to stipulate that he had a prior conviction of the type necessary to satisfy the statute under which he was prosecuted. 3 Va.App. 152, 161-62, 348 S.E.2d 434, 440 (1986), <em>aff'd, </em>236 Va. 1, 372 S.E.2d 134 (1988). We concluded that the Commonwealth was entitled to prove its case and was under no obligation to forgo putting on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>own evidence merely because the defendant offered a qualified stipulation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Accordingly, because I would affirm the judgment of the trial court, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\">UPON A PETITION FOR REHEARING EN .
