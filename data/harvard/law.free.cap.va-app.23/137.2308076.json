Ford contends that because he was unlawfully detained and arrested, the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the arresting police officer\u2019s testimony and his motions to strike the evidence as to both charges. We find that the evidence is insufficient, based on the statement of fact, to support a finding that the officer had probable cause to believe that Ford\u2019s conduct was disorderly in violation of Newport News City Code \u00a7 28-11. Accordingly, the officer had no basis to arrest Ford on that charge and, thus, no basis to search him and seize his knife. Therefore, we reverse both convictions and dismiss the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">According to the \u201cWritten Statement of Facts, and Testimony, and Other Incidents of the Case,\u201d filed pursuant to Rule 5A:8(c), the Commonwealth\u2019s only witness was Officer F.S. Nowak, Jr., of the Newport News Police Department. Officer Nowak testified that at approximately 9:00 p.m. on May 24, 1995, he and another officer were patrolling an area of New<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>port News known for prostitution and drug activity. Both officers were in uniform and riding bicycles.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The officers saw the defendant pushing a bicycle in a small park and \u201cdecided to approach the defendant and ask him his name and address [because] it was 9:00 p.m. in a location known for criminal activity.\u201d Officer Nowak testified that \u201che did not suspect the defendant of prostitution or drug activity, but he wanted to field interview the defendant because the defendant was pushing a bicycle, which could be stolen, at night in a known high crime area.\u201d Officer Nowak stopped his bicycle approximately ten feet from the defendant and asked the defendant to \u201ccome over\u201d to him. According to Nowak, his bicycle light was on, but neither he nor the other officer \u201cdrew their guns\u201d or \u201cshined a light\u201d on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Officer Nowak testified that when he asked the defendant to come over to him, \u201cthe defendant immediately became loud, angry, and uncooperative.\u201d According to Nowak, the defendant stated: \u201cI\u2019m tired of this shit. The cops in Hampton do the same shit, and I\u2019m not going to put up with it anymore.\u201d The defendant continued to use offensive language and threw \u201chis arms about in the air. The defendant was so loud and boisterous that apartment dwellers in a nearby building came out on their porch and asked if the officers needed help.\u201d The defendant\u2019s actions also attracted \u201cthe attention of other police officers ... in a training class in a nearby building ... who left their training activities to come to Officer Nowak\u2019s assistance if necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Officer Nowak arrested the defendant for disorderly conduct and searched him incident to that arrest. As a result of the search, Nowak recovered a lock-blade knife from the defendant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">A law enforcement officer does not implicate the Fourth Amendment by approaching a citizen in a public place for the purpose of asking the individual his name and address. <em>See Baldwin v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 191, 196, 413 S.E.2d 645, 648 (1992) (quoting <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 497, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1323-24, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983) (plurality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>opinion)). Furthermore, a consensual encounter between the police and a citizen becomes a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes \u201conly if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a <em>reasonable person </em>would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980) (Stewart, J.)). In order for a seizure to occur, the police must restrain a citizen\u2019s freedom of movement by the use of physical force or show of authority. <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Here, although both officers were in uniform, neither officer drew his weapon, physically restrained the defendant, or by show of force or authority indicated that the defendant was not free to leave. Officer Nowak stopped his bicycle approximately ten feet from the defendant and requested the defendant to come over to him. Under these circumstances, \u201cwe find no evidence of \u2018the threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baldwin, </em>243 Va. at 199, 413 S.E.2d at 649 (quoting <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. at 1877). Thus, the initial encounter between the defendant and the police officers was consensual and no seizure occurred until Officer Nowak arrested Ford for disorderly conduct. Accordingly, the dispositive question is whether Officer Nowak had probable cause to arrest the defendant for disorderly conduct. If so, Officer Nowak was entitled to search the defendant incidental to the arrest, <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 763, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969); if not, Nowak had no other lawful basis for searching the defendant or seizing the knife from his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Section 28-11 of the Newport News City Code provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">[a] person is guilty of disorderly conduct and a misdemeanor if, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>anee or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, such person ... <em>engages in conduct having a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person or persons at whom, individually, such conduct is directed; </em>provided, however, such conduct shall not be deemed to include the utterance or display of any word.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">(Emphasis added). <em>Compare </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-415. The requirement that the defendant\u2019s actions or behavior, in order to constitute disorderly conduct, must have \u201ca direct tendency to cause acts of violence\u201d is dictated by concern for First Amendment free speech protections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">[T]he First Amendment protects a significant amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers. \u201cSpeech is often provocative and challenging____ [But it] is nevertheless protected against censorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-8\"><em>City of Houston v. Hill, </em>482 U.S. 451, 461, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2509, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987) (quoting <em>Terminiello v. City of Chicago, </em>337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 896, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949)).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">\u201c[P]robable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information, alone are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 229, 231, 443 S.E.2d 189, 190 (1994) (quoting <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 816, 820, 284 S.E.2d 833, 836 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 906, 102 S.Ct. 1753, 72 L.Ed.2d 163 (1982)). \u201cThe test of constitutional validity is whether at the moment of arrest the arresting officer had knowledge of sufficient facts and circumstances to warrant a reasonable man in believing that an offense has been committed.\u201d <em>Bryson v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 85, 86-87, 175 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1970) (citations omitted). To establish probable cause, the Commonwealth must show \u201ca probability or substantial chance of criminal activity, not an actual showing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>such activity.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 179, 188-89, 402 S.E.2d 914, 920 (1991) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 243 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2335 n. 13, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). However, \u201c[t]he only difference between facts needed to establish probable cause and those needed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is in the degree or quantum of proof, not in the facts or elements of the offense.\u201d <em>State v. Moore, </em>659 S.W.2d 252, 257 (Mo.Ct.App.1983). \u201cIn assessing an officer\u2019s probable cause for making a warrantless arrest, no less strict standards may be applied than are applicable to a magistrate\u2019s determination that an arrest warrant should issue.\u201d <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 857, 862, 252 S.E.2d 326, 329 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Officer Nowak did not have reason to believe that the defendant\u2019s conduct would provoke a violent response from the person or persons at whom such conduct was directed, which is a requisite element of a violation of Newport News City Code \u00a7 28-11. The words uttered by the defendant, however offensive or rude, do not establish disorderly conduct. Although Officer Nowa,k testified that the defendant \u201c[threw] his arms about in the air\u201d and was \u201cloud and boisterous,\u201d he made no threatening remarks, uttered no words that would reasonably incite a breach of the peace, or made no threatening movements toward the officers. While the defendant\u2019s remarks lacked civility and were impolite, loud, and persistent protestations about his treatment, his act of throwing his arms in the air could in no reasonable way cause or incite the officers to violence. There is simply no evidence in the record to support a reasonable belief that the defendant\u2019s conduct would cause a reasonable officer to respond with physical force or violence or that the officers considered the defendant\u2019s throwing his arms in the air to be an assault. Consequently, Officer Nowak either did not know that the offense of disorderly conduct includes the requirement that the defendant\u2019s conduct must have a direct tendency to cause violence or, if he did, he had no reasonable basis to believe that the defendant\u2019s conduct had a direct tendency to incite violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Although a police officer, who makes a warrantless misdemeanor arrest based upon mistakes of fact or law, may not be subjected to civil liability for false imprisonment, provided that the officer acted in \u201cgood faith and \u2018reasonable belief in the validity of the arrest,\u201d <em>DeChene v. Smallwood, </em>226 Va. 475, 479, 311 S.E.2d 749, 751 (1984) (citation omitted), a warrantless arrest that is not based upon probable cause is unconstitutional and evidence seized as a result of an unconstitutional arrest is inadmissible, without regard to the officer\u2019s good faith and reasonable belief that he was not factually or legally mistaken. <em>See Draper v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 313, 79 S.Ct. 329, 333, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959); <em>cf. Jones, </em>18 Va.App. at 232-33, 443 S.E.2d at 191 (holding that the police officer did not have probable cause to arrest the accused for criminal trespass because the officer did not have \u201ca reasonable basis to conclude that [the accused] was neither a resident nor a guest of a resident\u201d of the apartment complex).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">In either case, on these facts a police officer would have no reasonable basis to believe that the defendant was guilty of disorderly conduct in violation of \u00a7 28-11 of the Newport News City Code. Consequently, because the officers had no probable cause to arrest the defendant, they had no other basis on which to lawfully detain or search him. Although the defendant was loud, profane, and uncivil, the officers had no basis to conclude, on these facts, that they would be required to use physical force to restrain the defendant in order to carry out their duties. <em>Cf. Keyes v. City of Virginia Beach, </em>16 Va.App. 198, 200, 428 S.E.2d 766, 768 (1993) (affirming the accused\u2019s conviction for disorderly conduct where the police officer lawfully stopped the accused for a traffic violation and testified that based upon the accused\u2019s loud and uncooperative behavior, he \u201cfelt as though [he] was going to have to fight to subdue [the accused]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Because the officer had no probable cause to arrest Ford for disorderly conduct, the search incident to that arrest and the seizure of the knife from his pocket was a \u201cfruit\u201d of the illegal arrest and should have been suppressed. <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 484-85, 83 S.Ct. 407, 415-16, 9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). In view of the holding that the evidence was insufficient to support a probable cause finding of disorderly conduct, necessarily, without additional evidence, it is insufficient to support the disorderly conduct conviction. Thus, we reverse both convictions and dismiss the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
