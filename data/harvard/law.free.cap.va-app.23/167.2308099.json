Appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the drunk driving charge as barred on double jeopardy and collateral estoppel grounds. Because the trial court did not err, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">On April 8,1995, a vehicle driven by appellant nearly struck another vehicle. Officer P.K. Redd of the Lynchburg Police Department arrived at the scene shortly thereafter. Appellant failed three field sobriety tests, and breathalyzer test results indicated that appellant\u2019s blood alcohol level was .20 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2, upon appellant\u2019s arrest, his driver\u2019s license was suspended administratively for seven days. On April 12,1995, appellant filed a motion for review of his administrative suspension. The Lynchburg General District Court held a hearing on the matter the same day, at which the Commonwealth chose not to appear. No police reports or other evidence on the Commonwealth\u2019s behalf were offered. After hearing appellant\u2019s testimony, the court rescinded the license suspension, finding that the police lacked probable cause to arrest appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Despite the general district court\u2019s ruling that no probable cause existed for appellant\u2019s arrest, the City of Lynchburg prosecuted appellant in the general district court pursuant to Lynchburg Code \u00a7 25-162, which prohibits drunk driving. On May 2,1995, appellant filed a motion to dismiss on grounds of acquittal, based on the ruling that there was no probable cause for his arrest. Appellant argued that the Commonwealth was collaterally estopped from proceeding on the related drunk driving charge and that the prosecution of the criminal charge was barred on double jeopardy grounds. The general district court overruled the motion and on May 3, 1995, convicted appellant of drunk driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>After appealing his conviction to the circuit court, appellant again filed a motion to dismiss on grounds of acquittal. On August 8, 1995, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion. The circuit court ruled that pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2(0 the prior determination of no probable cause did not constitute a binding or final judgment upon which collateral estoppel could be based.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After appellant stipulated to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the circuit court found appellant guilty of drunk driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">DOUBLE JEOPARDY &amp; COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL</p>\n<p id=\"AqA\">Appellant argues that his prosecution for drunk driving was constitutionally impermissible because the administrative license suspension proceeding was a criminal proceeding, and the double jeopardy protection of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution barred a second prosecution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">In <em>Tench v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 200, 204, 462 S.E.2d 922, 923-24 (1995)(en banc), we held that an administrative license suspension is a <em>civil </em>penalty and does not constitute \u201cpunishment\u201d for double jeopardy purposes. <em>See United States v. Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989). Here, pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2(C), appellant timely requested the general district court to review the license suspension, and a hearing was held on the matter four days after the suspension. It follows logically from <em>Tench </em>that the district court\u2019s license suspension hearing was a civil proceeding. <em>See, e.g., State v. Young, </em>249 Neb. 539, 544 N.W.2d 808, 811 (1996)(holding that an administrative license suspension hearing is civil); <em>State v. Cassady, </em>140 N.H. 46, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>662 A.2d 955, 958 (1995)(same); <em>Walton v. State, </em>831 S.W.2d 488, 490 (Tex.Ct.App.l992)(same); <em>People v. Moore, </em>138 Ill.2d 162, 149 Ill.Dec. 278, 280, 561 N.E.2d 648, 650 (1990)(same). Therefore, because the license suspension proceeding \u201cdid not impose punishment -within the meaning of the double jeopardy clause, [appellant] was not twice placed in jeopardy in violation of the United States Constitution when prosecuted for driving while intoxicated.\u201d <em>Tench, </em>21 Va.App. at 208, 462 S.E.2d at 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u201cThe doctrine of collateral estoppel in criminal cases ... means \u2018that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rogers v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 337, 341, 362 S.E.2d 752, 754 (1987)(quoting <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 443, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1194, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970)). \u201cThe party seeking the protection of collateral estoppel carries the burden of showing that the verdict in the prior action necessarily decided the precise issue he seeks to now preclude.\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>5 Va.App. at 341, 362 S.E.2d at 754. \u201c[T]he doctrine of collateral estoppel is a constitutional requirement embodied in the fifth amendment protection against double jeopardy and is applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Simon v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 412, 415, 258 S.E.2d 567, 569 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Because the license suspension hearing was a civil proceeding, \u201c[a]pplication of the doctrine of collateral estoppel is not constitutionally mandated.\u201d <em>Cassady, </em>662 A.2d at 958 (holding that collateral estoppel did not prevent relitigation in a criminal proceeding of issues of fact previously decided in defendant\u2019s favor in an administrative hearing); <em>Young, </em>544 N.W.2d at 812 (same); <em>State v. Arnold, </em>593 So.2d 1293 (La.Ct. App.l991)(same), <em>writ denied, </em>594 So.2d 1305 (La.1992); <em>Moore, </em>149 Ill.Dec. at 282, 561 N.E.2d at 652. \u201cBecause the \u2018issues of ultimate fact\u2019 in an administrative hearing held pursuant to [Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2] are different from those in a prosecution for the offense of driving while intoxicated, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar ... [a] subsequent prosecution for driving while intoxicated.\u201d <em>Walton, </em>831 S.W.2d at 490 (holding that administrative hearing to revoke defendant\u2019s license did not collaterally bar prosecution and did not violate double jeopardy).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Furthermore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">If we were to hold the doctrine of collateral estoppel applicable to later criminal proceedings, the [Commonwealth] would be forced to litigate thoroughly every fact at issue in an administrative license suspension proceeding. This would undermine the goal of providing informal and prompt review of a decision to suspend a driver\u2019s license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-6\"><em>Cassady, </em>662 A.2d at 958. <em>See Young, </em>544 N.W.2d at 812; <em>Moore, </em>149 Ill.Dec. at 282, 561 N.E.2d at 652. \u201cFrom the [Commonwealth\u2019s] perspective, [an administrative] hearing is a minor matter where one would not expect the [Commonwealth] to prosecute the action vigorously[.]\u201d <em>State v. Gusman, </em>125 Idaho 805, 874 P.2d 1112, 1115 (1994). Also, because license suspension hearings are civil in nature, \u201cthe court may rely on law. enforcement officers\u2019 official reports in the absence of the officers themselves.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>149 Ill.Dec. at 280, 561 N.E.2d at 650; <em>State v. Higa, </em>79 Hawaii 1, 897 P.2d 928, 936 (1995); see Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2(B), (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">For these reasons, we hold that the doctrines of double jeopardy and collateral estoppel did not bar appellant\u2019s prosecution for drunk driving, and we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\">. This statutory section reads, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The court's findings [with regard to the review of the license suspension] are without prejudice to the person contesting the suspension or to any other potential party as to any proceedings, civil or criminal, and shall not be evidence in any proceedings, civil or criminal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b218-9\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ3\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">I concur in the majority\u2019s holding that our decision in <em>Tench v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 200, 462 S.E.2d 922 (1995)(en banc) is dispositive of appellant\u2019s double jeopardy argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">While I generally agree with most of the majority\u2019s discussion of collateral estoppel, I believe that the following language of Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2(0 is dispositive of the collateral estoppel issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The [general district] court\u2019s findings [with regard to the review of the license suspension] are without prejudice to the person contesting the suspension or to any other potential party as to any proceedings, civil or criminal, and shall not be evidence in any proceedings, civil or criminal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u201cIn Virginia, it is well established that collateral estoppel requires mutuality.\u201d <em>Hampton Roads Sanitation Dist. v. City of Virginia Beach, </em>240 Va. 209, 213, 396 S.E.2d 656, 658 (1990). Under the mutuality doctrine, for which no exception applies in this case, \u201ca litigant is generally prevented from invoking the preclusive force of a judgment unless he would have been bound had the prior litigation of the issue reached the opposite result.\u201d <em>N &amp; W Railway Co. v. Bailey Lumber Co., </em>221 Va. 638, 640, 272 S.E.2d 217, 218 (1980). <em>See also Angstadt v. Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co., </em>249 Va. 444, 447, 457 S.E.2d 86, 87 (1995). Under the language of Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2(C), no party to the license suspension hearing was bound by any ruling made by the general district court. Indeed, the statute states that the findings may not be used in any proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Thus, I would also affirm the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
