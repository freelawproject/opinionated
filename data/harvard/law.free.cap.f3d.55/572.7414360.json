This is the third time that we have reviewed Remillong\u2019s sentencing by Judge G. Kendall Sharp in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Canzater, </em>994 F.2d 773 (11th Cir.1993) (per curiam) <em>(\u201cRemillong I </em>\u201d); <em>United States v. Remillong, </em>No. 93-3034 (11th Cir.

Section 3664(a) states as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-14\">(a) The court, in determining whether to order restitution under section 3663 of this title and the amount of such restitution, shall consider the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense, the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>defendant\u2019s dependents, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASq\">Also, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.1 establishes rules for the district courts to consider when imposing restitution. <em>One element which must be fully considered is the financial condition and the ability of a defendant to pay. The record in this case demonstrates that the district court failed to adequately consider the statutory factor of ability to pay under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 866k(a). </em>This constitutes an abuse of discretion requiring remand for resentencing in accordance with the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><em>Remillong II, </em>slip op. at 3-4 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(a)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Following our <em>Remillong II </em>opinion, Rem-illong filed a motion to correct his sentence. Judge Sharp, however, refused to eliminate the restitution order. Instead, Judge Sharp handwrote across the top of Remillong\u2019s motion to correct his sentence: \u201cBecause this case involves a bank robbery and defendant had physical possession of the money, restitution of $29,251.00 is appropriate.\u201d Rl-57; <em>see </em>Appendix. Consequently, this third appeal from Remillong\u2019s sentencing ensued.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">We review a district court\u2019s restitution order for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>United States v.

The Victim and Witness Protection Act (\u2018VWPA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663-3664, authorizing restitution to victims of crimes, \u201cspecifically directs a sentencing judge to consider not only the victim\u2019s injury, <em>but also </em>\u2018the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant\u2019s dependents, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.

Mahoney, </em>859 F.2d 47, 52 (7th Cir.1988) (\u201c[A]n impossible order of restitution ... is nothing but a sham, for the defendant has no chance of complying with the same, thus defeating any hope of restitution and impeding the rehabilitation process.\u201d). Consequently, \u201cwe will not uphold the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion if the record is devoid of any evidence that the defendant is able to satisfy the restitution order.\u201d <em>United States v. Patty, </em>992 F.2d 1045, 1052 (10th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">While we have determined that a \u201cdefendant\u2019s indigency at the time of sentencing is not a bar to an order of restitution under the VWPA,\u201d <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>909 F.2d 431, 435 (11th Cir.1990), we nonetheless have required that the district court evaluate the defendant\u2019s financial condition and ability to pay before determining the restitution amount, <em>United States v. Cobbs, </em>967 F.2d 1555, 1558 (11th Cir.1992) (per curiam); <em>Stevens, </em>909 F.2d at 435.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number><em>Logar, </em>975 F.2d 958, 964 (3d Cir.1992) (holding that, while restitution can be legally ordered for indigent defendants, \u201crestitution is only appropriate in an amount that the defendant can realistically be expected to pay\u201d). Further, we have held under <em>Hughey v. United States, 495 </em>U.S. 411, 413, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>1979, 1981, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990), that the \u201cdistrict court is authorized to order restitution only for the loss caused by the specific conduct underlying the offense of conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Cobbs, </em>967 F.2d at 1559. Judge Sharp, however, \u201capparently focused only on the amount of loss to the victim[s]\u201d without considering Remillong\u2019s ability to pay the ordered restitution within the statutory limitations period as required by sections 3663(f)(1) \u2014 (3) and 3664(a). <em>United States v. Newman, </em>6 F.3d 623, 631 (9th Cir.1993); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(f)(l)-(3) (designating specific dates by which restitution must be paid in full relative to the sentence imposed); <em>accord </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.1, comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating his financial resources by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(d). At sentencing, Remillong testified that he had no financial ability to pay the ordered restitution, no cash flow, and no <em>money in </em>a bank. R5-9. Additionally, he testified that he committed the bank robberies because he \u201cneeded money\u201d because of his \u201ceconomic problems\u201d resulting from not having a job. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Remillong\u2019s Presen-tence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) shows that his only asset was a 1979 Ford pickup truck valued at approximately $1,000.00, and that he had a loan liability of $3,000.00.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The PSR, which Judge Sharp adopted at sentencing, states that \u201cit does not appear that [Remillong] has the ability to pay a fine.\u201d PSR at 15. No evidence was presented to show his ability to pay the restitution ordered within the statutory limitations period.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Despite this record evidence and in blatant contravention of the adopted PSR, Judge Sharp ordered restitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>tion of the cumulative amount taken from the ten banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">We have determined that district courts are not required to make factual findings whenever they impose a restitution order <em>if the appellate record provides sufficient reasons for the decision to order full restitution. United States v. Hairston, </em>888 F.2d 1349, 1352-53 (11th Cir.1989); <em>accord United States v. Lombardo, </em>35 F.3d 526, 529-30 (11th Cir.1994) (per curiam). Our review of the record in this case, particularly the PSR, causes us to believe that Judge Sharp \u201ceffectively ignored the requirements of the statute\u201d by failing to consider evidence of Remil-long\u2019s financial inability to pay the ordered restitution in the record before him. <em>Bailey, </em>975 F.2d at 1032. \u201cA defendant claiming that the district judge failed to consider a mandatory sentencing factor [under section 3664(a) ] must show either that (1) it is not improbable that the judge failed to consider the mandatory factor and was influenced thereby, or (2) the judge explicitly repudiated the mandatory factor.\u201d <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>28 F.3d 38, 41 (7th Cir.1994).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Clearly, Remillong has satisfied both parts of this disjunctive standard. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>901 F.2d 855, 857 (10th Cir.1990) (vacating restitution order in bank embezzlement case because district court abused its discretion by ignoring the defendant\u2019s evi-dentiary proof of her inability to pay the restitution ordered at sentencing or within the statutory limitations period).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">After specifically being instructed by this court in <em>Remillong II </em>to assess on remand Remillong\u2019s financial capability to pay restitution pursuant to section 3664(a), Judge Sharp\u2019s cryptic handwritten notation that Remillong owes full restitution because he once had physical possession of the money is more than irresponsible, it is defiant. Far from performing the assessment that he explicitly was instructed to conduct in <em>Remil-long </em>II,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Judge Sharp\u2019s cursory handwritten notation dashed at the top of Remillong\u2019s motion to correct his sentence evidences Judge Sharp\u2019s disregard for this court\u2019s instruction and mandate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The problem in this ease is not that restitution was ordered, but that Judge Sharp failed to evaluate Rem-illong\u2019s financial ability to pay as statutorily required and <em>as mandated by this court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Regrettably, this case is not an aberration. We previously have reversed and/or remanded cases to Judge Sharp for failing to provide factual and legal explanations for his rulings. <em>See, e.g., Imperial Residential Design, Inc. v. Palms Dev. Group, Inc., </em>29 F.3d 581, 583 (11th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (\u201cBefore we can effectively review this appeal, we need an explanation from the district court about its factual and legal conclusions on the standing issue.\u201d); <em>Rodgers ex rel. Jones v. Bowen, </em>790 F.2d 1550, 1553 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201cIn the absence of prior resort to less severe sanctions which were available, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing ... [the] action\u201d [of plaintiff-appellant for slight delay in paying the filing fee after denying her application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis].); United States v. Bergouignan, </em>764 F.2d 1503, 1507 (11th Cir.1985) (\u2018When the government\u2019s failure to support its allegation ... is coupled with the district court\u2019s failure to explain its reasons for denying the motion to dismiss, ... we have no way of ascertaining whether the motion was proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ly denied_ Given the paucity of the record before us, we have no alternative but to remand to the district court for a determination of the number of excludable days, if any, between the arrest and the dismissal of the complaint.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1044, 108 S.Ct. 778, 98 L.Ed.2d 864 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We have gently chided Judge Sharp for his failure to provide reasoning for dismissing a claim \u201c \u201cwithout prejudice and without leave to amend\u2019 \u201d by stating that, \u201c[wjhile the failure of a lower court to give reasons for its disposition of an action makes review difficult, it does not necessarily preclude affir-mance where appropriate reasons for dismissal are readily apparent.\u201d <em>Grant v. County of Seminole, </em>817 F.2d 731, 732 (11th Cir.1987) (per curiam). We also have used the severe remedy of reassigning a case when Judge Sharp abused his discretion by refusing to grant an evidentiary hearing. <em>United States v. Yesil, </em>991 F.2d 1527, 1533 (11th Cir.1992). Analogous to discretion being limited in ordering restitution by considering the financial ability of the defendant to pay, we explained to Judge Sharp in <em>Yesil </em>that discretionary acceptance of a plea agreement <em>\u201cobligate[s] </em>\u201d the district court \u201cto accept the government\u2019s proffered information,\u201d causing the court to lose \u201cits usual discretion to determine whether or not to grant a party\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1532. In reversing and remanding that case for proceedings before a different district judge, we held that Judge Sharp \u201cabused this limited discretion when he refused to grant the requested Rule 35 evidentiary hearings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Additionally, we specifically have addressed Judge Sharp\u2019s handwritten notations for failing to give reasons for dispositive orders. <em>Seamon v. Vaughan, </em>921 F.2d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.1991) (per curiam). In vacating and remanding Judge Sharp\u2019s discretionary attorney fees award, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">The basis for the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees is unclear. <em>The court failed to make any findings of fact </em>to support the $25,000.00 amount. Its <em>only explanation </em>was a <em>cryptic handwritten comment </em>relating to duplication of attorney services. The district court did not explain why it eliminated half of the claimed attorney fees as duplicative. As a result, <em>we are unable to review the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion, </em>either on appeal or cross-appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-12\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">We are greatly troubled that Judge Sharp continues to ignore or to circumvent specific directives and mandates from this court in his adjudication of eases before him. His deliberate defiance of our mandate in <em>Remil-long II, </em>however, not only shows a disregard for our explicit instruction, complete with our quoting the governing statute to him, but also disregard for Remillong, who is before Judge Sharp for a just resolution of his case. Further, the third sentencing appeal in this case exemplifies the judicial inefficiency that results from such obstinate conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">Apparently, the only way that we can obtain compliance from Judge Sharp in this case is to reverse or vacate his rulings outright with the instruction that he <em>cannot </em>rule a particular way, as evidenced by Remillong\u2019s first two sentencing appeals. <em>See supra </em>note 1. When he had the opportunity to exercise discretion, as with the evaluation of Remil-long\u2019s ability to pay restitution, Judge Sharp stubbornly persisted in his questioned decision without reasonable explanation or justification. We <em>again </em>hold that Judge Sharp abused his discretion in complying with the requirements of section 3664(a) in evaluating Remillong\u2019s ability to pay restitution and, further, specifically defied our mandate in <em>Remillong II. </em>From Judge Sharp\u2019s rulings on the two prior remands in this case, we have no confidence that he will perform the appropriate evaluation of Remillong\u2019s financial condition on another remand concerning the same restitution issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">Accordingly, we VACATE Remillong\u2019s restitution order and REMAND this case to the Chief Judge of the Middle District of Florida to REASSIGN to a different district judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As we have ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>plained herein, the present record will not support a conclusion that Remillong, at sentencing, or within the statutory limitations period, could pay the cumulative amount taken from the victim banks of $29,251.00. It appears that an evidentiary hearing would be useful in assessing Remillong\u2019s present financial status as well as his ability to pay restitution within the statutory limitations period.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AL8e\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-9\">. In the first appeal of Ms sentence, we determined that Judge Sharp \"clearly erred\u201d in enhancing Remillong's sentence by two levels for an express threat of death in connection with the bank robberies as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(D) (presently U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F)). <em>United States v. Canzater, </em>994 F.2d 773, 775 (11th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (Remillong's case was consolidated with that of defendant-appellant Darryl L. Canzater on the issue of what language or action constitutes an express threat of death). At the resentencing hearing, Judge Sharp deleted the two-level, express-threat-of-death enhancement in accordance with tMs court's mandate in <em>Canzater, </em>but then enhanced Remillong's sentence by <em>three levels </em>pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E), for the possession of a dangerous weapon during the bank robberies, when no weapon was involved, and reaffirmed his previous sentencing order that Remillong make restitution of $29,251.00. We note, however, that the three-level enhancement appears to be Judge Sharp's attempt to circumvent this court\u2019s direction in <em>Canzater, </em>where we explained that ''[t]he statement, 'I have a gun'\" may only be a bald threat, which does not mean necessarily that a gun was present during the commission of the robbery. <em>Canzater, </em>994 F.2d at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">Remillong appealed Judge Sharp\u2019s amended sentencing order on two bases: (1) the three-level enhancement for possessing a dangerous weapon pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E), and (2) abuse of discretion for ordering restitution without considering fully Remillong's financial condition and ability to pay. Concerning possession of a dangerous weapon, we vacated Remillong\u2019s sentence and \"remand[ed] for resentencing with directions that Remillong be resentenced without the three-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon\u201d in accordance with Canza-ter. <em>United States v.

The present record in this case cannot provide a sufficient basis for review because the 1991 PSR likely is obsolete, since Remillong is no longer incarcerated and knowledge of his present occupation, obligations and responsibilities as well as earning capacity within the statutory limitations period would be helpful in determining the appropriate restitution. Additionally, after <em>three </em>sentencing appeals, a proper assessment of Remillong's financial condition has yet to be undertaken.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
