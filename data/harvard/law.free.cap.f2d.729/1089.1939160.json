Patterson Trust (Trust) in this action for a refund of federal income taxes with interest. The Trust, by its Trustee, the Reeves Banking &amp; Trust Company (Reeves), instituted this action for a refund of $115,747.98 in federal income taxes paid by the Trust in 1979 for the year 1976, plus interest of $15,805.94 which had accrued as of 1979. The Internal Revenue Service had assessed such taxes on the basis that the amount paid to the Trust for the redemption of all of the Trust\u2019s shares in the Puritan Laundry and Dry Cleaning Company (Puritan) should be taxed as a dividend, and not as a sale of stock. The record reveals the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">Prior to 1969, Henry Patterson, Sr. was the sole shareholder and chief executive officer of Puritan. In 1969, he gave forty shares of Puritan stock to each of his children \u2014 John, Hank and Ellen. At the time, Ellen was married to Bill Hicks (Hicks), who, along with Hank, was employed by Puritan. Henry Patterson retained 200 shares of Puritan stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-8\">Bill Hicks was apparently a skilled business manager, while Hank Patterson (Hank) lacked effectiveness. Through the years, a bitter tension between Hicks and Hank developed, resulting in numerous altercations, one of which ended with Hank\u2019s hospitalization. At one point, John Patterson (John) participated in the management of the business but, because of the Hank-Hicks rivalry, John resigned and pursued a teaching career.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-9\">At trial, there was testimony that Henry Patterson desired that Hicks operate the company after Patterson\u2019s retirement. In early 1970, Patterson suffered a broken hip which forced him to remain away from the company. He designated Hicks to act as Puritan\u2019s president and general manager in his absence. Patterson\u2019s health continued to deteriorate and he died in November 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-10\">In June 1971, Hicks presented the Puritan directors with a demand for an increase in salary and a proposal that they place all of the Puritan shares in a voting trust which Hicks would then control. The directors demurred and Hicks resigned. He immediately staged a slowdown of Puritan employees and persuaded the company\u2019s most substantial commercial accounts to demand that Puritan rehire him. Within ten days of Hicks\u2019 resignation, Puritan was on the verge of collapse. John, who had since returned to the business, contacted Hicks and negotiated a five-year employment contract with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-11\">Hicks\u2019 contract provided an increased salary, a profit sharing arrangement, and a five-year option to acquire eighty shares of Puritan stock. Hicks acquired five of those shares and his option on the remaining seventy-five shares remained open. At the same time, Hank also received a five-year contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-12\">During the ensuing five years, Puritan performed well but problems between Hank and Hicks became increasingly aggravated; Hank, John, <em>and </em>Ella Patterson, their mother, often were at odds with Hicks and his wife, Ellen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-13\">In the spring of 1976, the Patterson estate was closed. Henry Patterson had placed his 200 shares of Puritan stock in the Henry T. Patterson Trust (Trust) with his widow, Ella, as the beneficiary with the power to appoint the corpus at her death. Following the closing of the estate, the Puritan stock was thus distributed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-14\">Henry T. Patterson Trust 200 shares</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-15\">Ella Patterson 25 shares</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-16\">Hank Patterson 40 shares</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-17\">John Patterson 40 shares</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>Ellen (Patterson) Hicks 40 shares</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-4\">Bill Hicks 5 shares</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-5\">Lester Winkler 6 shares</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">Hicks devised a two-step plan whereby he and his wife could obtain control of Puritan. First, Puritan would redeem the Trust shares and, following the redemption, Hicks would exercise his option and acquire an additional seventy-five shares. As a result, Hicks and his spouse would own 120 shares and the remaining shareholders would control only 111 shares, thus Hicks would acquire a controlling interest in Puritan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">The Reeves Bank, as Trustee, determined that if it refused to redeem the shares, Hicks would leave the company and eventually the Trust corpus would be worthless. Thus, acting in what it perceived as the best interests of the Trust and the beneficiary, the Reeves Bank determined to accept the proposed redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-8\">On April 2, 1976, the directors were presented with the proposal. The Trustee reported that it would be in Ella\u2019s best interest to redeem the shares and invest the proceeds. The minutes report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-9\">After detailed discussion, it was moved by Wm. Hicks and seconded by [Hank] F. Patterson, that the company purchase the outstanding 200 shares held by the Reeves Banking and Trust Company, in trust for Mrs. Patterson upon the following terms: Price One Hundred Ninety Thousand and no/100 dollars (200 shares $950.00)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-10\">$47,500 Down Balance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANf\">$47,500 Due January 15, 1977</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQqZ\">$47,500 Due January 15, 1978</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoG\">$47,500 Due January 15, 1979</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEX\">Following the redemption, on July 7, 1976 Hicks exercised his option and purchased seventy-five shares of Puritan stock from the company. Hicks thereafter forced a realignment of the Puritan Board of Directors. Prior to his attaining control, the Directors were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-15\">Ella Patterson Ellen Hicks</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-16\">Hank Patterson Lester Winkler</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-17\">John Patterson</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1193-18\">Following the consumation of Hicks\u2019 plan, the Directors were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-19\">Bill Hicks</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-20\">Ellen Hicks</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuF\">Lester Winkler</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1193-21\">The Trust reported the transaction as a capital gains sale. Upon review, the Commissioner determined that the amount received by the Trust in the redemption, $190,000.00, was a dividend taxable as ordinary income under \u00a7 301 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. A deficiency of $115,747.98 plus interest of $15,805.94 was assessed. The Trust paid the deficiency, and, as a result, netted $58,446.08 from the original transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-22\">The Trust was denied a refund and instituted the within litigation. The district court rejected the Trust\u2019s argument that the transaction amounted to a termination of its interest in Puritan, but accepted the Trust\u2019s alternative argument that the transaction was not essentially equivalent to a dividend and was therefore entitled to capital gains treatment. This timely appeal by the United States followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-23\">The Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 301, as effective in 1976, provided that \u201ca distribution of property ... made by a corporation to a shareholder\u201d would be taxed as the ordinary income of that shareholder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 302 of the Code, 26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 302, established, however, four exceptions to the general rule that proceeds from a redemption of stock by a corporation shall be treated, for tax purposes, \u201cas a distribution of property to which \u00a7 301 applies\u201d. As relevant, the 1976 version of \u00a7 302 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-4\">(a) General Rule. \u2014 If a corporation redeems its stock ..., and if paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of subsection (b) applies, such redemption shall be treated as a distribution in part or full payment in exchange for the stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-5\">(b) Redemptions Treated as Exchanges.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-6\">(1) Redemptions not equivalent to dividends. \u2014 Subsection (a) shall apply if the redemption is not essentially equivalent to a dividend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-7\">* * ifc <em>% </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-8\">(3) Termination of shareholder\u2019s interest. \u2014 Subsection (a) shall apply if the redemption is in complete redemption of all of the stock of the corporation owned by the shareholder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-9\">* * <em>* </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-10\">(5) Application of paragraphs. \u2014 In determining whether a redemption meets the requirements of paragraph (1) the fact that such redemption fails to meet the requirements of paragraphs (2), (3), or (4) shall not be taken into account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-12\"># # sfc % * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-13\">(d) Redemptions Treated as Distributions of Property. \u2014 Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, if a corporation redeems its stock ..., and if subsection (a) of this section does not apply, such redemption shall be treated as a distribution of property to which \u00a7 301 applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1194-14\">Paragraphs (2) [dealing with substantially disproportionate redemptions] and (4) [dealing with railroad stocks] are not applicable. The district court rejected the Trust\u2019s arguments pursuant to paragraph (3), and the Trust admitted on appeal that paragraph (3) is not applicable to this redemption. Therefore, at issue here is the propriety, as a matter of law, of the district court\u2019s determination that the Trust\u2019s redemption was not essentially a dividend, as defined by \u00a7 302(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-17\">In <em>United States v. Davis, </em>397 U.S. 301, 90 S.Ct. 1041, 25 L.Ed.2d 323 (1970), the Supreme Court evaluated the intended scope of \u00a7 302(b)(1). In that case, a sole shareholder caused part of his shares to be redeemed by the corporation; the Court concluded that such a redemption is always equivalent to a dividend and thus subject to ordinary income tax. However, the Court\u2019s examination of \u00a7 302(b)(1)\u2019s history is germane to the analysis of this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-18\">It was clearly proper for Congress to treat distributions generally as taxable dividends when made out of earnings and profits and then to prevent avoidance of that result without regard to motivation where the distribution is in exchange for redeemed stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-19\">We conclude that that is what Congress did when enacting \u00a7 302(b)(1). If a corporation distributes property as a simple dividend, the effect is to transfer the property from the company to its shareholders without a change in the relative economic interests or rights of the stockholders. Where a redemption has that same effect, it cannot be said to have satisfied the \u201cnot essentially equivalent to a dividend\u201d requirement of \u00a7 302(b)(1). Rather, to qualify for preferred treatment under that section, a redemption must result in a meaningful reduction of the shareholder\u2019s proportionate interest in the corporation. Clearly, taxpayer here, who (after application of the attribution rules) was the sole shareholder both before and after the redemption, did not qualify under this test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1194-20\">397 U.S. at 313, 90 S.Ct. at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-21\">As explicated by the Supreme Court, \u00a7 302(b)(1) provides that corporate distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>tions which do not alter the shareholder\u2019s \u201crelative economic interests or rights\u201d will be taxed as a dividend, regardless of the form or nomenclature given the transactions. The test is to examine the change in the taxpayer\u2019s relationship to the corporation; \u00a7 302(b)(1) is satisfied, under this test, if the examination establishes a \u201cmeaningful reduction\u201d of the taxpayer\u2019s relative interests or rights in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-4\">Whether a distribution by redemption of stock was \u201cessentially equivalent to a dividend\u201d for the purposes of the 1954 Code is a question of fact. <em>Wright v. United States, </em>482 F.2d 600 (8th Cir.1973); <em>United States v. Fewell, </em>255 F.2d 496 (5th Cir.1958); 26 C.F.R. 1.302-2(b) (Treasury Regulations). The district court\u2019s factual determinations must be upheld on appeal if they are supported by substantial evidence within the record considered as a whole. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">To determine if the district court properly discerned a meaningful reduction in the Trust\u2019s interest and rights in Puritan, the starting point must be a comparison of the Trust's relative holdings prior to and after the redemption. As in <em>United States v. Davis, supra, </em>this comparison requires application of the attribution statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">Briefly stated, the 1954 Code provided that a trust constructively owned its shares plus the shares held by the beneficiary, including those shares which \u00a7 318 attributed to the beneficiary. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 302(c), 318.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-24\">Applying this statute, it is readily apparent that prior to the redemption, the Trust constructively owned 345 shares of the Puritan company, computed from its own shares (200), Ella\u2019s holdings (25), and the shares owned by Ella\u2019s children (John \u2014 40, Hank \u2014 40, Ellen Hicks \u2014 40). Following the redemption, the Trust\u2019s constructive holdings were reduced to 145 shares (25 owned by Ella, 120 held by her children). Only 11 other shares remained actually outstanding (Hicks \u2014 5, Winkler \u2014 6); therefore, the Trust held 345/356 shares, or 97%, before and 145/156b shares, or 93%, immediately after the redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-26\">When the district court made this comparison it included the seventy-five option shares held by Hicks. Accordingly, the district court determined that the Trust held 80% of the company before redemption (345/431), and 62.8% after redemption (145/231). Because the Trust no longer controlled the company after the redemption (holding less than two-thirds of the stock), the district court concluded that the \u201cmeaningful reduction\u201d test had been satisfied. The district court included the Hicks option in its calculations pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>plain language of the attribution statute, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 318(a)(4), which stated [emphasis added]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-4\">If <em>any </em>person has an option to acquire stock, such stock shall be considered as owned by such person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">On appeal, the Government urges that \u00a7 318(a)(4) actually applies only to the taxpayer or to individuals whose shares are otherwise attributable to the taxpayer. The Government would therefore greatly narrow the scope of \u00a7 318(a)(4). Under the Government\u2019s view of the statute, the Trust\u2019s ownership interest in Puritan was reduced only 4% as a result of the redemption, from 97 to 93%, which, it contends, was not meaningful as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-8\">\u201c[I]n determining the scope of a statute, one is to look first at its language.\u201d <em>Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., </em>460 U.S. 103, 103 S.Ct. 986, 990, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983). <em>See North Dakota v. United States, </em>460 U.S. 300, 103 S.Ct. 1095, 1103, 75 L.Ed.2d 77 (1983); <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, </em>444 U.S. 11, 19, 100 S.Ct. 242, 246, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979). \u201cAbsent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u201d <em>Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980). Further, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that where a statute is clear and unambiguous on its face, a court will not look to legislative history to alter the application of the statute except in rare and exception circumstances.\u201d <em>Pope v. Rollins Protective Services Co., </em>703 F.2d 197, 206 (5th Cir.1983). <em>See Rubin v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 424, 430, 101 S.Ct. 698, 701, 66 L.Ed.2d 633 (1981); <em>TVA v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 187 n. 33, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2298 n. 33, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978); <em>Crooks v. Harrelson, </em>282 U.S. 55, 60, 51 S.Ct. 49, 50, 75 L.Ed. 156 (1930). Finally, \u201cCongress is presumed to use words in their ordinary sense unless it expressly indicates the contrary.\u201d <em>Davis Bros., Inc. v. Donovan, </em>700 F.2d 1368, 1370 (11th Cir.1983) <em>reh. and reh. en banc denied </em>(Eleventh Circuit refused to allow the Secretary of Labor to interpret \u201ccustomarily furnished\u201d meals as meaning \u201cvoluntarily accepted\u201d meals for purposes of wage provisions in Fair Labor Standards Act). <em>See Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, </em>322 U.S. 607, 617-618, 64 S.Ct. 1215, 1221-22, 88 L.Ed. 1488 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-12\">Nevertheless, the Government invites this court to examine the legislative history of \u00a7 318(a)(4) and conclude that \u201cany person\u201d actually means only those \u201cparties in the line of attribution\u201d. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 318(a)(1)(A), 318(a)(4), <em>reprinted supra </em>n. 2. The Government relies on the commentary in the \u201cDetailed Discussion of Bill\u201d portion of the Senate Report relative to \u00a7 318(a)(3) [currently effective as \u00a7 318(a)(4)], The commentary describes the operation of the relevant portions of the attributive statute in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-13\">\u00a7 318. Constructive ownership of stock</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-14\">This section describes the area in which although in fact transactions related to stock ownership are in connection with a specific individual, ownership of stock is deemed to be in the hands of persons other than the person directly involved. Thus, for the purpose of determining whether a redemption of stock qualifies as a disproportionate redemption ... consideration is given not only to the stock held by such person but also to stock owned by members of his family....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-15\">The area of constructive ownership includes members of the family, persons having interests in ... trusts, ... such ... trusts, ... and stock held under an option.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-16\">In the family area (sec. 318(a)(1)) an individual is deemed to own stock owned by his parents, his children, and his grandchildren____ In the case of trusts, ... the beneficiary or grantor is deemed to own his proportionate interest in the stock owned by the trust or estate and the trust or estate is deemed to own all of the stock owned by its beneficiaries or grantors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>In any of the cases <em>above described. </em>where stock, though not owned, is subject to an option, the holder of such option is deemed to own such stock (sec. 318(a)(3)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1197-4\">S.Rep. No. 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 45, <em>reprinted in </em>[1954] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4621, 4890-91 [emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">The Government urges that as a result of the commentary\u2019s apparent limitation of the option attribution rule to \u201cthe cases above described\u201d, \u201cthe Senate indicated its intent that \u00a7 318(a)(3) (now \u00a7 318(a)(4)) should be limited to parties in the line of attribution\u201d. The Internal Revenue. Service has consistently followed the reasoning herein argued by the Government, <em>see, e.g., </em>Rev.Rul. 68-601, and the tax court has adopted the Service\u2019s view as well. <em>See Sorem v. Commissioner, </em>40 T.C. 206 (1963); <em>Northwestern Steel and Supply Co., Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>60 T.C. 356 (1973). However, only two appeals courts have addressed the issue and they, without analysis, adopted diverse positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">In <em>Friend v. United States, </em>345 F.2d 761 (1st Cir.1965), the First Circuit\u2019s <em>dictum </em>indicated that that court believed that \u201cCongress intended that section to apply only where options are held by the person whose shares are being redeemed.\u201d 345 F.2d at 764. In <em>Sorem v. C.I.R., </em>334 F.2d 275, 280 (10th Cir.1964), the court, again without analysis, applied the plain language of the options attribution provision of \u00a7 318(a), and rejected the Government\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">The Government argues that this court should defer to the Service\u2019s consistently-applied interpretation of the Code. However, while it is axiomatic that where statutory language remains vague even when illuminated by the legislative history, the construction offered by the agency charged with the enforcement of the statute will often be accorded dispositive weight, it is an equal principle that the agency may not so interpret the statute as to controvert its plain and unambiguous language. Except in \u201crare and exceptional circumstances\u201d, <em>Rubin v. United States, supra, </em>such as where Congress \u201cexpressly indicates\u201d its intent that the plain meaning of the statutory language be avoided, <em>Davis Bros., Inc. v. Donovan, supra, </em>unambiguous statutory language \u201cis to be regarded as conclusive\u201d. <em>Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">Instantly, the Government asserts only the commentary of the Senate Report, reprinted above, as support for its construction of \u201cany person\u201d in \u00a7 318(a)(4). The commentary falls short of a clear indication by Congress that the natural impact of the statutory language under review should be restrained. Accordingly, the district court appropriately included the option shares held by Hicks in determining the Trust\u2019s relative holdings prior to and following redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-10\">It should be noted that, even if the Hicks shares were excluded, on the instant record the district court would have been entitled to enter the factual finding that the transaction under review was not essentially equivalent to a dividend and was therefore properly claimed as a capital gain. \u201cThe question whether a distribution in redemption of stock ... is not essentially equivalent to a dividend ... depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.302-3(b) (1983 Treasury Regulations); <em>United States v. Davis, supra. </em>Obviously, <em>one </em>of the pertinent facts would be the relative holdings of the taxpayer as computed under \u00a7 318\u2019s constructive stock ownership provisions, 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1,302(b), <em>United States v. Davis, </em>however, neither statutory enactment nor judicial construction would support the proposition that the resulting comparative calculation would become the exclusive and dispositive fact.
