On July 7, 1982 this court dismissed HHS\u2019s appeal for want of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. More than three months later, on October 28, the government filed a motion to reinstate the appeal without stating grounds. This court rejected the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8t\">Appellant\u2019s motion does not address [the] issue [of this court\u2019s jurisdiction] and does not state any grounds for reinstating this appeal____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In the motion presently before us, filed two months after the above-quoted order, the government makes another belated attempt to revive its appeal, <em>cf. </em>11th Cir.R. 26 (petition for rehearing must be filed within 20 days of date of opinion), this time setting forth grounds. The appellee, in his response to this latest motion, argues that the appeal is frivolous and moves for costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">We cannot agree with appellee that the appeal was frivolous from the outset. An order of a district court remanding a case to an administrative agency has been held appealable under some circumstances, notwithstanding that the district court\u2019s order is technically interlocutory. <em>See, e.g., Gold v. Weinberger, </em>473 F.2d 1376 (5th Cir.1973); <em>Cohen v. Perales, </em>412 F.2d 44 (5th Cir.1969), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). HHS thus initially had an arguable basis for its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">HHS\u2019s duplicative attempt to reinstate its appeal, however, is frivolous. HHS may not call upon this court to again reconsider a ruling that it has had ample opportunity to challenge. <em>See Exhibitors Poster Exchange, Inc. v. National Screen Service Corp., </em>543 F.2d 1106 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Although we are prepared to deny HHS\u2019s motion on this basis alone, we find the former Fifth Circuit cases cited by HHS, <em>Gold, supra; Cohen, supra, </em>distinguishable. <em>See Hall v. Heckler, </em>No. 83-7097 (order of 5/23/83).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">The appellee moves for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with the motion to reinstate. Although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(a), (d) (West Supp.1983) authorizes an award of fees and costs against the United States in some circumstances, the appellee is not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the meaning of that section. <em>See Hanrahan v. Hampton, </em>446 U.S. 754, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980); <em>Hall, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">The motion to reinstate is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
