Linsteadt and his wife, sue under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cthe Information Act\u201d), 5 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>\u00a7 552, to require the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) to permit them access to certain agency records. They appeal from summary judgment rejecting their demand insofar as an agency-prepared memorandum that reported only the facts stated by the Linsteadts themselves in an interview between them and an IRS special agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\">I. <em>Overview</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">The principal legal issue, as will be stated below in more detail, is whether \u2014 as the defendant agency contends, and as the district court held \u2014 the agency\u2019s duty to disclose \u201creturn information\u201d is entirely measured by a provision of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103; or whether, as the plaintiffs contend, that provision is an exempting statute under the Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3), that furnishes the criteria for the duty to disclose, but which duty is nevertheless subject to the provisions of the Information Act. The difference is more than theoretical. If \u00a7 6103 provides the sole measure of the duty, on judicial review the claimant has the burden of proving an abuse of the agency\u2019s discretion in nondisclosure. If, however, the Information Act applies and merely incorporates the criteria of \u00a7 6103 as an exempting statute, on judicial review the district court determines the matter de novo, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B), with the agency bearing the burden of showing that nondisclosure was warranted, <em>id., </em>by one of the nine specific exemptions listed in \u00a7 552(b) of the Act. Following prior precedent of this court \u2014 and rejecting, as contrary to circuit panel practice, the suggestion of the IRS that we ignore this decision by a prior panel \u2014 we hold that, although \u00a7 6103 may furnish the criteria for the agency\u2019s duty to disclose return information, judicial review of the agency\u2019s nondisclosure is governed by the Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">This legal issue resolved, then the principal factual issue remaining is whether, in its alternative holding posited should this court find that the Information Act applies, the district court erred in determining that disclosure of a memorandum of the plaintiffs\u2019 own admissions to an IRS agent would \u201cseriously impair Federal tax administration\u201d, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(e)(7), or would \u201cseriously interfere with enforcement proceedings,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7), two of the statutory criteria justifying agency nondisclosure. Applying the accepted principles that under the Information Act the agency has the burden to justify nondisclosure, we affirm the district court\u2019s factual determinations that the agency\u2019s refusal to disclose the memorandum was justified by these statutory exemptions from the disclosure requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-12\">On this appeal, the merit-issue concerns the denial of the Linsteadts\u2019 Information Act request for portions of an IRS memorandum that contained only their own factual statements as summarized by an IRS agent who interviewed them, as will be detailed more fully later. We will here discuss the interrelationship between the Information Act and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103, the factual context in which this issue arises, as well as the applicable jurisprudential principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-13\">A. <em>The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-14\">The Information Act provides that an \u201cagency shall make available to the public,\u201d \u00a7 552(a), its records upon request, \u00a7 552(a)(3), except for nine specified exemptions, \u00a7 552(b) (two of which are claimed by the IRS here to apply). On judicial review of an agency\u2019s failure to disclose its records, \u201cthe court shall determine the matter de novo ..., and the burden is upon the agency to sustain its action.\u201d \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-15\">In resisting the Linsteadts\u2019 request for disclosure, the IRS relies upon Exemption 3 (the \u201cexempting statute\u201d exception) and upon Exemption 7(A) (the \u201cinvestigatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>records\u201d exception) of \u00a7 552(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this portion of the opinion, we will discuss the application of Exemption 3 to the present facts, reaching Exemption 7(A) in part IV below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">As set out in the margin, with regard to Exemption 3, the Information Act provides that it \u201cdoes not apply to matters that are ... specifically exempted from disclosure by statute,\u201d provided that the statute meets certain requirements. The crux of the present disputed legal issue is whether agency records subject to an \u201cexempting statute\u201d, such as the one upon which the IRS now relies, are completely exempted from any application whatsoever of the Information Act, or whether, instead, the Information Act\u2019s requirements of de novo judicial review and agency burden of proof for nondisclosure apply with regard to matters that the agency has statutory discretion not to disclose under the exempting statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">B. <em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">In refusing disclosure of the memorandum at issue to the Linsteadts, the IRS relies upon 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103. This statute, in general, provides that a taxpayer\u2019s tax re turns or tax \u201creturn information\u201d (defined, as is conceded, to include the memorandum of information furnished by the taxpayer to the IRS with respect to his tax liability) is confidential and may not be disclosed to the public (nor to governmental agencies, except as authorized by the statute). These nondisclosure provisions of \u00a7 6103 meet the requirement of proviso A to Exemption 3 \u2014 requiring \u201cthat the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave <em>no </em>discretion on the issue,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3)(A) quoted note 2 <em>supra </em>(emphasis added) \u2014 so that a person (a \u201cmember of the public,\u201d insofar as <em>another </em>person\u2019s tax information is concerned) is not entitled to access to the tax return or return information of <em>other </em>taxpayers. <em>Fruehauf Corporation v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>566 F.2d 574, 578, 580 (6th Cir.1980) (but specifically noting that the issue of discretionary release to a taxpayer himself, <em>infra, </em>was not at issue, 566 F.2d at 578 n. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-17\">However, \u00a7 6103 also provides that the taxpayer himself or his designee may have access to his own return and return information unless the Secretary determines that disclosure \u201cwould seriously impair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>Federal tax administration.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(c), (e)(7).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">The IRS contends that, by virtue of these provisions of \u00a7 6103, the Information Act is not applicable to a taxpayer\u2019s request for access to his own tax return or tax return information. The tax return or return information of a taxpayer is protected therefore (it argues) from access even by the taxpayer himself, when the Secretary determines that federal tax administration would thereby be impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">C. <em>Interrelationship of \u00a7 6103 and the Information Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">In so contending, the IRS relies upon the construction of \u00a7\u00a7 6103(c) and (e)(7), and the interrelationship between these statutory provisions and the Information Act, declared by <em>Zale Corporation v. United States Internal Revenue Service, </em>481 F.Supp. 486 (D.C.D.C.1979). <em>Zale </em>held that \u00a7 6103(e)(7) (then (e)(6)) was intended to provide the sole standard governing disclosure or nondisclosure of tax return information, rather than being merely support for a claim of exemption under the Information Act\u2019s \u00a7 552(b)(3) exemption. Construing \u00a7 6103\u2019s particularized regulation of release of return information as a self-contained statutory scheme, <em>Zale </em>concluded that the generalized disclosure requirements of the Information Act were not applicable at all to regulation of the disclosure/nondisclosure of tax return information. <em>Zale </em>held, therefore, that judicial review of the agency\u2019s nondisclosure of tax return information was limited by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq., </em>to determining whether the Secretary\u2019s action was arbitrary or an abuse of his discretion in his impairment determination upon which nondisclosure was based. 481 F.Supp. at 490. The <em>Zale </em>court found no such abuse and upheld nondisclosure. 481 F.Supp. at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-11\">Whatever the merits of the <em>Zale </em>interpretation, this circuit has held to the contrary. <em>Chamberlain v. Kurtz, </em>589 F.2d 827 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 842, 100 S.Ct. 82, 62 L.Ed.2d 54 (1979). In <em>Chamberlain, </em>we held that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6103(c) and (e)(7) (then, (e)(6)), indeed met the requirement of an exempting statute under Exemption 3(B), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(b)(3)(B) (quoted in note 2 <em>supra) </em>\u2014 as establishing sufficiently \u201cparticular criteria\u201d on \u201cparticular types\u201d of records to be withheld \u2014 so as \u201cto avoid the evils of unfettered agency discretion with which Congress was trying to deal when [in 1977] it [more restrictively] amended Exemption 3.\u201d 589 F.2d at 839. Therefore, \u00a7 6103(c), (e)(7) \u201cpermits the Secretary to withhold return information if he determines that such disclosure would \u2018seriously impair Federal tax administration.\u2019 \u201d 589 F.2d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-12\">However, we also held that, under the Information Act, the IRS has \u201cthe burden of sustaining a decision to withhold information\u201d from the taxpayer. 589 F.2d at 841.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to the subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>construction of <em>Zale, supra, </em>we held in <em>Chamberlain </em>that \u00a7 6103(c), (e)(7) provide criteria for nondisclosure under Exemption 3, but that on judicial review the agency-bears the burden of justifying its nondisclosure under the Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">The distinction between this circuit\u2019s approach in <em>Chamberlain </em>and that taken by the <em>Zale </em>court is brought into sharp focus by the decision of our sister Eleventh Circuit in <em>Currie v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>704 F.2d 523 (11th Cir.1983). There, similarly to the present case, the IRS argued that <em>Zale </em>provided the correct statutory interpretation of the statutory provisions at issue and that <em>Chamberlain </em>should not be followed. Rejecting the IRS\u2019s contentions,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the court concluded itself bound by the <em>Chamberlain </em>precedent of its predecessor court, which it construed as holding that \u201cthe nondisclosure of the requested information\u201d of tax return information relating to the taxpayer alleged to be protected from disclosure by \u00a7 6103 must be viewed \u201cas an exemption from the normal policy of full disclosure under the FOIA [Information Act]\u201d, 704 F.2d at 527, subject to de novo judicial review, with the agency bearing \u201cthe burden of proving [that] the withheld materials are within one of the exemptions of the \u2018tougher\u2019 FOIA [Information Act]\u201d, 704 F.2d at 530.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (The court also held that, once a court \u201chas analyzed a case under the strictures of FOIA [the Information Act] it is unnecessary for it to engage in the <em>Zale </em>analysis; a nondisclosure decision that passes muster under the \u2018tougher\u2019 FOIA requirements [the agency bearing the burden of proof to justify nondisclosure] will have a rational basis. Such needless use of scarce judicial resources is not to be encouraged.\u201d 704 F.2d at 528.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-13\">The IRS frankly admits that <em>Zale\u2019s </em>interpretation is contrary to that of this court in <em>Chamberlain </em>and to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s in <em>Currie </em>(following <em>Chamberlain), </em>but it argues that this panel is nevertheless free to decide in accordance with <em>Zale </em>\u201cbecause <em>Chamberlain </em>antedated <em>Zale </em>and no <em>Zale </em>-type argument was made to this Court in <em>Chamberlain.\u201d </em>IRS brief, p. 13. However, \u201c[u]nder the precedent theory of this court, one panel may not overrule,the decision of another panel of this court squarely on point and in the absence of intervening and overruling Supreme Court decisions.\u201d <em>White v. Estelle, </em>720 F.2d 415, 417 (5th Cir.1983).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>To summarize: The present facts before us concern a request by the taxpayers that the IRS furnish them access to a memorandum of factual statements made by them to an IRS agent. The IRS denied disclosure on the basis of its power to withhold release to the taxpayer himself of his tax return information when it determines that such disclosure would seriously impair tax administration, relying on 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6103(c) and (e)(7). It now contends that its denial may be reviewed solely under that statute for an abuse of its discretion. We hold, however, that while 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103 provides the criteria for nondisclosure under Exemption 3 of the Information Act, the agency\u2019s denial of disclosure is reviewable under the Information Act, with the government bearing the burden of demonstrating that one of the specific exemptions of the Information Act justifies its nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">The district court alternatively held that, if the Information Act does apply, then the IRS had borne its burden of demonstrating that the requested portions of the memorandum fell under Exemption 3 as (incorporating the \u00a7 6103 criteria) a disclosure likely to seriously impair federal tax administration, and under Exemption 7(A) <em>(see </em>note 2 <em>supra) </em>as an investigatory record compiled for law enforcement purposes, release of which would interfere with enforcement proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">With regard to our standard of review, it is settled that an appellate court reviewing district court determinations under the Information Act \u201c(1) must determine whether the district court had an adequate factual basis for the decision rendered and (2) whether upon this basis the decision reached was clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Stephenson v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>629 F.2d 1140, 1144 (5th Cir.1980). <em>Accord, Currie v. Internal Revenue Service, supra, </em>704 F.2d at 528; <em>Chilivis v. Securities and Exchange Commission, </em>673 F.2d 1205, 1210 (11th Cir.1982) and <em>Church of Scientology v. United States Department of the Army et al., </em>611 F.2d 738, 742 (9th Cir.1979) (full discussion of the standard of appellate review of Information Act determinations). \u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire record is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">The Linsteadts contend on appeal that the district court\u2019s factual findings are clearly erroneous and should be reversed. Before reaching the merits of this contention, we deem it advisable to explicate the present facts more fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-12\">The Linsteadts are presently the subject of a joint criminal/civil tax investigation for the 1978, 1979, and 1980 tax years. On June 30, 1982, the Linsteadts filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking copies of any statements made by the Linsteadts to Internal Revenue Service agents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The IRS identified four memoranda of interviews in its files that were responsive to the request. The IRS District Director for the Dallas District released three of the memoranda in their entirety, but disclosed only part of the fourth memorandum. In his letter to the plaintiffs partially denying their request, District Di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>rector Cagle explained that parts of the fourth document were being withheld pursuant to Exemptions (b)(3) and (b)(7)(A) of the Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(b)(3) and 552(b)(7)(A). After exhausting their administrative remedies, the plaintiffs brought the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">In the proceeding below, the government introduced affidavits from the IRS District Director for the Dallas District and the IRS Special Agent assigned to the Linsteadts\u2019 case to support the claim that the withheld document was within one of the exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act. In a hearing on the government\u2019s <em>motion </em>for summary judgment, the government conceded that the portions of the fourth memorandum of interview being withheld contained only a factual summary of the Linsteadts\u2019 statements, and did not include any conclusions or opinions of the Special Agent who took the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">As previously noted, the district court upheld the agency\u2019s nondisclosure primarily on the basis that it was not an abuse of the allowable discretion under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103, a ruling we have reversed as contrary to <em>Chamberlain. </em>Alternatively, the district court held that the government had borne its burden of demonstrating that the memorandum of the taxpayers\u2019 factual statements fell within two of the specified exemptions of the Information Act; a ruling we now review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">The IRS contends that nondisclosure is justified by two specific exemptions of the Information Act: (1) Exemption 3, incorporating the criterion of \u00a7 6103 as an exempting statute, under which disclosure of a taxpayers\u2019 return information to him is exempted if it would \u201cseriously impair Federal tax administration\u201d; and (2) Exemption 7(A), exempting from disclosure an investigatory record compiled for law enforcement purposes (as the sought document is conceded to be), \u201cbut only to the extent that the production of such records would (A) interfere with law enforcement proceedings,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">The Linsteadts\u2019 Information Act request was limited to any statements made by the Linsteadts during the course of the tax investigation, including written statements, oral statements recorded by a recording device, and oral statements which had been reduced to writing. The Linsteadts stress that their request does <em>not </em>include any demand for any conclusion or opinion of the Special Agent who recorded their statements. Nonetheless, the government contends that the release of the information would have several ill effects. The IRS claims that disclosure would allow the Linsteadts \u201cto fabricate excuses or evidence to frustrate the investigation or to address those facts which the Government unearths.\u201d IRS Brief, p. 17.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>Internal Revenue Service directives require that memoranda of interviews include only a summarized recitation of the statements made by the interviewees. <em>See </em>Part IX \u2014 Intelligence, Internal Revenue Manual, \u00a7 346.55. As the government forthrightly admits, the memorandum at issue contains no opinions or conclusions of the Special Agent, but merely a factual recitation of the Linsteadts\u2019 own statements. Moreover, as did the district court, this court has reviewed <em>in camera </em>the portions of the memorandum that the IRS seeks to withhold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\">Our review of the interview memorandum has generated a division of opinion among the members of this panel. Judge Brown and Judge Higginbotham conclude that the district court did not err in finding that the IRS bore its burden of establishing that release of this document would seriously impair the Service\u2019s administration of the federal tax laws and would significantly interfere with the present law enforcement proceedings. Though \u2014 or perhaps because \u2014 the question is not free from doubt, Judges Brown and Higginbotham defer to the district court\u2019s finding of fact. In their view, the affidavits of the IRS officials, <em>see </em>note 10, <em>supra, </em>must be given due weight despite our holding that an abuse of discretion standard does not apply, and if the district judge upon conducting his own <em>in camera </em>inspection concludes that the contents of the contested document justify the government\u2019s concern, this court should be particularly loathe to second-guess that judgment absent manifest error. No such error appears here, and the judgment must accordingly be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">Judge Tate dissents from this disposition, as he cannot agree that the evils cited by the government to justify nondisclosure could reasonably come to pass, given the contents of the withheld document. The remainder of this opinion comprises Judge Tate\u2019s explanation of why he would reverse the judgment and order the release of the withheld portions of the interview memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">\n<em>Dissenting Views of Judge Tate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-9\">The dominant objective of the Freedom of Information Act is disclosure, not secrecy; accordingly, this court must \u201cnarrowly construe\u201d the exemptions to disclosure otherwise compelled by the Act. <em>Department of Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 361, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 1599, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976). Applying this standard to the present case, Judge Tate does not find a sufficient basis in the record to support a finding that the government met its burden of demonstrating the asserted exemptions to be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-10\">Since the Linsteadts\u2019 statements to the Special Agent may be introduced at a subsequent trial as admissions, they offer the plaintiffs no greater opportunity to create or destroy evidence than is possible in the ordinary course of events without access to the statements.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nor would the document reveal to the Linsteadts any information about the nature, scope, or course of the government\u2019s investigation or its reliance upon certain evidence not otherwise known or deducible by them, since the memorandum eoncededly recites only factual statements made by the plaintiffs\u2019 themselves in response to questions by the Special Agent as to their cash assets and other transactions, exclusive of any statement, opinion or conclusion of the Special Agent. In that the withheld memorandum admittedly recites only those statements made by the Linsteadts themselves, its release will not cause the kind of \u201cserious\u201d impairment to federal tax administration, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(e)(7), or \u201csignificant\u201d interference with law enforcement proceedings, <em>Hawkes </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number><em>v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>467 F.2d 787, 795 (6th Cir.1972), <em>disclosure affirmed after remand, </em>507 F.2d 481, 484 (6th Cir.1974), envisaged by those two exceptions to the Information Act\u2019s ordinary mandate of disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">Moreover, in cases applying the exemptions asserted here, the information withheld has presented a far greater potential for abuse than does the release of a factual summation of a party\u2019s own statement. <em>See e.g. Chamberlain v. Kurtz, </em>589 F.2d 827, 840 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 842, 100 S.Ct. 82, 62 L.Ed.2d 54 (1979) (exempting forty-two \"return information\u201d documents including various intra-agency memoranda discussing taxpayer\u2019s tax liability, several case summaries, memoranda of witness interviews, agency workpapers, reports of Special Agents, and intra-agency letters about the case) and <em>Currie v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>704 F.2d 523, 531 (11th Cir.1983) (exempting internal agency memoranda on the direction of the investigation, memoranda of interviews with witnesses and confidential informants, draft affidavits of confidential informants, correspondence with state law enforcement officials and third parties, other third party information, and IRS notes and workpapers). In view of the narrow scope of the documents requested (factual statements by the taxpayers themselves to an IRS agent), Judge Tate concludes that IRS has not borne its burden of demonstrating that the requested document withheld by it is exempt from disclosure under the stated exceptions to the Information Act. Thus, in Judge Tate\u2019s view, the district court clearly erred in its factual determination to the contrary and in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 request for an order requiring disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">For the reasons stated, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s determination that the factual summary of the plaintiffs\u2019 statements was properly withheld.

For a general discussion of the Information Act as originally enacted in 1966 (not changed in these respects, although subsequent amend-merits broadened disclosure requirements), <em>see </em>Davis, <em>Administrative Law Text, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3A.1-3A.25 (3d ed. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">. Exemptions (b)(3) and (b)(7)(A) of the Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(b)(3) and (b)(7)(A), read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-8\">(b) This section does not apply to matters that are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-9\">* * <em>it it it it</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-10\">(3) <em>specifically exempted from disclosure by statute </em>(other than section 552b of this title), provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-11\">\n<em>it it it it it it</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-12\">(7) investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would (A) interfere with enforcement proceedings____ [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-15\">With regard to Exemption 3, the Act as initially enacted simply provided that disclosure was not required for matters that are \"specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) (1970). An amendment of this statute by the Sunshine Act, Pub.L. No. 94-409, 90 Stat. 1241, 1247, effective March 13, 1977, narrowed the exemption by adding the provisos as to the requirements of an exempting statute, (A) or (B), as above stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1102-19\">. In terms of statutory construction, the issue is whether the provision in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) that \"[t]his section <em>[i.e., </em>the Information Act] does not apply\" was legislatively intended to supersede the entire application of the Information Act as to agency records within the ambit of the exempting statute, or whether, instead \u2014 as this court held in <em>Chamberlain, infra, </em>to anticipate a point \u2014 the statutory provision was legislatively intended to mean that only the unrestricted <em>duty to disclose </em>otherwise provided for by the Information Act \"does not apply\u201d and is limited by the requirements of the exempting statute. If the latter construction is followed, then \u2014 when Congress <em>has </em>provided an agency with discretion not to disclose certain of its records \u2014 the agency\u2019s exercise of that discretion not to disclose is still subject to judicial review under the provisions of the Information Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(c) and (e)(7) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-9\">(c) <em>Disclosure of returns and return information to designee of taxpayer. </em>\u2014 The Secretary may, subject to such requirements and conditions as he may prescribe by regulations, disclose the return of any taxpayer, or return information with respect to such taxpayer, to such person or persons as the taxpayer may designate in a written request for or consent to such disclosure, or to any other person at the taxpayer\u2019s request to the extent necessary to comply with a request for information or assistance made by the taxpayer to such other person.

The court summarizes the IRS\u2019s contentions as follows, identically to those now raised before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-8\">The IRS contends that I.R.C. \u00a7 6103, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103, is a self-contained statutory scheme regulating the disclosure of tax return information and therefore the disclosure or nondisclosure of such information is not subject to the FOIA and its concomitant procedural requirements and policy objectives. Judicial review of the agency\u2019s decision to withhold these documents, they argue, is limited to a determination of whether the decision was arbitrary or an abuse of discretion. We disagree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1104-9\">704 F.2d at 526-27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">. The materials withheld in <em>Currie </em>are described at 704 F.2d at 528-30 n. 14. As described, they relate pertinently to present issues of information obtained in the course of the tax investigation that revealed \"prospective testimony; witnesses (including a confidential source or confidential sources); prospective witnesses; investigative leads; specific transactions being investigated; defenses that might be raised and the validity of these defenses; investigators\u2019 theories and thought processes.\u201d 528 F.2d at 528-29, n. 14. Using the clearly erroneous standard, the appellate court affirmed the district court's factual determination that the material was not improperly withheld and that the government had proved that it fell under Exemption 3 and Exemption 7 because its release could impair federal tax administration and law enforcement. 704 F.2d at 531-32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1104-15\">.

Internal Revenue Service, </em>688 F.2d 488 (7th Cir.1982), the Seventh Circuit adopted the <em>Zale </em>court's analysis and upheld the administrative nondisclosure determination as not an abuse of discretion. In <em>White v.

Any such disclosure would impair the Service\u2019s ability to present its best case in court should L.A. and/or Wannelle Linsteadt ultimately be indicted or in any future criminal or civil litigation involving plaintiffs herein by prematurely revealing evidence; the reliance placed by the government on that evidence; the nature and direction of the government\u2019s case; and the scope and limits of the investigation.
