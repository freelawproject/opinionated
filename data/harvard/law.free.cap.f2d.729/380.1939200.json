MARTIN, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b483-17\">Joseph Cusmano, appeals his conviction for violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. Cusmano was charged in a two-count indictment with obstructing, delaying and affecting commerce by extortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (Count 2) and with conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (Count 1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-18\">On appeal, Cusmano argues the conduct charged in the indictment and proven at trial fails to establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 because the Hobbs Act does not apply to activities between an employer and employee engaged in discussions concerning a labor dispute over the terms and conditions of employment. He also contends there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, prejudicial collateral evidence was needlessly admitted at trial, and prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial. Because we find no error below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-19\">The facts and background of this case have already been set forth in two previous decisions of this court. <em>United States v. Cusmano I, supra; United States v. Russo, </em>708 F.2d 209 (6th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 487, 78 L.Ed.2d 682 (1983). On this appeal, we note that Cusmano and codefendant James Russo were the co-owners of J &amp; J Cartage Company, a trucking firm engaged in the transportation of steel. Cusmano, along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>with the other codefendants,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> allegedly coerced the drivers of J &amp; J to pay the company\u2019s contributions to the Teamster Health and Welfare and Pension Funds by requiring them to sign a \u201c11% agreement.\u201d The agreement authorized the company to deduct 11% from gross earnings, prior to computing the drivers\u2019 wages, and to use the deducted amount to pay employer contributions to the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Cusmano asserts the 11% agreement was the result of legitimate labor negotiations between an employer and its employees, and cannot constitute a violation of the Hobbs Act. Relying on <em>United States v. Enmons, </em>410 U.S. 396, 399, 93 S.Ct. 1007, 1009, 35 L.Ed.2d 379 (1973), which held that the Hobbs Act does not proscribe \u201cviolence committed during a lawful strike for the purpose of inducing an employer\u2019s agreement to legitimate collective-bargaining demands,\u201d Cusmano contends his conviction must be reversed because the objective behind the 11% agreement \u2014 the reduction of labor costs in the form of lower wages \u2014 was a legitimate labor objective and therefore was protective activity under <em>Enmons. </em>The United States, on the other hand, argues the 11% agreement constituted a wrongful means to achieve a wrongful objective, and thus violated the Hobbs Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">We believe our earlier decisions in <em>Cusmano I </em>and <em>Russo </em>affirmatively resolved the issue of whether the Hobbs Act applies to the employer activity involved here. In <em>Russo </em>we held that J &amp; J, which Cusmano was half owner of,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">had no legitimate claim to the \u2018service charge\u2019 of 11% of the gross earnings. This is true because the existing contracts expressly required the [c]ompany to make the payments to the welfare and pension funds out of the [company\u2019s own funds. Indeed, the contract provided that it would be \u2018unlawful and illegal\u2019 to deduct the welfare and pension payments from the [drivers\u2019] gross earnings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-8\"><em>Russo, </em>708 F.2d at 215. Because J &amp; J had no lawful claim to the 11% service charge, we held that the Hobbs Act could be utilized to proscribe the conduct of J &amp; J\u2019s officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Cusmano argues, however, as did the dissent in <em>Russo, </em>that our conclusion on the applicability of the Hobbs Act directly conflicts with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States v. Enmons, supra. </em>Cusmano\u2019s and the dissent in <em>Russo\u2019s </em>reliance on <em>Enmons </em>is misplaced. In <em>Enmons </em>the Supreme Court ruled that a union\u2019s violent activities during the course of a legitimate strike, were not proscribed by the Hobbs Act because the legislative history of the statute \u201cmakes it clear that the Act does not apply to the use of force to achieve legitimate labor ends.\u201d <em>Enmons, </em>410 U.S. at 401, 93 S.Ct. at 1010. The Court noted, however, that the Hobbs Act would be properly applied in situations \u201cwhere the obtaining of ... property would itself be \u2018wrongful\u2019 because the alleged extortionist has no lawful claim to that property.\u201d <em>Enmons, </em>410 U.S. at 400, 93 S.Ct. at 1009. Applied in this manner, the Hobbs Act could be properly invoked where violence or force were utilized to obtain personal payoffs, <em>United States v. Iozza, </em>420 F.2d 512, 515 (4th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 943, 91 S.Ct. 1607, 29 L.Ed.2d 111 (1971), or where violence is used to secure payment for work which was unwanted or fictitious. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>350 U.S. 415, 417, 76 S.Ct. 522, 524, 100 L.Ed. 494 (1956). Thus, the Hobbs Act presents no bar to prosecution where an accused is alleged to have extorted property to which he has no lawful claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Viewed in this light, Cusmano\u2019s activities in extracting the 11% agreement from J &amp; J drivers was not protected conduct under the rule of <em>Enmons. </em>As an employer, or otherwise, Cusmano had no lawful claim to the money he received from the 11% agreement. As we carefully pointed out in <em>Russo, </em>the labor agreement between J &amp; J and its drivers provided that it would be \u201cun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>lawful and illegal\u201d for J &amp; J to deduct the welfare and pension payments from the drivers\u2019 gross earnings. Moreover, the 11% agreement was not the result of any collective bargaining between J &amp; J and the union, but instead was secured through the coercive tactics of Cusmano and his codefendants. <em>Russo, </em>708 F.2d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We believe Cusmano\u2019s attempt to characterize his behavior as protected labor activity stretches <em>Enmons </em>too far. He claims he had a legal right to bargain with his employees in an attempt to reduce J &amp; J\u2019s labor costs. Although he might have this right, the facts proven at trial do not establish any legitimate bargaining by Cusmano in an attempt to reduce J &amp; J\u2019s labor costs. Instead, the evidence discloses that he and his codefendants coerced the J &amp; J drivers into an illegal agreement which required the drivers to pay for pension contributions which Cusmano should have paid. The facts demonstrate Cusmano attempted to obtain by wrongful means and under the guise of a \u201cservice charge\u201d an objective which the parties\u2019 own contract specifically declared \u201cunlawful and illegal.\u201d <em>Russo, </em>708 F.2d at 216 (concurring opinion). This conduct went beyond legitimate labor tactics and violated the Hobbs Act. <em>Cf. United States v. Provenzano, </em>334 F.2d 678, 693 (3d Cir.1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 947, 85 S.Ct. 440, 13 L.Ed.2d 544 (1964); <em>see also United States v. Iozza, supra, </em>420 F.2d at 515. Applying Cusmano\u2019s interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, the Hobbs Act would pose no bar against the utilization of sham agreements, even though such agreements were obtained outside the traditional labor/management bargaining context. We decline to adopt such a restricted view and believe that <em>Enmons </em>provides no sanction for the activities proven here.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Cusmano further contends prejudicial collateral evidence was needlessly admitted at trial. First, he complains that the district court improperly allowed the government to introduce evidence regarding the bankruptcy proceedings of J &amp; J. Cusmano argues this evidence was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial as evidence of another crime extraneous to the charges against him. The government asserts this evidence was properly admitted under Fed.R.Evid. 608(b) to impeach the credibility of Cusmano. We find the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence for purposes of impeachment. Throughout the direct examination, Cusmano testified about the close business relationship he had with his employees. He also testified extensively about the economic collapse of J &amp; J Cartage Company. In light of this testimony, the United States was in a proper posture to challenge the credibility of Cusmano. This challenge took the form of proof of how he was able to eventually transfer all the assets of J &amp; J to his own personal account, leaving the trucking firm with no assets. Thus, the evidence of J &amp; J\u2019s bankrupt proceedings was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Cusmano claims further the district court erred when it permitted the Assistant United States Attorney to secure from him an admission that he had physically assaulted a tow truck driver in charge of towing one of J &amp; J\u2019s trucks to a Michigan State Police truckyard in Roseville, Michigan. On direct examination Cusmano stated he had \u201cnever threatened anyone in my life including my drivers who were my friends or intended to be.\u201d Cusmano now claims he made this statement in the context of economic threats to his employees. While this remark may have been limited, the broad nature of the comment, considered together with Cusmano\u2019s other testimony, could certainly have suggested that Cusmano had never threatened anyone. Therefore, it was properly allowed as evidence rebutting Cusmano\u2019s direct testimony. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 608(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">He also asserts the district court erred when it permitted the United States to introduce evidence regarding the reputation of codefendant Vincent Meli. As we noted in <em>Russo, </em>708 F.2d at 208, this evidence was admitted solely for the purpose of showing the state of mind of the victims of the alleged extortion at the time they consented to the 11% agreement. We find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>no abuse of discretion in the admission of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Finally, Cusmano contends prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial. In support of this contention Cusmano claims the Assistant United States Attorney repeatedly sought to introduce prejudicial evidence and constantly attempted to humiliate him. We see no support for this claim. In <em>United States v. Leon, </em>534 F.2d 667, 679 (6th Cir.1976), we noted we must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">consider the degree to which the remarks complained of have a tendency to mislead the jury and to prejudice the accused; whether they were isolated or extensive; whether they were deliberately or accidentally placed before the jury, and the strength of the competent proofs introduced to establish the guilt of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Cusmano has failed to meet this test. The record contains sufficient evidence to support the convictions reached below. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Leon, </em>534 F.2d 667, 676 (6th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-12\">. The Hobbs Act provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-13\">(a) Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-14\">(b) As used in this section\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB2\">(2) The term \u201cextortion\u201d means the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b483-22\">. Cusmano\u2019s first conviction, based on the same conduct at issue here, was reversed because certain evidence admitted at trial, together with the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury, constituted a constructive amendment of the indictment. <em>United States v. Cusmano I, </em>659 F.2d 714 (6th Cir.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">. The convictions of codefendants James A. Russo, Vincent Meli, and Roby G. Smith were affirmed by this court in <em>United States v. Russo, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
