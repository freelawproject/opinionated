BLAINE ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1287-20\">The Blackfeet Tribe of Indians (the \u201cTribe\u201d) filed suit seeking equitable relief against state taxation of oil and gas production undertaken by the Tribe\u2019s non-Indian lessees on the Blackfeet Reservation. Named as defendants were William Groff as Director of the Montana Department of Revenue, the State of Montana, Glacier County, Montana, and Pondera County, Montana (all simply the \u201cState\u201d). The district court, the Honorable Paul G. Hatfield presiding, granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-22\">The Blackfeet Tribe, under the supervision of the Department of the Interior, is the lessor of 125 parcels of tribal land for oil and gas mining purposes. The Tribe is the beneficial owner of the mineral rights in issue. The United States holds the legal title in trust for the Tribe. The lessees (or \u201cproducers\u201d) are not Indian or Indian-owned entities. The Tribe receives royalty payments based on the amount of oil and gas produced. Oil and gas leasing on the reservation began in 1932 and has continued until the recent past.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-23\">Four Montana taxing statutes are at issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One has been in force at all times relevant to this action. Two were enacted in the 1970\u2019s and the other in 1953. All four statutes tax different aspects of the production of the oil and gas extracted by the non-Indian lessees. The Tribe admits it has not paid any of these taxes directly to the State; the producers have paid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>taxes. The Tribe asserts, however, that the producers have deducted the Tribe\u2019s share of taxes from the royalty payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">The Tribe brought this action in 1978. Both the Tribe and the State moved for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">District Judge Hatfield based his grant of summary judgment on the belief the 1924 Act authorized state taxation of reservation oil and gas production; because the 1924 Act authorized the taxes at issue, it was unnecessary to reach the issue of whether the legal incidence of the tax is on the Tribe. The Tribe argues on appeal that the 1924 Act is no longer in effect and the incidence of the tax adversely impacts its inherent right of sovereignty. As this appeal is from a summary judgment, our review is the same as that of the trial court. <em>National Industries, Inc. v. Republic National Life Ins. Co., </em>677 F.2d 1258, 1265 (9th Cir.1982). Few, if any, facts are in dispute. Virtually all issues are legal and involve the often difficult questions of jurisdiction in Indian Country.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-7\">A. <em>Congressional Authorization to Tax</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1288-8\">A state\u2019s power to tax transactions arising in Indian Country is severely limited. This is especially true when Indian interests are affected. Thus, it was early established that the states could not tax Indian trust property. <em>The Kansas Indians, </em>72 U.S. (5 Wall.) 737, 18 L.Ed. 667 (1867). More recently, it has been held that the states may not tax the income earned by tribal members on the tribe\u2019s reservation, <em>McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Commission, </em>411 U.S. 164, 93 S.Ct. 1257, 36 L.Ed.2d 129 (1973), the personal property of tribal members, <em>Bryan v. Itasca County, </em>426 U.S. 373, 96 S.Ct. 2102, 48 L.Ed.2d 710 (1976), or sales involving tribal members, <em>Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, </em>425 U.S. 463, 96 S.Ct. 1634, 48 L.Ed.2d 96 (1976), and <em>Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, </em>447 U.S. 134, 100 S.Ct. 2069, 65 L.Ed.2d 10 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-12\">State jurisdiction over the affairs of non-Indians in Indian Country often presents more difficult issues. Such jurisdiction must usually be analyzed in terms of federal preemption and/or the Tribe\u2019s limited right of sovereignty. <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, </em>448 U.S. 136, 142, 100 S.Ct. 2578, 2583, 65 L.Ed.2d 665, 672 (1980). If the state taxation of non-Indians in Indian Country is not preempted, <em>Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Commission, </em>380 U.S. 685, 85 S.Ct. 1242, 14 L.Ed.2d 165 (1965), it may be upheld if the state\u2019s interest in taxing the non-Indians is substantial and outweighs the sovereignty interest of the tribe. <em>See Confederated Colville Tribes, supra, </em>447 U.S. 134, 100 S.Ct. 2069, 65 L.Ed.2d 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-13\">The major exception to the limited power of the states to tax Indian or non-Indian interests in Indian Country is when there is an express authorization by Congress for the tax. <em>See Bryan v. Itasca County, supra, </em>426 U.S. 373, 96 S.Ct. 2102, 48 L.Ed.2d 710, and <em>McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Commission, supra, </em>411 U.S. 164, 93 S.Ct. 1257, 36 L.Ed.2d 129. The district judge found, and the State argues, such authorization exists. Our task, then, is to determine whether Congress has evinced its consent to the taxes at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-14\">We have little difficulty finding such consent in the Act of May 29, 1924, 43 Stat. 244 (the \u201c1924 Act\u201d). This statute, currently codified at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 398, amended the Act of February 28, 1891, 26 Stat. 795, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 397.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The 1891 Act authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>the leasing of tribal property for grazing and mining purposes, within certain specified regulations. The 1924 Act includes a specific procedure for oil and gas leasing and provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-5\">That the production of oil and gas and other minerals on such lands may be taxed by the state in which said lands are located in all respects -the same as production on unrestricted lands, and the Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed to cause to be paid the tax so assessed against the royalty interests on said lands____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-10\">The 1924 Act\u2019s authorization of state taxation of oil and gas production and net proceeds under tribal leases on the Blackfeet Reservation was upheld in <em>British-American Oil Prod. Co. v. Board of Equalization of Montana, </em>299 U.S. 159, 57 S.Ct. 132, 81 L.Ed. 95 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-11\">B. <em>Effect of the Act of 1938</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-12\">The Tribe contends the 1924 Act\u2019s tax authorization was abrogated by the Act of May 11, 1938, 52 Stat. 347, codified at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 396a-396g (the \u201c1938 Act\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>The 1938 Act did not expressly repeal the 1924 Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While we recognize the 1938 Act was an attempt to provide uniformity in an area which has been described as a \u201cpatch-work state,\u201d F. Cohen, <em>Handbook of Federal Indian Law, </em>328 (1942 Ed.), we cannot agree with the Tribe that this act impliedly repealed the 1924 Act\u2019s tax authorization.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">At the outset, we note the opinion in <em>Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, </em>455 U.S. 130, 102 S.Ct. 894, 71 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982), while not dispositive, offers support for our conclusion the 1938 Act did not repeal the 1924 Act. In <em>Merrion, </em>the Court upheld the right of the Jicarilla Apache Tribe to tax oil and gas production on its reservation. New Mexico had in existence its own oil and gas production taxes pursuant to the Act of March 3, 1927, 44 Stat. 1347, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 398a-e. The 1927 Act\u2019s main purpose was to extend the 1924 Act\u2019s coverage to executive order reservations. <em>See, </em>F. Cohen, <em>Handbook of Federal Indian Law, </em>534 (1982 Ed.) The Court noted in <em>Merrion </em>that it was not deciding the issue whether the state could tax oil and gas production through leases entered under the 1938 Act. 455 U.S. at 151, fn. 17, 102 S.Ct. at 909, fn. 17, 71 L.Ed.2d at 38, fn. 17. Nonetheless, the Court treated the 1927 and 1938 Acts as a composite whole 'and made no indication the state lacked the authority to tax. We believe a similar analysis should apply to the 1924 and 1938 Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-10\">The 1938 Act attempts to make uniform the law governing the leasing of tribal (unallotted) lands for mineral purposes. Letter from Charles West, Acting Secretary of the Interior, to the House Committee on Indian Affairs, June 17, 1937, <em>reprinted in </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1872, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. (1938); S.Rep. No. 985, 75th Cong., 1st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>Sess. (1937). It does so by regulating the leasing of all minerals, not solely certain types of mineral leasing. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 396a. It also regulates the procedures for entering a lease and allows the Department of Interior to issue rules to that effect. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 396d. The legislative history also makes it clear the 1938 Act was designed to further the purposes of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 461\u2014479. Letter from Charles West, <em>supra. </em>The Reorganization Act was quite clearly an effort to reverse the assimilation policies of the Allotment Acts and to encourage Indian self-government. <em>See Fisher v. District Court, etc., </em>424 U.S. 382, 387, 96 S.Ct. 943, 946, 47 L.Ed.2d 106, 111 (1976). The 1938 Act furthers these goals by giving tribes more control over the decisions to lease and by streamlining the leasing process to secure a higher economic return to the tribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">Against the policy and scope of the 1938 Act, we must balance the long-recognized rule that repeals by implication are strongly disfavored. <em>Morton v. Mancari, </em>417 U.S. 535, 549, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 2482, 41 L.Ed.2d 290, 300 (1974); <em>Posadas v. National City Bank, </em>296 U.S. 497, 503, 56 S.Ct. 349, 352, 80 L.Ed. 351, 355 (1936). As explained by the Supreme Court in <em>Posadas:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-6\">There are two well-settled categories of repeal by implication \u2014 (1) where provisions in the two acts are in irreconcilable conflict, the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one; and (2) if the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute, it will operate similarly as a repeal of the earlier act. <em>But in either case, the intention of the legislature to repeal must be clear and manifest </em>____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">296 U.S. at 503, 56 S.Ct. at 352, 80 L.Ed. at 355 (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">We see no \u201cirreconcilable conflicts\u201d in the language of the 1924 Act and the 1938 Act. There is no doubt the two statutes are capable of coexistence. The 1938 Act primarily uses and expands the oil and gas leasing procedures outlined in the 1924 Act and applies them to all leases. Section 1 of the 1938 Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 396a, reiterates much of the. language of the 1924 Act regarding tribal council consent, BIA approval, and a general ten-year durational limit on the leases. Section 2 of the 1938 Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 396b, expands on the 1924 Act\u2019s public auction requirements. The 1938 Act is silent regarding taxation. The language of the statutes does not evince a clear indication that repeal of the taxing authorization was intended. On its face, taxation of oil and gas production is quite compatible with the 1938 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-11\">Nor does the legislative history supply the necessary showing of intent. It is true, as the Tribe argues and we have noted, the 1938 Act was an effort to make uniform the leasing laws and to bring them into harmony with the policies of the Indian Reorganization Act. The terms of the 1938 Act make it evident, however, it was the intent of Congress to supply uniformity by placing the leasing of mineral rights other than oil and gas within a statutory framework similar to that provided for in the 1924 Act. <em>See </em>Letter from Charles West, <em>supra. </em>Also, to bring leasing into harmony with the Reorganization Act, the drafters of the 1938 Act attempted to create a system which would provide the tribes with the \u201cgreatest return on their property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Apparently, the drafters of the bill believed the new act would streamline the leasing process and thereby increase the availability of leases for all types of minerals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The streamlined process, however, was substantially derived from the 1924 Act. Neither the language of the statute nor the legislative history persuades us that there is an irreconcilable conflict or repugnancy between the 1924 and 1938 Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>The only possible conflict between the 1924 and the 1938 Acts involves the Reorganization Act\u2019s self-determination and self-sufficiency policies. Arguably, these policies conflict with the continued authorization of state taxation which might tend to reduce tribal income. This possible conflict, however, must be viewed in light of another Reorganization Act policy which was the desire to encourage tribes \u201cto enter the white world on a footing of equal competition.\u201d Statements of Rep. Howard, 78 Cong.Rec. 11732, <em>quoted in Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, </em>411 U.S. 145, 152, 93 S.Ct. 1267, 1272, 36 L.Ed.2d 114, 121 (1973); <em>see also Fort Mojave Tribe v. San Bernadino County, </em>543 F.2d 1253, 1256 (9th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 983, 97 S.Ct. 1678, 52 L.Ed.2d 377 (1977). State taxation is one of the realities of an equal footing. We do not believe this possible policy conflict rises to the level of irreconcilability required to constitute an implicit repeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">Even though the 1938 Act is a more comprehensive and general statute than the 1924 Act, a fact which sometimes will lead to a finding of an implied repeal of the earlier act, <em>Posadas, supra, </em>296 U.S. at 503, 56 S.Ct. at 352, 80 L.Ed. at 355, we still do not find there to be the requisite conflict. This conclusion is supported by the rule that \u201c[w]here there is no clear intention otherwise, a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one regardless of the priority of enactment.\u201d <em>Morton, supra, </em>417 U.S. at 550-551, 94 S.Ct. at 2482-2483, 41 L.Ed.2d at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">The Tribe argues the canon of construction which provides that ambiguities in statutes are to be resolved in favor of the Indians applies to this case. <em>See, e.g., Bryan v. Itasca County, supra, </em>426 U.S. at 392, 96 S.Ct. at 2112, 48 L.Ed.2d at 723. We cannot agree. The 1924 Act\u2019s tax authorization is unambiguous. This \u201ccanon of construction is not a license to disregard clear expressions of ... congressional intent.\u201d <em>DeCoteau v. District County Court, </em>420 U.S. 425, 447, 95 S.Ct. 1082, 1094, 43 L.Ed. 300, 315 (1975); <em>Andrus v. Glover, </em>446 U.S. 608, 619, 100 S.Ct. 1905, 1911, 64 L.Ed.2d 548, 558 (1980). Nor does the 1938 Act create any ambiguity. It is silent on the repeal of the 1924 Act. The Tribe\u2019s use of this canon of construction would have us amend the 1938 Act to include an express repeal of the 1924 Act. That, however, would be going beyond a liberal interpretation of an ambiguous clause or phrase to the point of judicial legislating. This we will not do. <em>See Fry v. United States, </em>557 F.2d 646, 649 (9th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1011, 98 S.Ct. 722, 54 L.Ed.2d 754 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-8\">Additionally and perhaps most importantly, there has been a long-term administrative interpretation upholding the right of states to tax oil and gas production on the reservations notwithstanding the silence of the 1938 Act. This, outside compelling reasons otherwise, is sufficient to support the continued validity of the 1924 Act. <em>See Assiniboine &amp; Sioux Tribes v. Nordwick, </em>378 F.2d 426, 432 (9th Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 1046, 88 S.Ct. 764, 19 L.Ed.2d 838 (1968); <em>Baur v. Mathews, </em>578 F.2d 228, 233 (9th Cir.1978); <em>Castillo-Felix v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>601 F.2d 459, 465 (9th Cir.1979). Beginning in 1943, the Department of Interior interpreted the 1924 Act to be of continued effectiveness despite the 1938 Act. Several supporting interpretations were made until a contrary interpretation was issued in 1977. See 84 Interior Dec. 905 (1977) and its references to the prior opinions. Generally, the construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>is entitled to great weight, especially when, as here, Congress has refused to alter the administrative interpretation. <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., </em>395 U.S. 367, 381, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1801, 23 L.Ed.2d 371, 384 (1969). The contrary interpretation by the Solicitor of the Department of Interior in 1977 does not change the result in this case. Unless the original interpretation of the statute by the Department was clearly wrong, which we do not believe to be true, it is not appropriate for the Department to reverse its long held construction of a statute. <em>See United States v. Leslie Salt Co., </em>350 U.S. 383, 396, 76 S.Ct. 416, 423, 100 L.Ed. 441, 451 (1956); <em>Power Brake Equipment Company v. United States, </em>427 F.2d 163, 164 (9th Cir.1970); <em>Red Lion, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 381, 89 S.Ct. at 1801, 23 L.Ed.2d at 384. Furthermore, the presumption against repeal by implication, the long and consistent interpretation by the Department of Interior, and congressional acquiescence in that interpretation all lead to the conclusion the 1977 opinion is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-4\">We hold, then, that the 1924 Act and its authorization to tax reservation oil and gas production was not implicitly repealed by the 1938 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">C. <em>Leases Under the 1938 Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">The Tribe contends that even if the 1924 Act is not found to be repealed by the 1938 Act, 113 of the leases in question were entered pursuant to the 1938 Act; therefore, the 1938 Act controls and it does not contain an authorization to tax. For the following reasons, we reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">Most, if not all, of what has been said concerning the implied repeal of the 1924 Act applies with equal force to the Tribe\u2019s contention. Having found the 1924 Act to still be in force, we would be remiss to find it lacked any effect. \u201cWhen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective.\u201d <em>Morton, supra, </em>417 U.S. at 552, 94 S.Ct. at 2483, 41 L.Ed.2d at 301; <em>Radzanower v. Touche Ross &amp; Co., </em>426 U.S. 148, 96 S.Ct. 1989, 48 L.Ed.2d 540 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-11\">Furthermore, the fact the leases were made pursuant to the 1938 Act does not affect the State\u2019s power to tax. The critical aspect is the State\u2019s authorization to tax, not the statute under which the leases were made. In any event, both statutes purport to regulate leasing on the same lands \u2014 unallotted reservation property.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is not a strain on our reasoning to find the two acts have a concurrent, cumulative, and compatible effect. We hold, therefore, the 1924 Act\u2019s taxing authorization applies with equal force to leases made pursuant to the 1938 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-13\">We find the 1924 Act to permit Montana to tax oil and gas production on the Blackfeet Reservation. The 1938 Act did not impliedly repeal the 1924 Act and its authorization for the taxes at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-14\">The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1287-14\">.

See Section 7 of the 1938 Act reproduced in footnote 4. Generally, the presence of a general repealer is not considered a strong indication that all prior law on the subject is meant to be repealed. 1A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 23.08 (4th Ed.1972). In fact, a general repealer has been construed to imply \u201cvery strongly that there may be acts on the same subject which are not thereby repealed.\u201d <em>Hess v. Reynolds, </em>113 U.S. 73, 79, 5 S.Ct. 377, 379, 28 L.Ed. 927, 929 (1885); <em>Sutherland, supra, </em>\u00a7 23.08.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1290-14\">. <em>But cf. Crow Tribe of Indians v. State of Montana, </em>650 F.2d 1104 (9th Cir.1981), <em>amended, </em>665 F.2d 1390 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 916, 103 S.Ct. 230, 74 L.Ed.2d 182 (10/12/82). In <em>Crow Tribe; </em>this court held the Tribe had stated a cause of action in its suit to enjoin state taxation of the Tribe's non-Indian lessees of coal rights. In so holding, the court stated in dictum the 1938 Act \"probably\u201d repealed the prior leasing statutes, apparently including the 1924 Act and its tax authorization. 650 F.2d at 1112, fn. 10. For two reasons, we refuse to follow that conclusion. First, the 1924 Act's tax authorization applies only to oil and gas leasing, not coal, so this issue was not before the court. Second, <em>Crow Tribe </em>is a pleading case and any statements beyond those necessary to sustain upholding the Tribe's statement of a cause of action are dicta.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1291-9\">. In addition to being in a \"patch-work state,\u201d some leasing statutes mandated following the general mineral leasing laws used on public domain lands. This procedure created \"long delay and quite an expense to an applicant for a lease.\u201d Letter from Charles West, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1292-6\">. We believe this arguable policy conflict in the 1938 and 1924 Acts is found primarily through the benefit of hindsight. While the intent of the 1938 Act makes clear the belief the tribes would be able to secure revenue through mineral leasing, we doubt Congress or the Department of Interior had any idea mineral resources on reservations would rise to the level of importance they have today. It is the current import of those resources which makes taxation such a critical issue at present. In our analysis of the 1938 Act, however, our <em>primary </em>emphasis must focus on the intent of Congress at that time, not on the present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1293-8\">. While the 1924 Act, through its predecessor the 1891 Act, does not use the same language to describe the lands to which it applies as the 1938 Act, the 1924 Act has been construed to have had the same coverage as the 1938 Act. <em>British-American Oil Prod.
