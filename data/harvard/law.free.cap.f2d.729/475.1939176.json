We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The evidence at the motion to suppress hearing revealed that on December 2, 1982, at approximately 5:30 p.m., Indiana State Trooper Zimmerman spotted a speeding 1982 Corvette on the Indiana Toll Road. Zimmerman, whose roof-mounted lights were not functioning, motioned the driver to pull off the roadway by shining a spotlight on the rear window of the vehicle, but the driver responded by speeding away. Zimmerman radioed a general description of the Corvette to other officers in the area, but was unable to provide a license number as the license plates were too dirty to discern. Soon thereafter, a toll road attendant radioed that a silver Corvette, answering Officer Zimmerman\u2019s description, had exited the Indiana Toll Road at the Middleberry exit. Approximately one-half hour later the attendant radioed that the same vehicle had returned to the toll road but that the license plates remained unidentifiable. After hearing the attendant\u2019s description of the Corvette over his police radio, Indiana State Trooper Kensil radioed officers in the area that three months earlier he had stopped a silver Corvette traveling 134 m.p.h. on the Indiana Toll Road. Kensil supplied the officers with the California license number of the vehicle he had stopped and identified the driver as a Charles Griffin of Gary, Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Indiana State Trooper Hostetter, who was monitoring his radio and patrolling the Indiana Toll Road on the evening of December 2, 1982, positioned himself in the emergency lane of the roadway in order to observe the oncoming Corvette. As the vehicle passed the squad car\u2019s position, Hostetter pulled onto the roadway and followed the Corvette but was unable to determine the license number due to the dirty license plates. Concerned that this Corvette might be the same one that had previously eluded Officer Zimmerman, Hostetter continued to follow closely. Once the Corvette approached the proximity of other state troopers positioned along the roadway, Hostetter flashed his roof-mounted lights and the driver of the Corvette pulled into the emergency lane of the toll road.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">Officer Hostetter approached the Corvette and informed the driver that he had been stopped for an \u201cimproperly displayed registration\u201d (unidentifiable license plate). Hostetter asked the driver for his operator\u2019s license and vehicle registration but the driver was unable to produce either document. Hostetter then asked for any form of identification and the driver handed Hostetter an \u201cIllinois identification card\u201d with the name Jerome Griffin inscribed thereon. Hostetter instructed Jerome Griffin to exit the 1982 Corvette and join him in the squad car, and while there, Jerome stated that he had no valid Illinois driver\u2019s license, only an expired California driver\u2019s license. Hostetter advised Jerome that he would receive a warning for the improperly displayed registration but that he would be cited for failing to possess a valid operator\u2019s license. When informed that the fine for operating an automobile without a valid license was between $40.00 and $50.00, Jerome asked for and was given permission to borrow the money needed to pay his fine from his cousin Charles Griffin, the passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">During the period that Hostetter was questioning Jerome Griffin, Officer Nufer observed that the 1982 silver Corvette had a California license number identical to that of the Corvette stopped by Officer Kensil some three months earlier on the Indiana Toll Road. When the passenger of the vehicle presented Nufer with a valid Indiana driver\u2019s license in the name of Charles Griffin, Nufer identified Charles as the driver of the Corvette that had been ticket<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ed three months earlier for travelling 134 m.p.h. on the Indiana Toll Road. Nufer ran a routine check on Charles Griffin in Lake County, Indiana, Charles\u2019s county of residence, and learned that an outstanding bench warrant existed for Charles\u2019s failure to appear in court on October 8, 1982, for an unrelated traffic violation. Based upon this information, Nufer arrested Charles Griffin and placed him in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Jerome Griffin obtained the cash needed to pay his fine from Charles, and then informed Charles that the Indiana State Police were going to impound the Corvette because neither Jerome, who had no valid driver\u2019s license, nor Charles, who was under arrest, could lawfully remove the vehicle from the toll road. Charles objected and suggested that the vehicle remain parked in the emergency lane of the roadway until Charles\u2019s girlfriend arrived to drive it back to Gary, Indiana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Hostetter refused to leave the automobile on the side of the well-traveled Indiana Toll Road due to the danger it presented to passing nighttime motorists and the high incidence of theft inherent in a late model sports car such as a 1982 Corvette. Hostetter also recalled a previous incident wherein an officer allowed alleged friends of a driver to remove the driver\u2019s automobile from the highway and the friends decided to steal the automobile. Rather than expose himself or the Indiana State Police Department to unwarranted liability, by allowing an unknown third party to remove a vehicle whose ownership had not yet been determined,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hostetter followed the \u201cstandard operating procedure\u201d of the Indiana State Police Department and impounded the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Hostetter directed Jerome Griffin to lock the Corvette and the two of them proceeded to the courthouse in Fremont, Indiana, while Nufer began his portion of the westbound relay of Charles Griffin to Lake County, Indiana.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the Fremont court, Jerome pleaded guilty to the charge of failing to possess a valid operator\u2019s license and paid the statutory fine and costs. During Jerome's court appearance, Roger Fulton arrived at the courthouse in response to Hostetter\u2019s request that the towing service provide a driver to remove the Corvette from the Indiana Toll Road. It was standard procedure to allow the towing service to drive a Corvette, rather than tow it, due to the possibility that towing might damage the sports car\u2019s transmission and/or fiberglass body.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">Before driving Fulton to the location of the Corvette, Hostetter offered to arrange for a westbound bus to transport Jerome Griffin back to Gary, Indiana. Jerome accepted the offer but requested permission to accompany Hostetter and Fulton to the Corvette in order that he might retrieve his apartment keys. During the trip from the courthouse to the Corvette, Jerome gave his automobile keys to Fulton pursuant to Hostetter\u2019s instructions. When the three of them arrived at the vehicle, Fulton unlocked the driver\u2019s door and allowed Jerome to search for his apartment keys. Officer Hostetter next instructed Jerome to unlock the passenger\u2019s door so that Hostetter could assist Jerome in his search for the keys and begin the routine inventory search of the vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While checking for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the presence of valuables, Hostetter reached into the open area behind the passenger\u2019s seat of the two-seat vehicle and removed the lid from an unlocked storage compartment. Hostetter observed two hand guns within the compartment and replaced the storage lid. Hostetter next searched the elasticized map pouch in the passenger door, found Jerome\u2019s apartment keys therein, and returned the same to Jerome.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Following the discovery of Jerome\u2019s keys, Hostetter checked the revolvers to determine if they were loaded. He observed that ammunition clips were in the weapons and also that an unsecured brown paper bag was lying beneath the two revolvers in the unlocked storage compartment. Hostetter removed the unsecured brown paper bag from the compartment and immediately detected an unusual odor emanating from the bag. Hostetter opened the unsecured brown paper bag, and within the bag discovered a package wrapped in brown paper and secured with fibrous plastic tape. Rather than opening the package at that time, Hostetter placed the package back inside the brown paper bag, returned the bag and the revolvers to the compartment, and instructed Fulton to drive the Corvette to a maintenance area located \u201cabout two miles\u201d down the highway. Jerome Griffin joined Hostetter in the police car and the two of them followed Fulton to the maintenance area that also served as a gasoline service station for the Indiana State Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Once at the maintenance area, Hostetter ran a routine check on the two revolvers with his command post but received no information on either revolver. As Hostetter continued to inventory and secure the items contained within the Corvette, he removed the unsecured brown paper bag from the storage compartment and became \u201csuspicious\u201d of its contents. Hostetter had no knowledge of what the brown paper bag contained but decided that for purposes of his inventory, he must itemize the bag\u2019s contents as he was \u201cresponsible for what [was] in it.\u201d Hostetter removed the tape wrapped package from the brown paper bag and opened an end portion, unsecured by tape, \u201cto see what was in it to put down on [his] inventory.\u201d Hostetter observed a yellow substance in a clear plastic bag but did not open the plastic bag, instead he radioed Officer Nufer to join him at the maintenance area. Nufer, who had completed his portion of the westbound relay of Charles Griffin to Lake County, Indiana, arrived at the maintenance area and after observing the yellow substance contained within the sealed, clear plastic bag, informed Hostetter that he believed the package contained a controlled substance. The Indiana State Police lab later analyzed the contents of this clear plastic bag and identified the yellow substance as 805 grams of phencycledine, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">On December 3, 1982, Charles and Jerome Griffin were charged with unlawful possession with the intent to distribute 805 grams of phencycledine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (1982). The defendants moved to suppress the introduction of the phencycledine into evidence on the grounds that it was obtained without a valid search warrant. The district court granted defendants\u2019 pre-trial Motion to Suppress, ruling that the warrantless search did not fall within any of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement, including a search incident to an arrest, an automobile inventory, the automobile exception, or plain view, and therefore, was invalid. The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in finding that the warrantless search of the 1982 Corvette did not constitute a proper automobile inventory search.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s ruling that Officer Hostetter\u2019s search of the impounded 1982 Corvette did not constitute a proper automobile inventory search, we initially note the district court\u2019s finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>\u201c[Cjredible testimony established that Trooper Hostetter took custody of an expensive sports car which would have been otherwise left unattended, possibly for an extended period, in close proximity to the traveled portion of a busy, high speed roadway. There was also a danger to other motorists, along with the need to protect the state from civil liability based upon unfounded property claims for lost or stolen items. Adopting these determinations, <em>the court must conclude that Hostetter\u2019s [impoundment] was justified and that based on these considerations, substantially similar to those underlying the premise in [South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 <em>(1976)] the initiation of the subsequent routine inventory search was reasonable and therefore consistent with the constitutional commands and guarantees of the Fourth Amendment. </em>428 U.S. at 368-71 [96 S.Ct. at 3096-98].\u201d (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The evidence presented at the motion to suppress hearing, and the case law applicable thereto, provides more than ample support for the district court\u2019s findings that Indiana State Trooper Hostetter\u2019s impoundment of the 1982 Corvette was proper and that his initiation of a routine- inventory search, without a warrant, was reasonable and thus consistent with the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The record reveals that Charles and Jerome Griffin at no time presented Officer Hostetter with documentary proof of ownership of the 1982 Corvette. In addition, the driver of the 1982 Corvette, Jerome Griffin, had no valid driver\u2019s license, and the passenger, Charles Griffin, was under arrest and being transported back to Lake County, Indiana, to answer for an outstanding bench warrant. Thus, neither Charles nor Jerome could lawfully remove the vehicle from its parked position in the emergency lane of the Indiana Toll Road. In such a situation, Officer Hostetter\u2019s decision to direct the removal of the Corvette from the heavily traveled, high speed roadway was an act of good judgment in the interest of public safety, as the vehicle presented a hazard to passing nighttime motorists. <em>See, e.g., South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 368-69, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 3096-97, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976) <em>(\u201cOpperman\u201d); Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 443, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 2529, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973) <em>[\u2018Cady\"). </em>Furthermore, by removing the Corvette from the roadway, Hostetter protected the expensive 1982 sports car and its contents from the likelihood of damage, theft, and vandalism. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Staller, </em>616 F.2d 1284, 1290 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 869, 101 S.Ct. 207, 66 L.Ed.2d 89 (1980); <em>United States v. Balanow, </em>528 F.2d 923, 924 (7th Cir.1976). The impounding of the vehicle was part of Officer Hostetter\u2019s \u201ccommunity caretaking functionf], totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.\u201d <em>Cady, </em>413 U.S. at 441, 93 S.Ct. at 2528. Indeed the impounding of an automobile has been upheld as proper when the automobile is in violation of a parking ordinance, <em>see Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 365-66, 96 S.Ct. at 3095-96; a state forfeiture statute applies, <em>see Cooper v. California, </em>386 U.S. 58, 61, 87 S.Ct. 788, 791, 17 L.Ed.2d 730 (1967); the driver is incapacitated, <em>see Cady, </em>413 U.S. at 436, 93 S.Ct. at 2525; the driver\u2019s operator\u2019s license is suspended, <em>see United States v. Balanow, </em>528 F.2d at 924. In this instance, the Corvette presented a potential hazard to passing nighttime motorists and neither Charles nor Jerome Griffin could lawfully remove the vehicle from its illegally parked position in the emergency lane of the Indiana Toll Road. Officer Hostetter\u2019s decision to impound the 1982 sports car was certainly proper for \u201c[t]he authority of police to seize and remove from the streets vehicles impeding traffic or threatening public safety and convenience is beyond challenge.\u201d <em>Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 369, 96 S.Ct. at 3097. <em>See also </em>Ind.Code \u00a7 9-4-1-113 (1976).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Before removing the vehicle from the heavily traveled toll road, Hostetter commenced a warrantless inventory search of the vehicle\u2019s interior. The fact that Hostetter obtained no search warrant before initiating the automobile inventory search is totally consistent with current law that provides: \u201cthe inventory search constitutes a well-defined exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Lafayette, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 2608, 77 L.Ed.2d 65 (1983) <em>(\u201cLafayette\u201d). </em>As the Court in <em>Opperman </em>noted, \u201c[t]he Fourth Amendment does not require that every seareh be made pursuant to a warrant. It prohibits only <em>unreasonable </em>searches and seizures.\u201d (emphasis original) 428 U.S. at 372-73, 96 S.Ct. at 3098-99 (quoting <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 509, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2059, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971) (Black, J., concurring and dissenting)). Moreover, \u201c[i]n applying the reasonableness standard adopted by the Framers, [the] Court has consistently sustained police intrusions into automobiles impounded or otherwise in lawful police custody where the process is aimed at securing or protecting the car and its contents.\u201d <em>Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 373, 96 S.Ct. at 3099. Thus, the justification for an inventory search \u201cdoes not rest on probable cause and ... the absence of a warrant is immaterial to the reasonableness of the search.\u201d <em>Lafayette, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2608.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">In conducting the automobile inventory search of the lawfully impounded 1982 Corvette, Officer Hostetter testified that he was following the \u201cstandard operating procedure\u201d for the Indiana State Police Department. According to the Court in <em>Opperman:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">\u201cWhen vehicles are impounded, local police departments generally follow a routine practice of securing and inventorying the automobiles\u2019 contents. <em>These procedures developed in response to three distinct needs: the protection of the owner\u2019s property while it remains in police custody; the protection of the police against claims or disputes over lost or stolen property; and the protection of the police from potential danger.\u201d </em>(citations omitted) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">428 U.S. at 369, 96 S.Ct. at 3097. <em>See also United States v. Maier, </em>691 F.2d 421, 423 (8th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 1524, 75 L.Ed.2d 947 (1983); <em>United States v. Dall, </em>608 F.2d 910, 914 (1st Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 918, 100 S.Ct. 1280, 63 L.Ed.2d 603 (1980). When the automobile inventory search is carried out \u201cin accordance with <em>standard procedures </em>in the local police department, [it] ... tend[s] to ensure that the intrusion [is] limited in scope to the extent necessary to carry out the caretaking function.\u201d (emphasis original) <em>Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 375, 96 S.Ct. at 3100. In this instance, Officer Hostetter\u2019s statement, that the automobile inventory search was carried out in accord with the \u201cstandard operating procedures\u201d of the Indiana State Police De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>partment, is supported by the district court\u2019s finding of fact that \u201cit was standard practice for state troopers to routinely undertake the inventory of such vehicles pursuant to a departmental policy which required that all impounded vehicles be searched prior to being towed or driven away by the towing service.\u201d Officer Hostetter\u2019s statement finds further support in this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Balanow, </em>528 F.2d 923 (7th Cir.1976) <em>(\u201cBalanow\"), </em>where, just as in this case, an Indiana State trooper conducted an inventory search of an automobile that was impounded due to the driver\u2019s inability to present a valid operator\u2019s license. In holding that the inventory search was reasonable, this court stated that, <em>\u201c[u]nder normal [Indiana] state procedure, defendant\u2019s car was searched at the time of impounding. </em>The police had a right to inventory the contents of the impounded car.\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Balanow, </em>528 F.2d at 924. Thus, Hostetter\u2019s decision to conduct an inventory search of the Corvette in order to protect the Griffins\u2019 property from damage, theft, and vandalism while in the custody of the Indiana State Police, to protect the Indiana State Police and the towing service against claims of lost or stolen property, and finally, to protect himself and other Indiana State Police officers from potential danger,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was standard operating procedure for the Indiana State Police Department and therefore reasonable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Accord Opperman, 428 </em>U.S. at 373, 96 S.Ct. at 3099. Based upon the evidence presented at the motion to suppress hearing, we agree with the district court and hold that Officer Hostetter properly impounded the 1982 Corvette and in accord with the \u201cstandard operating procedures\u201d of the Indiana State Police Department, engaged in a routine, caretaking inventory search of the automobile. <em>See Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 375, 96 S.Ct. at 3100; <em>Cady, </em>413 U.S. at 436, 93 S.Ct. at 2525. Moreover, in response to the Griffins\u2019 claim that the inventory search was nothing more than a pretext for an unlawful investigatory search the district court \u201cremain[ed] unpersuaded that Trooper Hostetter undertook the inventory search as a subterfuge for an investigatory search.\u201d Upon our independent review of the record, we agree with the district court\u2019s finding that Officer Hostetter\u2019s inventory search was not a pretext for an unlawful investigatory search.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">We next consider whether the district court erred in finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-12\">\u201c[Although Trooper Hostetter had the right to search the vehicle and retain the bag, for the purpose identified in <em>Opperman, ... </em>the maintenance of [sic] privacy expectation superior to the governmental interests articulated precludes the use of the inventory exception to authorize the opening of either the bag or the tape-wrapped package within.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>In sum, we must determine whether the scope of Hostetter\u2019s automobile inventory search was \u201creasonable\u201d and thus within the confines of the Fourth Amendment. \u201cAs always, the reasonableness of [an] inventory search depends upon the particular facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Laing, </em>708 F.2d at 1571 (citing <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>577 F.2d 883, 893 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 968, 99 S.Ct. 458, 58 L.Ed.2d 427 (1978)). To determine the reasonableness of an inventory search, we must \u201cbalanc[e] its intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interest against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u201d <em>Lafayette, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2608 (quoting <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979)). Of course, a routine automobile inventory search must be limited to the purposes for which it was effectuated. <em>United States v. Prescott, </em>599 F.2d 103, 105 (5th Cir.1979). <em>See also United States v. Bosby, </em>675 F.2d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>529 F.Supp. 1047, 1053 (D.Md.1981). In this instance, those purposes, which also constitute the legitimate governmental interests, include protecting the Griffins\u2019 property from damage, theft, and vandalism while in the custody of the Indiana State Police, protecting the Indiana State Police and the towing service against claims of lost or stolen property, and protecting Hostetter and other Indiana State Police officers from potential danger. <em>See Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 369, 96 S.Ct. at 3097. We balance these legitimate governmental interests against Charles and Jerome Griffins\u2019 expectation of privacy in a tape wrapped package placed in an unsecured brown paper bag and located in the unlocked storage compartment of an automobile that neither Charles nor Jerome owned.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">We initially note that \u201cthe expectation of privacy with respect to one\u2019s automobile is significantly less than that relating to one\u2019s home or office.\u201d <em>Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 367, 96 S.Ct. at 3096. <em>Accord United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 561, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 3084, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976). As the Court in <em>Opperman </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">\u201cIn discharging their varied responsibilities for ensuring the public safety, law enforcement officials are necessarily brought into frequent contact with automobiles. Most of this contact is distinctly noncriminal in nature.

On this issue we believe the decision in <em>Opperman, </em>where the Court upheld an inventory search of the contents of the unlocked glove compartment of an abandoned automobile, lawfully impounded by the police, to be dispositive. As the Court in <em>Opperman </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u201cThe inventory was not unreasonable in scope ____ [Ojnce the policeman was lawfully inside the car to secure the personal property in plain view, it was not unreasonable to open the unlocked glove compartment, to which vandals would have had ready and unobstructed access once inside the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">428 U.S. at 376 n. 10, 96 S.Ct. at 3100 n. 10. Just as the unlocked glove compartment in <em>Opperman </em>was a \u201ccustomary place ... for the temporary storage of valuables,\u201d 428 U.S. at 372, 96 S.Ct. at 3098, so too, in this instance, the unlocked recessed compartment behind the passenger\u2019s seat of the Corvette was an ideal place for the temporary storage of valuables. Thus, in furtherance of the legitimate governmental interests of protecting the vehicle and its contents from damage or theft, and protecting members of the Indiana State Police Department from liability and potential danger, we hold that it was reasonable for Officer Hostetter to open the unmarked lid of the recessed storage compartment. <em>Accord Cady, </em>413 U.S. at 448, 93 S.Ct. at 2531 (the inventory search of an automobile trunk upheld as reasonable); <em>Cooper v. California, </em>386 U.S. at 62, 87 S.Ct. at 791 (the inventory search of a glove compartment upheld as reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">We next consider whether it was reasonable for Officer Hostetter to remove the unsecured brown paper bag from the compartment, retrieve from that bag a package wrapped in brown paper and secured with fibrous tape, and then open an unsecured end of that package. It is undisputed that once Hostetter observed the two revolvers in the recessed storage compartment and the brown bag lying beneath them, he was entitled to remove the revolvers and the bag in order to properly inventory and secure the items. The district court took issue, however, with Hostetter\u2019s next move, namely his retrieval and inspection of the tape wrapped package contained within the unsecured brown paper bag. According to the district court, Charles and Jerome Griffin had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the unsecured brown paper bag, and Hostetter, rather than opening the bag, should have simply inventoried \u201cone brown bag.\u201d In the alternative, the district court concluded that even if it was proper for Officer Hostetter to retrieve the tape wrapped package from the brown paper bag, there was no reason for opening an unsecured end of that package; instead Hostetter could have inventoried \u201cone tape wrapped package.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bloomfield, </em>594 F.2d 1200, 1203 (8th Cir.1979) <em>(\u201cBloomfield </em>\u201d) (the inventory search of the contents of a zipped knapsack, tied with string, and contained within an automobile, held to be unreasonable). Despite the closeness of this issue, a review of the record and recent case law convinces this court that the district court improperly balanced the Griffins\u2019 expectation of privacy in the tape wrapped package contained within the unsecured brown paper bag, against the legitimate governmental interests involved in an inventory search.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">In the instant case, the brown paper bag was not secured and thus its unknown con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>tents could have fallen out and been misplaced, lost, or even stolen. (We know from various cases that 805 grams of phencycledine has a street value in excess of ten thousand dollars.) Officer Hostetter\u2019s decision to inventory and secure each and every item contained within the Corvette, including the contents of the unsecured brown paper bag, protected the bag\u2019s contents from falling out and being lost. As the court in <em>Bloomfield </em>stated, \u201c[i]f a container which is to be inventoried is not securely closed so that the articles within could possibly fall out, it may be wiser for police to itemize the articles.\u201d 594 F.2d at 1203. In addition, Officer Hostetter\u2019s decision to itemize the unknown contents of the unsecured brown paper bag allowed the Indiana State Police Department to verify the bag\u2019s contents, and thus prevent false claims of lost or stolen property. The facts in this instance closely resemble those in <em>United States v. Laing, </em>708 F.2d 1568 (11th Cir.1983) where a police officer, conducting a routine automobile inventory search, opened an \u201cunusually heavy,\u201d unsecured Yahtzee box, \u201cto see if it held anything of value that might need to be catalogued.\u201d 708 F.2d at 1571. The court held that \u201c[t]his intrusion was justified by the purposes of an inventory search, especially the need to protect the police from claims pertaining to lost or stolen property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It certainly was in furtherance of a legitimate governmental interest for Officer Hostetter to protect himself and the Indiana State Police Department from unwarranted liability in the event that the unsecured bag, and the material or articles contained therein, were lost, stolen, damaged, or misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In addition, there existed a reasonable likelihood of \u201cpotential danger\u201d in an unsecured bag placed beneath two revolvers. Officer Hostetter testified that when he retrieved the unsecured brown paper bag, he immediately detected an unusual odor. When Hostetter ran a routine check on the two revolvers with his command post, he received no information. As a result, Hostetter was \u201csuspicious\u201d of the bag\u2019s contents, which could have ranged from worthless sand to valuable diamonds to instrumentalities of a crime, including additional weapons, contraband, or explosives. <em>See, e.g., Lafayette, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2609. In light of the totality of the circumstances, we hold that the legitimate governmental interests of protecting the vehicle and its contents from being damaged or lost, and protecting members of the Indiana State Police Department from liability and potential danger, outweighed the Griffins\u2019 expectation of privacy in the unsecured brown paper bag. Accordingly, it was proper for Officer Hostetter, in the course of a routine caretaking automobile inventory search, to open the unsecured brown paper bag in order to determine its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Finally, we review Officer Hostetter\u2019s decision to open an unsecured end of the package contained in the brown paper bag. On this issue we believe the United States Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Lafayette </em>to be instructive, especially in light of the Court\u2019s substantial reliance in that case, upon the same governmental interests as those present in this instance. In <em>Lafayette, </em>the defendant was arrested for disturbing the peace and was taken to the \u201cbooking room\u201d of the police station where he removed a package of cigarettes from his shoulder bag and placed the bag on a counter. A police officer, in the course of a preincarceration inventory search, removed the contents of the shoulder bag and found ten amphetamine pills inside a cigarette case package. The Court held that the inventorying of the defendant\u2019s shoulder bag at the stationhouse, preceding incarceration, was reasonable because it supported the legitimate governmental interest of \u201cdeter[ring] false claims [and] also inhibiting] theft or careless handling of articles taken from the arrested person.\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 2609. In addition, the Court noted that \u201c[d]angerous instrumentalities \u2014 such as razor blades, bombs, or weapons \u2014 can be concealed in innocent looking articles taken from the arrestee\u2019s possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court recognized that \u201cpri- or cases amply support this conclusion\u201d and then proceeded to discuss the holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>in <em>Opperman, </em>that the automobile inventory search of a glove compartment was reasonable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">\u201cbecause it served legitimate governmental interests that outweighed the individual\u2019s privacy interests in the contents of his car. Those measures protected the owner\u2019s property while it was in the custody of the police and protected police against possible false claims of theft.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 2610.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">In the instant case, Hostetter had no knowledge of what the tape wrapped package contained but did know that the package was placed beneath two revolvers and emitted an unusual odor. As a result, Hostetter was \u201csuspicious\u201d of the package. Hostetter opened an unsecured end of the package to determine what it contained. Hostetter testified that he opened the package only because he was \u201cresponsible for what is in it,\u201d and furthermore, he never opened the clear bag enclosed within the package. The contents of the package could have ranged from worthless sand to valuable diamonds to dangerous instrumentalities of a crime, including additional weapons, contraband, or explosives. <em>See, e.g., Lafayette, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2609. As the court stated in <em>United States v. Markland, </em>635 F.2d 174, 176 (2nd Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 991, 101 S.Ct. 2332, 68 L.Ed.2d 851 (1981) <em>(\u201cMarkland </em>\"), with regard to the inventory search of a zippered thermal package thrown from an automobile in the course of an accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">\u201cThis does not mean, however, that [the police] officer ... was required to take the plastic thermal package into his custody with a \u2018pig in a poke' obviousness as to its contents. <em>This impersonal package could have contained anything from beer to bullion or a bomb. Its contents might have been perishable, valuable, or dangerous.\" </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">635 F.2d at 176. The court in <em>Markland </em>went on to hold that the opening of the zippered thermal package was consistent with the officer\u2019s \u201ccommunity caretaking function.\u201d So too, in this instance it was within Hostetter\u2019s routine \u201ccommunity caretaking function\u201d to observe, examine, and inventory the contents of the tape wrapped package, an act that \u201cnot only deters false claims but also inhibits theft or careless handling of articles ... [and uncovers] [d]angerous instrumentalities\u2014 such as razor blades, bombs, or weapons\u2014 ... concealed in innocent looking articles.\u201d <em>Lafayette, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2609.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">According to the Court in <em>Lafayette, </em>\u201cthe need to protect against such risks arises independent of a particular officer\u2019s subjective concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2610. Thus, in order to protect the owner\u2019s property from damage, theft, or vandalism, the police and the towing service against claims of lost or stolen property, and the police officers from potential danger, Hostetter had a duty to perform a reasonable automobile inventory search of the 1982 Corvette. In light of the totality of the circumstances, including the presence of two revolvers and an unusual odor emanating from the unsecured brown paper bag, we hold that the legitimate governmental interests involved in an inventory search outweighed the Griffins\u2019 expectation of privacy in the tape wrapped package contained within the unsecured brown paper bag. As the United States Supreme Court has held in the context of an automobile search incident to a custodial arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">\u201c[W]hen a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile ... [and] may also examine the contents of any containers found within the passenger compartment ____ Such a container may, of course, be searched whether it is open or closed, since the justification for the search is not that the arrestee has no privacy interest in the container, but that the lawful custodial arrest justifies the infringement of any privacy interest the arrestee may have.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apl\"><em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460-61, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 2864-65, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>(1981). In the instant case, Officer Hostetter\u2019s lawful automobile inventory search justified the infringement of any privacy interest the Griffins may have had in a tape wrapped package contained within the passenger compartment of the 1982 Corvette. Accordingly, it was reasonable for Officer Hostetter to open the unsecured end of the tape wrapped package in the course of his routine caretaking automobile inventory search.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In so holding, we are cognizant of the fact that Hostetter could have inventoried \u201cone brown bag\u201d or \u201cone tape wrapped package.\u201d The United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Lafayette </em>that the Illinois Appellate Court raised a similar argument, namely, \u201c \u2018the defendant\u2019s shoulder bag could easily have been secured by sealing it within a plastic bag or box and placing it in a secured locker.\u2019 <em>[People v. </em>Lafayette], 99 Ill.App.3d [830] at 835 [55 Ill.Dec. 210 at 214], 425 N.E.2d [1383] at 1386\" (citation omitted). 103 S.Ct. at 2610. The Court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">\u201cPerhaps so, but the real question is not what \u2018could have been achieved,\u2019 but whether the Fourth Amendment <em>requires </em>such steps; it is not our function to write a manual on administering routine, neutral procedures of the station-house. Our role is to assure against violations of the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">* Sj! * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">In language equally applicable to this ease, we held, \u2018[t]he fact that the protection of the public might, in the abstract, have been accomplished by less intrusive means does not, by itself, render the search unreasonable.\u2019 <em>[Cady, </em>413 U.S. at 447, 93 S.Ct. at 2531]. <em>See also United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 557 n. 12 [96 S.Ct. 3074, 3082 n. 12, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116] (1976).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">sfc * * * $ \u00a3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">Even if less intrusive means existed of protecting some particular types of property, it would be unreasonable to expect police officers in the everyday course of business to make fine and subtle distinctions in deciding which containers or items may be searched and which must be sealed as a unit. Only recently in <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454 [101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768] (1981), we stated: \u2018[a] single familiar standard is essential to guide police officers, who have only limited time and expertise to reflect on and balance the social and individual interest involved in the specific circumstances they confront.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-12\"><em>Id. </em>103 S.Ct. at 2610-11, (quoting <em>Dunaway v.

Applying the Court\u2019s language to the instant case, the fact that Hostetter\u2019s inventory search may have been accomplished by \u201cless intrusive\u201d means, did not render the search unreasonable. We agree with the United States Supreme Court that \u201cour role is to assure against violations of the Constitution\u201d not to \u201cwrite a manual on administering [the] routine, neutral procedure\u201d of an automobile inventory search. <em>Lafayette, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2610.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">We are also aware of Justice Powell\u2019s concurrence in <em>Opperman </em>that \u201cthe <em>unrestrained </em>search of an automobile and its contents would constitute a serious intrusion upon the privacy of the individual in many circumstances.\u201d (emphasis added). 428 U.S. at 379-80, 96 S.Ct. at 3102-03 (Powell, J., concurring). Based upon the totality of the \u201cfacts and circumstances,\u201d <em>United States v. Laing, </em>708 F.2d at 1571, including the Griffins\u2019 inability to produce documented proof of ownership of the 1982 Corvette, the fact that neither Charles nor Jerome could lawfully remove the vehicle from the heavily traveled Indiana Toll Road, the presence of two revolvers in an unlocked recessed compartment, and the unusual odor emanating from the unsecured brown paper bag, we uphold Officer Hostetter\u2019s routine caretaking automobile inventory search of the lawfully impounded 1982 Corvette. <em>See United States v. Maier, </em>691 F.2d at 423-25; <em>United States v. Strahan, </em>674 F.2d 96, 100-01 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 1010, 102 S.Ct. 2304, 73 L.Ed.2d 1306 (1982). The governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>interest in protecting the Griffins\u2019 property from damage, theft, and vandalism while in the custody of the Indiana State Police, protecting the Indiana State Police and the towing service against claims of lost or stolen property, and protecting Hostetter and the Indiana State Police officers from potential danger, outweighed Charles and Jerome Griffins\u2019 expectation of privacy in a tape wrapped package placed in an unsecured brown paper bag and located in the unlocked storage compartment of an automobile that neither Charles nor Jerome owned.

The fact that an inventory search is not premised upon probable cause distinguishes the inventory search of an automobile, and the packages contained therein, from the warrantless search of an automobile where probable cause for the search exists in the first instance. Thus, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s rationale in the line of cases dealing with the warrantless search of an automobile, where probable cause for the search exists in the first instance, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982); <em>Robbins v. California, </em>453 U.S. 420, 101 S.Ct. 2841, 69 L.Ed.2d 744 (1981); <em>Arkansas v.

The district court also relied upon \"the absence of standard procedures regulating the scope of [the] search\" to rule that Officer Hostetter's search of the lawfully impounded 1982 Corvette did not constitute a proper automobile inventory search. In light of Officer Hostetter's testimony that the inventory of impounded vehicles is \"standard operating procedure\u201d of the Indiana State Police Department, the district court's finding of the same, and this court's language in <em>Balanow </em>that normal Indiana procedure allows state troopers to perform an automobile inventory search at the time of impounding, we fail to understand the district court\u2019s concern over the Government\u2019s failure to show \"the existence of any formal guideline or regulation defining the permissible scope of the trooper's search.\u201d The district court\u2019s attempt to distinguish the <em>scope </em>of the \"standard operating procedure\" used by the Indiana State Police and the one used by the Vermillion Police Department which was upheld by the Court in <em>Opperman </em>is without merit. In his concurrence in <em>Opperman, </em>Justice Powell noted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>\"standard inventory\" of the Vermillion Police Department \"consist[ed] of a survey of the vehicle\u2019s exterior \u2014 windows, fenders, trunk, and hood \u2014 apparently for damage, and its interior to locate \u2018valuables\u2019 for storage.\" <em>Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 380 n. 6, 96 S.Ct. at 3102 n. 6 (Powell, J., concurring). There exists no mention in <em>Opperman </em>of the scope of the inventory search once inside the interior of the vehicle. For this reason the district court\u2019s reliance upon the lack of a formal guideline or regulation defining the permissible scope of Hostetter\u2019s inventory search, once inside the automobile, is completely misplaced. In fact, it appears that the Indiana State Police Department\u2019s \"standard operating procedure\u201d is \"essentially like that followed throughout the country,\" <em>Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 376, 96 S.Ct. at 3100, for the inventory search of an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"AR5l\">The district court\u2019s mention of the lack of a formal guideline or regulation defining the permissible scope of an automobile inventory search appears to be a new and novel theory to further restrict law enforcement procedures under the guise of constitutional interpretation.

Lafayette, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 77 L.Ed.2d 65 (1983). Nevertheless, the government must prove that such a search was truly inventorial, and not investigative. In other words, the government must demonstrate that the search was performed \u201cin accordance with established inventory procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>103 S.Ct. at 2611; <em>see South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 372, 96 S.Ct. at 3098. Absent proof of compliance with settled inventory rules, evidence seized during the search must be suppressed. <em>See, e.g., State v. Jewell, </em>338 So.2d 633 (La.1976); <em>State v. Blais, </em>416 A.2d 1253 (Me.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The district court found that the Indiana State Police has a \u201cdepartmental policy that all impounded vehicles be inventoried prior to being towed or driven away.\u201d This finding is based on the testimony of Trooper Hostetter who stated: \u201c[WJhen I take a car in for protective custody or to impound it I inventory that vehicle because our standard operating procedure I am supposed to do that. That protects the wrecker service and protects me.\u201d Indeed, in <em>United States v. Balanow, </em>528 F.2d 923 (7th Cir.1976), we recognized the same policy of inventorying cars before turning them over to tow-service drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">The uncontroverted testimony in this case reveals, however, that the standard practice was not followed. To be sure, Trooper Hostetter did conduct an inventory search prior to turning the car over to Roger Fulton \u2014 the tow-service driver. In the course of that search the trooper noticed, but did not open, a package wrapped in plastic tape. Only after Roger Fulton drove the ear to a maintenance area did Trooper Hostetter renew his search, open the wrapped package, and discover the phencycledine.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">If the established practice is to inventory a car <em>before </em>it is turned over to a tow-service driver, I must conclude that the search in the maintenance area was not in accord with settled procedures. Trooper Hostetter, in directing Roger Fulton to drive the car to a maintenance area, implicitly acknowledged that the roadside inventory search was adequate to protect himself and Roger Fulton. The subsequent search in the maintenance area, and the opening of what Trooper Hostetter termed a \u201csuspicious\u201d package, simply do not square with the routine inventory practice. To summarize, I am unaware of any Indiana State Police policy that calls for two inventory searches \u2014 one roadside search and one subsequent search to investigate \u201csuspicious\u201d items.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">I would thus affirm without discussing the merits of the district court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence must be suppressed because \u201cthe scope of the search appears to have been left to the absolute discretion of Trooper Hostetter.\u201d I cannot subscribe, however, to the majority\u2019s characterization of the district court\u2019s reasoning as \u201ca new and novel theory to further restrict law enforcement procedures under the guise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>constitutional interpretation.\u201d <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 483 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">As noted above, inventory searches are constitutionally permissible only if performed in accord with standardized procedures. This principle of law would be meaningless if an adequate \u201cstandardized procedure\u201d is the commitment of absolute discretion in the searching officer. As the Ninth Circuit noted in <em>United States v. Hellman, </em>556 F.2d 442 (1977), \u201c[a] locally followed practice gives some assurance that a particular car was not singled out for special searching attention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444; <em>see generally </em>2 W. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment </em>\u00a7 7.4, at 576-77 (1978). Indeed Justice Powell, whose vote was needed for a majority in <em>Opperman, </em>finds inventory searches reasonable because \u201cno significant discretion is placed in the hands of the individual officer: he usually has no choice as to the subject of the search <em>or its scope.\u201d South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 384, 96 S.Ct. at 3104 (Powell, J., concurring) (emphasis added). I leave for another day the question whether the Indiana State Police\u2019s inventory policy is sufficiently specific. I need only note that the policy, as general as it is, did not sanction the trooper\u2019s actions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
