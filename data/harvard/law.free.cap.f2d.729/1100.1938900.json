The district court\u2019s order finding jurisdiction was certified to this court as an interlocutory appeal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (1976). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-12\">Defendant Alice R. Dean is a medical doctor who at one time practiced psychiatry in the Milwaukee area. In 1980 the defendant was found guilty in state court of making fraudulent claims for Medicaid reimbursements in connection with her medical practice. State <em>v. Dean, </em>Case No. J-4775 (Cir.Ct., Milw. Cty.1979). The court sentenced the defendant to probation and ordered her to pay $13,285 in restitution to the State of Wisconsin. As a consequence of her conviction, the State permanently revoked the defendant\u2019s license to practice medicine in Wisconsin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-17\">On September 9, 1980, the State of Wisconsin\u2019s Departments of Justice and Health and Social Services (the State) filed suit in federal district court against the defendant under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 231-233 (1976). The False Claims Act gives parties other than the federal government both a private right of action against persons who submit false claims to the federal government and a portion of any recovery. The complaint here alleged that the defendant submitted approximately 912 fraudulent claims for reimbursement for psychiatric services between March 1974 and February 1976. The State demands relief of $2,000 per false claim (the statutory forfeiture amount), $47,343.76 damages on behalf of the United States, $15,808.12 compensatory damages on a pendent claim, $150,000 punitive damages, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-18\">To exercise a private right of action, the <em>qui tam </em>plaintiff must provide the United States Attorney General with a copy of the complaint and \u201ca disclosure in writing of substantially all evidence and information in his possession material to the effective prosecution of such suit.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 232(C). The United States then has sixty days upon notification of the <em>qui tam </em>action \u201cwithin which to enter appearance in such suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff may maintain the action even though the government declines to join unless \u201cit shall be made to appear that such suit was based upon evidence or information in the possession of the United States, or any agency, officer or employee thereof, at the time such suit was brought.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-19\">The United States declined to join this action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After considering all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>arguments and evidence, the district court held that \u201cthe information upon which the instant case is based was sufficiently in the possession of the United States to enable the federal government to adequately investigate the case and make a decision whether to prosecute.\u201d Nonetheless, the district court interpreted the legislative history of Section 232(C) and denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court certified this interlocutory appeal on the ground that its decision to find subject matter jurisdiction \u201cinvolves a controlling question of law ... and that an immediate appeal ... may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). We accepted jurisdiction and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">The district court properly recognized that the jurisdictional bar of Section 232(C) applies whenever the government has knowledge of the \u201cessential information upon which the suit is predicated\u201d before the suit is filed, even when the plaintiff is the source of that knowledge. <em>United States ex rel. Weinberger v. Florida, </em>615 F.2d 1370, 1371 (5th Cir.1980). Although the courts consistently have interpreted the unambiguous language of Section 232(C) to admit no exception when the government possesses such \u201cessential information,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court examined the legislative history of the False Claims Act and determined that the State of Wisconsin could maintain a <em>qui tam </em>action when the State was the source of the \u201cessential information\u201d and wh\u00e9n 'the State was required to provide such- information to the federal government as part of its participation in the Medicare reimbursement program. A contrary result, the district court reasoned, \u201cwould frustrate the purpose of Congress in protecting the United States against false claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-11\">We are not persuaded by the State\u2019s contention that the district court improperly determined that the State\u2019s complaint was \u201cbased upon evidence or information in the possession of the United States, or any agency, officer or employee thereof, at the time\u201d the complaint was filed. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 232(C). The evidence which the government possesses need not be a \u201cmirror image of that in the hands of the <em>qui tam </em>plaintiff.\u201d The evidence and information need only be \u201csufficient to enable [the government] adequately to investigate the case and to make a decision whether to prosecute.\u201d <em>Pettis ex rel. Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number><em>ed States v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., </em>577 F.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir.1978). In the district court, the defendant showed that the government possessed such \u201csufficient information.\u201d First, the Wisconsin Medicaid Fraud Control Unit provided the United States Department of Health and Human Services with many reports about the allegedly fraudulent Medicaid claims during the State\u2019s investigation and prosecution of the appellant on state criminal grounds. Many of those reports were required from the State under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 455.17 (1980). Second, the state criminal proceedings were reported extensively in two Milwaukee newspapers. Finally, the Milwaukee County Assistant District Attorney who prosecuted the appellant in the state criminal proceedings acted as a Special United States Attorney at the time of the prosecution. The district court thus properly determined that the government possessed adequate information as contemplated by Section 232(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">In order to establish an exception to overcome the plain language of the False Claims Act, we must find a \u201cclearly expressed legislative intention\u201d contrary to that language. <em>Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980). The district court concluded that the legislative history of the Act was clear enough to overcome the statute\u2019s unambiguous language. Our own review of the legislative history leads us to the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">Many courts have reviewed the legislative history of the False Claims Act since the jurisdictional bar at issue here was added in 1943. <em>See, e.g., Safir v. Blackwell, </em>579 F.2d 742 (2d Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 943, 99 S.Ct. 2161, 60 L.Ed.2d 1045 (1979); <em>Pettis, </em>577 F.2d 668; <em>United States ex rel. Bayarski v. Brooks, </em>154 F.2d 344 (3d Cir.1946); <em>United States v. Pittman, </em>151 F.2d 851 (5th Cir.1946); <em>United States ex rel. Vance v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>363 F.Supp. 1038 (W.D.Pa.1973); <em>United States v. Aster, </em>176 F.Supp. 208 (E.D.Pa.1959), <em>aff'd, </em>275 F.2d 281 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Aloff v. Aster, </em>364 U.S. 894, 81 S.Ct. 223, 5 L.Ed.2d 188 (1960); <em>United States v. Armour &amp; Co., </em>146 F.Supp. 546 (D.D.C.1956). In each of these cases a party challenged the jurisdictional bar by seeking an exception to the plain language of the statute. The various courts all held that no exception exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">For example, the <em>Pettis </em>court denied jurisdiction for a <em>qui tarn </em>plaintiff despite the plaintiff's contention that Section 232(C) was inapplicable \u201cwhen an informer prior to bringing suit supplies the government with the information which under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 232(C) invokes the bar.\u201d 577 F.2d at 669. The court reviewed extensively the legislative history of the False Claims Act presented by the parties here in support of their respective interpretations of the jurisdictional bar of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-9\">Congress enacted the jurisdictional bar at issue here in reaction to <em>United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, </em>317 U.S. 537, 63 S.Ct. 379, 87 L.Ed. 443 (1943), in which the Supreme Court held that a <em>qui tarn </em>action was not barred merely because the <em>qui tarn </em>plaintiff may have obtained the information for his complaint from an indictment or other public record and thus may have contributed nothing to the discovery of the fraud upon the government. Although Congress\u2019s immediate concern in enacting the 1943 amendment was to do away with the \u201cparasitical suits\u201d allowed by <em>Hess, </em>the language and effect of the 1943 amendment in fact is much broader. The amendment itself was the result of a compromise between very different remedies proposed in each House of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-10\">The House of Representatives passed a bill to completely abolish <em>qui tarn </em>suits. The Senate, on the other hand, sought to allow <em>qui tarn </em>actions if they were based either upon information not in the possession of the United States or upon information in the possession of the United States of which the <em>qui tarn </em>plaintiff was the source. The compromise amendment allowed <em>qui tarn </em>actions that the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>States did not join to continue if the information was not in the possession of the United States at the time the action was brought, thereby incorporating only the first part of the original Senate proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">As the <em>Pettis </em>court observed, \u201cwhy [Congress] struck the particular compromise it did remains obscure.\u201d 557 F.2d at 671. Nonetheless, the State would have us conjecture as to Congress\u2019s rationale for the compromise amendment. The State would have us read the House Conference Report language on the compromise proposal that \u201c[t]he conferees ... have followed to some extent the pattern of the Senate amendments,\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 933, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. 4, <em>reprinted in </em>89 Cong.Rec. 10844, 10845 (1943), to mean that the conference committee rejected the wording of the original Senate proposal in favor of the compromise proposal because the committee considered the Senate proposal an unnecessary clarification of the compromise proposal finally adopted. Appellees\u2019 br. at 17. We decline to undertake this strained reading of the House Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">The State also relies on the statements of Senator Van Nuys during floor debate of the original Senate proposal. Senator Van Nuys, in response to protests to any decrease in federal court jurisdiction for <em>qui tarn </em>actions under the False Claims Act, stated that the original Senate proposal \u201cprotects the honest informer as nearly as we can do it by statute [and] ... would not prevent an honest informer from coming in.\u201d 89 Cong.Rec. 7609 (1943). Although Senator Van Nuys was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee which originally proposed the Senate version of Section 232(C) and although Senator Van Nuys was a member of the conference committee which drafted the proposal finally enacted by Congress, his remarks certainly do not control the result here, <em>Weinberger v. Rossi, </em>456 U.S. 25, 35 &amp; n. 15, 102 S.Ct. 1510, 1517 &amp; n. 15, 71 L.Ed.2d 715 (1982), and clearly are insufficient standing alone to overcome the clear language of the statute. <em>Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, </em>447 U.S. at 108, 100 S.Ct. at 2056.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-7\">For the same reasons, the State\u2019s attempts to use the statements of Representatives Kefauver and Walter before the House of Representatives are unpersuasive. Representative Kefauver, who was not a member of the conference committee that drafted the compromise proposal, summarized what he considered the essence of the proposal: \u201c[I]f the average, good American citizen ... had the information and he gives it to the Government, and the Government does not proceed in due course, provision is made here where that suit can be brought and where he can get some compensation.\u201d 89 Cong.Rec. 10844. Similarly, Representative Walter, a member of the conference committee, stated during the debate that the committee intended to stop parasitical suits and had \u201cno desire to interfere with suits which are brought honestly and legitimately by informers in which the United States were not a party.\u201d 89 Cong.Rec. 10846. Representative Walter also explained that \u201cactions in which informers brought suits in good faith, and [in which] information was not available to the Department of Justice, ... then, under this compromise measure, those informers will have the right to proceed with their actions and recover.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Representative Kefauver\u2019s statements, although ambiguous, as the <em>Pettis </em>court points out, cannot overcome the plain language of Section 232(C). Representative Walter\u2019s statements merely confirm that the proposal eliminates \u201cparasitical suits.\u201d Representative Walter\u2019s statements thus also are insufficient to justify the exception the State now seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-10\">In <em>United States v. Aster, </em>176 F.Supp. 208, <em>aff'd, </em>275 F.2d 281, the court held that the jurisdictional bar of Section 232(C) is \u201cbroad enough to cover information obtained by the government from any source whatever.\u201d 176 F.Supp. at 209. <em>United States v. Pittman, </em>151 F.2d 851, one of the earliest cases decided under Section 232, lends support to that conclusion. In <em>Pittman, </em>the court discussed how the jurisdictional bar of Section 232(C) was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>absolute where the government possessed the essential information upon which a <em>qui tam </em>action is based and the government declines to join the suit. We must not lightly dismiss the weight of these early interpretations of Section 232(C). Longstanding acceptance by the courts of Section 232(C)\u2019s construction, coupled with Congress\u2019s failure to reject these reasonable interpretations, weigh significantly in favor of accepting Section 232(C) as an absolute bar. <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 733, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 1924, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">The State seeks to distinguish <em>Pettis, Aster, </em>and <em>Pittman </em>on the ground that they involved private citizens rather than a state government as the source of the information which creates the jurisdictional bar. The State argues that Congress did not contemplate a state government as the <em>qui tam </em>plaintiff when it enacted the 1943 amendment, and that the state therefore is not included within the jurisdictional bar. This contention is without support in the legislative history of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">The State contends that the distinction between private citizens and states is justified because the state is required to provide the federal government with the very information that creates the jurisdictional bar of Section 232(C). Under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396p, states that receive grants from the federal government under the Act must report various fraud and abuse information to the Health Care Financing Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 455.17 (1980). The State contends that this reporting requirement alone is sufficient to create an exception to the False Claims Act. The House Conference Report on the compromise amendment to the False Claims Act stated that under the amendment \u201c[i]t will not be possible to abate a pending suit if before such suit was filed such person had in his possession and voluntarily disclosed to the Attorney General substantial evidence or information which was not theretofore in the possession of the Department of Justice.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 933, 89 Cong.Rec. at 10845. Even if we were to interpret this language to admit the exception which <em>Pettis, Aster, </em>and <em>Pittman </em>denied, which we <em>do.not, the </em>language clearly excludes the appellees where they were required to provide the government with the information upon which this action was based; such information was not, therefore, \u201cvoluntarily disclosed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-8\">Moreover, nothing in the legislative history of the Social Security Act supports finding an exception to the False Claims Act in this case. ' Only in the rarest instance will a court find an exception to a statute when Congress has not directly amended that statute. <em>Galvan v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp., </em>549 F.2d 281, 288 (3d Cir.1977). <em>Cf. Cohen v. United States, </em>201 F.2d 386, 393 (9th Cir.1953) (\u201c[Specific legislation will not be held to have repealed by implication more general legislation in this field where another reasonable. construction can be applied.\u201d). We will not use the Social Security Act to fashion an exception to the False Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-9\">If the State of Wisconsin desires a special exemption to the False Claims Act because of its requirement to report Medicaid fraud to the federal government, then it should ask Congress to provide the exemption. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, </em>317 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>U.S. at 546-47, 63 S.Ct. at 385-86, when it refused to create the jurisdictional bar that Congress later provided by the 1943 amendment to the False Claims Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1209-4\">The government presses upon us strong arguments of policy against the statutory plan, but the entire force of these considerations is directed solely at what the [state] thinks Congress should have done rather than at what it did____ But the trouble with these arguments is that they are addressed to the wrong forum. Conditions may have changed, but the statute has not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1209-7\">The decision of the district court is reversed and this case is remanded with instructions for the district court to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1204-14\">. A <em>qui tam </em>action is one in which the plaintiff sues for himself and on behalf of the government to recover a penalty under a statute which provides that part of the penalty is awarded to the party bringing the suit and the remainder of the penalty is awarded to the government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1204-21\">. On November 7, 1980, the United States submitted its statement to the district court declining to enter an appearance in this action. The statement reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>[T]he relator submitted the required notice to the Attorney General of the United States at Washington, D.C., and the Attorney General hereby timely files this declination. In doing so, however, the United States does not mean to imply that this action is not cognizable under the [False Claims] Act, nor that governmental interests will not be affected by its outcome. On the contrary, it is because those interests will be served by the relator\u2019s control of this action that the United States has declined to enter____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-8\">The state is a proper relator. This litigation is the result of the investigative efforts of the State of Wisconsin.

Further, the relator possesses the ability, manpower and resources with which to pursue this action. Thus, the <em>qui tam </em>plaintiff herein is the proper party to conduct this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1205-12\">R. at 3. As discussed below, the district court properly found that the action was based upon information which was known to the United States at the time the action was filed. Therefore, the Attorney General's decision that the State of Wisconsin is a proper relator for this action is a nullity. The Attorney General cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction upon the district court. <em>See American Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v.
