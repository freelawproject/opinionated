The practice falls within the regulatory jurisdiction, not of Massachusetts, but of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; it is embodied in a private utility agreement, which FERC has approved. Massachusetts told the utility to seek FERC\u2019s approval to change the rule. The utility filed a notice of change with FERC, in accordance with the procedures contained in \u00a7 205 of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d. FERC rejected the proposed change, because it believed that this particular statutory provision governs changes that the utility itself proposes, not those that a state regulator requires it to propose. If Massachusetts objects to the rule, says FERC, it should file a complaint in accordance with a different statutory procedure, namely, that contained in \u00a7 206 of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824e. Massa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>chusetts appeals FERC\u2019s decision. We find that FERC was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">The procedural dichotomy here involved \u2014 between \u00a7\u00a7 205 and 206 \u2014 is often found in statutory schemes of public \u00fatility rate regulation \u2014 regulation that typically consists of a public commission\u2019s review of a private utility\u2019s rates and practices to determine whether they are reasonable. Both state and federal regulatory statutes often provide two different \u201ctracks\u201d for review. The first allows the commission, acting either on its own initiative or after a complaint, to change <em>existing </em>utility rate practices. To do so, the commission or the complainant must prove that the practices are unreasonable. The existing rates stay in effect while the proceedings take place; and, typically, the utility has no obligation to give customer refunds, even if the rates are found unreasonably high. The second track allows the commission to review <em>changes </em>that the utility intends to make. Typically, the commission may suspend the proposed change for a few months; then, if the proceedings are not yet finished, the change takes effect, subject to a refund obligation if the change is found unreasonable. <em>See, e.g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717c-717d (natural gas); 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10704, 10708 (rail carriers with market dominance); Ill.Stat. ch. 111\u2154, \u00a7\u00a7 36, 41; Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 93-94; N.H.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 378:7, 8; Ohio Code \u00a7\u00a7 4909.15, 4909.18; 66 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1308-09, R.I.Gen.Laws \u00a7\u00a7 39-3-11,-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">The first of these tracks is here found in \u00a7 206 of the Federal Power Act. It states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-7\">[wjhenever the Commission, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint, shall find that any rate ... or ... any rule, ... practice, or contract affecting such rate ... is ... unreasonable ..., the Commission shall determine the ... reasonable rate, ... practice, or contract ... and shall fix the same by order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824e(a). The second of these tracks is here found in \u00a7 205 of the Federal Power Act. It states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgT\">every public utility shall file with the Commission ... schedules showing all rates and ... practices ... and ... contracts which ... relate to such rates____ [N]o change shall be made ... except after sixty days\u2019 notice____ Such notice shall be given by filing with the Commission ... new schedules____ Whenever any such new schedule is filed the Commission shall have authority ... to enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness [of the changes] ...; and, pending such hearing and the decision thereon, the Commission ... may suspend the ... [new] schedule ... [for no longer than] five months ---- If ... an order [has not been] made at [the end of] ... five months, [the changes] ... shall go into effect ..., but in case of a proposed increased rate or charge, the Commission ... [may require a refund of any] portion of such increased rate[ ] ... as by its decision shall be found not justified. At any hearing involving [a rate increase], the burden [of proving an increase] just and reasonable shall be upon the public utility____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-15\">16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d(c)-(e). In essence, FERC says that Massachusetts should use the first track to obtain review of the utility\u2019s contractual rate rule; Massachusetts in \u201cordering] the Company to petition FERC for an amendment\u201d essentially tried to use the second track by telling the utility to file a \u201cnew schedule\u201d containing the changes it desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-16\">The specific narrow statutory question before us is whether \u00a7 205 applies to this type of regulator-compelled rate change. Do the \u00a7 205 statutory words \u201cchange,\u201d \u201csuch new schedule,\u201d and so forth, include <em>this </em>type of change or \u201cnew schedule?\u201d The words of the statute do not themselves resolve the problem, for one might read them either as including or excluding the type of \u201cutility-proposed\u201d change here at issue. FERC says that they do not include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>this type of change. We are fully aware of the special attention that a court should pay to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own authorizing statute, <em>NLRB v. Hendricks County Rural Electric Membership Corp., </em>454 U.S. 170, 177, 102 S.Ct. 216, 222, 70 L.Ed.2d 323 (1981); <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 565, 100 S.Ct. 790, 796, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980); <em>Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB, </em>441 U.S. 488, 495, 99 S.Ct. 1842, 1848, 60 L.Ed.2d 420 (1979); <em>NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 274-75, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 1761-1762, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974), particularly when the subject matter is one of proper procedure necessary to facilitate the agency\u2019s work, <em>see Oldham v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>718 F.2d 507, 510 (1st Cir.1983). And here there is more than sufficient support for FERC\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">For one thing, FERC\u2019s interpretation is more consistent with the purposes of the entire procedural scheme. Like most traditional regulatory schemes, the two provisions together allow the utility the choice among various reasonable rate practices. Unless the Commission can prove that an existing rate practice is unreasonable, the utility\u2019s previously filed rate practice may remain in effect. Similarly, the utility may change any rate practice so long as it can prove that the proposed change is reasonable. To accept Massachusetts\u2019 claim that \u00a7 205 includes \u201cregulator-compelled\u201d utility-proposed changes would prevent the utility from choosing among reasonable rate-practice alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">For another thing, Massachusetts\u2019 interpretation threatens confusion, possibly chaos. What is to prevent each state in a multistate service area from requiring the utility to file a <em>different </em>set of \u201creasonable\u201d rate practices with FERC? Neither law nor economics can identify one unique set of rates or practices as \u201creasonable,\u201d <em>Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Service Co., </em>341 U.S. 246, 251, 71 S.Ct. 692, 695, 95 L.Ed. 912 (1951), and each state would prefer a rate structure that benefitted its residents to the detriment of its neighbors. (The substantive issue underlying this case appears to concern the proper allocation of costs between Connecticut and Massachusetts customers.) FERC perhaps could sort out consequent confusions, but requiring it to do so has a procedural cost; in addition, the accompanying uncertainty could raise capital costs to the detriment of the very consumer whom the regulatory statute seeks to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Furthermore, the net effect of accepting Massachusetts\u2019 argument is to allow a state to do what FERC itself cannot, namely, to change an <em>interstate </em>rate practice that FERC has not found unreasonable. In analogous circumstances, the Supreme Court has forbidden others to exercise powers denied FERC but within FERC\u2019s general area of authority. <em>Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Hall, </em>453 U.S. 571, 579-80, 101 S.Ct. 2925, 2927, 69 L.Ed.2d 856 (1981) (court cannot, through breach-of-contract action, permit collection of rate other than that on file with Commission); <em>Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Service Co., </em>341 U.S. at 254, 71 S.Ct. at 696 (court cannot grant, on grounds of fraud and deceit, reparations for allegedly unreasonable past rates on file with the Commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">Finally, if Massachusetts is right, FERC could suspend the change for five months (under \u00a7 205), but, if the proceeding were then still pending, FERC would have to allow the change to take effect. Suppose that sometime after five months FERC concludes that the Massachusetts-inspired change unreasonably favors Massachusetts customers at the expense of those in Connecticut. The utility would have to refund amounts overcharged to Connecticut consumers but could not then recover the unreasonable \u201cundercharge\u201d from those in Massachusetts. <em>Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Hall, </em>453 U.S. at 578 &amp; n. 8, 580, 101 S.Ct. at 2931 &amp; n. 8. Section 205 provides only for overcharge refunds, perhaps because a utility, <em>acting on its own, </em>is unlikely to propose a rate that unreasonably deprives it of sufficient revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Given the practical difficulties that the Massachusetts interpretation may well create, it is not surprising that Massachusetts has been unable to find directly supporting authority arising under any of the many statutory schemes that embody this type of two-track system. <em>See, e.g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717c-717d (natural gas); 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10704, 10708 (rail carriers with market dominance); Ill.Stat. ch. 111\u2154, \u00a7\u00a7 36, 41; Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 93-94; N.H.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 378:7, 8; Ohio Code \u00a7\u00a7 4909.15, 4909.18; 66 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1308-09; R.I.Gen.Laws \u00a7\u00a7 39-3-11,-12. These difficulties are sufficient to convince us that PERC\u2019s interpretation of its own statute is correct, and its order is</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
