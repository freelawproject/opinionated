The Board, by its order, affirmed an administrative law judge\u2019s finding that Verderane was entitled to disability benefits under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 (1976) (the Act). However, because it disagreed with the method used by the AU to calculate the statutory adjustments to Verderane\u2019s compensation rate, the Board vacated the AU\u2019s award of benefits and remanded for recomputation of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">After this court granted the petitions for review, the Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, United States Department of Labor, moved this court to dismiss the consolidated appeal on the ground that no appealable final order had been entered by the Benefits Review Board. We agree with the Director and therefore dismiss the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">Under section 21(c) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-13\">Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order of the Board may obtain a review of that order in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the injury occurred, by filing in such court within sixty days following the issuance of such Board order a written petition praying that the order be modified or set aside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">Without exception, this circuit has held that section 21(c) requires the Board\u2019s order to be final<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and does not provide for review of a Board order that remands the case to an AU for further findings on a claimant\u2019s award of benefits. <em>See, e.g., United Fruit Co. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>546 F.2d 1224, 1225 (5th Cir.1977); <em>Gulfport Shipbuilding Corp. v. Vallot, </em>334 F.2d 358, 360 (5th Cir.1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 U.S. 974, 85 S.Ct. 1333, 14 L.Ed.2d 269 (1965). In fact, no circuit has reached a contrary conclusion on the issue. <em>See Newpark Shipbuilding &amp; Repair, Inc. v. Roundtree, </em>723 F.2d 399 (5th Cir.1984) (en banc) (collecting cases); <em>Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Benefits Review Board, </em>535 F.2d 758 (3d Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">Following, as we must, the precedent in this circuit, we hold that a petition to review a Benefits Review Board order that determines liability but remands to an AU for recalculation of the award is not an appealable final order under section 21(c) of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the petitions for review are</p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-10\">. Generally, a judgment or order is not final for purposes of appellate review unless the decision \"ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 467, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2457, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978), (quoting, <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 633, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-11\">. We emphasize that our disposition of this petition for review does not call into question those exceptional cases in which appealable finality has been accorded even though the judgment or order sought to be reviewed did not completely terminate the litigation. <em>See Huckeby v. Frozen Food Express, </em>555 F.2d 542, 547-49 (5th Cir.1977) (certain narrow exceptions to rule of appealable finality recognized \"where there is \u2018an order, otherwise nonappealable, determining substantial rights of the parties <em>which will be irreparably lost if review is delayed until final </em>judgment____\u201d\u2019) (emphasis in original) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-19\">The petition for review in this case, arising as it does under section 21(c) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, does not present such an exceptional situation. Therefore, the well-established requirement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>appealable finality stands as a bar to our review of the Board's order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
