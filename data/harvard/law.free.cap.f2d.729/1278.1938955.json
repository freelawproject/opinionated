On February 4, 1982, a Kansas City, Kansas, federal grand jury indicted Beachner Co. and its Secretary-Treasurer, Robert Beachner, on one count of bid-rigging in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, and on one count of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. This indictment <em>{Beachner I) </em>related to the alleged bid-rigging of a state highway construction project in Harvey County, Kansas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 7, 1982, both defendants were acquitted following a jury trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1381-8\">On November 16, 1982, a second indictment was returned against Beachner Co., naming Jerry Beachner, a Vice-President, as a codefendant. This indictment <em>(Beachner II) </em>charged the defendants with three Sherman Act violations (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1) and three mail fraud violations (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) regarding three Kansas highway construction projects let on April 25, 1978 (Bourbon and Allen Counties), November 1, 1978 (Cowley County), and July 19, 1979 (Montgomery and Neosho Counties). After both defendants moved to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, the district court held a pretrial evidentiary hearing as required by <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977). At the close of this hearing, the district court granted Beachner Co.\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment and the government\u2019s motion to sever defendant Jerry Beachner\u2019s case for trial. The court found that the alleged bid-rigging schemes regarding the aforementioned highway projects were each part of a single, continuing conspiracy which had existed in Kansas since the early 1960\u2019s. Thus, the court reasoned that to prosecute Beachner Co. under the second indictment would effectively put it in jeopardy twice for the same offense in violation of the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-10\">The issues presented on this appeal are whether the district court erred (1) in finding that the second indictment against Beachner Co. encompasses the same conspiracy in which it was previously acquitted, and (2) in dismissing the three mail fraud counts in the indictment along with the Sherman Act counts because it found the existence of a single Sherman Act conspiracy. We agree with the district court that a single, continuing bid-rigging conspiracy was present in this case. Further, we hold that the mail fraud actions were an integral part of the overall bid-rigging scheme; hence, it was proper for the district court to dismiss the entire <em>Beachner II </em>indictment filed against Beachner Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-13\">At the double jeopardy evidentiary hearing, both the government<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Beachner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>Co. introduced evidence, including testimony by seven Kansas asphalt contractors, which established the following facts. The Kansas Department of Transportation occasionally holds competitive bid-lettings for state highway construction projects which require asphalt work. Since the 1960\u2019s, however, a scheme to submit collusive bids has often been used by the state asphalt contractors to allow them to avoid competition and ensure higher profits (R., Vol. 6 at 59-64; Vol. 8 at 512). Specific terms such as \u201csetup job\u201d and \u201ccomp bid\u201d or \u201ccomplementary bid\u201d were familiar industry-wide in Kansas for at least the past twenty years<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (R., Vol. 6 at 59, 69-70, 165-67, 169-71, 217-19, and 222-24; Vol. 7 at 311-12 and 338-39; Vol. 8 at 428-29, 487-88, and 512-13). This terminology has been preserved although the \u201cmethod\u201d of bid-rigging within the Kansas highway asphalt paving industry had changed slightly over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">Until 1972, San Ore Construction Company had directed the bid-rigging. Contractors would contact San Ore\u2019s President, Clare Miller, if they wanted to be awarded a particular job (R., Vol. 6 at 92). At the beginning of each year, the contractors would meet to study the list of state jobs planned for letting. Miller would then allocate the available jobs among the interested contractors (R., Vol. 6 at 139; Vol. 7 at 384 and 387). When a setup project was open for bids, the designated \u201csetup\u201d contractor telephoned the other bidders to inform them of the price to bid above (R., Vol. 6 at 140). When San Ore went out of business in the early 1970\u2019s, the contractors ceased meeting on an annual basis. Further, the state stopped issuing the lists of planned highway projects far in advance of the time for letting (R., Vol. 6 at 141 and 150-51).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-9\">Although the contractors no longer followed the \u201cyearly\u201d method of bid-rigging, all contractors involved after San Ore\u2019s dissolution followed the <em>same procedure </em>for \u201csetting up\u201d a job as was used previously (R., Vol. 6 at 79-80, 91-94 and 117; Vol. 8 at 512-13). This common procedure was that a contractor interested in setting up a job would contact other contractors potentially-interested in bidding and obtain their cooperation \u2014 the other contractors would either submit \u201ccomp\u201d bids or refrain from bidding on the particular job (R., Vol. 6 at 108-10 and 174; Vol. 7 at 245-46 and 369-71). If a \u201csetup\u201d contractor was subsequently unable to rig the bidding, he was expected to advise the other bid-rigging participants of that inability (R., Vol. 6 at 79 and 175). Further, if one bidding contractor refused to participate in the desired scheme for a particular job, the job was bid competitively (R., Vol. 8 at 518-19). In fact, recently, more than eighty percent of all jobs were bid competitively (R., Vol. 6 at 198; Vol. 7 at 274-75 and 386-87; Vol. 8 at 425).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-10\">The incentive for a contractor to \u201cgo along\u201d with a proposed setup job by submitting a complementary bid, or no bid at all, was that he could depend on the \u201csetup\u201d contractor to return the same favor at a future bid-letting<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (R., Vol. 6 at 131). If this reciprocal obligation did not occur, the original \u201ccomp bidder\u201d would ordinarily refuse to cooperate again with the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>\u201csetup\u201d contractor (R., Vol. 7 at 236-37). Thus, the bid-rigging scheme was most prevalent when a large amount of asphalt work was available because in less active times, fewer future benefits were possible for the other participating contractors (R., Vol. 6 at 81-82, 132 and 182). Contractors were apparently less willing to participate in bid-rigging for another\u2019s instant benefit when they all needed work to stay in business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-6\">A. <em>Double Jeopardy</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ail\">The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to' be twice put in jeopardy in life or limb____\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That clause may not properly be invoked unless both the first and second trials involve the \u201csame offence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ewell, </em>383 U.S. 116, 124, 86 S.Ct. 773, 778, 15 L.Ed.2d 627 (1966). To determine if Beachner Co. was indicted a second time for the same offense of which it had previously been acquitted, our primary concern is whether the alleged actions by Beachner Co. relating to the asphalt projects enumerated in <em>Beachner II </em>comprised a separate conspiracy to rig bids, or whether those actions were part of a single, continuing conspiracy to rig bids. If a single conspiracy is found to have existed, Beachner Co. may not be tried twice for that offense. When making such a determination, we have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqLh\">the pertinent inquiry is whether the record ... is sufficient to establish that [all conspirators] had a <em>single, common and continuing objective </em>____ If so, there would be but one conspiracy even though its purposes were advanced ... by diverse parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1383-15\"><em>United States v. Wilshire Oil Co. of Texas, </em>427 F.2d 969, 976 (10th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 829, 91 S.Ct. 58, 27 L.Ed.2d 59 (1970) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1383-16\">The standard we must apply in reviewing the district court\u2019s finding of a \u201csingle, continuing conspiracy\u201d is whether it was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Jabara, </em>644 F.2d 574, 577 (6th Cir.1981). <em>See also United States v. Comosona, </em>614 F.2d 695, 697 n. 4 (10th Cir.1980). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when the appellate court \u201c \u2018is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jabara, supra </em>at 577 (quoting <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number><em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948)). After reviewing the entire record, we hold that the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding the existence of a single, continuing conspiracy to rig bids in the asphalt industry in Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">The court based this finding on several grounds: (1) there existed (for more than twenty-five years) a continuous, cooperative effort among Kansas asphalt contractors to rig bids and there was a \u201ccommon objective\u201d by all participants to eliminate price competition (R., Vol. 2 at 245), (2) although the overall system of bid-rigging has varied slightly throughout the years, a \u201ccommon method\u201d of \u201csetting up\u201d a job was persistent (Id.), (3) common bid-rigging jargon was well-known and freely used throughout the industry for the twenty-five-year period <em>(Id. </em>at 246), (4) the participating contractors took no precautions and expressed no fear when approaching a fellow contractor to rig a bid <em>(Id.), </em>(5) mutual and interdependent obligations were created between participating contractors <em>(Id.), </em>and (6) although witnesses denied that an agreement for a single conspiracy existed, the bid-rigging scheme was self-perpetuating in nature and could be \u201cplugged into\u201d at any time <em>(Id. </em>at 247).</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\">The district court further supported its decision with a detailed discussion of prior case law, particularly <em>United States v. Consolidated Packaging Corp., </em>575 F.2d 117 (7th Cir.1978). <em>See also United States v. Rodgers, </em>624 F.2d 1303 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 917, 101 S.Ct. 1360, 67 L.Ed.2d 342 (1981); <em>United States v. David E. Thompson, Inc., </em>621 F.2d 1147 (1st Cir.1980); <em>United States v. American Honda Motor Co., </em>271 F.Supp. 979 (N.D.Cal.1967); <em>United States v. H.E. Koontz Creamery, Inc., </em>257 F.Supp. 295 (D.Md.1966). In <em>Consolidated Packaging, </em>a one-count indictment charged twenty-three folding carton companies with engaging in a nation-wide price-fixing conspiracy. Consolidated, the only defendant company to go to trial, was convicted. The issues before the appellate court were (1) whether the government\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish one, nation-wide conspiracy and (2) whether the evidence showed that Consolidated was a participant in that conspiracy. 575 F.2d at 120. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to establish a single conspiracy, <em>id. </em>at 128, and that Consolidated was part of a conspiratorial agreement, although tacitly. <em>Id. </em>at 127. We agree with the district court that the circumstances of <em>Consolidated Packaging </em>are similar to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-10\">Although <em>Consolidated Packaging </em>did not involve a double jeopardy question, the case turned on the issue of whether there was one or several conspiracies. The evidence presented in both cases revealed (1) the existence of common bid-rigging jargon prevalent industry-wide, (2) the participants had no fear of initiating the setup of a bid, (3) the perpetual nature of the bid-rigging scheme, and (4) the existence of a tacit mutual understanding among competitors of a single, continuing conspiracy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>R., Vol. 2 at 254-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-12\">The government contends, however, that the evidence presented in this case estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>lished that the alleged bid-rigging actions pertaining to each project produced separate conspiracies involving separate agreements to rig particular projects let by the state on particular dates. <em>See Brief for Appellant United States of America </em>at 16, 18-20. Further, the government asserts that the evidence does not reveal any interdependence between participating contractors as a result of their actions on a particular rigged job. Because each job could be rigged only after individual negotiations at the time of the letting, the government argues essentially that the participating contractors would not usually base their decision to \u201cgo along\u201d with the rigging on the reliance of a future \u201cfavor\u201d from another contractor. Thus, the government concludes that there is not sufficient evidence of a single conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 18. These contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">First, the government appears to urge that a \u201cformal agreement\u201d to continue one overall scheme is necessary to prove that a single conspiracy existed. The government contends, of course, that there was no evidence of such an agreement\u2014 there was only evidence of \u201cletting-by-letting\u201d agreements. However, it is well settled that a formal agreement is not necessary to form a criminal conspiracy. <em>American Tobacco Co. v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 781, 809, 66 S.Ct. 1125, 1138, 90 L.Ed. 1575 (1946); <em>United States v. Zang, </em>703 F.2d 1186, 1191 (10th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 103, 78 L.Ed.2d 107; <em>Consolidated Packaging, supra </em>at 126. It is enough that the participating parties have a tacit understanding based upon a long course of conduct. <em>Direct Sales Co. v. United States, </em>319 U.S. 703, 714, 63 S.Ct. 1265, 1270, 87 L.Ed. 1674 (1943); <em>Consolidated Packaging, supra </em>at 126; <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>470 F.2d 121, 123 (7th Cir.1972). The evidence showed that asphalt contractors in Kansas understood for over twenty-five years that the ability to rig bids was available using the aforementioned method. There was, therefore, no lack of conspiratorial agreement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-10\">Second, the weight of the evidence in the record shows that a contractor would participate in a bid-rigging plan with the belief that future benefits of some kind would be returned to him. No matter what the specific reasons for participating were,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> they were always that a contractor would eventually benefit in some way \u2014 usually through another\u2019s cooperation with his desire to set up a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-11\">We hold that a review of the testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing reveals that a common objective was shared by each participating contractor: <em>to eliminate price competition and ensure higher individual profits. </em>Because a common objective between the contractors has been established in the record, that is sufficient for us to hold that a single conspiracy existed. We do not find any error in the findings of the district court; hence, there is substantial evidence in the record to support a finding of a single conspiracy. Beachner Co. was, therefore, indicted for the same offense in <em>Beachner II </em>that it had previously been acquitted of in <em>Beachner I.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>B. <em>The Mail Fraud Charges</em></p>\n<p id=\"Abu2\">The government contends that the district court erred by dismissing the entire indictment against Beachner Co. since such a decision improperly included the three counts of mail fraud. The essence of the government\u2019s argument is that even if each of the mailings derived from a single scheme to defraud, each mailing is a separate crime. <em>See Brief for Appellant United States of America </em>at 31-32 (citing <em>Badders v. United States, </em>240 U.S. 391, 394, 36 S.Ct. 367, 368, 60 L.Ed. 706 (1916); <em>United States v. Ledesma, </em>632 F.2d 670, 679 (7th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 998, 101 S.Ct. 539, 66 L.Ed.2d 296 (1980); <em>United States v. Clevenger, </em>458 F.Supp. 354, 359 (E.D.Tenn.1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">Beachner Co. initially asserts that because the government failed to raise this contention before the district court, the government waived its right to argue this in the first instance on appeal. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>525 F.2d 1308, 1310 (10th Cir.1975). Further, Beachner Co. contends that the \u201cplain error\u201d rule expressed in Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is not applicable to the government. Although we agree with Beacher Co.\u2019s contentions, we further hold that the alleged mail fraud actions were an integral part of the alleged bid-rigging scheme. Likewise, the mail fraud charges are encompassed in the Sherman Act bid-rigging conspiracy charges. The <em>Beacher I </em>and <em>Beachner II </em>indictments alleged that the scheme to defraud the State of Kansas included (1) Beachner Co.\u2019s submission of collusive bids to the state and (2) the fact that Beachner Co. caused a warrant for payment (check from the State of Kansas) to be delivered through the United States mail. Thus, in order for the government to prove the mail fraud charges made in <em>Beachner II, </em>it <em>must </em>also prove the conspiracy alleged in the Sherman Act counts in the same indictment. The district court, therefore, properly dismissed the entire <em>Beachner II </em>indictment on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1381-15\">. The indictment specifically charged the defendants (1) with entering into and engaging in a combination and conspiracy to suppress and eliminate competition for the construction of that project, and (2) with defrauding the State of Kansas and the United States by causing a warrant to be delivered through the United States mail as payment of the project. (R., Vol. 2 at 238-39.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1381-18\">. On March 2, 1982, Robert Beachner was again indicted for the same alleged offenses as detailed in the February 4 indictment. The government elected to proceed against Robert Beachner on the March 2 indictment and against Beachner Construction Co. on the February 4 indictment. <em>(Id. </em>at 239.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1381-19\">. The government also presented the evidence it proposed to use in the <em>Beachner II </em>trial to prove the charges alleged in the second indictment. This evidence consisted of grand jury testimony and affidavits relating to the alleged bid-rigging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>of the projects in Cowley County, Bourbon and Allen Counties, and in Neosho and Montgomery Counties. See <em>Brief for Appellant United States of America </em>at 4-7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1382-6\">. The term \"set up job\u201d means that the bids on a project were rigged by one contractor designated to submit a low bid and the other bidders would submit higher bids designed to insure that the low bidder would be awarded the job. (R., Vol. 6 at 61). The term \"comp bid\u201d or \"complementary bid\" means a bid submitted, not for the purpose of being awarded a job, but instead as a favor to other contractors to present a false impression of competition for the job. Thus, the \"set up\u201d contractor\u2019s bid would appear legitimate. (R., Vol. 6 at 69-70, 170 and 223).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1382-12\">. In its opening brief, the government urges that this \"incentive\u201d was more often the exception than the rule: \"generally, submission of a complementary bid was not contingent on any \u2018trade-off.\u2019\" <em>Brief for Appellant United States of America </em>at 9. Other reasons expressed by several witnesses for giving complementary bids included \u201cto keep the peace,\u201d or to protect one\u2019s \"home territory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1383-9\">. The underlying theory of this constitutional prohibition was expressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Green v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 187-88, 78 S.Ct. 221, 223-24, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-10\">[T]he State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1383-11\">. In <em>Wilshire, </em>the court held that the evidence supported the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that multiple conspiracies existed. Wilshire Oil Company had sold liquid asphalt to the State of Kansas while allegedly participating in a conspiracy to fix the price of such asphalt. <em>See United States v. Wilshire Oil Co. of Texas, </em>427 F.2d 969, 972 (10th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 829, 91 S.Ct. 58, 27 L.Ed.2d 59 (1970). The basis for Wilshire\u2019s double jeopardy contention was that it and other oil companies had been previously tried and convicted in another federal court for an asphalt conspiracy in Missouri. The <em>Wilshire </em>court rejected that contention, holding that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support a conclusion that there was no \"common objective\" between the participants in <em>both </em>states to fix prices of liquid asphalt in <em>Kansas. Id. </em>at 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-18\">The <em>Wilshire </em>court also noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the offenses charged in each case varied: the Missouri indictment charged the defendants with conspiring to \" \u2018suppress and eliminate competition in the sale of liquid asphalt,\u2019 \u201d but the Kansas indictment charged the defendants with conspiring \u201c \u2018to fix, maintain, and establish non-competitive prices for the sale of liquid asphalt.\u2019\" <em>Id. </em>at 975. This distinction was pointed out by the court in application of its holding that \"prosecution for one offense will not confer immunity from subsequent prosecutions of distinct, though related, offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is not a concern in the instant case; Beachner Co. was charged, in each indictment, with the same offenses \u2014 conspiracy to rig bidding of the asphalt aspect of state highway construction projects and mail fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1384-6\">. We are not persuaded by the government's attempts to distinguish <em>Consolidated Packaging </em>from the present case. Its arguments concerning the difference in the issues and the circumstances are without merit. Further, the government points to the following language in <em>Consolidated Packaging </em>which it feels \"supports\u201d its decision to prosecute participants for \"separate conspiracies\u201d <em>(See Brief for Appellant United States of America </em>at 28):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-7\">If the conspirators could make the conspiracy work and minimize price competition, all conspirators could expect a more profitable survival due to the artificially established higher prices. That to accomplish this, <em>there were spawned numerous other lesser conspiracies related to specific bids </em>does not create a variance.... <em>The government might also have proceeded piecemeal with numerous indictments against each conspirator alleging the lesser conspiracies.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-14\">575 F.2d at 128 (emphasis by government).</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-15\">Although it may be true that the above-quoted language supports the government\u2019s decision to prosecute \u201ceach\u201d participant by a piecemeal approach, this language does not (and no court could justifiably) support the government\u2019s attempt to prosecute \u201cone\u201d alleged participant <em>twice </em>for its actions within <em>one </em>conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">. <em>See supra </em>note 5 and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1385-8\">. The government moderately disputes the district court\u2019s decision regarding the bearer of the burden of proof in the double jeopardy evidentiary hearing. Following <em>United States v. Inmon, </em>568 F.2d 326, 332 (3d Cir.1977), <em>aff\u2019d on reh'g, </em>594 F.2d 352 (1979) and <em>United States v. Jabara, </em>644 F.2d 574, 576-77 (6th Cir.1981), the court found that the defendant has the initial burden to <em>produce </em>evidence of double jeopardy (advancement of a <em>prima facie </em>non-frivolous claim). If the defendant meets that requirement, the burden then shifts to the government <em>to persuade </em>the judge, by a preponderance of the evidence, of the existence of multiple conspiracies and thus no double jeopardy prohibition (R., Vol. 2 at 241). The government asserts that this was error since the law in this Circuit places the burden of <em>persuasion </em>on the <em>defendant. See Brief for Appellant United States of America </em>at 13 n. 9 (citing <em>United States v. Rumpf, </em>576 F.2d 818, 823 (10th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 893, 99 S.Ct. 251, 58 L.Ed.2d 239 (1979)). Alternatively, the government urges that the record nevertheless shows it met the burden placed upon it by the district court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Abo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>It is true that our cases seem to place the burden of persuasion on the party moving for dismissal based on double jeopardy. <em>See United States v. Rumpf, supra; United States v. Martinez, </em>562 F.2d 633, 638 (10th Cir.1977); <em>United States v. Wilshire Oil Co. of Texas, supra </em>at 976 n. 12. Even so, the record in this case shows, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a single conspiracy existed and, thus, Beachner Co. was entitled to a dismissal based on double jeopardy. This was the implicit finding of the district court when it determined that the government's evidence of multiple conspiracies did not \u201coutweigh\u201d Bechner Co.\u2019s evidence of one conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1386-18\">.
