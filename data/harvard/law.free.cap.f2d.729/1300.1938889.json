On October 31, 1983, 575 F.Supp. 552, following a bench trial, the district court entered a judgment in defendant\u2019s favor, and further stated that \u201cDefendant shall recover the costs of this action from plaintiffs.\u201d On November 10, plaintiffs timely moved the district court \u201cpursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\u201d to alter or amend the final judgment with respect to the allocation of costs. The plaintiffs argued first that it was improper to assess costs against passive members of the plaintiffs\u2019 class, insofar as they had not been put on notice that they were at risk of having costs assessed against them; and second, that it was inequitable to assess costs against any of the plaintiffs, active or passive. On November 20, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. On January 5, 1984, the district court undertook a \u201cclarifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>cation\u201d of its October 31 judgment, limiting liability for costs to the plaintiffs actively represented, and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion in all other respects. No further notice of appeal was filed by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-5\">Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits a litigant to move the court to alter or amend a judgment within ten days of the entry of judgment. Rule 4(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALei\">If a timely motion under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is filed in the district court by any party: ... under Rule 59 to alter or amend the judgment ... the time for appeal for all parties shall run from the entry of the order ... granting or denying any ... such motion. A notice of appeal filed before the disposition of any of the above motions shall have no effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1403-6\">The defendant argues that since plaintiffs\u2019 November 20 notice of appeal was filed before the January 5 disposition of their self-styled Rule 59 motion to alter or amend the judgment, the notice of appeal had no effect; and because no timely notice of appeal was filed within the required thirty days after the district court\u2019s resolution of the \u201cRule 59\u201d motion, defendant urges that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-7\">A motion respecting costs is not a motion to alter or amend a judgment under Rule 59. Rule 59 applies to motions for reconsideration of matters encompassed in a decision on the merits of the dispute, and not matters collateral to the merits. A motion for costs does not seek reconsideration of substantive issues resolved in the judgment, but relates exclusively to the collateral question of what is due because of the judgment. <em>Knighton v. Watkins, </em>616 F.2d 795, 797-98 (5th Cir.1980); <em>see also White v. New Hampshire Department of Employment Security, </em>455 U.S. 445, 450-56, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 1165-68, 71 L.Ed.2d 325, 330-34 (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1403-11\">Rules 54(d) and 58 are the applicable rules governing the allocation of costs. Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in part that \u201ccosts shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.\u201d It was therefore unnecessary for the court affirmatively to direct that the prevailing defendant be allowed costs. In its November 10 motion, the plaintiffs urged the district court to exercise its option under Rule 54(d) to direct that the prevailing party be allowed less than all costs. The finality of the judgment respecting the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 securities fraud action was not affected by the pendency of its motion concerning costs, for as Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides: \u201cEntry of the judgment shall not be delayed for the taxing of costs.\u201d There is no need to delay entry of judgment pending taxing of costs, since a motion to review taxation of costs may be passed upon by the district court while an appeal is pending. J. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 54.-77[9], 1753-54 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-12\">Whereas F.R.App.P. 4(a)(4) states that a notice of appeal is a nullity to the extent that it is filed when a Rule 59 motion is still pending, F.R.App.P. 4 does not nullify a notice of appeal filed prior to final resolution of matters pertaining exclusively to costs under Rules 54(d) and 58.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>quently, plaintiffs\u2019 notice of appeal must be deemed effective, notwithstanding that the plaintiffs characterized their motion as one filed pursuant to Rule 59, for we agree with a recent decision of the Ninth Circuit, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-4\">Though [defendant] styled its motion a Rule 59(e) motion, \u201cnomenclature is not controlling.\u201d [citation omitted]. The court will construe it, however styled, to be the type proper for the relief requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1404-5\"><em>Miller v. Transamerican Press, Inc., </em>709 F.2d 524, 527 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-6\">The motion to dismiss is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1403-8\">. The narrow issue in <em>White </em>was whether a motion for attorney\u2019s fees following judgment, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, constituted a Rule 59 motion to alter or amend the judgment. The Supreme Court held that it did not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1403-9\">The federal courts generally have invoked Rule 59(e) only to support reconsideration of matters properly emcompassed in a decision on the merits [citation omitted]. By contrast, a request for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 raises legal issues collateral to the main cause of <em>action </em>\u2014 issues <em>to which Rule 59(e) was never intended to apply.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1403-14\"><em>Id. </em>102 S.Ct. at 1166 (emphasis supplied). The Supreme Court\u2019s observations with respect to attorney\u2019s fees applies with equal if not greater force to costs, for costs must certainly be regarded as collateral to the main cause of action in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1403-15\">. By its terms, F.R.App.P. 4(a)(4) renders notice of appeal ineffective only insofar as the notice is filed before the disposition of any one of the following motions: for judgment under F.R.C.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>50(b); to amend or make additional findings of fact under F.R.C.P. 52(b); or for a new trial or to alter or amend the judgment under F.R.C.P. 59.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
