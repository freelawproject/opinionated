The court held that the debtor lacked \u201cstanding\u201d to challenge the constitutionality of Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-54-107 (Supp.1983) which prevented him from claiming specific federal exemptions provided for under the Bankruptcy Code. The direct appeal is brought pursuant to a stipulation by the parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-19\">We affirm the order of the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-20\">Leo Hinkson, the debtor and appellant herein, filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Colorado. In the petition, the debt- or claimed a number of exemptions. At issue here are a $50.00 United States Savings Bond, a federal tax refund of $788.27, and a state tax refund in the amount of $166.88. There is no dispute that these particular exemptions fall under the Code\u2019s provision in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d)(5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trustee, Jean Pfleiderer, objected to these claimed exemptions on the basis that Colorado had exercised its option under the Code to deny its residents the right to federal exemptions contained in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>The statutory authority for this \u201copt-out\u201d is contained in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-5\">Notwithstanding section 541 of this title, an individual debtor may exempt from the property of the estate <em>either </em>\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\">(1) property that is specified under subsection (d) of this section, <em>unless the State law that is applicable to the debt- or under paragraph 2(A) of this subsection specifically does not so authorize; </em>or in the alternative,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">(2) (A) any property that is exempt under Federal law, <em>other than subsection (d) </em>of this section, or State or local law that is applicable on the date of the filing of the petition at the place in which the debtor\u2019s domicile has been located for 180 days immediately preceding the date of the filing of the petition, or for a longer portion of such 180-day period than in any other place, (emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">It is clear that where a state has acted affirmatively, pursuant to the congressional grant contained in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(1), a debtor may not take advantage of the exemptions provided for under section 522(d) of the Code. <em>See First National Bank of Mobile v. Norris, </em>701 F.2d 902, 904 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Matter of Sullivan, </em>680 F.2d 1131, 1132 (7th Cir.1982); <em>Matter of Cannady, </em>653 F.2d 210, 214 (5th Cir.1981); <em>See generally </em>3 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 522.02 at 522-11 (15th ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">The Colorado general assembly has exercised its \u201cveto\u201d power over federal code exemptions contained in section 522(d). Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-54-107 (Supp.1983) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-10\">The exemptions provided in section 522(d) of the federal bankruptcy code of 1978 (Title 11 of the United States Code), as amended, are denied to residents of this state. Exemptions authorized to be claimed by residents of this state shall be limited to those exemptions expressly provided by the statutes of this state.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvG\">Colorado\u2019s decision to \u201copt-out\u201d of the section 522(d) exemptions activates the provisions of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(2A). The debt- or\u2019s alternative is limited to that section. Thus, the only exemptions which the debtor may claim are those available under state or local law or any property which is otherwise exempt by operation of federal law other than section 522(d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">The debtor attacks the whole of the Colorado statute, \u00a7 13-54-107, since, he claims, the provision in the second sentence of this two-sentence statute exceeds the authority invested by Congress upon the State of Colorado to deny certain exemptions to its residents. The claimed excess, says the debtor, offends Article VI, Clause 2 (the Supremacy Clause) of the United States Constitution and, therefore, the entire Colorado statute is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">In our opinion, we need not address the debtor\u2019s claim of unconstitutionality. We need not, therefore, decide the close question as to whether the second sentence of the Colorado statute refers only to Section 522(d) exemptions or whether its breadth is broader than this. This inquiry would take us into realms of legislative intent and statutory construction which need not be visited in this case. The thrust of debtor\u2019s argument need not be addressed for a sound and practical reason. No claim is made here that the exemptions claimed by debtor are exemptions denied him because these come within the ambit of the second sentence of the Colorado statute. The exemptions claimed by debtor are exemptions which, but for the denial in the first sentence of the Colorado statute, could be claimed under 11 U.S.C. Section 522(d). But these the Congress has authorized the State of Colorado to deny its residents and these the State of Colorado has denied. The debtor, therefore, does not have standing to question the constitutionality of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>part of a Colorado statute which does not affect him.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The question of standing is an aspect of justiciability as that term relates to the \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement of Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution. The Plaintiff's ability to demonstrate his or her standing in a particular case is a threshold requirement which empowers a federal court to adjudicate the dispute. <em>See City and County of Denver v. Matsch, </em>635 F.2d 804, 808 (10th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has recently clarified the nature of this Article III requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">[A]t an irreducible minimum, Art. Ill requires the party who invokes the court\u2019s authority to \u201cshow that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant,\u201d <em>Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, </em>441 U.S. 91, 99 [99 S.Ct. 1601, 1607, 60 L.Ed.2d 66] (1979), and that the injury \u201cfairly can be traced to the challenged action\u201d and \u201cis likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., </em>426 U.S. 26, 38, 41 [96 S.Ct. 1917, 1924, 1925, 48 L.Ed.2d 450] (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aay\"><em>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., </em>454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 758, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The standing requirement is rooted in the concern that the role of federal courts in a democratic society be properly limited, <em>See Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2205, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), and that the judicial process is addressed \u201cto questions presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution____\u201d <em>Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 95, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1950, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). Thus, the basic requirement of \u201c \u2018actual injury redressable by the Court\u2019 \u201d is intended to insure that \u201cthe legal questions presented to the court will be resolved, not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action.\u201d <em>Valley Forge, </em>454 U.S. at 472, 102 S.Ct. at 758; <em>See also Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">The \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d whether threatened or actual, must be personal to the plaintiff. <em>See Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 735, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 1366, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972); <em>United States v. SCRAP, </em>412 U.S. 669, 687, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 2416, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973); <em>Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, </em>441 U.S. 91, 99-100, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 1607-08, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979). \u201cAbstract injury is not enough.\u201d <em>O'Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 494, 94 S.Ct. 669, 675, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974). These considerations have moved the Supreme Court to note that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-12\">Embedded in the traditional rules governing constitutional adjudication is the principle that a person to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied will not be heard to challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others, in other situations not before the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABT\"><em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 610, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2915, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973) (citations omitted); <em>See also United States v. Maestas, </em>523 F.2d 316, 322 (10th Cir.1975). Those limited situations where a litigant's assertion of <em>jus tertii </em>standing may be permitted are inapplicable to this case. <em>See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. at 611, 93 S.Ct. at 2915; <em>Craig v. Boron, </em>429 U.S. 190, 193, 97 S.Ct. 451, 455, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">There is no question that the State of Colorado\u2019s decision to \u201copt-out\u201d from the exemptions contained in section 522(d) is within the contemplation of the Code. Nor is there any question that the exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>tions claimed by the debtor in this case fall under the provisions of section 522(d). The debtor has not sustained any cognizable injury by the operation of Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-54-107 (Supp.1983). The ambiguity contained in the second sentence of the Colorado statute \u2014 whether it precludes a debtor from claiming other federal, non-Code exemptions \u2014 has not operated to this debtor\u2019s detriment. \u201cIn order to challenge a statutory scheme, the challenger must show that he has been injured by it.\u201d <em>Savina Home Industries v. Secretary of Labor, </em>594 F.2d 1358, 1366 (10th Cir.1979). This remains true even if \u201cthe court\u2019s judgment may benefit others collaterally.\u201d <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. at 499, 95 S.Ct. at 2205.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The bankruptcy court correctly ascertained that the debtor could not claim his section 522(d) exemptions under Colorado law and that he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-54-107 (Supp.1983). The debtor has failed to demonstrate a \u201cpersonal stake in the outcome of the controversy,\u201d <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. at 204, 82 S.Ct. at 703 and, therefore, has no standing to invoke the power of a federal court through Article III.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-13\">.
