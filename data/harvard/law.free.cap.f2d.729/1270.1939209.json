The district court held that the statute was constitutionally valid. On appeal NGTF contends that the statute violates plaintiff\u2019s members\u2019 rights to privacy and equal protection, that it is void for vagueness, that it violates the Establishment Clause, and, finally, that it is over-broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-11\">The challenged statute, Okla.Stat. tit. 70, \u00a7 6-103.15, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-12\">\u201cA. As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-13\">1. \u2018Public homosexual activity\u2019 means the commission of an act defined in Section 886 of Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes, if such act is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-14\">a. committed with a person of the same sex, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-15\">b. indiscreet and not practiced in private;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-16\">2. \u2018Public homosexual conduct\u2019 means advocating, soliciting, imposing, encouraging or promoting public or private homosexual activity in a manner that creates a substantial risk that such conduct will come to the attention of school children or school employees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-17\">3. \u2018Teacher\u2019 means a person as defined in Section 1-116 of Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-18\">B. In addition to any ground set forth in Section 6-103 of Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes, a teacher, student teacher or a teachers\u2019 aide may be refused employment, or reemployment, dismissed, or suspended after a finding that the teacher or teachers\u2019 aide has:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-19\">1. Engaged in public homosexual conduct or activity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-20\">2. Has been rendered unfit, because of such conduct or activity, to hold a position as a teacher, student teacher or teachers\u2019 aide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-21\">C. The following factors shall be considered in making the determination whether the teacher, student teacher or teachers\u2019 aide has been rendered unfit for his position:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-22\">1. The likelihood that the activity or conduct may adversely affect students or school employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-23\">2. The proximity in time or place the activity or conduct to the teacher\u2019s, student teacher\u2019s or teachers\u2019 aide\u2019s official duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-24\">3. Any extenuating or aggravating circumstances; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-25\">4. Whether the conduct or activity is of a repeated or continuing nature which tends to encourage or dispose school children toward similar conduct or activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-26\">The trial court held that the statute reaches protected speech but upheld the constitutionality of the statute by reading a \u201cmaterial and substantial disruption\u201d test into it. We disagree. The statute proscribes protected speech and is thus facially overbroad, and we cannot read into the statute a \u201cmaterial and substantial disrup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>tion\u201d test. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">We see no constitutional problem in the statute\u2019s permitting a teacher to be fired for engaging in \u201cpublic homosexual activity.\u201d Section 6-103.15 defines \u201cpublic homosexual activity\u201d as the commission of an act defined in Okla.Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 886, that is committed with a person of the same sex and is indiscreet and not practiced in private. In support of their argument that this provision violates their members\u2019 right of privacy, plaintiff cites <em>Baker v. Wade, </em>553 F.Supp. 1121 (N.D.Tex.1982), and <em>New York v. Onofre, </em>51 N.Y.2d 476, 434 N.Y.S.2d 947, 415 N.E.2d 936 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 987, 101 S.Ct. 2323, 68 L.Ed.2d 845 (1981). Both of those cases held that the constitution protects consensual, noncommercial sexual acts in private between adults. <em>Baker </em>and <em>Onofre </em>are inapplicable to the instant case. Section 6-103.15 does not punish acts performed in private. Thus, the right of privacy, whatever its scope in regard to homosexual acts, is not implicated. <em>See Lovisi v. Slayton, </em>539 F.2d 349 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 977, 97 S.Ct. 485, 50 L.Ed.2d 585 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">The trial court correctly rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention that the Oklahoma statute is vague in regard to \u201cpublic homosexual activity.\u201d In <em>Village of Hoffman Estates v. The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982), the Court outlined the doctrines of facial overbreadth and vagueness. Regarding vagueness the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-8\">\u201cA law that does not reach constitutionally protected conduct and therefore satisfies the overbreadth test may nevertheless be challenged on its face as unduly vague, in violation of due process. To succeed, however, the complainant must demonstrate that the law is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-9\">455 U.S. at 497, 102 S.Ct. at 1193. Plaintiff makes no such showing. The Oklahoma cases construing the \u201ccrime against nature\u201d statute have clearly defined the acts that the statute proscribes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-10\">Plaintiff also argues that the statute violates its members\u2019 right to equal protection of the law. We cannot find that a classification based on the choice of sexual partners is suspect, especially since only four members of the Supreme Court have viewed gender as a suspect classification. <em>Frontiero v. Richardson, </em>411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973). <em>See also Baker v. Wade, </em>553 F.Supp. 1121, 1144 n. 58. Thus something less than a strict scrutiny test should be applied here. Surely a school may fire a teacher for engaging in an indiscreet public act of oral or anal intercourse. <em>See Amback v. Norwick, </em>441 U.S. 68, 80, 99 S.Ct. 1589, 1596, 60 L.Ed.2d 49 (1979). We also agree that the district court correctly rejected the Establishment Clause claim. <em>See Harris v. McCrae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 100 S.Ct. 2671, 65 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-12\">The part of \u00a7 6-103.15 that allows punishment of teachers for \u201cpublic homosexual conduct\u201d does present constitutional problems. To be sure, this is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>facial challenge, and facial challenges based on First Amendment overbreadth are \u201cstrong medicine\u201d and should be used \u201csparingly and only as a last resort.\u201d <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 613, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2916, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). Nonetheless, invalidation is an appropriate remedy in the instant case because this portion of \u00a7 6-103.15 is overbroad, is \u201cnot readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts,\u201d and \u201cits deterrent effect on legitimate expression is both real and substantial.\u201d <em>Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 216, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 2276, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975). Also, we must be especially willing to invalidate a statute for facial overbreadth when, as here, the statute regulates \u201cpure speech.\u201d <em>New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 772-773, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3362-3363, 70 L.Ed.2d 587 (U.S.1982); <em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 615, 93 S.Ct. at 2917.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">Section 6-103.15 allows punishment of teachers for \u201cpublic homosexual conduct,\u201d which is defined as \u201cadvocating, soliciting, imposing, encouraging or promoting public or private homosexual activity in a manner that creates a substantial risk that such conduct will come to the attention of school children or school employees.\u201d Okla.Stat. tit. 70, \u00a7 6-103.-15(A)(2). The First Amendment protects \u201cadvocacy\u201d even of illegal conduct except when \u201cadvocacy\u201d is \u201cdirected to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\u201d <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio, </em>395 U.S. 444, 447, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 1829, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969). The First Amendment does not permit someone to be punished for advocating illegal conduct at some indefinite future time. <em>Hess v. Indiana, </em>414 U.S. 105, 109, 94 S.Ct. 326, 329, 38 L.Ed.2d 303 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">\u201cEncouraging\u201d and \u201cpromoting,\u201d like \u201cadvocating,\u201d do not necessarily imply incitement to imminent action. A teacher who went before the Oklahoma legislature or appeared on television to urge the repeal of the Oklahoma anti-sodomy statute would be \u201cadvocating,\u201d \u201cpromoting,\u201d and \u201cencouraging\u201d homosexual sodomy and creating a substantial risk that his or her speech would come to the attention of school children or school employees if he or she said, \u201cI think it is psychologically damaging for people with homosexual desires to suppress those desires. They should act on those desires and should be legally free to do so.\u201d Such statements, which are aimed at legal and social change, are at the core of First Amendment protections. As in <em>Erznoznik, </em>the statute by its plain terms is not easily susceptible of a narrowing construction. The Oklahoma legislature chose the word \u201cadvocacy\u201d despite the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of that word in <em>Brandenburg. </em>Finally, the deterrent effect of \u00a7 6-103.15 is both real and substantial. It applies to all teachers, substitute teachers, and teachers aides in Oklahoma. To protect their jobs they must restrict their expression. <em>See Erznoznik, </em>422 U.S. at 217, 95 S.Ct. at 2276. Thus, the \u00a7 6-103.15 proscription of advocating, encouraging, or promoting homosexual activity is unconstitutionally overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">We recognize that a state has interests in regulating the speech of teachers that differ from its interests in regulating the speech of the general citizenry. <em>Pickering v. Board of Education, </em>391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1734, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). But a state\u2019s interests outweigh a teacher\u2019s interests only when the expression results in a material or substantial interference or disruption in the normal activities of the school. <em>See Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, </em>393 U.S. 503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). This Court has held that a teacher\u2019s First Amendment rights may be restricted only if \u201cthe employer shows that some restriction is necessary to prevent the disruption of official functions or to insure effective performance by the employee.\u201d <em>Childers v. Independent School District No. 1, </em>676 F.2d 1338, 1341 (10th Cir.1982). Defendant has made no such showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-8\">The statute declares that a teacher may be fired under \u00a7 6-103.15 only if there is a finding of \u201cunfitness\u201d and lists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>factors that are to be considered in determining \u201cunfitness\u201d: whether the activity or conduct is likely to adversely affect students or school employees; whether the activity or conduct is close in time or place to the teacher\u2019s, student teacher\u2019s or teachers aide\u2019s official duties; whether any extenuating or aggravating circumstances exist; and whether the conduct or activity is of a repeated or continuing nature which tends to encourage or dispose school children toward similar conduct or activity. An adverse effect on students or other employees is the only factor among those listed in \u00a7 6-103.15 that is even related to a material and substantial disruption. And although a material and substantial disruption is an adverse effect, many adverse effects are not material and substantial disruptions. The statute does not require that the teacher\u2019s public utterance occur in the classroom. Any public statement that would come to the attention of school children, their parents, or school employees that might lead someone to object to the teacher\u2019s social and political views would seem to justify a finding that the statement \u201cmay adversely affect\u201d students or school employees. The statute does not specify the weight to be given to any of the factors listed. An adverse effect is apparently not even a prerequisite to a finding of unfitness. A statute is saved from a challenge to its overbreadth only if it is \u201creadily subject\u201d to a narrowing construction. It is not within this Court\u2019s power to construe and narrow state statutes. <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 110, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2299, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). The unfitness requirement does not save \u00a7 6-103.15 from its unconstitutional over-breadth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">The parts of \u00a7 6-103.15 that deal with \u201cpublic homosexual conduct\u201d can be severed from the rest of the statute without creating a result that the legislature did not intend or contemplate. <em>See Tulsa Exposition and Fair Corp. v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>468 P.2d 501, 507 (Okl.1970); <em>see also Hejira Corp. v. MacFarlane, </em>660 F.2d 1356, 1362-63 (10th Cir.1981). We reverse the judgment of the district court, holding that the statute, insofar as it punishes \u201chomosexual conduct,\u201d as that phrase is defined in the statute to include \u201cadvocating ... encouraging or promoting public or private homosexual activity\u201d is unconstitutional. We also hold that the unconstitutional portion is severable from the part of the statute that proscribes \u201chomosexual activity,\u201d and we find that portion constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-7\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">. Section 886 provides: \"Every person who is guilty of the detestable and abominable crime against nature, committed with mankind or with a beast, is punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary not exceeding ten (10) years.\u201d The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has held that \u00a7 886 proscribes oral and anal copulation. <em>Berryman v. State, </em>283 P.2d 558, 563 (Okl.Cr.App.1955). In <em>Wainwright v. Stone, </em>414 U.S. 21, 94 S.Ct. 190, 38 L.Ed.2d 179 (1973), the Court held that an almost identical Florida statute was not unconstitutionally vague because the Florida courts had specified that the statute applied to oral and anal copulation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-14\">\"When a state statute has been construed to forbid identifiable conduct so that \u2018interpretation by [the state court] puts these words in the statute as definitely as if it had been so amended by the legislature,\u2019 claims of impermissible vagueness must be judged in that light.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-15\">414 U.S. at 23, 94 S.Ct. at 192, citing <em>Winters v.

The majority opinion renders the statute ineffective. It upholds the sanctions of the statute <em>only </em>if there is evidence proving that a teacher has engaged in \u201cpublic homosexual activity\u201d defined in 70 O.S. \u00a7 6-103.15(A.)(1.)(a.) and (b.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-10\">The \u201cpunishment\u201d referred to in the majority opinion which the majority holds may not be imposed on Oklahoma teachers is refusal of employment or reemployment, or dismissal or suspension <em>if </em>a teacher advocates, solicits, imposes, encourages or promotes \u201cPublic homosexual activity\u201d (which, by specific reference to the Oklahoma criminal code is distinctly identified as \u201cthe unnatural, perverse, detestable and abominable act of sodomy\u201d) in a manner that creates a substantial risk that such conduct will come to the attention of school children or school employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-11\">It is fundamental that state legislative bodies, in the exercise of state police power, may enact reasonable regulations in the interest of public health, safety, morals and welfare over persons within state limits. Oklahoma has, by enactment of the subject statute, endeavored to protect its school children and school employees from any teacher who advocates, solicits, encourages or promotes public or private <em>homosexual activity pinpointed as the commission of the unnatural and detestable act of sod</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number><em>omy. </em>21 Okla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 886 entitled \u201cCrime against nature\u201d provides: \u201cEvery person who is guilty of the detestable and abominable crime against nature, committed with mankind or with a beast, is punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary not exceeding ten (10) years.\u201d Oklahoma has held that this section is not unconstitutionally vague even though it is general in its terms and circumstances, inasmuch as the terms convey adequate description of prohibited act or conduct to persons of ordinary understanding. <em>Carson v. State, </em>529 P.2d 499 (Okl.Cr.1974); <em>Canfield v. State, </em>506 P.2d 987 (Okl.Cr.1973), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>414 U.S. 991, 94 S.Ct. 342, 38 L.Ed.2d 230 (1973), <em>rehearing denied, </em>414 U.S. 1138, 94 S.Ct. 884, 38 L.Ed.2d 763 (1973); <em>Moore v. State, </em>501 P.2d 529 (Okl.Cr.1972), cer<em>t. denied, </em>410 U.S. 987, 93 S.Ct. 1517, 36 L.Ed.2d 185 (1972). Oklahoma has clearly announced that the offense of sodomy is not to be countenanced within its borders. Federal courts should not function as superlegislatures in order to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations in areas that neither affect fundamental rights nor proceed along suspect lines. <em>City of New Orleans v. Dukes, </em>427 U.S. 297, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 2516, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">In <em>Wainwright v. Stone, </em>414 U.S. 21, 94 S.Ct. 190, 38 L.Ed.2d 179 (1973), the Supreme Court upheld a Florida statute which proscribed \u201cthe abominable and detestable crime against nature, either with mankind or with beast\u201d against a constitutional challenge of void for vagueness. The Fifth Circuit had held the statute infirm as unconstitutionally vague and void on its face for failure to give adequate notice of the conduct forbidden by law. In reversing, the Supreme Court observed that copulation per os and per anum had long been held by Florida courts violative of the challenged statute as the \u201cabominable and detestable\u201d crimes against nature referred to in the statute. Hence, the Supreme Court found that the statute was subject to a narrowing construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">The majority, unlike the district court, holds that portion of the statute which allows \u201cpunishment\u201d for teachers for advocating \u201cpublic homosexual conduct\u201d to be overbroad because it is \u201cnot readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts\u201d and \u201cits deterrent effect on legitimate expression is both real and substantial.\u201d I disagree. Sodomy is <em>malum in se, </em>i.e., immoral and corruptible in its nature without regard to the fact of its being noticed or punished by the law of the state. It is not <em>malum prohibitum, </em>i.e., wrong <em>only </em>because it is forbidden by law and not involving moral turpitude. It is on this principle that I must part with the majority\u2019s holding that the \u201cpublic homosexual conduct\u201d portion of the Oklahoma statute is overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-7\">Any teacher who advocates, solicits, encourages or promotes the practice of <em>sodomy </em>\u201cin a manner that creates a substantial risk that such conduct will come to the attention of school children or school employees\u201d is in fact and in truth <em>inciting </em>school children to participate in the abominable and detestable crime against nature. Such advocacy by school teachers, regardless of the situs where made, creates a substantial risk of being conveyed to school children. In my view, it does not merit any constitutional protection. There is no need to demonstrate that such conduct would bring about a material or substantial interference or disruption in the normal activities of the school. A teacher advocating the practice of sodomy to school children is without First Amendment protection. This statute furthers an important and substantial government interest, as determined by the Oklahoma legislature, unrelated to the suppression of free speech. The incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedom is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-8\"><em>Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, </em>393 U.S. 503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969) is a poor vehicle for the majority to rely upon. There, the Supreme Court simply held that school children opposed to the Vietnam conflict were protected under the First Amendment in their practice of wearing black arm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>bands in protest thereto, unless that conduct could be shown to substantially interfere or disrupt normal school activities. <em>Tinker </em>involved a symbolic demonstration involving a matter of national political significance. Political expression and association is at the very heart of the First Amendment. The advocacy of a practice as universally condemned as the crime of sodomy hardly qualifies as such. There is no need to establish that such advocacy will interfere, substantially or otherwise, in normal school activities. It is sufficient that such advocacy is advanced in a manner that creates a substantial risk that such conduct will encourage school children to commit the abominable crime against nature. This finds solid support in <em>Tinker, supra, </em>where the Court said \u201cFirst Amendment rights must always be applied \u2018in light of the special characteristics of the ... environment\u2019 in the particular case.\u201d 393 U.S. 503, 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-4\">The Oklahoma legislature has declared that the advocacy by teachers of homosexual acts to school children is a matter of statewide concern. The Oklahoma statute does not condemn or in anywise affect teachers, homosexual or otherwise, except to the extent of the non-advocacy restraint aimed at the protection of school children. It does not deny them any rights as human beings. To equate such \u201crestraint\u201d .on First Amendment speech with the <em>Tinker </em>armband display and to require proof that advocacy of the act of sodomy will substantially interfere or disrupt normal school activities is a bow to permissiveness. To the same extent, the advocacy of violence, sabotage and terrorism as a means of effecting political reform held in <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio, </em>395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969) to be protected speech unless demonstrated as directed to and likely to incite or produce such action <em>did not </em>involve advocacy of a crime <em>malum in se </em>to school children by a school teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">Facial overbreadth challenges are \u201cmanifestly strong medicine\u201d which must be employed \u201csparingly and only as a last resort.\u201d <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 613, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2916, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). When a party asserts such a challenge, the overbreadth \u201cmust not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615, 93 S.Ct. at 2917. A statute\u2019s \u201cplainly legitimate sweep\u201d usually includes \u201ccontrols over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A broadly-worded statute which does deter some protected speech or conduct may not require invalidation if that deterrence can, with confidence, justify such action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">In <em>Keyishian v. Board of Regents, </em>385 U.S. 589, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967), the Supreme Court set down its initial guidelines for determining when deterrence of speech or conduct does or does not justify invalidation of a statute. The Court held that a statute is overbroad if it proscribes speech or conduct which \u201cmerely advocates the doctrine in the abstract without any attempt to indoctrinate others, or incite others to action in furtherance of unlawful aims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599-600, 87 S.Ct. at 681-682. The Court drew a distinction between speech or conduct advocating an abstract doctrine or belief, which demands constitutional protection, and advocacy of unlawful action or acts, with the intent to incite, which deserves no such protection. <em>See also Communist Party of Indiana v. Whitcomb, </em>414 U.S. 441, 444, 94 S.Ct. 656, 659, 38 L.Ed.2d 635 (1974); <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio, supra; Yates v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 298, 318-27, 77 S.Ct. 1064, 1076-1081, 1 L.Ed.2d 1356 (1956). I submit that in the context of the Oklahoma public school system, the advocacy of sodomy by a teacher in a manner \u201cthat creates a substantial risk\u201d it will come to the attention of school children deserves no First Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-8\">There is nothing abstract about a teacher advocating to school children the commission of the criminal act proscribed by section 886, <em>supra. </em>The expression proscribed by \u00a7 6-103.15 is the advocacy of the commission of the very act held to be a criminal act in <em>Canfield. </em>Thus, the deterred speech or conduct concerns \u201cadvocating,\u201d \u201cpro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>moting\u201d and \u201cencouraging\u201d school children to commit the crime of sodomy. In the context of the public school system involving the teacher-student relationship, it cannot be said that the advocacy of such action is mere advocacy of an abstract doctrine or belief. <em>See Keyishian, supra </em>385 U.S. at 599-600, 87 S.Ct. at 681-682. To hold otherwise ignores the difference between children and adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
