CAMPBELL, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">Antonio O\u2019Neill, plaintiff trustee of the debtor, Caceres &amp; Johnson, appeals from summary judgment in favor of defendants, Nestle Libbys and Fruit Nectars. The dispute centers on two checks issued and delivered by the debtor on August 29, 1981, less than 90 days prior to filing its bankruptcy petition. One check was issued to defendant Nestle Libbys as payment for goods delivered on July 15, 1981; the cheek was honored on September 25, 1981. The other check was issued to defendant Fruit Nectars as payment for goods also received on July 15,1981; the check was honored on September 14, 1981. The debtor filed a Chapter 11 petition on October 13, 1981, which was converted to a Chapter 7 petition on January 25, 1982. The trustee subsequently filed complaints against the defendants seeking to avoid the two payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">Section 547(b) of the Bankruptcy Act allows a trustee to avoid transfers of property made \u201con or within 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition.\u201d Although the two checks were issued less than 90 days prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 petition, the defendants invoked one of the exceptions to the trustee\u2019s power to avoid transfers. Section 547(c) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-14\">The trustee may not avoid under this section a transfer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-16\">(1) to the extent that such transfer was</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-17\">(A) intended by the debtor and the creditor to or for whose benefit such transfer was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-18\">(B) in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-19\">(2) to the extent that such transfer was</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-20\">(A) in payment of a debt incurred in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-21\">(B) <em>made not later than 45 days after such debt was incurred;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-22\">(C) made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-23\">(D) made according to ordinary business terms____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-24\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(c) (emphasis added). Defendants claimed coverage under the section 547(c)(2) exception. The trustee admitted that the checks were issued in the ordinary course of business and that the checks were delivered to the payee within 45 days after the debts were incurred. But he asserted that a \u201ctransfer\u201d under section 547(c)(2) occurs only when a bank honors a check, not when the check is delivered. Under this interpretation neither payment would satisfy the 45-day requirement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>thus could be avoided by the trustee. The bankruptcy court rejected the construction urged by the trustee and granted summary judgment for defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Since the plain language of the section does not resolve the present dispute, we turn to the legislative history of the statute. In discussing subsection 547(c), the Senate Report states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">The first exception is for a transfer that was intended by all parties to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value, and was in fact substantially contemporaneous. Normally, a check is a credit transaction. However, for purposes of this paragraph, a transfer involving a check is considered to be \u201cintended to be contemporaneous,\u201d and if the check is presented for payment in the normal course of affairs, which the Uniform Commercial Code specifies as 30 days, U.C.C. \u00a7 3-503(2)(a), that will amount to a transfer that is \u201cin fact substantially contemporaneous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">The second exception protects transfers in the ordinary .course of business (or financial affairs, where a business is not involved) transfers. For the case of a consumer, the paragraph uses the phrase \u201cfinancial affairs\u201d to include such non-business activities as payment of monthly utility bills____ The purpose of this exception is to leave undisturbed normal financial relations, because it does not detract from the general policy of the preference section to discourage unusual action by either the debtor or his creditors during the debtor\u2019s slide into bankruptcy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 88, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 5874. <em>See also </em>H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 373, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5963, 6329.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">Unlike the discussion of the first exception, the discussion of the second exception does not state that a check is to be treated as cash. The trustee would have us interpret this silence as evidencing an intent to apply a credit transaction approach to section 547(c)(2), namely, that a transfer by check is only made when the drawee bank honors the check. The trustee has not pointed to any reason for making such a distinction between the two exceptions. Indeed, since both exceptions cover transfers made in the normal course of a debtor\u2019s business or financial affairs, we think it appropriate to apply the same interpretation to both. <em>Fortin v. Marshall, </em>608 F.2d 525, 528 (1st Cir.1979); <em>Commissioner v. Estate of Ridgeway, </em>291 F.2d 257, 259 (3d Cir.1961). This approach is bolstered by statements in the legislative debates on the Bankruptcy Reform Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-12\">Payment is considered to be made when the check is delivered for purposes of Sections 547(1) and (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">124 Cong.Rec. S17414 (daily ed. Oct. 6, 1978) (statement of Sen. DeConcini); 124 Cong.Rec. H11097 (daily ed. Sept. 28, 1978) (statement of Rep. Edwards). <em>See also Shamrock Golf Co. v. Richcraft, Inc., </em>680 F.2d 645 (9th Cir.1982); 2 Norton, <em>Bankruptcy Law &amp; Practice </em>\u00a7 32.15 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-16\">This construction of the second exception is confirmed by the purpose underlying section 547. The trustee\u2019s power to avoid transfers is intended to discourage creditors from racing to the courthouse to dismember a failing debtor, thus enabling the debtor to solve its difficult financial situation. H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 177-78, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5963, 6138. The section 547(c)(1) and (2) exceptions further the goal of enabling debtors to rehabilitate themselves by insulating normal business transactions from the trustee\u2019s avoidance power. Without these exceptions creditors would be reluctant to conduct business with a struggling enterprise for fear that any payments made by the debtor could later be avoided. A crabbed reading of the section 547(c)(2) exception would only undermine this beneficial purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-17\">To treat checks as cash payments is also to construe section 547(c)(2) in accord with commercial reality. Since checks are normally considered present payments between parties, <em>Engstrom v. Wiley, </em>191 F.2d 684 (9th Cir.1951), the <em>delivery </em>of a check should supply the time of transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>under section 547(c)(2). The 45-day period of section 547(c)(2) accommodates the monthly billing practice of most businesses. If checks were deemed transfers only when honored, the time necessary for cashing and collection of a check would compress the time available for making payments so as to substantially impair the usefulness of the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The trustee contends that section 547(e)(1)(B) supports his position. That subsection, however, deals with the perfection of security interests in the debtor\u2019s property. As here the defendants did not take the debtor\u2019s checks as security, the provisions in section 547(e) are inapplicable. <em>But see In re Supermarket Distributors Corp., </em>25 B.R. 63, 9 Bankr.Ct.Dec. (CRR) 1155 (Bkrtcy.D.Mass.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The checks in question were presented for payment within the 30-day period deemed reasonable under the U.C.C. and were duly honored by the drawee bank. We therefore hold that the date of delivery of the checks was the date of transfer for the purpose of section 547(c)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-18\">. An argument can be made that a check dishonored by the drawee bank would not be a transfer \"made according to ordinary business terms\u201d and therefore would not satisfy section 547(c)(2). Because both checks were honored in the present case we need not consider the effect of dishonor on the applicability of section 547(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
