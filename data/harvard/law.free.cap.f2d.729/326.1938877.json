BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b429-17\">The appeal today is significant in two respects: for the facts presented, and for those left unsaid. Briefly, this case involves a suit brought by the wife of a deceased serviceman (plaintiff), individually and as a representative of their minor child and the estate, against the United States for its part in her husband\u2019s death. The Government moved to dismiss the claims as barred under <em>Feres v. United States, </em>and the District Court granted the motion. On the facts which we have, and applying clear and recent precedent, we in large part affirm that action. More important, however, is what we do not have. Specifically, because we find that under her complaint plaintiff could prove a separate tort committed after the serviceman was discharged from the military, we reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-20\">In June 1981, Lannie L. Jones was a 36 year old member of the United States Air Force stationed at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio, Texas. On the 15th of that month, Jones was injured when the motorcycle he was driving struck a dog and he was thrown to the ground. He was off the military base and \u201con pass\u201d at the time of the accident. Jones was taken to the emergency room at Wilford Hall Medical Center \u2014 a military hospital on the base, admitted, and treated. Several weeks later while still at the hospital, Jones died.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-21\">Plaintiff filed an administrative claim with the Air Force for damages from Jones\u2019 death, which claim was denied. She then filed suit in federal court under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) &amp; 2671-2680, a statute which, generally waives the immunity of the United States for injury resulting from its or its employees\u2019 negligence, and under Texas survival and wrongful death law. Plaintiff asserted that Jones was negligently diagnosed and treated at the military hospital, resulting in his death on July 20, 1981. She also claimed that at a certain point during the period of his treatment \u2014 on July 18, 1981 \u2014 Jones was discharged from the military.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The Government answered and moved to dismiss, asserting that <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950), barred the plaintiffs action for damages. The District Court agreed and dismissed the suit. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">We need not attempt here to recount the undulant development of the so-called <em>Feres </em>doctrine. It suffices that because of this judicially-created doctrine, the Government is not liable under the FTCA for injury to members of the armed forces arising out of or occurring in the course of activity incident to their military service. <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 146, 71 S.Ct. 153, 159, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950). <em>See also Warner v. United States, </em>720 F.2d 837, 838 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Gaspard v. United States, </em>713 F.2d 1097, 1100 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">It is clear that plaintiff complains mainly about the negligent care and treatment of her husband by the doctors and staff of the military hospital. This Court has long considered medical malpractice suits brought by servicemen or their representatives to fall squarely within the scope of the <em>Feres </em>doctrine. <em>See Scales v. United States, </em>685 F.2d 970, 973 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 1772, 76 L.Ed.2d 344 (1983); <em>Stanley v. Central Intelligence Agency, </em>639 F.2d 1146, 1150 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>631 F.2d 34, 36 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1018, 101 S.Ct. 3007, 69 L.Ed.2d 389 (1981); <em>Vallance v. United States, </em>574 F.2d 1282, 1283 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 965, 99 S.Ct. 453, 58 L.Ed.2d 423 (1978); <em>Lowe v. United States, </em>440 F.2d 452, 452-53 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 833, 92 S.Ct. 83, 30 L.Ed.2d 64 (1971); <em>Shults v. United States, </em>421 F.2d 170, 171-72 (5th Cir.1969). Plaintiff, however, urges that Jones was \u201con pass\u201d when his accident occurred, and that he remained \u201con pass\u201d throughout his medical treatment. She says that because of this otherwise unexplained status he falls outside the reach of <em>Feres, </em>citing <em>Parker v. United States, </em>611 F.2d 1007 (5th Cir.1980) (serviceman injured-while on 4-day leave allowed FTCA claim), and <em>Brooks v. United States, </em>337 U.S. 49, 69 S.Ct. 918, 93 L.Ed. 1200 (1949) (serviceman injured while on furlough allowed FTCA claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">Plaintiff misinterprets the law. In applying <em>Feres </em>to suits for medical malpractice, this Court has normally looked only to whether the serviceman was a member of the armed forces on \u201cactive duty\u201d at the time of the asserted improper medical treatment. <em>See Scales v. United States, </em>685 F.2d 970, 973 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 1772, 76 L.Ed.2d 344 (1983) (child has no FTCA claim for its prenatal injury resulting from asserted negligent medical treatment of mother while she was on active duty); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>631 F.2d 34, 36 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1018, 101 S.Ct. 3007, 69 L.Ed.2d 389 (1981) (no FTCA claim for asserted negligent release from military hospital of mentally ill serviceman, where he had not been discharged from the military); <em>Vallance v. United States, </em>574 F.2d 1282, 1283 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 965, 99 S.Ct. 453, 58 L.Ed.2d 423 (1978) (no FTCA claim for asserted negligent diagnosis and treatment by military hospital staff of naval officer on active duty); <em>Lowe v. United States, </em>440 F.2d 452, 452-53 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 833, 92 S.Ct. 83, 30 L.Ed.2d 64 (1971) (no FTCA claim for asserted malpractice in performance of elective surgery at military hospital on serviceman, two months before the end of his enlistment); <em>Shults v. United States, </em>421 F.2d 170, 171-72 (5th Cir.1969) (no FTCA claim for asserted malpractice in treatment at military hospital of sailor injured on 48-hour pass but while still on active status).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\"><em>Shults </em>is a good example of this general requirement. There, a serviceman was struck by an automobile while on 48-hour \u201cliberty,\u201d a leave that was never formally cancelled during the period of his assertedly negligent medical treatment. Nonetheless, this Court rejected an FTCA suit on his behalf, observing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>it is obvious that the injured man could not have been admitted, and would not have been admitted, to the Naval Hospital except for his military status. He was there treated by Naval medical personnel solely because of that status. It inescapably follows that whatever happened to him in that hospital during the course of that treatment had to be \u2018in the course of activity incident to service\u2019.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afh\"><em>Id. </em>at 170-72. As we later remarked, \u201c[wjith active military status, Shults would have remained in the service had he recovered.\u201d <em>Bankston v. United States, </em>480 F.2d 495, 496 (5th Cir.1973). Thus, it is the \u201cactive\u201d military status of the serviceman that usually has been the controlling element in barring military medical malpractice suits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Not surprisingly, the precise nature of \u201cactive\u201d status for servicemen is not always clear. In one setting, we have stated that one who has not been discharged (i.e., received his discharge papers) is still a member of the armed forces on active duty. <em>Garrett v. United States, </em>627 F.2d 712, 713 (5th Cir.1980) (no FTCA suit for asserted negligent and illegal detainer of serviceman for two months between the expiration of his enlistment and his formal discharge).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In the context of a medical malpractice case, however, we recently held that the lack of a formal discharge does not <em>per se </em>require a finding that the plaintiff was on \u201cactive\u201d military duty. <em>Adams v. United States, </em>728 F.2d 736, 739 (5th Cir.1984). There, we clarified the application of the three factors in <em>Parker v. United States, </em>611 F.2d 1007 (5th Cir.1980), for making the \u201cincident to military service\u201d determination under <em>Feres </em>\u2014 the duty status of the serviceman, the site of injury, and the activity of the serviceman at the time of injury \u2014 in medical malpractice cases. We pointed out that \u201c[wjhile no single factor is necessarily dispositive, ... the duty status of the service member is usually considered the most indicative of the nature of the nexus between him and the government at the time of injury and is therefore the most important factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The injured serviceman in <em>Adams </em>had been court-martialed several years before he sought treatment at the public service hospital, and all that remained for his formal discharge was for him to report to military authorities. Since \u201c[t]he Army had discharged [the injured man] to the full extent of its ability to do so\u201d prior to the asserted malpractice causing the injury, suit under the FTCA was not barred by <em>Feres. Id. </em>at 739. We went on to explain that in medical malpractice cases the remaining two factors \u2014 site of injury (i.e., a military or government hospital) and activity of serviceman at time of injury \u2014 are \u201cessentially subsumed into the inquiry as to his duty status at the time he sought treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740-741 <em>See also Bankston v. United States, </em>480 F.2d 495, 497-98 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Be that as it may, plaintiff makes no contention that Jones was practically or legally discharged from the Air Force when the asserted improper diagnosis and treatment occurred. In fact, her claim that Jones was \u201con pass\u201d throughout most of this medical care and then discharged on July 18 concedes his active duty status. Consequently, Jones\u2019 \u201cpass\u201d status before being admitted into and while at the military hospital in no way pretermits the application of the <em>Feres </em>doctrine to plaintiff\u2019s claims of medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s suit on Jones\u2019 behalf thus was correctly dismissed by the District Court. Likewise, <em>Feres </em>bars plaintiff\u2019s claims on her own behalf and for her and Jones\u2019 child. As we stated in <em>Gaspard v. United States, </em>713 F.2d 1097 (5th Cir.1983),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-12\">FTCA relief is not available to family members for claims based on the injuries to their relatives in the armed forces. This is true even when the claims of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>family members are independent of the serviceman\u2019s cause of action under applicable state law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\">... We see no distinction between pendent and independent claims in this regard \u2014 we need look only to the factual elements underlying the claim to find them barred under the <em>Feres </em>doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABt\"><em>Id. </em>at 1102 (citations omitted); <em>see also id. </em>at 1101-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">These conclusions do not dispose of this case, however. In responding to the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, plaintiff significantly clarified her suit. She asserted that Jones was injured at two separate times by two distinct torts. First, she claimed that, when Jones was \u201con pass,\u201d his injuries from the motorcycle accident were wrongly diagnosed and treated. We have held that this claim (and any claim dependent on it) is <em>Feres </em>-barred. In addition, however, she contended that Jones was injured in a different way at a time when he was no longer in the military. We have already stated that plaintiff claimed that the Air Force discharged Jones on July 18, 1981, about a month after his motorcycle accident and while he was still in the hospital. She further asserted that two days later, on July 20,1981, a doctor at the military hospital negligently ended Jones\u2019 life by turning off his oxygen and life support system \u2014 an act distinct from the assertedly negligent diagnosis and treatment given him at the hospital. Concluding that Jones was a civilian (albeit a veteran) when the doctor wrongly ended his life, she reasoned that <em>Feres </em>was inapposite. <em>See supra, </em>n. 1. The District Court rejected this argument without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The Government now seeks to rebut the plaintiff\u2019s contentions in maintaining that her complaint on its face does not allege such separate torts. The Government seems to concede that Jones was discharged on July 18, 1981. However, it emphasizes that plaintiff\u2019s pleadings can only be read to allege the single tort of medical malpractice, a tort which began when Jones was on active duty, which continued beyond his discharge, and which culminated in his death. Such a continuing tort, the Government argues, is wholly precluded by <em>Feres.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Clearly, <em>Feres </em>bars plaintiff\u2019s FTCA suit for the asserted negligent medical treatment which continued beyond July 18, 1981, when Jones apparently became a civilian. <em>See Gaspard v. United States, </em>713 F.2d 1097, 1100-01 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Stanley v. Central Intelligence Agency, </em>639 F.2d 1146, 1153-56 (5th Cir.1981). Notwithstanding that, plaintiff argues for what could be a separate tort committed during the post-discharge period.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">We must determine whether this allegation can be read from plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Of course, we apply the test of <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957), in scrutinizing pleadings on a motion to dismiss. It must appear beyond doubt that plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of her claim which would entitle her to relief. <em>Id. </em>at 45-46, 78 S.Ct. at 101-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">At this point, we reiterate what this Court stated over 17 years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-12\">The Trial Court [has] forgot[ten] the lesson so often brought home by us that at this day and time dismissal of a claim\u2014 land-based, waterborne, amphibious, equitable, legal, maritime, or an ambiguous, amphibious mixture of all of them, on the basis of the barebone pleadings is a precarious one with a high mortality rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-13\"><em>Barber v. Motor Vessel \u201cBLUE CAT\u201d, </em>372 F.2d 626, 627 (5th Cir.1967) (citations and footnote omitted). In the interest of long-term judicial economy and simply as a matter of good practice, this Court has consistently urged trial courts to pause long, before granting motions to dismiss on the face of the pleadings. Here, the Government gave its all-too-reflex cry of \u201cNo claim!\u201d and convinced the District Court. Now it presents the case to this Court for resolution on, not crystalline facts quarried from affidavits, depositions, or interrogato<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ries, but merely the broad exhortations of the plaintiffs lawyer. As so often, we are thus presented with just flour and fruit and asked to judge the pie; only seeds and soil, so to rate the harvest.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Under the nonformalistic standard of <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>we find that the Trial Court erred in dismissing all of plaintiff\u2019s suit. No doubt, plaintiff could have been infinitely more specific in drafting her complaint. Courts, however, look not for an annotated synthesis of a case, rather only for its outline, in adjudging the adequacy of pleadings. This complaint can fairly be read to include the claim of a discrete, post-discharge tort by one of Jones\u2019 doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Thus, we generally AFFIRM the action of the District Court, but REVERSE the dismissal of one important part of this suit. We REMAND plaintiff\u2019s FTCA and state claims based on the asserted separate post-discharge tort \u2014 and only those claims \u2014 to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\">. Of course, we do not deal here with an FTCA suit which may be brought by a veteran for medical malpractice occurring after discharge. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </em>348 U.S. 110, 75 S.Ct. 141, 99 L.Ed. 139 (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
