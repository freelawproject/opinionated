The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-10\">The plaintiff, Jay Hans Vest (Vest), appeals from an order of the district court dismissing with prejudice his action against the defendant-appellees (appellees) on the basis that, as a federal employee subject to Civil Service, he may not bring a direct constitutional cause of action against his supervisors, the appellees, because of a personnel decision they had made. Vest brought this action pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the appellees conspired to improperly discharge him in retaliation for his public comments regarding improprieties within the Rock Springs, Wyoming, District Office of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Because a <em>Bivens </em>action may not be maintained by a federal employee against his supervisors concerning personnel actions, we hold that the district court properly dismissed this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-14\">Vest, initially employed with the BLM in October of 1974, was assigned to the Rock Springs BLM Office in April of 1979. Vest alleges that shortly after November of 1979, he was subjected to harassment by his BLM supervisors. Such harassment, allegedly intended to force Vest from his position with the BLM, consisted of appellee Donald H. Sweep improperly relieving Vest of certain duties (preparation of wilderness intensive inventory reports) and Sweep\u2019s refusal to release for public review certain wilderness inventory reports submitted by Vest. Shortly thereafter, Vest informed the local press of his belief that the actions taken by Sweep were improper under BLM directives. Subsequently, Vest\u2019s comments were published through several newspaper articles which were circulated throughout the State of Wyoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-15\">Approximately eight days after Vest spoke with the press, the BLM notified him of a proposal it had made that he be suspended for fourteen days based upon certain incidents unrelated to his public criticisms of the office. Vest\u2019s appeal of the suspension was denied; the suspension became effective on March 3, 1980. On or about July 11, 1980, Vest was notified of a proposal to remove him from his BLM position. The BLM\u2019s reasons for removal were (1) failure to meet deadlines, (2) failure to produce acceptable work products, (3) failure to follow supervisor\u2019s orders, and (4) failure to follow safety rules. Vest contends the actual reason for his removal was the adverse comments he made to the press. On or about September 5, 1980, Vest was removed from his position with the BLM. Vest appealed this decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) and that Board\u2019s Office of Special Counsel. The Office of Special Counsel reviewed the situation and found no grounds warranting its intervention. On January 23, 1981, after a hearing had been held, the hearing examiner for the Board rendered an initial decision upholding Vest\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>Although the Board\u2019s decision informed Vest of his right to an administrative appeal of the ruling, he chose to forego that review. Thus, pursuant to the regulations of the Board, the initial decision became final. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.113 (1983). Vest then elected not to pursue the available judicial review procedures. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703 (1982). Vest subsequently filed the present action in federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">Subsequent to the district court\u2019s decision in the instant case, the Supreme Court addressed the very issue decided by the district court and before us on appeal. <em>See Bush v. Lucas, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (U.S.1983). We hold that the <em>Bush </em>decision is dispositive of the question before us. The facts of <em>Bush </em>are substantially similar to the present action in that the plaintiff alleged his discharge was in retaliation for exercising his right to free speech. Further, the question before the Court was whether the plaintiff-employee could bring a direct judicial action under <em>Bivens, </em>or whether, to recover for any injury he sustained, he must follow the government\u2019s comprehensive scheme of review regarding personnel actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court held that \u201c[bjecause such claims arise out of an employment relationship that is governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions giving meaningful remedies against the United States, we conclude that it would be inappropriate for us to supplement that regulatory scheme with a new judicial remedy.\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 2405.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-7\">In reaching this decision, the Supreme Court reiterated its previous holding that a <em>Bivens </em>action could not be maintained if either one of two situations was present: 1) there exist \u201cspecial factors counselling hesitation\u201d of a court to create such an action; and 2) there exists an \u201cexplicit congressional declaration\u201d foreclosing the money damages claim and requiring the action to be \u201cremitted to another remedy.\u201d <em>Carlson v. Green, </em>446 U.S. 14, 18-19 and n. 5, 100 S.Ct. 1468, 1471-1472 n. 5, 64 L.Ed.2d 15 (1980); <em>Bivens, supra </em>403 U.S. at 396-97, 91 S.Ct. at 2004-05. Although the <em>Bush </em>Court held that there was no congressional directive expressly denying Bush the judicial remedy he sought, there did exist \u201cspecial factors counselling hesitation.\u201d These special factors include the unique status of government employment and the existence of an elaborate, comprehensive statutory scheme which provides meaningful remedies for civil servants unfairly disciplined for making critical comments about their agencies. 103 S.Ct. at 2411, 4758. <em>See also </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7501-7543, 7701-7703 (1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <em>Bush </em>Court concluded that Congress had paid \u201ccareful attention to conflicting policy considerations\u201d when it enacted this review scheme; hence, Congress was in a better position than a court to decide if the public interest would best be served by creating a new species of litigation in the federal employment sector. 103 S.Ct. at 2417-2418.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-11\">The nature of Vest\u2019s claim and his federal employment demand that this case be controlled by <em>Bush. </em>Under the <em>Bush </em>mandate, Vest, a civil servant, must rely exclusively on the remedies available to him under the comprehensive statutory scheme devised by Congress. This scheme includes a direct judicial appeal from the Board\u2019s final decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703 (1982). We hold that the district court properly dismissed Vest\u2019s action because the presence of such a corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>prehensive statutory scheme to review certain federal personnel actions precludes a direct <em>Bivens </em>suit by a federal employee against his federal supervisors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">WE AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1388-8\">. The primary difference between this case and <em>Bush </em>is that Vest failed to pursue the administrative remedies available to him under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7501-7543, 7701-7703 (1982). In <em>Bush, </em>however, the plaintiff's administrative appeal was in process at the time he filed the <em>Bivens </em>action. We must note, however, that in the present action we are not concerned with the question of whether Vest properly \"exhausted his administrative remedies\u201d and, thus, whether we have before us a <em>final </em>administrative action ripe for judicial review. Our holding, as did the <em>Bush </em>Court\u2019s holding, merely deals with the availability of a <em>Bivens </em>action under the circumstances before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1388-13\">. See generally <em>Bush v. </em>Lucas,-U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (U.S.1983) for a detailed discussion of this statutory scheme and its history.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1389-14\">. Justice Marshall, in a concurring opinion in <em>Bush </em>in which he was joined by Justice Black-mun, noted that a federal employee may still pursue a <em>Bivens </em>remedy if his injury is not attributable to \"personnel actions\" covered by the federal scheme in question. <em>Id. </em>at 2418 (Marshall, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
