The defendant-appellant filed a motion for removal to federal court and the appellee responded with a motion to remand for lack of federal jurisdiction. The district court granted the motion to remand, from which order the appellant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-23\">The appellee\u2019s main argument on appeal is that under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) this court is without jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Section 1447(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-24\">An order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed pursuant to \u00a7 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1394-25\">The Supreme Court in <em>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976) held that \u00a7 1447(d) bars review of a remand order only if the district court\u2019s basis for remand was \u00a7 1447(c), which requires a remand if \u201cit appears that the case was removed improvidently and without juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>diction ____\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). <em>See also Gravitt v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, </em>430 U.S. 723, 97 S.Ct. 1439, 52 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977). If the lower court acted on the basis of \u00a7 1447(c), review is barred \u201cwhether or not that order might be deemed erroneous by an appellate court.\u201d <em>Thermtron, </em>96 S.Ct. at 593. This circuit has further held that review of a remand order is available under <em>Therm-tron </em>only in a case where \u201ca district judge stated openly that he was relying on a non-1447(c) ground for remand.\u201d <em>In re Merrimack Mutual Fire Insurance Company, </em>587 F.2d 642 (5th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-5\">Here, the district court judge did not expressly state that he was remanding because of \u00a7 1447(c); nor, however, did he \u201cstate[ ] openly\u201d that he was remanding on non-1447(c) grounds. On this basis alone, <em>Merrimack </em>apparently would bar our review of the remand order. We further note that the district court\u2019s opinion indicated that it ordered a remand because it believed removal jurisdiction was lacking due to the \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333 and the Eleventh Amendment, both of which are jurisdictional in nature. <em>See </em>Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 3674 (discussion of effect of \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause on removal jurisdiction); <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1363, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974) (Eleventh Amendment \u201cpartakes of the nature of a jurisdictional bar\u201d). The district court\u2019s grounds for remand thus appear to have been within section 1447(c)\u2019s purview.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">Because we are barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) from reviewing the district court\u2019s order, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1394-15\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 concerns civil rights cases and is not in issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1395-8\">.

City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981), adopted as precedent decisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
