The district court dismissed by summary judgment the O\u2019Dowds\u2019 claim upon finding, inter alia, (1) that the O\u2019Dowds, a white couple, had no cause of action under the Act because they did not fall into a legally-recognized minority protected by the Act, and (2) that, if entitled to notice of \u201cadverse action\u201d under the Act, the statement of the reasons therefor supplied by South Central was adequate to satisfy the statutory requirement. We affirm, agreeing with the district court as to the latter holding, and finding that, under the undisputed showing, no discrimination affecting the Act\u2019s protected classifications was implicated, whether or not a non-minority applicant has a cause of action under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>\n<em>Context Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">George O\u2019Dowd, a well-respected white<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> lawyer, and his wife had enjoyed residential telephone service supplied by South Central over twenty years previously. At the time this service was installed, no deposit was required by South Central. Through carelessness, O\u2019Dowd was tardy in payment of his monthly telephone bill four times during the year preceding September 1980. The precipitating fact of this litigation arises out of South Central\u2019s notice to O\u2019Dowd in September 1980 that, \u201cdue to [his] past payment record,\u201d a $100 deposit would be required and the telephone service disconnected if the deposit was not received in forty-five days. O\u2019Dowd protested the demand, and South Central disconnected'the service, whereupon he paid the deposit under protest and secured re-installation of his residential telephone service. (The deposit was subsequently refunded to him, with interest.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The O\u2019Dowds subsequently filed this action for damages, alleging two causes of action: I. The first cause of action was based upon a violation of the Act \u201cin denying credit on the bases of race, sex, creed, and/or other invalid or discriminatory basis,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(a)(1),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> arising out of South Central\u2019s treatment of customer-applicants in the allegedly predominately black population of their \u201c366\u201d area exchange; II. The second cause of action was based upon an additional violation by South Central of the Act\u2019s requirement that \u201c[e]ach applicant [for credit] against whom adverse action is taken shall be entitled to a statement of reasons for such action from the creditor.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(d)(2) (1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">I. <em>The Discrimination Claim under Section 1691(a)(1)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">The O\u2019Dowds do not claim that they themselves were discriminated against on the grounds of \u201crace, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(a)(1) (quoted at n\u00f3te 3 <em>supra), </em>but rather that they were damaged as a result of South Central\u2019s discriminatory policies against customer-applicants in the \u201c366\u201d exchange (which the O\u2019Dowds, a white couple, allege to have a large number of black and elderly customer-applicants). This cause of action would depend, for its predicate, upon a showing that South Central did not enforce a similar deposit-requirement, when presented with tardiness in payment, with regard to other exchange areas that were predominately white or predominately inhabited by younger persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-16\">We need not face the issue posed by the O\u2019Dowds, however \u2014 that, contrary to the district court holding, not only members of Act-protected classifications, but <em>also </em>other applicants for credit damaged as a result of discrimination against the protected classifications,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> have a cause of action under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Act \u2014 because here, under the undisputed showing, South Central\u2019s request for a deposit was made pursuant to a standard policy applicable to all exchange areas serviced by it, and that, moreover, the exchange \u201c366\u201d area reflected a racially and sexually diverse \u201cmicrocosm\u201d reflecting South Central\u2019s entire customer population.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The district court granted South Central summary judgment on this claim. Initially, the party seeking summary judgment must demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and the appropriateness of judgment as a matter of law. <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress and Company, </em>398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1608, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). South Central presented various showings demonstrating that the basis for the deposit request to the O\u2019Dowds was a pattern of lateness in payments (four times) during the previous twelve months. Presented by South Central for consideration on the motion for summary judgment were, inter alia, the affidavit of Beryle S. Ramsey,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a supervisor handling accounts in the \u201c366\u201d telephone exchange area, and the deposition of Shari Hinojosa,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the service representative who handled the request from the O\u2019Dowds of the deposit. These factual submissions were sufficient to demonstrate, unless controverted, that South Central\u2019s deposit request was based upon a non-discriminatory motive, <em>i.e., </em>the O\u2019Dowds\u2019 tardiness in payment of the telephone bill, and in accordance with a nondiscriminatory general practice of requiring deposits in such instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) provides that, once motion for summary judgment is supported by affidavits and other evidence, \u201can adverse party may not rest on the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided by this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">The O\u2019Dowds\u2019 allegation that the deposit request was made on the basis of impermissible discrimination is refuted by the undisputed factual showing. The O\u2019Dowds assert that South Central discriminates against \u201c366\u201d area applicants because the racial composition and age of the area\u2019s population indicate that residents in the area are a bad credit risk. When pressed for the factual basis of the allegation, however, O\u2019Dowd was unable to identify his source.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, O\u2019Dowd admitted to hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ing missed due dates in paying his telephone bills, and he admitted having received from South Central at least three \u201clate\u201d notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In short, the O\u2019Dowds failed to produce any \u201cspecific facts,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e), to show there was a genuine factual issue with regard to South Central\u2019s undisputed showing of legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for the action taken, and that would tend to substantiate the O\u2019Dowds\u2019 claims regarding the demography of the \u201c366\u201d area or the disparate treatment by South Central of customer-applicants in the area. Accordingly, the grant of summary judgment in favor of South Central was correct. <em>McKenzie v. U.S. Home Corp., </em>704 F.2d 778, 779 (5th Cir.1983); <em>White v. United Parcel Service, </em>692 F.2d 1, 3 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">II. <em>The Adequate-Explanation-Failure Cause of Action Under Section 1691(d)(3)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The Act affords a cause of action for damages against any creditor \u201cwho fails to comply with <em>any </em>requirement\u201d imposed by the Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691e (emphasis added). The plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to damages for South Central\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">For present purposes, without necessarily so deciding, we accept the O\u2019Dowds\u2019 contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">(a) that South Central\u2019s new requirement that the O\u2019Dowds furnish a deposit for continued credit service, after twenty years of such service without deposit, was an \u201cadverse action\u201d within the statutory definition as \u201ca change in the terms of an existing credit arrangement,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(d)(6), which thus entitled them to a \u201cstatement of reasons\u201d for such adverse action, \u00a7 1691(d)(2), (quoted at note 4 <em>supra </em>), that would contain \u201cthe specific reasons for the adverse action taken,\u201d \u00a7 1691(d)(3), (quoted at note 4 supra), and</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">(b) that \u00a7 1691(d), which was added to the Act by a 1976 amendment, required a creditor to notify <em>any </em>\u201ccredit applicant\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of an adverse action and of the \u201cspecific reasons\u201d therefor, \u00a7 1691(d)(2), (3) \u2014 not just those within the classifications of race, gender, etc. protected against credit discrimination by the Act. <em>See, e.g., Fischl v. General Motors Acceptance Corporation, </em>708 F.2d 143 (5th Cir.1983) (apparently accepting, without discussion, this construction of the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-17\">As previously noted, pursuant to a standard policy, South Central sent a notice of its adverse action <em>(i.e., </em>requiring a deposit for continuation of credit), explaining the reason as \u201cdue to your [O\u2019Dowd\u2019s] past payment record.\u201d The O\u2019Dowds claim that this notice did not meet the statutory requirement that the notice contain \u201cthe specific reasons for the adverse action taken.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-18\">Before summarizing the present facts with more specificity, in the light of which we hold that the adverse-action notice <em>did </em>meet the statutory requirement, it is appropriate that, first, we advert to the statutory purposes designed to be served by this notice requirement. As explained in the Senate Report accompanying the 1976 notice-provision, which originated in the Sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ate and was added to the Act by the 1976 amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">The requirement that creditors give reasons for adverse action is, in the Committee\u2019s view, a strong and necessary adjunct to the antidiscrimination purpose of the legislation, for only if creditors know they must explain their decisions will they effectively be discouraged from discriminatory practices. Yet this requirement fulfills a broader need: rejected credit applicants will now be able to learn where and how their credit status is deficient and this information should have a pervasive and valuable educational benefit. Instead of being told only that they do not meet a particular creditor\u2019s standards, consumers particularly should benefit from knowing, for example, that the reason for the denial is their short residence in the area, or their recent change of employment, or their already overextended financial situation. In those cases where the creditor may have acted on misinformation or inadequate information, the statement of reasons gives the applicant a chance to rectify the mistake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">S.Rep. No. 589, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1976), <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 403, 406. The notice provision was thought to have a long-term \u201cbeneficial educational effect on the credit-consuming public and a beneficial competitive effect on the credit marketplace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409 (S.Rep. at 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The Senate Report concluded that it was not intended that \u201cstatements of reasons be given in the form of long, detailed personal letters, and that \u201ca short, check-list statement will be sufficient so long as it reasonably indicates the reasons for adverse action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410 (S.Rep. at 8). The report included a sample check-list letter regarded as sufficient, indicating that the reasons would be sufficiently stated by such notations as \u201clength of employment,\u201d \u201clack of credit references,\u201d \u201ctime in residence,\u201d \u201ctoo many other credit obligations at this time,\u201d etc. <em>Id. </em>at 410-11 (S.Rep. at 9).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consonantly with the legislative intent, the administrative regulation promulgated as authorized by the Act provided that the \u201cstatement of reasons for adverse action shall be sufficient if it is specific and indicates the principal reason(s)\u201d for the action; the regulation furnished a form check-list that, if properly completed, would satisfy the Act\u2019s requirements, which includes such short-form summaries as \u201c[djelinquent credit obligations,\u201d \u201c[ijnsufficient credit file,\u201d \u201c[Ijength of employment,\u201d etc., 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.9(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Reverting to the present facts, in a letter of September 30, 1980, O\u2019Dowd was informed by South Central that a deposit of $100 was requested \u201cdue to your past payment record\u201d and that, if the deposit was not received by October 22, 1980, O\u2019Dowd\u2019s telephone would be disconnected. As previously described, this letter was triggered by computer printout because O\u2019Dowd\u2019s current telephone bill was overdue (by a day or so) and because, three times during the preceding year (October 1979, November 1979, and December 1979) the bill had been similarly overdue, resulting in each instance in a past-due notice that unless the rather nominal amounts owed were paid within a week, telephone service would be interrupted. (In each instance, O\u2019Dowd promptly paid the overdue amounts, without further incident.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Under these circumstances, O\u2019Dowd was clearly informed, in our opinion, of the \u201cspecific reasons for the adverse action taken,\u201d as required by 15 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u00a7 1691(d)(3). Within the meaning of the applicable administrative regulation, it was \u201cspecific and indicate[d] the principal reason^) for the adverse action,\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.9(b)(2), and it met the statutory purpose of informing the creditee of \u201cwhere and how, [his] credit status is deficient,\u201d S.Rep. No. 589, <em>supra, </em>at 4, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The present situation is thus distinguishable from that in <em>Fischl v. General Motors Acceptance Corporation, </em>708 F.2d 143 (5th Cir.1983). There, a young homeowner with (actually) an A-l credit rating, was denied financing on a new-car purchase with the check-listed reason, \u201ccredit references are insufficient,\u201d and with a check-list indication that no outside sources of information had been used. Actually, however, a credit-bureau report had been consulted, on which there was a mistaken although non-derogatory indication as to one account, and on which the applicant\u2019s present employment at $4,000 per month was not shown. In holding the statement of reasons insufficient in that instance, we pointed out that the creditor\u2019s statement of reasons inaccurately implied \u201csome qualitative deficiency in Fishl\u2019s credit status\u201d and that it did not \u201csignal the nature of that deficiency and, since the name and address of the credit bureau was not supplied, did not provide the [statute-] mandated opportunity for the applicant to correct erroneous information.\u201d 708 F.2d at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Here, unlike in <em>Fischl, </em>the reason was <em>not </em>\u201cmisleading or at best excessively vague,\u201d and the O\u2019Dowds were <em>not </em>\u201c \u2018left to speculate\u2019 \u201d as to the reasons for the adverse action here given, which stated reasons were <em>not </em>\u201cmisleading\u201d but instead <em>did </em>\u201ccoincide with those in fact relied upon\u201d by the creditor. <em>Fischl, supra, </em>708 F.2d at 148. The holding and rationale in <em>Fischl </em>are thus consistent with ours in the instant decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment summarily dismissing the O\u2019Dowds\u2019 claims against South Central.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-9\">.

A cause of action under such an anti-discrimination statute was found in favor of one not a member of a protected class though directly affected by discrimination against members of such a class. <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress and Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 150-52, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1604-06, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). The O\u2019Dowds urge that such a cause of action should be recognized under the Act as well, as was found in <em>Cherry v. Amoco Oil Co., </em>490 F.Supp. 1026, 1029-30 (N.D.Ga.1980). <em>See also 12 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 202.2(Z), n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b452-6\">. Beryle S. Ramsey\u2019s affidavit stated: South Central\u2019s procedures in following delinquent accounts caused its computers to issue written notices of overdue amounts when payment was not received by the due date shown on each bill. When an overdue notice was sent out, the computer was also programmed to consider the payment record of the customer-applicant over the previous twelve months. When certain computer-programmed criteria were met, the computer printed out a list of accounts that had been periodically overdue during the previous year, <em>without </em>regard to length of account, place of employment, credit-worthiness, race, color, religion, national origin, welfare status, sex, marital status, etc. Deposit requests were then sent out to customers with periodically overdue accounts thus determined, solely on the basis of a pattern of repeated tardiness. Four past due notices had been sent to the O\u2019Dowds during the year before the notice; Shari Hinojosa, South Central's service representative, reviewed the computer record of O\u2019Dowd\u2019s payment, found it to have a pattern of late payments during that period and sent a letter to O\u2019Dowd requesting a $100 deposit, the customary practice for a periodically tardy account. Finally, Ramsey averred that the \"366\u201d exchange includes a racially and sexually diverse microcosm of South Central\u2019s customer-applicant population.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b452-13\">.
