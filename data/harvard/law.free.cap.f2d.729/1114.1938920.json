The district court dismissed all but the second claim before trial. The dismissal of the first claim (the only dismissal challenged by plaintiff on appeal) was on the ground that it was time-barred; the district court concluded that plaintiff\u2019s claim of discrimination in hiring was not presented to the MBDA\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity counselor within thirty days of the date of the alleged discriminatory act, as required by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.214(a)(1)(i).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>After a bench trial, the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law and held that defendant had produced compelling evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for plaintiffs termination and that plaintiff had produced no evidence that defendant\u2019s articulated reasons for dismissal were merely a pretext for discrimination. The court accordingly entered judgment in favor of defendant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">Plaintiff raises three sets of issues on appeal. First, he contends that the district court erred in dismissing his claim of discrimination in hiring. Second, he asserts that the district court erred in making two evidentiary rulings at trial. Finally, he complains about alleged errors made by his court-appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-6\">In reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss, the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint are taken as true, <em>Reichenberger v. Pritchard, </em>660 F.2d 280, 282 (7th Cir.1981), and this court must consider the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, <em>i.e., </em>the plaintiff in this case, <em>Henry C. Beck Co. v. Fort Wayne Structural Steel, </em>701 F.2d 1221, 1223 (7th Cir.1983). We must resolve every reasonable doubt in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Id., </em>at 1223-24. The grant of a motion to dismiss will be affirmed only if it \u201cappears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-7\">Plaintiff worked for the MBDA as a Minority Business Program Specialist from September 10, 1979 to August 22, 1980. The announcement of the job opening at issue here stated that the position was available at grades of GS-9, GS-11 or GS-12, depending on the applicant\u2019s experience. When Wolfolk was offered the job, however, he was advised that the position was available only at a grade of GS-9. Plaintiff accepted the job at that level although, at the time he was hired, Wolfolk met the requirements for a grade of GS-12. Plaintiff did not inquire, when he was offered the job, why the position was available only at a GS-9 level.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-10\">On August 6, 1980, Wolfolk was informed that his employment with the MBDA was being terminated and that he would soon receive a written letter of termination. The next day, plaintiff contacted an Equal Employment Opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d) counselor. On August 14, 1980, plaintiff received his written notice of termination from the MBDA. That same day, Wolfolk learned for the first time that other employees in the same office performing the same job he did, but whose qualifications were inferior to his, were receiving a GS-11 salary. These other employees were white. Wolfolk also learned for the first time on August 14, 1980, that the Chicago office of the MBDA had falsely reported to its Washington office that plaintiff\u2019s grade was GS-11 rather than GS-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-11\">Wolfolk filed a discrimination complaint on September 3, 1980, with the Office of Civil Rights (\u201cOCR\u201d) in the United States Department of Commerce. Plaintiff received both the final decision from OCR denying his claim and a Notification of Right to Sue from the EEOC on or about May 9, 1981. Plaintiff timely filed his initial complaint in district court soon thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-14\">Federal law forbids discrimination in all personnel actions affecting federal employees or applicants for federal employment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(a) (Supp. IV 1980). The EEOC has the authority to enforce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>statute and to issue rules and regulations necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(b) (1976). The regulations require complaints to be brought to the attention of the EEO counselor in an agency within thirty days of \u201cthe matter causing [complainant] to believe he had been discriminated against\u201d or, if a personnel action, within thirty days of its effective date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Wolfolk\u2019s claim of discrimination in hiring is a \u201cpersonnel action.\u201d By the terms of the regulation, he would have had to bring his discrimination charge to the attention of the EEO counsel- or within thirty days of the effective date of his hiring in order to file a timely claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">However, the regulations provide for exceptions to the thirty-day limit in certain circumstances. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.214(a)(4) (1982) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-6\">(4) The agency shall extend the time limits in this section: (i) When the complainant shows that he was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them, or that he was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from submitting the matter within the time limits; or (ii) for other reasons considered sufficient by the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">Plaintiff claims that he did not know the facts supporting his claim of discrimination in hiring until August 14, 1980, over nine months after he was hired. We hold that plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to fall within the exception of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.214(a)(4).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Wolfolk\u2019s lack of knowledge of facts which would support a discrimination claim clearly constitutes \u201ccircumstances beyond his control\u201d which prevented him from submitting the matter to his agency\u2019s EEO counselor within thirty days of the effective date of his hiring. Plaintiff had no reason to suspect discrimination in hiring until long after the thirty-day limit had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-10\">Our decision is not based on a subjective test of when plaintiff allegedly learned of facts that would support a discrimination charge. Rather, in interpreting and applying the regulation in question, we adopt the test that has been used in private Title VII actions to determine whether Title VII\u2019s time limits should be tolled. A person is \u201cprevented by circumstances beyond his control\u201d from submitting a discrimination charge until the time when \u201cfacts that would support a charge of discrimination under Title VII were apparent or should have been apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights similarly situated to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Reeb v. Economic Opportunity Atlanta, Inc., </em>516 F.2d 924, 931 (5th Cir.1975). <em>See also Nelson v. United States Steel Corp., </em>709 F.2d 675, 677 n. 3 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Fox v. Eaton Corp., </em>689 F.2d 91, 93 (6th Cir.1982); <em>Wilkerson v. Siegfried Insurance Agency, Inc., </em>683 F.2d 344, 345 (10th Cir.1982); <em>Stoller v. Marsh, </em>682 F.2d 971, 974 (D.C.Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 1427, 75 L.Ed.2d 787 (1983); <em>Cooper v. Bell, </em>628 F.2d 1208, 1212 (9th Cir.1980). When this point in time has been reached, a person must submit the matter to the agency\u2019s EEO counselor within thirty days in order to take advantage of the exception at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-13\">We adopt and apply the <em>Reeb </em>standard in this factual context because it strikes an appropriate balance between fairness to the claimant and the importance of beginning the administrative process of investigation and conciliation in a timely manner. <em>Reeb </em>is also consistent with our recognition of the remedial purposes of Title VII. <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Liberty Trucking Co., </em>695 F.2d 1038, 1040 (7th Cir.1982). Further, cases involving the issue of tolling of Title VII time limits due to a complainant\u2019s lack of knowledge of key facts which would sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>port a discrimination charge are factually analogous to the instant case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">Case law supports our holding that Wolfolk did not have reason to suspect discrimination until August 14, 1980, and that equitable considerations require application of the exception found in the regulation. An alleged disparity in pay levels between white and black employees is a fact \u201cpeculiarly within the knowledge of the employer.\u201d <em>Strong v. Demopolis City Board of Education, </em>515 F.Supp. 730, 734 (S.D.Ala.1981). Employees generally lack knowledge about their co-workers\u2019 salaries, <em>id., </em>and employers are often reticent about disclosing this information. In <em>Strong, </em>the district court denied a motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s Title VII claim. The court ruled that equitable tolling of EEOC time limitations was warranted because plaintiff had no knowledge of the salary disparity between male and female sports coaches until a Board of Education meeting approximately two and one-half years after plaintiff was first paid for coaching. We cannot say, on the record before us, that the fact that white employees were being paid more for doing the same work as a black employee would or should have been apparent to a reasonably prudent person in Wolfolk\u2019s situation prior to August 14, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">In the instant case, Wolfolk acted promptly. He filed his discrimination complaint with the appropriate agency within twenty days of the time he first learned that white employees with inferior qualifications were being paid more than he was for doing the same job. The fact that plaintiff began the EEO counseling process before he discovered this fact is immaterial. At that time, he was undoubtedly concerned with his impending termination. The crucial point, for our purposes, is that once plaintiff initially discovered that whites with inferior qualifications were being paid more than he was, he acted promptly in bringing this charge to the attention of the EEO counselor. We hold that the district court erred in dismissing plaintiff\u2019s first claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-9\">Our decision here is consistent with this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Sims v. Heckler, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>725 F.2d 1143 (7th Cir.1984). In <em>Sims, </em>we held that the plaintiff failed to show that the exceptions in \u00a7 1613.214(a)(4) applied to him. We went on to hold, on the basis of principles of sovereign immunity, that the thirty-day limitation of \u00a7 1613.214(a)(1)(i) was jurisdictional and affirmed a district court order dismissing plaintiffs complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Unlike <em>Sims, </em>the plaintiff here has shown that he fits within \u00a7 1613.214(a)(4). Hence, the jurisdictional bar of \u00a7 1613.214(a)(1)(i) does not come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">Although our use of private Title VII cases involving tolling to clarify the meaning and application of the exception at issue here may make the holding of <em>Sims </em>of somewhat limited practical significance, this is only because the government -has decided to create an exception to the thirty-day limit that is similar in scope to the tolling principles applicable in private Title VII actions. The standard we have adopted is entirely consistent with the broad language and apparent liberality of the exception. To the extent that this standard permits plaintiffs like Wolfolk to proceed with their actions despite having missed the thirty-day limit, we conclude that this was the intent of the regulation in allowing an extension of the time limit for a person \u201cprevented by circumstances beyond his control from submitting the matter within the time limits.\u201d Finally, we note that our holding today does not eradicate the differences between private and federal employees who claim to be victims of employment discrimination and who do not file timely charges. Although the practical effect of this decision may be to eliminate those differences for employees who lack knowledge, until a later date, of facts that would support a discrimination charge, other employees missing filing deadlines will continue to be affected by their employer\u2019s identity because federal employees failing to contact their agency\u2019s EEO counselor in a timely manner are limited to the exceptions found in the regulation while private employees may have a wider range of potential equitable exceptions at their disposal under <em>Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 385, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-9\">Plaintiff challenges two evidentiary rulings made by the district court during the trial. First, plaintiff contends that the court erred in admitting into evidence performance evaluations which criticized Wolfolk\u2019s writing abilities and were prepared while Wolfolk was employed in the Office of Audits in the Department of Commerce.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> One of the reasons stated for plaintiff\u2019s termination in the written notice from the MBDA was plaintiff\u2019s allegedly poor written communications skills. Because plaintiff asserted that defendant\u2019s reliance on this factor was merely a pretext for discrimination, the performance evaluations were relevant to defendant\u2019s position that MBDA had a valid, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating plaintiff\u2019s employment. This evidence also was admissible to impeach plaintiff\u2019s testimony regarding his performance in the Office of Audits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s second evidentiary argument is also without merit. The district court correctly refused to admit into evidence a portion of the Federal Personnel Manual setting forth the manner in which a probationary employee is to be notified that he or she will be terminated. Plaintiff did not allege any procedural irregularities in connection with his termination in any of his complaints. This evidence, therefore, was not relevant to the issues before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-12\">Finally, plaintiff claims that re-; versal is warranted because of several errors allegedly made by his court-appointed counsel. This argument is without merit. The Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of effective assistance of counsel does not apply in civil cases. \u201cThere is no constitutional or statutory right for an indigent to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>counsel appointed in a civil case. It of course follows there is no constitutional or statutory right to effective assistance of counsel in a civil case.\u201d <em>Watson v. Moss, </em>619 F.2d 775, 776 (8th Cir.1980) (citation omitted). <em>See also Mekdeci v. Merrell National Laboratories, </em>711 F.2d 1510, 1522-23 (11th Cir.1983), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs first claim and affirm on the remaining issues. The case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1217-11\">. The defendant, Victor Rivera, is the director of the MBDA, which is part of the United States Department of Commerce. In civil actions alleging employment discrimination by a department, agency or unit of the federal government, the appropriate defendant is the head of the department, agency or unit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) (1976).

In <em>Reeb, </em>the Fifth Circuit vacated a district court dismissal of a Title VII case against a private employer. Plaintiff was told that her contract with her employer was not renewed because of a lack of money. Nearly seven months after her termination, plaintiff learned for the first time that her ex-employer had filled her old position with an allegedly less qualified male six weeks after her termination. Plaintiff filed a sex discrimination charge with the EEOC within a week after discovering this information. The Court of Appeals held that the then-existing ninety-day limitation period was tolled until plaintiff learned that she had been replaced by an allegedly less qualified male.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\"><em>See also Tucker v.
