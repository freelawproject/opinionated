Merritt, entered November 25, 1983, 721 F.2d 1046. I believe this proceeding \u201cinvolves a question of exceptional importance\u201d as set out as a prerequisite for determination of causes by the court <em>en banc. </em>Fed.R.App.P. 35(a)(2). Within the time specified under this rule, a petition for rehearing with suggestion for rehearing <em>en banc </em>was filed by the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. An attorney from the General Litigation and Legal Advice Section of the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice joined in this petition and signed the brief in support thereof, which I found persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-9\">This case involves the national Selective Service draft registration program instituted by the President and procedures involved for violation of the registration requirement (50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7\u00a7 453 and 462). The opinion of Judge Merritt in this case follows the dissenting opinion of a judge of the Ninth Circuit; disregards the majority opinion of that court;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and overrules the action of the trial court in denying defendant-appellant Schmucker\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing on his claim of selective prosecution prior to his conviction by jury trial. Schmucker refused to register as required by law despite \u201cefforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a government attorney to persuade him\u201d to the contrary. (P. 1048, of Judge Merritt). His contention with respect to selective prosecution was that the government was \u201cprosecuting only those persons who ... publicly expressed disagreement with the draft registration law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-11\">Judge Merritt makes reference in his opinion to an earlier decision of this court in <em>United States v. Hazel, </em>696 F.2d 473 (1983), which also dealt with a claim of selective prosecution. <em>Hazel, </em>however, imposes a \u201cheavy burden\u201d on a defendant asserting selective prosecution, claiming a \u201cprotestor\u201d status to show (1) that others similarly situated have not been prosecuted and (2) that the decision to prosecute was made invidiously or in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-12\">The appellant in this case wrote a letter to the Selective Service Department expressing his refusal to register; the defendant in <em>Hazel </em>was a vocal opponent of and protestor against the tax system of the government. That defendant in <em>Hazel </em>was one of the \u201chighly visible leaders of their movement\u201d was found to be insufficient to require a hearing despite first amendment claims. <em>Hazel </em>at 475. Citing <em>Oyler v. Boles, </em>368 U.S. 448, 82 S.Ct. 501, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962), the <em>Hazel </em>court held \u201ceven if Hazel and Lott had conclusively proven their charge that the Government initiated prosecution because of the great notoriety of their protests, that fact would not as a matter of law, be an impermissible basis for prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-13\">This case may fit another prerequisite for an <em>en banc </em>hearing \u201cto secure or maintain uniformity of its [this court\u2019s] decisions\u201d under Fed.R.App.P. 35(a)(1) as Schmucker\u2019s situation, even if this assertion were given credence, would appear to be no stronger than Hazel\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-14\">Attached to the petition for rehearing was a memorandum of the government, dated March 19, 1982, which was apparent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>ly submitted in evidence by defendant-appellant in support of his selective prosecution claim that the government prosecuted \u201cprotestors only,\u201d such as himself. It was indicated there that an active system for identifying non-registrants was being implemented prior to the time of this indictment. This letter memorandum was referred to in Judge Merritt\u2019s opinion. It also indicated that identification of potential registration violators was complicated, and that the system would not be productive until sometime in 1983. It noted that 183 identifications of non-registrants had been made based on reports from violators themselves, (defendant-appellant himself fits within that classification) and from third parties. In the interim, while the program was being implemented, the United States would undertake to prosecute known violators, such as Mr. Schmucker, under the following standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-4\">Assuming that the \u201cactive identification\u201d non-registrant class is so large that prosecution of everyone is impracticable, we could apply the <em>same </em>selection standard to the \u201cpassive\u201d referrals as to the \u201cactive\u201d referrals. Not only would we avoid some of the \u201cpassive\u201d legal problems, we could probably even avoid some of the \u201cpassive\u201d prosecutions. Nevertheless, we cannot recommend putting the \u201cpassives\u201d on hold until the \u201cactives\u201d are referred. We are precluded from doing so by one factor \u2014 time. If the Department of Justice waits until late this year to institute prosecutions of non-registrants, <em>the registration scheme will suffer greatly. </em>Consequently, we reluctantly conclude that United States Attorneys should be directed to proceed to prosecution with the matters which have already been referred to them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\"><em>Memorandum </em>(3/19/82) at 2 [emphasis added]. This standard, it appears to me, was carefully considered and found to meet constitutional standards in <em>Wayte. </em>The government\u2019s standard was found in <em>Wayte </em>to be a good faith assessment by those charged with prosecution of registration law violators that acting in a timely fashion against known violators to preserve the integrity of the law was deemed important to the national defense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-8\">The government offers two explanations for its selection procedure: (1) the identities of other violators were not known, and (2) violators who expressed their refusal to register made clear their willful violation of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-9\">The first explanation is logical and does not evidence impermissible motives. Moreover the government has made an effort to establish a system for identifying nonregistrants who are not otherwise brought to its attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-10\">The second justification is permissible also. The government may, in making prosecutorial decisions, \u201cconsider whether the potential defendants have, by their public statements or otherwise, made clear their actual or intended participation in the illegal activity.\u201d <em>[United States v.] Taylor, </em>693 F.2d [919] at 923 [ (9th Cir.1982) ] (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfEu\"><em>Wayte, </em>710 F.2d 1385, 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-11\">In this case the district court had before it the policy of the Department of Justice and the local United States Attorney\u2019s office that it prosecutes only those who, like Schmucker, confess to their non-registration violation <em>and </em>others who are reported to it. Only those who continue to refuse to register after receiving letters and visits from the F.B.I. are prosecuted. It would appear that those who persist in not registering are being prosecuted under the policy already made known to the trial court, this court, and the Ninth Circuit Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I believe this issue should have been considered by our entire court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-12\">KRUPANSKY, Circuit Judge, joins Circuit Judge WELLFORD\u2019s dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1143-15\">. <em>See, United States v.

Apparently, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals also considers this issue of such moment it has elected to hear appeals <em>en banc </em>sua sponte. <em>(United States v.
