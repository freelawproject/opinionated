This is particularly true as to infants, the ill and the aged. It also contributes to acid rain with its subsequent deleterious impact on the plant and fish life in the lakes and rivers of Ohio and neighboring states. Indeed it is alleged to contribute to the latter type of pollution in downwind areas as far removed as New England and Eastern Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-17\">The fundamental issues of this case were dealt with and decided over five years ago in <em>Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. v. EPA, </em>572 F.2d 1150 (6th Cir.1978) and <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. EPA, </em>578 F.2d 660 (6th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1114, 99 S.Ct. 1017, 59 L.Ed.2d 72 (1979). In those two opinions, this court approved the EPA\u2019s plan for controlling the ambient air affected by four power plants and the Supreme Court denied certiorari. This court\u2019s basic rationale for its approval of the EPA\u2019s air quality standards was (and remains) concern about human health and safety. In our earlier <em>Cleveland Electric </em>decision, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-18\">The federal Clean Air Act program which produced these standards is based primarily upon the adverse effect which air pollution has upon human life and health.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-19\">Acute episodes of high pollution have clearly resulted in mortality and morbidi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>ty. Often the effects of high pollutant concentrations in these episodes have been combined with other environmental features such as low temperatures or epidemic diseases (influenza) which may in themselves have serious or fatal consequences. This has sometimes made it difficult to determine to what extent pollution and temperature extremes are responsible for the effects. Nevertheless, there is now no longer any doubt that high levels of pollution sustained for periods of days can kill. Those aged 45 and over with chronic diseases, particularly of the lungs or heart, seem to be predominantly affected. In addition to these acute episodes, pollutants can attain daily levels which have been shown to have serious consequences to city dwellers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-5\">There is a large and increasing body of evidence that significant health effects are produced by long-term exposures to air pollutants. Acute respiratory infections in children, chronic respiratory diseases in adults, and decreased levels of ventilatory lung function in both children and adults have been found to be related to concentrations of SO2 and particulates, after apparently sufficient allowance has been made for such confounding variable as smoking and socioeconomic circumstances. Rall, <em>Review of the Health Effects of Sulfur Oxides, </em>8 Env\u2019tal Health Perspectives 97, 99 (1974).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-7\">Two other facts should be added from the extensive technical record in this case before we turn to the specific legal issues. The first is that sulfur dioxide emitted from plant stacks reacts with other elements in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid mist and various suspended sulfates which are in fact the irritants which adversely affect human health. T. Lewis, M. Amdur, M. Fritzhand &amp; K. Campbell, Toxicology of Atmospheric Sulfur Dioxide Decay Products 17 (1972).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-8\">The second important fact is that these derivatives from sulfur dioxide tend to be airborne for days. They affect areas at great distances downwind, even when in the original sulfur dioxide form they were emitted from a high power plant stack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-10\">Rall, <em>Review of the Health Effects of Sulfur Oxides, </em>8 Env\u2019tal Health Perspectives 97, 106 (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-11\">572 F.2d at 1153, 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-12\">While three of the original petitioners are parties to this appeal, we are advised that two of the four are now in compliance with the EPA standards which we approved in 1978. As to those two appellants, this appeal is in effect a petition to roll back emission standards which are currently being met, and thus to increase SO2 emissions in the ambient air in Ohio and elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-13\">As indicated above, the plant not in compliance is Ohio Power Company\u2019s Muskingum River plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-14\">This court, in its opinion in <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. EPA, supra, </em>approved the EPA plan in all respects except one. The exception pertained to the EPA\u2019s employment of the Class A assumption in determining pollution dispersion under least stable wind conditions in rural areas. As to this issue, we remanded saying as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-15\">On this present record we conclude that United States EPA's employment of the Class A assumption in determining pollution dispersion under \u201cleast stable\u201d wind conditions in rural areas and areas of complex terrain is not a rational decision and is arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-16\">As we read EPA\u2019s position on this point, it is that no better solution has been proposed. This answer, however, ignores the Enviroplan and Smith-Singer studies. More importantly, it ignores the conclusions of the experts\u2019 conference convened by Argonne National Laboratory at United States EPA\u2019s own request. The report of that conference suggested \u201celimination of the A curve and the use of the B curve for both A and B stability categories.\u201d <em>See </em>Report of the Special<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>ists\u2019 Conference on the EPA Modeling Guideline, Feb. 22-24, 1977, Chicago, Illinois, at \u00a7 2.7.5: \u201cVertical Dispersion Estimates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1201-5\">By pointing out this proposed solution, we do not mandate its acceptance by United States EPA. Our ultimate action on this score is simply to remand this issue to United States EPA for further study. This might result in the writing of a new record which supplies the now missing support for the use of Class A coefficients for the least stable wind condition in rural counties, or it might result in United States EPA\u2019s adoption of use of the Class B coefficients for the two least stable wind conditions, or it might result in a new record which supports a wholly new solution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">578 F.2d at 663-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">Thus the sole issue of practical significance before this court at this time is the question as to whether or not the EPA, since the remand, has properly carried out this court\u2019s mandate to undertake further study of the basis for the use of Class A coefficients and whether, if so, the record now supports EPA\u2019s renewed determination that the Class A coefficients should continue to be used for power plants in rural areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">We now have this case back before us with many newly stated arguments from EPA\u2019s opponents<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and some from Intervenor State of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-9\">After a lengthy hearing (which included the State of Pennsylvania\u2019s contentions), the court concludes that we carefully limited the remand to a single issue and that we should now decide only that issue. This record shows that EPA did reconsider and did introduce into the record additional support for its original finding that the Pasquill-Gifford Class A coefficients should be used and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-11\">Since the beginning, this case has been the subject of careful study by this court because of 1) the complexity and technicality of the record; 2) the economic importance of the decision to the industry concerned; and 3) the health hazards to the general public. Yet our review is limited by a very narrow standard. Congress has provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1201-12\">(9) In the case of review of any action of the Administrator to which this subsection applies, the court may reverse any such action found to be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1201-13\">(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1201-14\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(9)(A) (Supp. I 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-15\">The Supreme Court has elaborated upon this standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1201-16\">Under the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard the scope of review is a narrow one. A reviewing court must \u201cconsider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment____ Although this inquiry into the facts is to be searching and careful, the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one. The court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, supra, </em>[401 U.S. 402 at 416, 91 S.Ct. 814 at 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136]. The agency must articulate a \u201crational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168 [83 S.Ct. 239, 246, 9 L.Ed.2d 207] (1962). While we may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency\u2019s action that the agency itself has not given, <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196 [67 S.Ct. 1575, 1577, 91 L.Ed. 1995] (1947), we will uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned. <em>Colorado </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number><em>Interstate Gas Co. v. FPC, </em>324 U.S. 581, 595 [65 S.Ct. 829, 836, 89 L.Ed. 1206] (1945).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-6\"><em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285-86 [95 S.Ct. 438, 441-42, 42 L.Ed.2d 447] (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">Undertaking the review called for concerning the issue in this case, we find that the agency took the following actions:</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-11\">1) At a meeting of EPA Region V staff representatives on August 15, 1978, this court\u2019s remand of the Pasquill-Gifford dispersion coefficients was considered. EPA thereafter decided to continue to use the Class A coefficients \u201cuntil an alternative approach is sufficiently demonstrated to be more adequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-12\">2) February 7, 1979, EPA published a Notice of Reconsideration in 44 Fed.Reg. 7,798 (1979), concerning 1) the use of Class A coefficients at the four power plants then concerned; and 2) extending the time necessary for compliance with emission limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-13\">3) EPA also considered and rejected the solution proposed by appellants, namely, the use of Class B dispersion coefficients \"as contrary to both dispersion theory and available data.\u201d It based the rejection in part upon data taken from studies at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center in Germany. These studies, EPA found, supported use of the Class A coefficients.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-14\">4) A period followed when EPA received and considered objections filed by the appellants claiming 1) inapplicability of the Karlsruhe data and EPA's misinterpretation of it; 2) EPA\u2019s failure to consider all alternatives; and 3) its failure to take into proper account \u201cThe enormous economic costs involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-15\">5) On June 19,1980, EPA announced and published its intention to continue to employ the Pasquill-Gifford Class A coefficients (S<em>ee </em>45 Fed.Reg. 41,501 (1980)). It subsequently denied appellants\u2019 motions to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-16\">This court, of course, has no responsibility for determining the merits (or lack thereof) of the technical standard EPA has adopted. Our duty ends when we are able to say that the agency has acted lawfully and that the decision is not \u201carbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.\u201d We find no violation of this standard on review of this record. The instant petitions for review are dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1199-12\">.

Petitioners also contend that EPA was required on this remand to follow the formal notice requirements of \u00a7 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d). We agree with EPA, however, that the reconsideration ordered by this court did not constitute either promulgation or revision of an implementation plan. Additionally, if we were to assume the applicability of \u00a7 307(d) to this proceeding, any deviation from the \u00a7 307(d) requirements under the record contained here would be harmless within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(9).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
