CAMPBELL, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Appellant was convicted under a two-count indictment charging him with knowingly receiving, concealing, and retaining stolen property of the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The property consisted of two United States Treasury checks, each for $149.30, drawn to Carmen Ramos in payment of her Social Security benefits. Appellant was sentenced to two three-year prison terms to be served concurrently. He now challenges both the sufficiency of the evidence and the severity of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">I. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b141-16\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal. The motion was first made during the course of his two-day bench trial. It was renewed eight days after the court made its finding of guilt. The court rejected appellant\u2019s motion to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal both on the merits and for tardiness, citing Rules 29 and 45 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-17\">Because the government\u2019s evidence was plainly sufficient to support the judgment of conviction we need not reach the question whether appellant waived his sufficiency claim by filing his motion to renew one day outside Rule 29(c)\u2019s seven-day filing limit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-18\">Appellant argues that there was no evidence \u201cthat he either took the check[s] ... or that he knew someone had stolen them____\u201d On this he is clearly mistaken; the government\u2019s case was powerful on both points. There was evidence that on May 1, 1981 Carmen Ramos received two Social Security checks drawn on the United States Treasury. On May 4 she endorsed the checks and gave them to her husband, who testified that he deposited them into their joint account at the Santa Rosa branch of Banco Popular. The deposit slip, stamped by the teller, was submitted into evidence. A bank auditor testified that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the ordinary course of business this deposit would have been sent on the day of deposit to the bank\u2019s proof department where the deposit slip and the deposited items would be cross-checked before posting to the customer\u2019s account. Appellant was at that time an employee of the proof department. On May 5, 1981, according to Ferdinand Rolon Martinez (Rolon), another bank employee, appellant was in possession of these two checks. Rolon testified that on that day appellant gave him the checks with instructions to cash them at the Barceloneta branch of Banco Popular. On May 6 he took them to that branch as instructed, gave them to a teller, Jose Raphael Gandara Nieves (Gandara), and received cash in return. The cash, Rolon testified, was then split between appellant, Gandara, and himself. Gandara\u2019s testimony substantially corroborated Rolon\u2019s. He added, moreover, that appellant had first approached him in March 1981, to enlist him in a scheme whereby appellant and others would steal Social Security checks from bank deposits and give them to other bank employees to cash. Gandara testified that he had cashed eleven such checks, including the two deposited into Ramos\u2019s account. The court was entitled to believe Rolon and Gandara and to disbelieve appellant\u2019s version.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Appellant argues that even if all of this were believed, it does not show that he took anything that belonged to the United States or that the United States was in any way prejudiced. The statute, however, does not require a showing that the United States was prejudiced. It merely requires the government to show that a \u201cthing of value of the United States\u201d has been knowingly received, concealed or retained by the accused with improper intent, and, to support a felony conviction, that that property have a \u201cvalue\u201d in excess of $100. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. In <em>United States v. Forcellati, </em>610 F.2d 25, 30-32 (1st Cir.1979), we held that the United States retained a sufficient property interest in a United States Treasury check to sustain a conviction on an information under section 641. While the check there was undelivered, our rationale clearly indicated that the instrument would be a \u201cthing of value to the United States\u201d even after delivery \u2014 indeed, indefinitely. <em>Accord United States v. O\u2019Kelly, </em>701 F.2d 758 (8th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">It follows that the present checks were things of value of the United States within section 641. Since <em>Forcellati </em>involved a misdemeanor, no issue was presented of evaluating the check for purposes of the third paragraph of section 641, which provides that one guilty of the proscribed conduct commits a felony unless \u201cthe value of such property does not exceed the sum of $100.\u201d Section 641 goes on to define the term \u201cvalue\u201d to mean \u201cface, par, or market, or cost price, either wholesale or retail, whichever is greater.\u201d The checks here each had a face value of $149.30. This was the value which enticed appellant and his confederates to purloin the checks; this was their functional value for purposes of the fraudulent scheme. That the United States might not have been liable for the loss caused by the theft and resulting fraud is immaterial. <em>See Clark v. United States, </em>268 F. 329, 331 (6th Cir.1920), <em>cited in Forcellati, </em>610 F.2d at 31. We are satisfied that for purposes of making the crimes a felony rather than a misdemeanor, the value of the checks exceeded $100. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>454 F.2d 190, 192 (9th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">II. SENTENCE DISPARITY</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Appellant argues that the district court showed vindictiveness in sentencing him to three year\u2019s imprisonment on each count to be served concurrently, while his cohorts were either not tried (Rolon and Gandara) or given a suspended sentence (Sotomayer). He suggests that the court\u2019s alleged vindictiveness was motivated by his decision to take his case to trial, and that it therefore violated his right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">We rejected a similar argument in <em>United States v. Quejada-Zurique, </em>708 F.2d 857, 861 (1st Cir.1983). We said, \u201cThe short answer to this contention is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>sentences, all of which were within statutory limits, were imposed by two different judges, each with discretion to choose the sentence he deemed appropriate.\u201d As in <em>Quejada-Zurique, </em>appellant and Sotomayer came before different judges and appellant\u2019s sentence was well within statutory limits. We also stated in <em>Quejada-Zurique,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">The defendant who opts to go to trial rather than negotiating a plea runs the risk of a harsher sentence than he would have received by pleading guilty. \u201cWhile confronting a defendant with the risk of more severe punishment clearly may have a \u2018discouraging effect on the defendant\u2019s assertion of his trial rights, the imposition of these difficult choices is an inevitable\u2019 \u2014 and permissible \u2014 \u2018attribute of any legitimate system which tolerates and encourages the negotiation of pleas.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 364, 98 S.Ct. 663, 668, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978) (quoting <em>Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, </em>412 U.S. 17, 31, 93 S.Ct. 1977, 1985, 36 L.Ed.2d 714 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">708 F.2d at 861-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-10\">. Section 641 provides, in essence, that, \"[w]hoever receives, conceals or retains\" any \"thing of value of the United States ... with the intent to convert it to his ... use or gain, knowing it to have been embezzled, stolen, purloined or converted\u201d shall be guilty of a felony; \"but if the value of such property does not exceed the sum of $100,\u201d he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-11\">. Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c) provides that \u201ca motion for judgment of acquittal may be made or renewed within 7 days after the jury is discharged____\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 45(b) states that \"the court may not extend the time for taking any action under Rules 29, 33, 34 and 35 except to the extent and under the conditions stated in them.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b141-21\">. Avoiding the waiver issue seems even more appropriate because it was not briefed at all by appellant and the cases which the government wishes us to follow, purporting to view similar defaults as a bar to appellate review, went on to consider the sufficiency of the evidence under \"plain error\u201d or \"manifest injustice\u201d standards. <em>See United States v. Rone, </em>598 F.2d 564, 572-73 (9th Cir.1979) (\"The evidence is sufficient; no plain error is present.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 946, 100 S.Ct. 1345, 63 L.Ed.2d 780 (1980); <em>United States v. Phipps, </em>543 F.2d 576, 577 (5th Cir.1976) (\u201cThe evidence in the instant case supports the jury verdict and does not result in manifest injustice,\" assuming <em>arguendo </em>that such an exception to the waiver doctrine exists), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1110, 97 S.Ct. 1146, 51 L.Ed.2d 564 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
