HALL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The United States appeals from an order of the district court, 555 F.Supp. 843, vacating its prior ruling finding Fred M. Keller-man (Kellerman) guilty of misapplication of bank funds under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Kellerman became president of the Southwest Virginia National Bank (the \u201cBank\u201d) in 1975, after approximately fifteen years of banking experience in other localities in Virginia. In late 1979, Keller-man began personally authorizing payment by the Bank of numerous overdrafts created on a checking account for Cowan Associated Mining Company, Inc. (\u201cCowan\u201d). By February, 1980, overdrafts in excess of $90,000 had accumulated on Cowan\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">On February 20, 1980, Kellerman submitted a request to the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors for approval of a $170,000 loan to Cowan, to be secured by an assignment of Cowan\u2019s stock and coal reserves. The stated purpose of the loan was to cover the overdrafts and to provide Cowan with new capital. The Board approved the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Early in the morning on the following day, the Chairman of the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors requested that Kellerman convene a special board meeting that day to reevaluate the Cowan loan. Whereupon Kellerman contacted the Bank\u2019s attorney and requested assistance in getting Walt Childers (Childers), who had previously expressed an interest in the Cowan property, \u201cto put the money up\u201d for the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The Bank\u2019s attorney obtained a check for $165,000 from Childers, drawn on an account for N-S Corporation, along with a letter signed by Childers as vice-president of N-S Corporation and addressed to Cow-an. The letter stated that the check was \u201cpayable to Southwest Virginia National Bank escrow for [Cowan].\u201d These items were transmitted to Kellerman in time for the special board meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">Kellerman presented to the Board the $165,000 check.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the letter from N-S Corporation to Cowan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-15\">This check [was] to be held by [Southwest Virginia National Bank] pending final negotiations and closing of transaction for prospective coal lease and related equipment which [Cowan] controls] or will control in the near future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-16\">By copy of this letter, said bank is directed to deliver said check back to [Cowan] upon [Cowan\u2019s] assignment to [N-S Corporation] of a valid marketable, leasehold estate of [Cowan\u2019s] property near Brewster-Dale <em>\\sic </em>], McDowell County, West Virginia, free from any valid objections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-17\">The evidence in this case revealed that Cowan never owned any marketable leasehold property near Brewsterdale, McDowell County, West Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-18\">At the special board meeting, Kellerman told the Board that Childers had agreed to purchase Cowan\u2019s assets if a substantial reduction in Cowan\u2019s indebtedness to the Bank was not made at the end of ninety days. Kellerman also told the Board that he would place the check in an escrow account; however, he never did so. The Board rescinded the $170,000 loan to Cow-an and extended a new loan for ninety days in the amount of $165,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-19\">About the time that the ninety-day note matured, in the latter part of May or early June, Childers called Kellerman and said he needed the check for his mining operations. Kellerman, without the Board\u2019s authorization or knowledge, returned the check to Childers. The check was never negotiated, and its ultimate disposition is unknown. No copy of it was ever located at the Bank or obtained from any of the witnesses. It is undisputed that N-S Corporation did not have sufficient funds to cover the $165,000 check when it was presented to the Board by Kellerman on February 21, 1980, or at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>any time before Kellerman returned the check to Childers.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Kellerman was indicted in May, 1982, on thirty-two counts arising out of a series of loans made by him to a small, interrelated group of borrowers engaged in the coal business during 1980 and 1981, when he was president of the Bank. Count Twenty-Eight of the indictment charged that Kellerman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">wilfully and knowingly did misapply and abstract the sum of $165,000.00 of the monies and funds of the bank, in that FRED M. KELLERMAN disposed of and converted check drawn on an N-S Corporation account for the amount of $165,-000.00 which was received by and intended by the Board of Directors of said Bank to be placed in escrow as collateral on a $165,000.00 loan approved February 21, 1980, to Cowan Mining, Inc., a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 656 and 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">After hearing all of the evidence, the trial judge found Kellerman guilty under Count Twenty-Eight.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Kellerman then moved for a judgment of acquittal or a new trial on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that the evidence failed to show a misapplication of Bank funds. The district court vacated its prior ruling and acquitted Kellerman of Count Twenty-Eight, the only remaining Count. Although there was sufficient evidence of Kellerman\u2019s intent to deceive the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors, the district court found that the check was worthless and therefore concluded that Kellerman could not have misapplied Bank funds. The district court found</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">that the check was worthless in two respects. First, if the Bank had acquired rights in and had attempted to cash the check, it would have been unable to do so because of insufficient funds. Second, if the Bank had, brought a collection suit against N-S Corporation, it would not have been entitled to prevail, because it was not a holder in due course and was, therefore, subject to N-S Corporation\u2019s defenses. This appeal by the United States followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">On appeal, the United States contends that this Court has jurisdiction to decide this case because an appeal from a judgment of acquittal setting aside a prior bench finding of guilt does not offend the double jeopardy clause. The United States concedes that the Bank could not have cashed the check due to insufficient funds but asserts that that alone does not necessarily mean the check was valueless. The government contends that mere possession of the check by the Bank was sufficient and that the Bank was not required to hold the check in due course for it to have value to the Bank. We conclude we have jurisdiction to decide this appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but reject the government\u2019s other contention as meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656 provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-16\">Whoever, being an officer, director, agent or employee of, or connected in any capacity with any ... national bank ... willfully misapplies any of the moneys, funds, or credits <em>of such bank </em>or any moneys, funds, assets or securities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>intrusted to the custody or care of such bank, </em>... shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">(Emphasis added). Kellerman was not indicted for misapplying funds <em>intrusted </em>to the custody or care of the Bank. Rather, he was indicted for misapplying funds <em>of </em>the Bank in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656. Nevertheless, the United States frankly acknowledges that its theory of prosecution in this case was that \u201cKellerman returned a check which was <em>intrusted to him and to the bank as collateral, or security, on a loan </em>and that at the time he returned the check he intended to defraud his employer bank.\u201d Government\u2019s Brief at 11 (emphasis added). We find that the government indicted Kellerman under the wrong portion of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">To prove the offense charged in Count Twenty-Eight of the indictment, the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the check constituted Bank funds. No criminal misapplication of funds occurs when the so-called \u201cfunds\u201d consist of worthless paper. <em>Batchelor v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 426, 15 S.Ct. 446, 39 L.Ed. 478 (1895). Thus, if the $165,000 check was worthless when it was returned by Kellerman to N-S Corporation, then funds of the Bank were not misapplied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">The United States maintains that whether the check was payable to Cowan or to the Bank is immaterial. According to the government, as long as the check remained in the Bank\u2019s possession, it had value to the Bank. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">For the Bank to take the check free from all claims and defenses, entitling it to collect from N-S Corporation in the event of default, the Bank must be a holder in due course. Va.Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.3-122; .3-304; .3-306 (1965). Obviously only a holder can be a holder in due course. To be a holder, a person must have \u201cpossession of ... an instrument ... drawn, issued or indorsed to him or to his order or to bearer or in blank.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8.1-201(20). Thus, for the Bank to be a holder, the check must have been negotiated to the Bank. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8.3-202(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, whether the check was payable to Cowan or to the Bank is critical in proving that the check was negotiated to the Bank, that the Bank was a holder \u2014 and therefore a holder in due course \u2014 and that the check had value to the Bank.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The only proof adduced at trial as to the identity of the payee was the \u201cescrow letter\u201d which stated that the check was \u201cpayable to Southwest Virginia National Bank <em>escrow for [Cowan].\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). This language establishes that the Bank possessed the check only as an escrow agent for N-S Corporation. The check was not delivered to the Bank as collateral for the Cowan loan. As the \u201cescrow letter\u201d provides, the cheek was in consideration of a prospective coal and equipment lease from Cowan to N-S Corporation. Cowan was to assign a leasehold interest to N-S Corporation, and the Bank was to hold the check pending final negotiations and closing of the contemplated transaction. If the check represented any \u201cfunds,\u201d it was not funds of the Bank as charged in Count Twenty-Eight of the indictment, but funds of N-S Corporation intrusted to the Bank, and, as we have already explained, Keller-man was not indicted for misapplication of funds intrusted to the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Because the Bank was not a holder in due course, the check was worthless paper, given N-S Corporation\u2019s defenses to the check. Va.Code \u00a7 8.3-302 defines \u201cholder in due course\u201d to mean \u201ca holder who takes the instrument (a) for value; and (b) in good faith; and (c) without notice ... of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person.\u201d As against any person not having the rights of a holder in due course, lack of consideration is a defense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8.3-306; .3-408. Because N-S Corporation never received an assignment of a leasehold estate in Cowan\u2019s property in return for the check, the Bank, had it attempted to sue N-S Corporation, would have been subject to the defense of lack of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">In addition, the facts belie the government\u2019s assertion that the Bank possessed the check as security for the loan to Cowan. The check and letter were an offer by N-S Corporation to buy Cowan\u2019s assets and were held by the Bank as an escrow agent pending the closing of that transaction. The Bank gave nothing of value for the check. Kellerman\u2019s misrepresentations of the circumstances surrounding the check to obtain the Board\u2019s approval of the $165,-000 loan, did not constitute \u201cvalue\u201d from the Bank to N-S Corporation. The Board\u2019s treatment of the check as security to be held in escrow pending Cowan\u2019s payment of its ninety-day loan did not in itself impose any obligation upon N-S Corporation to secure Cowan\u2019s loan. Accordingly, the check never constituted \u201cfunds\u201d of the Bank, and its return by Kellerman was not a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656 as charged in Count Twenty-Eight of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment of acquittal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-11\">. The district court accepted the testimony of the members of the Board of Directors that although Kellerman may have had the letter at the meeting, he did not present it to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\">. Of the 32 counts in the indictment, four were dismissed prior to trial and 25 were dismissed following the close of the government\u2019s case-in-chief. Kellerman was acquitted of two other counts following trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b385-10\">. The Criminal Appeals Act of 1970, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, provides in relevant part that: \u201cIn a criminal case ... no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution.\u201d Pursuant to this statute, the government may appeal from a judgment of acquittal vacating an earlier finding of guilt by the district court provided success by the United States on appeal will result in reinstatement of the prior finding of guilt and not a new trial. <em>See United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 130, 101 S.Ct. 426, 433, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980) (dicta); <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>429 U.S. 1, 3, 97 S.Ct. 24, 25, 50 L.Ed.2d 1 (1976); <em>United States v. Steed, </em>674 F.2d 284, 285-86 (4th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 829, 103 S.Ct. 67, 74 L.Ed.2d 68 (1982). We conclude that success by the United States on the merits would result in reinstatement of the district court's prior finding of guilt and that therefore we have jurisdiction to decide this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\">. The district court found that Kellerman misrepresented to the Board of Directors: \u201cthat he had a good check as security, ... whether or not Childers was going to buy out Cowan and under what circumstances; ... [and] the terms of the so-called \u2018escrow\u2019 letter.\" Clearly, Kellerman \u201cpulled one over\u201d on the Board, but that is not the question before us. We must decide whether the check constituted \"funds\u201d of the Bank within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656. We conclude that the Board\u2019s erroneous belief that the check had value is insufficient to support a criminal conviction under the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\">. Va.Code \u00a7 8.3-202 provides in pertinent part that: \"Negotiation is the transfer of an instrument in such form that the transferee becomes a holder. If the instrument is payable to order, it is negotiated by delivery with any necessary indorsement; if payable to bearer it is negotiated by delivery.\" There is no claim here that the check was payable to bearer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\">. The dissent argues that the check constituted funds of the Bank because the government established that the Bank was a holder and because a holder has rights not available to one who is not a holder. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">Both the government and the dissent concede that the government did not prove the exact language employed on the check regarding the payee\u2019s identity. For the government to argue before this Court that the identity of the payee is immaterial belies the contention that it proved the Bank was a holder. By definition, the holder of a check is the person to whom it is drawn, issued or indorsed. Va.Code \u00a7 8.1-201(20). In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the government would have this Court infer that the Bank was the payee. We decline the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-17\">Because the government failed to prove the identity of the payee, the dissent must speculate as to the payee\u2019s identity based upon the language of the escrow letter which is, at best, ambiguous. This is a criminal case, and the government has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the check constituted funds of the Bank. <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975). The government could have asked one of its witnesses or Kellerman the identity of the payee. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>did not do so. We find that the government failed to carry its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Moreover, even if the government had proved that the Bank were a holder, the check was still worthless to the Bank. Without elaborating upon the rights of a holder, the dissent merely asserts that the check had value to the Bank because the \"status of holder confers upon a party rights and benefits not available to one who is not a holder.\u201d As an example of such rights, the dissent cites Va.Code \u00a7 8.3-307 and acknowledges that that statute confers only procedural rights upon the parties. Procedural rights do not render a worthless piece of paper valuable.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">The only right of a holder which could conceivably give value to the check in the Bank\u2019s possession is the right to payment. <em>See </em>Va.Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.3-301; .3-306. In this case, if the Bank had attempted to cash the check, payment would have been properly refused for insufficient funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">Even if N-S Corporation had had sufficient funds to pay the check, the Bank would have had no right to cash it. Assuming that the check was made out in any one of the four ways proposed by the dissent, the undisputed fact remains that the Bank was an escrow agent and as such had no right to cash the check. Thus, the check did not constitute good and valid funds of the Bank.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b387-13\">MURNAGHAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Axr\">concurring in part, dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">I join the majority\u2019s opinion to the extent of its holding that our consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>government\u2019s appeal does not offend the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">As to the merits of the appeal, however, I dissent. It is worth recalling that the trial court found that Kellerman intended to defraud the Bank,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and also that Keller-man insisted and the Board of Directors believed that the check was good, and represented valid funds of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The majority nonetheless concludes that \u201c[bjecause the Bank was not a holder in due course, the check was worthless paper\u201d to the Bank. At 285. It therefore reasons that the check was not monies or funds of the Bank, and holds that Keller-man could not be convicted of violating the portion of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656 under which he was indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">There is, I submit, an unjustified leap to the conclusion that the government\u2019s failure to prove that the Bank was a holder in due course rendered the paper <em>worthless </em>to the bank. I believe instead that the government established that the Bank was a holder, which is sufficient for the government\u2019s purposes here, and that it belies the fundamental doctrines of the law of negotiable instruments to conclude that a check, whether or not it is held in due course, is by definition worthless paper to a holder of that check.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">As the Uniform Commercial Code, as adopted by Virginia, makes clear, one may be a holder without being a holder in due course. Va.Code \u00a7 8.1-201(20) defines a \u201cholder\u201d as one \u201cwho is in possession of a document of title or an instrument or an investment security drawn, issued or endorsed to him or his order or to bearer in blank.\u201d Va.Code \u00a7 8.3-302(1) then defines certain holders as holders in due course.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fatal error of the majority is to assume that an instrument can only be held in due course. The sections of the. Code discussed above,, however, state unequivocably that an instrument can be held notwithstanding the existence of potential defenses, which may or may not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">For the purposes of Kellerman\u2019s case, the only impediment to a conclusion that the Bank was a holder concerned the proof at trial as to whether the Bank was a payee of the check. Since the check had mysteriously disappeared by the time of trial, the government\u2019s proof at trial as to the payee depended on the language of the \u201cescrow letter,\u201d which stated that the check was \u201cpayable to Southwest Virginia National Bank escrow for [Cowan].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Appellees seek to demonstrate that the language in the \u201cescrow letter\u201d is so ambiguous, that the letter does not constitute proof that the Bank was the payee of the check. To illustrate its point, Appellees list six possible ways the check could have been made out based on the escrow letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">(1) to \u201cSouthwest Virginia National Bank Escrow for Cowan Mining\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">(2) to \u201cSouthwest Virginia National Bank, Escrow Agent for Cowan Mining\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">(8) to \u201cSouthest Virginia National Bank\u201d with the notation, \u201cfor Cowan Mining Escrow Account\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">(4) to \u201cSouthwest Virginia National Bank and Cowan Mining\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">(5) to \u201cCowan Mining Escrow Account\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">(6) to \u201cCowan Mining\u201d with the notation, \u201cfor deposit in Southwest Virginia National Bank Escrow Account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Based on the language of the escrow letter, it is patently indefensible to argue that the Fifth and Sixth choices are possibilities. No reasonable person would infer that a check made out solely to \u201cCowan Mining Escrow Account\u201d or \u201cCowan Mining\u201d would be referred to as a check payable to Southwest Virginia National Bank.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-18\">We are therefore left with the first four choices. While a case for selecting any of those four is not implausible, it is not fatal to the government\u2019s case that the ambiguity remains unclarified. The choices share the common feature that <em>in each instance the Bank is a </em>holder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-19\">The government, therefore, did not prove the exact language employed on the check. It did, however, prove that the Bank was a holder.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The only remaining inquiry is whether despite Bank\u2019s status as a holder, the check was somehow worthless to the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-20\">At the outset of the inquiry is the rather obvious general proposition that the very status of a holder confers upon a party rights and benefits not available to one who is not a holder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For example, Va.Code \u00a7 8.3-307<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> confers procedural rights in establishing the burdens on the parties in an action to enforce the obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Since, in general, an instrument is not inherently worthless to its holder, there only remains the specific question of whether this particular instrument was worthless to its holder. The only argument offered by the trial court on this point is that the N-S Corporation lacked sufficient funds to cover the check. In the same opinion, however, the court provided the appropriate rejoinder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">The mere fact that there were not funds to cover the check does not necessarily mean that the check was valueless. Had the bank attempted to cash the check and discovered that it was drawn on insufficient funds, perhaps it could have obtained a judgment on the underlying obligation, and perhaps the judgment could have been collected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Mem.Op. p. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">It is of utmost importance to distinguish between a mere insufficiency of funds and insolvency.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court relied heavily on a proposition from the seminal case of <em>Batchelor v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 426, 15 S.Ct. 446, 39 L.Ed. 478 (1895) that the misapplication of worthless notes cannot constitute a misapplication of bank funds. Yet <em>Batchelor </em>concerned a bank president\u2019s scheme of cancelling the indebtedness of an insolvent debtor of the bank. Here, there was no allegation that the N-S Corporation was insolvent, but merely that there were insufficient funds to cover the check. Furthermore, the evidence indicated that both the Board of Directors and Kellerman believed that there were sufficient funds to cover the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">The district court was in error, therefore, when it concluded that the check was worthless to the Bank at the time Keller-man returned the check to Childers without the Board\u2019s authorization or knowledge. The check provided the Bank with all the rights and privileges conferred upon a holder. The Bank was free to demand fulfillment of the underlying obligation, or, in the stead of a refusal by N-S Corporation to perform, the Bank was free to initiate proceedings for a favorable judgment based on the check.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">This view of the evidence leads to the conclusion that Kellerman\u2019s conviction should not have been disturbed. The district court found that Kellerman intended to defraud the Bank. Both the Board of Directors and Kellerman insisted that the check was good and valid funds of the Bank. The foregoing arguments have demonstrated that the check was not worthless to the bank.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of acquittal and reinstate Kellerman\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\">. In its memorandum on the grant of defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APv\">The court adheres to its original opinion that the entire events surrounding the matter of the check and the granting of the loan to Cowan Mining Company showed an intention upon the part of the defendant to deceive the members of the Board of Directors. The court is of the opinion that the defendant Kellerman misrepresented to the Board of Directors the situation regarding the lease of Cowan Mining Company and that it was assigned to the Bank as security for the loan; the defendant misrepresented to the Bank that he had a good check as security; the defendant misrepresented to the bank the situation insofar as whether or not Childers was going to buy out Cowan and under what circumstances; there was a misrepresentation about the terms of the socalled [sic] \"escrow\u201d letter; there was a misrepresentation or a failure to tell the members of the Board of Directors about returning the check and in concealing that the check had been returned and there was misrepresentation to the Board about the production which was going on at the Cowan Mining Company and there were misleading status reports given to the Board from time to time over a period of approximately a year. Therefore, the court is of the opinion that the evidence is sufficient in this case overall to show an intent to defraud on the part of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">Mem.Op., n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-13\">. \u00a7 8.3-302.

In such a case, the filing of a bankruptcy petition \"effectively stops any further action in proceedings involving the debtor pending in other courts.\u201d <em>In re Critical Fork Coal Corporation, </em>18 B.R. 425 (Bkrtcy.W.D.Va.1982). <em>Cf.

Furthermore, even in the case of bankruptcy of the payor, a check would in many cases still have value since its holder would ultimately share in a <em>pro rata </em>distribution to general creditors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\">. For these reasons, it is irrelevant that the N-S Corporation possessed potential defenses to the action. The question here is an open one as to whether the status of the Bank rose to the level of holder in due course. That depends on what would be the outcome in civil litigation between payee (the Bank) and payor (N-S Corporation).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Nonetheless, a proven status of valueless has not been established. First, the existence of a holder's rights, .not all of which operate solely with respect to the maker of the instrument, are enough to refute a claim of worthlessness. Second, those potential defenses are just that: potential defenses. As against the N-S Corporation, the Bank possessed at least a colorable claim, and a <em>prima facie </em>case, which at the very least had settlement value. Even a partial defense would not strip the check of value as to the residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">While uncertainty continues, the check has value. Virtually every lawsuit, before it has concluded, has some value in the plaintiff's hands up until a final and complete judgment in the defendant's favor has been rendered. At the time Kellerman returned the check, there remained the possibility that the N-S Corporation might fail to assert its defenses at a later date, or that the trier of fact might remain unpersuaded by those defenses. The Bank would thus be entitled to a judgment as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b390-15\">.
