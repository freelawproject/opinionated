The magistrate made findings of fact and conclusions of law, and recommended that plaintiff\u2019s suit be dismissed. As of the date that this appeal was filed in this court, the district court had not acted on the findings and recommendation of the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-16\">It is well established that the findings of a magistrate may not ordinarily be appealed directly to the Court of Appeals. <em>United States v. Renfro, </em>620 F.2d 497, 500 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 921, 101 S.Ct. 321, 66 L.Ed.2d 149 (1980); <em>Kendall v. Davis, </em>569 F.2d 1330 (5th Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Cline, </em>566 F.2d 1220 (5th Cir.1978). This general rule is overcome only when the magistrate acts under a specific statutory provision authorizing direct appeal to the circuit court. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1), a district court, with the voluntary consent of the parties, may authorize a magistrate to conduct proceedings and enter final judgment in a case; such judgment is then appealable to the circuit court directly, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 636(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-17\">We conclude that the reference to the magistrate made by the district court was not made under \u00a7 636(c)(1), and hence is not covered by \u00a7 636(c)(3). The district judge stated that the reference was being made under Title VII\u2019s magistrate provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(5), and Rule 53. Neither of these sections provides for a final judgment to be entered by the magistrate, and Rule 53 explicitly provides for review of the magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendations by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-18\">Further, we find no evidence that the parties consented to have the magistrate enter a final judgment. We have held before that such consent must be explicit, and will not be casually inferred from the conduct of the parties. <em>Glover v. Alabama Bd. of Corrections, </em>660 F.2d 120 (5th Cir.1981); <em>accord, Alaniz v. California Processors, Inc., </em>690 F.2d 717 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-19\">In sum, the magistrate\u2019s findings are not a final appealable order, and the district court, too, has yet to enter a final judgment in this case. It follows that plaintiff\u2019s appeal must be dismissed for want of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-20\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
