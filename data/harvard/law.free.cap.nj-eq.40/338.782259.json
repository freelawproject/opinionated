McCarter, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-8\">I. <em>The Claim. </em>\u2014 A surviving partner who pays a partnership debt is entitled to contribution from the estate of his deceased partner in equity. <em>Comins </em>v. <em>Culver, 6 Stew. Eq. 94; Wells </em>v. <em>Hubbell, 2 Johns. Ch. 294.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-9\">II. <em>The Parties. </em>\u2014 A. Such a creditor can follow assets into the hands of legatees or distributees in equity. <em>March </em>v. <em>Russell, 3 My. &amp; Cr. 42; Hodges </em>v. <em>Waddington, 2 Vent. 360; Thomas </em>v. <em>Griffith, 2 Giff. 504; Stuart </em>v. <em>Kissam, 2 Barb. 493; Trip </em>v. <em>Talbird, 1 Hill\u2019s Ch. 142; Lupton </em>v. <em>Lupton, 2 Johns. Ch. 626.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-10\"><em>B. </em>The executor or administrator of such deceased debtor is a proper party to such a suit, if he still has assets in his hands. <em>Gillepsie </em>v. <em>Alexander, 3 Russ. 136; Davis </em>v. <em>Frowd, 1 Myl. &amp; K. 209; Greig </em>v. <em>Somerville, 1 Russ. &amp; M. 338.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-11\">A further reason for making the administratrix a party is the admitted fact that no guardian has been appointed for the infant distributee. <em>Wms. on Exrs. 1206.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-12\">III. <em>The Amount. </em>\u2014 Complainant is entitled to recover one-half of the amount paid by her or her testator, including expenses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-13\">The administratrix was notified by complainant or her testator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>or his agents, of their liability to meet half of the Jackson claim, if established.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-6\">They never disclaimed the propriety of Lee\u2019s defence to the action, nor claimed that he ought to pay without litigation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-7\">They simply denied the liability of any one but the surviving partner, and always sent the claimant to him. <em>Wheeler </em>v. Arnold, <em>30 Mich. 304; Allen </em>v. <em>Blanchard, 9 Conn. 631; Forbes </em>v. <em>Webster, 2 Vt. 58; 2 Lindley on Partnership (Ewell\u2019s ed.) 790 note; Blythe </em>v. <em>Smith, 5 M. &amp; G. 407; Kemp </em>v. <em>Finden, 12 M. &amp; W. 421; Stothoff </em>v. <em>Dunham, 4, Harr. 181; Notes to Lampleigh </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, 1 Smith\u2019s Lead.

Lee was ignorant of it or the claim on wdiich it was based. He was approached by several different parties claiming to own it, who respectively offered to settle it at $700 and at $500. He was advised by reputable counsel that he had a good defence, which was a question of some doubt even in the court of appeals, where the vote was four to three against him. <em>Derham </em>v. <em>Lee, 87 N. Y. 599.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-11\">All these facts make the vice-chancellor\u2019s conclusion that his defence was, under the circumstances justifiable, eminently proper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-12\">TV. <em>The Defence. </em>\u2014 The <em>Supposed Arbitration. </em>\u2014 In addition to the authorities quoted by the vice-chancellor, to the effect that an award between the parties has no legal effect upon a claim not submitted to or considered by the arbitrators, see <em>Mt.
