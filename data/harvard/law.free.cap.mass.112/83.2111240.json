by the plaintiffs in this case; and the defendants, during their occupation under the leases, had, on previous occasions, paid taxes on the leased premises, apportioned as in the present case; but there was no evidence that when the defendants thus paid taxes, the mode of apportioning the same was disclosed to them, or was in question between them and the plaintiffs. The evidence of this usage was admitted against the objection and subject to the exception of the defendants. The valuation for taxation and assessment of taxes, made upon Amory Hall for the year 1870, was in the mode customary in the city of Boston, as follows: one or more assistant assessors, to whom were assigned specific districts, inspected estates, and estimated their value for the purposes of taxation, and reported their estimate, &amp;c., to the board of assessors, and thus the whole valuation of the city was-obtained and reported, having reference to values on May 1, 1870, and the valuations thus obtained were completed and recorded on August 9, 1870, and on August 23, 1870, the rate of taxation was fixed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\">The Amory Hall premises included a small yard, of which some of the tenants, but not all of them, during the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>occupation under the leases, had the use either for purposes of light, air or storage; and the defendants Melvin &amp; Badger had such use of the yard in common with three other tenants. But the defendants R. <em>&amp; </em>T. C. Bacon had no use of the yard for any purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-5\">The defendants had occupied the premises under different leases. The other tenants of other parts of the building had had leases also, of different terms, and the rent had varied with them in the different terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">Upon the foregoing facts, the court ruled that plaintiffs were entitled to recover of the defendants taxes under the leases, apportioned as above, for the year 1870, and found for the plaintiffs. The defendants, in each case, alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-7\"><em>A. A. Ranney, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWr\">The offered evidence of usage was incompetent, and the usage proved was invalid. The matter of taxes was provided for by an express written contract, admitting of a reasonable interpretation, which usage could not enlarge, vary or control. <em>Insurance Companies </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>1 Wall. 456. 1 Smith's Lead. Cas. (6th Am. ed.) 681. <em>Macomber </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>13 Pick. 175, 181 and 182. <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Rotch, </em>12 Pick. 107. <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>7 Allen, 29, 37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-8\">If the taxes are to be apportioned <em>pro </em>rata, according to the rents paid by the different tenants, the contract requires them to be apportioned according to the rents paid under the leases existing at the time when the defendants\u2019 leases were given. The usage to apportion according to the rents in fact paid on the first of May of each year, under contracts made between the lessors and other tenants, subsequently to the defendants\u2019 lease, contravenes the law and violates the written contract. It is unreasonable to make the apportionment according to the rents actually paid, because the defendants are thereby subject to the lessors\u2019 power to let other portions of the building at prices which they see fit, and the defendants are thus at the mercy of the lessor. Reason and justice require an apportionment according to the relative value of the leasehold premises, compared with the whole value as estimated by the assessors for the whole estate. <em>Wall </em>v. <em>Hinds, </em>4 Gray, 256. This point was not argued at all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>in <em>Codman </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>9 Allen, 335, and is not fully developed in the opinion of the court. Besides, the two cases differ. It does not appear in that case when the taxes were assessed or payable. They may have been assessed and paw4&gt;le within the term. There is a difference also between the covenants in the two cases, and for aught that appears, the different lessees in that case held under contemporaneous leases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-5\">The previous practice of the parties could not control or vary, or be used to construe the subsequent contract in writing. Besides, it appears that the taxes so apportioned were paid without knowledge of the mode in which the assessment had been made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-6\">The covenants in the leases provide for no apportionment, or mode of apportionment, of the taxes. This want cannot be supplied by paroi evidence of usage, because no provision is made for an apportionment in the contract, and the obligation to pay arises from an express written covenant. <em>Macomber </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>13 Pick. 175. <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>7 Allen, 29, 37. <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Weld, </em>14 Gray, 210, 212. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Thatcher, </em>15 Mass. 431, 432.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-7\">As the taxes were not actually payable or assessed during the defendants\u2019 term, none are collectible of them for the year 1870. In <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Libbey, </em>1 Allen, 375, the taxes were found to have been assessed on May 1st. It is otherwise in the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-8\">In the second of these cases the defendants had no use of the yard; in the first, the defendants used it in common with other tenants. This is important, as bearing upon the apportionment and the validity of the alleged usage. In the defendants\u2019 lease, in one case, vacant land was included; in the other, it was not.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-9\"><em>S. Merwin, </em>for the plaintiffs, was not called upon.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b100-10\">Mobtom, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASY\">These actions are brought upon the covenants of leases, to recover the taxes assessed for the year 1870. In the leases the defendants covenant that they will pay \u201c all taxes and assessments whatsoever, which may be payable or assessed in respect of the premises, or any part thereof, during said term. The leased premises were parts of a large building which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>leased to several tenants. At the trial the presiding judge admitted evidence of a usage in Boston, in such cases, to apportion the whole tax assessed upon the building among the different tenants according to their respective rents. This question was directly decided in <em>Codman </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>9 Allen, 335. Though an estate is leased to several independent tenants, taxes are uniformly assessed upon the whole estate. The covenant of each tenant to pay taxes cannot be construed to mean the taxes upon the whole estate. From the nature of the case some mode of apportioning the whole tax must be contemplated by the parties. The usage ro apportion it in proportion to the rents paid by the tenants is a convenient and reasonable usage, and in the absence of any express stipulation upon the subject, the parties must be deemed to have contracted in reference to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The defendants also contend that as their leases expired on the first day of July, 1870, and as the board of assessors did not fix the rate of taxation and assess the tax until August, they are not bound by their covenants to pay the taxes for the year 1870. But it is immaterial when the valuation of estates is completed, or when the tax is payable. The assessment, when completed, relates back to the first of May, and the tax is in law regarded as assessed on that day. The taxes for 1870 were therefore taxes \u201c assessed in respect of the premises during said term,\u201d and the defendants are liable for it under their covenants. The case of <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Libbey, </em>1 Allen, 375, is decisive upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
