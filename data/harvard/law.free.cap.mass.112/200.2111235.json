This right to a popular form of town government was guarded most jealously. Snow\u2019s Hist, of Boston, <em>e. </em>61. p. 363. Quincy\u2019s Hist, of Boston, <em>ce. </em>1, 2. Dillon\u2019s Munic.

The strength of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as compared with that of her- sister states, lies now, as it always has, in her towns. 1 Elliott\u2019s Hist. New England, 182.

N: E. Hist. &amp; Geneal. Reg., January and April 1870. Dillon\u2019s Munic. Corp. <em>supra. </em>The Constitution, prior to 1821, guaranteed to every citizen of this state a popular form of municipal government. The amendment of 1821, by its express limitations, still preserves this right to the citizens of any town, until the town has twelve thousand inhabitants, and guarantees it even then, unless a majority of the inhabitants of the town, voting at a meeting duly warned and holden for that purpose, give their consent and make the necessary application to the General Court for a representative form si government. These corporate rights, immunities, and privileges appertaining to each town in the state cannot be taken away except in accordance with the Constitution, and in a constitutional manner. The annexation of Brookline to Boston by this act establishes a city government, that is, a representative government, in an entire town where a town government now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>exists. Thus the citizens of Brookline will have a representative government before they have twelve thousand people within their limits, and before the majority have given their consent and made the requisite application to the Legislature. There will be, then, either a direct violation or an evasion of the Constitution. The popular form of government in Brookline will have been changed for a representative government, in utter disregard of express constitutional limitations. In construing this clause of the Constitution, whether the letter of the text is strictly adhered to, or whether every aid is employed which contemporary history can furnish to explain what it intends, the conclusion is, that this amendment, with its limitations, is the only protector and conservator of that popular form of government, which is the distinguishing characteristic of the municipalities of this state, and that it is so framed as to protect this right from violation in every possible case which may arise under it. The language employed is broad and comprehensive in the extreme. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>1 Wheat. 304, 326; <em>S. C. </em>Story on Const. U. S. \u00a7 422.

An injunction is asked to prevent proceedings by the city or town under the act, with a prayer that it may be declared void, and for general relief. To this there is a general demurrer for want of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The question whether this court has jurisdiction to grant the relief asked in favor of private citizens against the contemplated alleged illegal action of these municipalities, was not argued and 'a not considered by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>By the amendment of the Constitution relied on, power is given -\u00bfo the General Court to erect city governments in any \u201c corporate town or towns of this Commonwealth,\u201d and to confer such powers as may be necessary for the government thereof, with the proviso that \u201c no such government shall be erected in any town not containing twelve thousand inhabitants, nor unless it be with the consent and on the application of a majority of the inhabitants of such town present and voting thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The bill alleges that the town of Brookline did not contain twelve thousand inhabitants, and that the act in question was passed by the Legislature without first obtaining the consent and without the application of a majority of the inhabitants of the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The court are of opinion that the demurrer is well taken. The control of the General Court over the territorial division of the state into cities, towns, and districts, unless controlled by some specific constitutional limitation, must necessarily be supreme. It is incident to that sovereign power which regulates the performance of public and political duties. The rights and franchises of such corporations are granted only to this end, and they may be modified and changed in their territorial limits as public convenience and necessity require. The inhabitants do not derive private or personal rights under the act of incorporation; they acquire no vested right in those forms of municipal government which exist under general laws in towns, as distinguished from those by which the affairs of cities are regulated. If injuriously affected by legislative action upon these political relations, within constitutional limits, the courts can afford no remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">This power of the General Court it was not the intention of the amendment in question to limit or affect. It has no application to the annexation, by the authority of the Legislature, of a town or part of a town to a city already existing. It has express reference to the erection of a city government in the place of a town government within the same town limits. We are referred by the defendants to many acts of the Legislature annexing towns and parts of towns to cities, showing that this has been the uniform construction of the article in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\n<em>Demurrer sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b219-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Memoranda.</p>\n<p id=\"AyZo\">On the twenty-eighth day of June, 1873, Chief Justice Chapman died at Fluelen in Switzerland, having held the office of Chief Justice since the seventh day of February, 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"ADu\">On the fifth day of September, 1873, Mr. Justice Gray was appointed Chief Justice, in place of Chief Justice Chapman, deceased, and took his seat upon the bench as such on the ninth day of September, at the term of the court then held at Pittsfield in the County of Berkshire.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
