Fettner, Jennifer Trevino, and Jason Allen filed suit against 'Defendant-Appellee Castlepoint National Insurance Company, formerly known as SUA Insurance Company, in Texas state court. Plaintiffs contended that they were entitled to recover on a commercial liability policy that Castlepoint issued to a general contractor that worked on Plaintiffs\u2019 homes. Following removal to federal court, Castlepoint filed three separate motions for summary judgment, arguing that Plaintiffs\u2019 extra-contractual claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and that Plaintiffs could not recover under the policy. The district court granted two of the motions for summary judgment, and Plaintiffs timely appealed. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b752-16\">The instant case arises from the efforts of Plaintiffs-Appellants Jay Broughton, Chrystal Broughton, David A. Fettner, Jennifer Trevino, and Jason Allen, to recover damages for alleged construction and design defects in their homes. In or around 2005, Hogar Builders, LLC (Ho-gar)\u2014a general contractor in Houston, Texas\u2014began development and construction of a cluster of five homes in Houston identified as Units A, B, C, D, and E. Plaintiffs Jay and Chrystal Broughton purchased and moved, into Unit D in January 2007, and Plaintiffs Jennifer Trevino and Jason Allen purchased and moved into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Unit C in March 2007. After purchasing these homes and moving in, Plaintiffs allegedly discovered substantial and multiple construction and design defects in their homes and complained to Hogar regarding these defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Around this period, Defendant-Appellee Castlepoint National Insurance Company, formerly known as SUA Insurance Company (Castlepoint), issued Hogar a general commercial liability policy (the Policy), which was made effective May, 16, 2007. The Policy provided insurance coverage to Hogar for bodily injury and property damage, as well as other forms of liability, but included a number of exclusions from coverage. As relevant to the instant matter, the policy contained a' \u201cTract Housing\u201d exclusion, excluding from coverage \u201c \u2018bodily injury*, \u2018property damage\u2019 or \u2018personal and advertising damage\u2019, ... caused, arising, directly or indirectly, out of, or related to an insured\u2019s or an insured\u2019s sub-contractor\u2019s operations ... that are incorporated into a \u2018tract housing project or development.\u2019 \u201d As defined by the Policy, \u201cTract Housing\u201d meant \u201cany housing project or development that include[d] the construction of five (5) or more residential buildings in any or all phases of the project or development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Pursuant to the Policy, Hogar initiated a claim with Castlepoint in January 2009 for coverage related to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of construction defects. Following its investigation of this claim, Castlepoint determined that the defects alleged were excluded from coverage under the tract housing exclusion and sent Hogar a letter on July 28, 2009, informing Hogar that its claim was denied. Plaintiffs Jay Brough-ton, Chrystal Broughton, Trevino, and Allen subsequently filed suit against Hogar in Texas state court on June 23, 2011, asserting claims for fraud, violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), negligence, and breach of warranty. The parties in that case mediated and reached an agreement, and on July 23, 2013, the state court entered an Amended Agreed Final Judgment and awarded damages to Plaintiffs against Hogar. The Texas state court thereafter appointed Plaintiff David A. Fettner as Receiver to facilitate the collection of damages under the Amended Agreed Final Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">On June 26, 2014, Plaintiffs filed the instant suit against Castlepoint in Texas state court and filed their first amended petitions on July 16.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs asserted a number of extra-contractual claims, including violations of the Texas Insurance Code, violations of the DTPA, intentional misconduct, misrepresentation, and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, arising out of Castlepoint\u2019s previous denial of Ho-gar\u2019s claim for insurance coverage. Plaintiffs also asserted a breach of contract claim against Castlepoint, contending that it breached the Policy by failing to pay out Hogar\u2019s claim. In connection with these claims, Plaintiffs alleged \u2018that they were entitled to collect on the insurance claim in satisfaction of their Amended Agreed Final Judgment with Hogar as judgment creditors. Castlepoint removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on August 29, 2014, on the basis of diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Following removal, Castlepoint filed three separate motions for summary judgment. In the first motion, Castlepoint contended that Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract and extra-contractual claims under Texas state law were barred'by the applicable statutes of limitations. In the second motion, Castlepoint contended that Hogar failed to notify it of Plaintiffs\u2019 first suit and that this failure constituted prejudice, barring coverage under the Policy. And in the third motion, Castlepoint asserted that the housing tract exclusion in the Policy barred Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim because Hogar built five residential buildings and the Policy expressly excluded coverage where Hogar built five or more residential buildings. Plaintiffs opposed the motions. In opposing the third motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs argued that a supplemental questionnaire submitted to Hogar by Castlepoint, along with the Policy, created a fact issue of whether the Policy excluded coverage on construction of <em>more than five </em>units rather than on <em>five or more </em>units.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs further argued that deposition testimony of Castlepoint\u2019s alleged agent, Ralph Nannola, demonstrated that Hogar relied on the supplemental questionnaire when entering into the Policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">On October 28, 2015, the district court held a hearing on Castlepoint\u2019s motions for summary judgment. At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court held that, while Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim was not time barred, their extra-contractual claims under state law were barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Nonetheless, while the district court concluded that the breach of contract claim was timely, it dismissed this claim, holding that the tract housing exclusion in the Policy\u2014by its plain terms and \u2022 under Texas state law\u2014exempted Hogar\u2019s construction defects from coverage because Hogar\u2019s development included the construction of five or more residential buildings. The district court dismissed all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims with prejudice and entered final judgment on November 2, 2015. Plaintiffs timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Rogers v. Bromac Title Servs., L.L.C., </em>755 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir. 2014). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A genuine dispute of material fact exists \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). \u201cWe construe all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party when reviewing grants of motions for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting <em>Murray v. Earle, </em>405 F.3d 278, 284 (5th Cir. 2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">As to issues involving \u201ca district court\u2019s determination of state law,\u201d while sitting in diversity jurisdiction, our review is <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number><em>novo. Salve Regina Coll. v. Russell, </em>499 U.S. 225, 231, 111 S.Ct. 1217, 113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991). In resolving issues of state law, \u201cwe are bound to apply the law as interpreted by the state\u2019s highest court.\u201d <em>Barfield v. Madison Cty., </em>212 F.3d 269, 271-72 (5th Cir. 2000). As the district court applied Texas law and all parties agree as to its application, we look to Texas state law in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">III. THE DISTRICT COURT\u2019S GRANT OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">On appeal, Plaintiffs\u2019 only contention is that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their breach of contract claim because the supplemental questionnaire and deposition testimony of Nan-nola created a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the Policy excluded Hogar\u2019s construction defects from coverage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We find that the district court did not err because Question 14 of the supplemental questionnaire and the deposition testimony were not material to Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim under Texas law. <em>See Gibson v. Rich, </em>44 F.3d 274, 277 n.7 (5th Cir. 1995) (noting that facts that are \u201cnot material or necessary to [a] case ... d[o] not preclude summary judgment\u201d). Under Texas law, Plaintiffs as judgment creditors \u201cstep[ ] into the shoes\u201d of Hogar and are bound by the Policy between Hogar and Castlepoint. <em>Stonewall Ins. Co. v. Modern Expl., Inc., </em>757 S.W.2d 432, 434 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 1988, no writ). We have noted that, \u201c[u]nder Texas law, the same general rules apply to the interpretation of contracts and insurance policies.\u201d <em>Aubris Res. LP v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>566 F.3d 483, 486 (5th Cir. 2009). Accordingly, \u201c[wjhen construing a contract [or insurance policy], the court\u2019s primary concern is to give effect to the written expression of the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d <em>Forbau v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>876 S.W.2d 132, 133 (Tex. 1994). And \u201c[w]hen terms are defined in an insurance policy, those definitions control the interpretation of the policy.\u201d <em>Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Knott, </em>128 S.W.3d 211, 219 (Tex. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Plaintiffs do not contend that the Policy\u2019s housing tract exclusion, on its face, unambiguously excluded claims for construction defects where Hogar built five or more units, thereby negating Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim. Instead they assert that Question 14 of the supplemental questionnaire submitted to Hogar and Nannola\u2019s deposition testimony create a genuine dispute of material fact that the exclusion, despite its terms, actually only applied when Hogar built more than five residential buildings. However, the questionnaire and deposition testimony are not part of the Policy and are, in fact, parol evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Sun Oil Co. (Delaware) v. Madeley, </em>626 S.W.2d 726, 731-32 (Tex. 1981) (noting parol evidence is evidence extrinsic to a contract). Although parol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>evidence may be introduced to determine the meaning of ambiguous terms in a policy, \u201c[o]nly where a contract is first determined to be ambiguous may [a] court[] consider the parties\u2019 interpretation and admit extraneous evidence to determine the true meaning of the instrument.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v. CBI Indus., Inc., </em>907 S.W.2d 517, 520 (Tex. 1995) (citation omitted). \u201cParol evidence is <em>not </em>admissible for the purpose of creating an ambiguity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the district court correctly concluded, the Policy unambiguously excludes the kind of work performed by Hogar from coverage. Therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 parol evidence is not admissible under Texas law and not material to their breach of contract claim. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cWhether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to decide by looking at the contract as a whole in light of the circumstances present when the contract was entered.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">In arguing that the court should have considered this parol evidence, Plaintiffs point to our unpublished decision in <em>Star-Tex Resources, L.L.C. v. Granite State Insurance Co., </em>553 Fed.Appx. 366 (5th Cir. 2014) (per curiam) (unpublished). There we noted that, under the eight corners rule in Texas law\u2014applying to an insurer\u2019s duty to defend\u2014there was a narrow exception to admitting the use of extrinsic evidence \u201conly when relevant to an independent and discrete coverage issue, not touching on the merits of the underlying third-party claim,\u201d and \u201cwhen it [was] initially impossible to discern whether coverage [was] potentially implicated.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). But Plaintiffs misunderstand the application of the eight corners doctrine. That doctrine is not at issue in this breach of contract claim, but rather applies in duty to defend cases in which courts must determine an insurer\u2019s duty to defend based on allegations in the pleadings and the language of an insurance policy. See <em>Northfield Ins. Co. v. Loving Home Care, Inc., </em>363 F.3d 523, 528 (5th Cir. 2004). And, as previously mentioned, the language of the Policy unambiguously demonstrates that coverage was not implicated here. The district court ultimately did not err in granting summary judgment against Plaintiffs on their breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b752-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\">. Plaintiffs Trevino and Allen, with Fettner acting as Receiver, filed suit in the 295th Judicial District, of Harris County, Texas. Plaintiffs Jay and Chrystal Broughton, with Fettner acting as Receiver, separately filed suit in the 164th Judicial District of Harris County, Texas. Because both sets of Plaintiffs asserted the same claims and had their actions consolidated following removal, we refer to them as Plaintiffs here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-5\">. In particular, Plaintiffs pointed to Question 14 of the Supplemental Questionnaire, which asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">14. Do you work on condominiums, townhouses, apartments or tracts over 5 units at any one time; except for repair or remodeling of not more than 5 units within a development at any given time?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-11\">. Castlepoint denied that Nannola was its agent. Because we find, that Nannola\u2019s testimony is not material to Plaintiffs' breach of contract claim as a matter of law, we decline to address whether he was or was not Castle-point\u2019s agent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\">.Although Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments on appeal raise issues as to the misrepresentation and intentional misconduct claims they pressed before the district court, Plaintiffs only challenge the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on their breach of contract claim. They did not brief their dismissed extra-contractual claims. Therefore, Plaintiffs waive any argument on appeal as to the other claims dismissed by the district court. <em>See United States v. Thibodeaux, </em>211 F.3d 910, 912 (5th Cir. 2000) (\"It has long been the rule in this circuit that any issues not briefed on appeal are waived.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"A-aS\">.Plaintiffs appear to imply in their arguments that Question 14 of the supplemental questionnaire was incorporated into the Policy. We find any implicit argument on this point unavailing. Plaintiffs do not point to any part of the Policy specifically referencing or incorporating Question 14 of the supplemental questionnaire. Instead they suggest that the Representations provision of the Policy implicitly incorporates this questionnaire. This provision, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-11\">6.Representations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-12\">By accepting this policy, you agree:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>a. The statements in the Declarations are accurate and complete;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-19\">b. Those statements are based upon representations you made to us; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-20\">e. We have issued this policy in reliance upon your representations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-21\">But the Declarations do not reference Question 14 either, and the Policy included a merger clause stating that the Policy \"contained] all the agreements [between the parties] concerning the insurance afforded.\" The Policy did not incorporate Question 14 of the supplemental questionnaire.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
