Lomas-Torres challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). He contends that the court based the variance on old convictions. He further asserts that the court failed to consider mitigating factors regarding his reason for returning to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Because Lomas-Torres failed to object to the reasonableness of his sentence, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir. 2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In reviewing a non-guidelines sentence for substantive reasonableness, we consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range, to determine whether as a matter of substance, the sentencing factors in section 3553(a) support the sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Gerezano-Rosales, </em>692 F.3d 393, 400 (5th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">When imposing Lomas-Torres\u2019s sentence, the district court assessed the facts and provided specific reasons consistent with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to support its determination that a sentence outside of the guidelines range was necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing. The record establishes that the district court considered Lomas-Torres\u2019s mitigating facts but concluded that an above-guidelines sentence was nevertheless warranted in light of other factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). Under the totality of the circumstances, including the significant deference that is given to the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the district court\u2019s reasons for its sentencing decision, Lomas-Torres fails to show that the district court erred, plainly or otherwise, in imposing his 27-month above-guidelines sentence. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>see Gerezano-Rosales, </em>692 F.3d at 400-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b750-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-19\">.' Lomas-Torres acknowledges our precedent, but notes that the circuits are divided on this point and therefore wishes to preserve the issue. for possible review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
