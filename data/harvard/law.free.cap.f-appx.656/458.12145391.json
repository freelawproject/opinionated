Plaintiffs-Appellees are medically fragile children who suffer from serious conditions that, under the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (\u201cEPSDT\u201d) provision of the Medicaid Act and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), entitle them to in-home nursing services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Georgia Department of Community Health (\u201cDCH\u201d) offers these services to Plaintiffs and children like them under the Georgia Pediatric Program (\u201cGAPP\u201d). In the underlying suit, Plaintiffs successfully blocked DCH from reducing their hours of nursing care and from evaluating requests for nursing care using criteria other than medical necessity. Plaintiffs sought attorneys\u2019 fees for their efforts, and the district court awarded them $837,847.50. Finding no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s award, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">A. Plaintiffs\u2019 Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">The district court\u2019s docket for this case lists 234 entries between 2008 and 2015. Those entries include seven hearings and a three-day bench trial. Essentially, Plaintiffs sought to prevent DCH from reducing their hours of nursing care. Early in the proceedings, the district court determined that \u201ca policy of not providing services where it is medically necessary is inconsistent with the Medicaid Act....\u201d Despite the district court\u2019s clear pronouncement on this issue, DCH continued reducing Plaintiffs\u2019 hours of,care. As a result, Plaintiffs had to move again and again for injunctive relief to preclude DCH from doing so. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>total, the district court granted Plaintiffs three temporary restraining orders, two preliminary injunctions, three permanent injunctions, and a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The district court issued these injunctions at critical moments for Plaintiffs. For example, one order enjoined DCH to approve 24-hour post-surgical care for six to eight weeks while Plaintiff M.H. was in a body cast. To put the court\u2019s relief into perspective, DCH had offered Plaintiff M.H. 24-hour care for a mere three days. Similarly, in 2012, the district court intervened on behalf of Plaintiff Z.R. when DCH tried to cut back on the hours of care he had been receiving for the prior nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">B. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In 2013, the district court ruled on and granted DCH\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on seven of Plaintiffs\u2019 nine remaining claims. The court found, for example, that Plaintiffs had failed to cite any evidence that DCH had violated its duty to inform families of the scope of services available to them under EPSDT. On the other claims\u2014claims largely attacking DCH\u2019s procedures for reviewing requests for care\u2014the court similarly determined that Plaintiffs had failed to provide evidence of harm or wrongdoing. Importantly, though, the court denied summary judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 central, substantive claims und\u00e9r Medicaid and ADA, concluding that a determination of the number of medically necessary nursing hours Plaintiffs required presented a question of material fact. The district court ultimately resolved these claims in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor at a bench trial. So\u2014critical to this case\u2014the claims decided in DCH\u2019s favor did not affect Plaintiffs\u2019 ultimate and core relief: safeguarding the children\u2019s hours of nursing care from DCH\u2019s improper reductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">C. Plaintiffs\u2019 Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">After Plaintiffs succeeded at the bench trial on their claims under Medicaid and ADA, they moved to recover attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (The Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976) (the \u201cAct\u201d). The Act allows a plaintiff to recover attorneys\u2019 fees if the plaintiff is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in a suit seeking to privately enforce a plaintiffs civil rights. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1976). After the parties submitted briefing, the district court awarded $837,847.50 in attorneys\u2019 fees. That figure accounted for both Plaintiffs\u2019 voluntary reduction of hours from 2,391.65 to 2,241.125 and the court\u2019s further reduction of those hours by ten percent for claims dismissed early in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">On appeal, DCH does not dispute that Plaintiffs were a prevailing party and thus entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees. Instead, DCH disputes how the district court calculated the hourly rate and the reasonable number of hours Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel expended on the litigation. DCH argues that Plaintiffs did not obtain excellent results in the litigation and that the district court\u2019s order does not allow us to meaningfully review the hourly rates and the number of hours claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">We review a district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the abuse-of-diseretion standard. Under this standard, the district court enjoys \u201ca range of choice ..., so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>888 F.2d 732, 745 (11th Cir. 1989). Still, we \u201cclosely scrutinize questions of law decided by the district court in reaching a fee award,\u201d <em>Clark v. Hous. Auth. of City of Alma, </em>971 F.2d 723, 728 (11th Cir. 1992), and require that the district court \u201carticulate its rulings in sufficient detail to enable us to accomplish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>meaningful review.\u201d <em>Adams v. Mathis, </em>752 F.2d 553, 554 (11th Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, a prevailing party is entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1976). Designed to in-centivize private enforcement of civil-rights laws, this legislation represents a key exception to the American Rule. <em>See, e.g., City of Riverside v. Rivera, </em>477 U.S. 561, 576, 106 S.Ct. 2686, 2695, 91 L.Ed.2d 466 (1986). \u201cCongress enacted \u00a7 1988 specifically because it found that the private market for legal services failed to provide many victims of civil rights violations with effective access to the judicial process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cBecause civil rights litigants are often poor, and judicial remedies are often non-monetary, the Act shifts the costs of litigation from civil rights victim to civil rights violator.\u201d <em>Dowdell v. City of Apopka, </em>Flor<em>ida, </em>698 F.2d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir. 1983). This cost-shifting incentive is highly relevant here, where lengthy and costly litigation\u2014resulting in injunctive relief only\u2014 would otherwise leave Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys without proper compensation and discourage attorneys from taking such legitimate cases. <em>See Rivera, </em>477 U.S. at 575-76, 106 S.Ct. at 2695.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">A. Plaintiffs Were a Prevailing Party</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">To recover attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, a plaintiff must be a prevailing party. <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 432, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1935, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). A party prevails \u201cwhen actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 111-12, 113 S.Ct. 566, 573, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992). Usually, an injunction or declaratory judgment meets this standard. <em>Lefemine v. Wideman, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 9, 11, 184 L.Ed.2d 313 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">DCH does not dispute that Plaintiffs were a prevailing party. Because Plaintiffs here obtained substantial relief, we agree. The district court enjoined DCH from reducing Plaintiffs\u2019 hours of nursing care and from employing criteria other than medical necessity to review requests for care. Because Plaintiffs directly benefited from this suit, the district court properly found that they were a prevailing party, entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">B. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Awarding $837,847.50 in Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">The lodestar\u2014the product of the reasonable hourly rate and the number of hours billed\u2014is the district court\u2019s analytical framework for awarding attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>See Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct. at 1939. That figure is entitled to a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d of validity, <em>Pennsylvania v. Del. Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>478 U.S. 546, 565, 106 S.Ct. 3088, 3098, 92 L.Ed.2d 439 (1986), but the district court can nonetheless adjust this figure upwards or downwards to account for, among other things, the plaintiffs success in the suit. <em>See Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 434, 103 S.Ct. at 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">\n<em>1. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Determining Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel\u2019s Reasonable Hourly Rates</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">DCH first contests the district court\u2019s conclusion on the reasonableness of Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 hourly rates. In support of its position, DCH complains that the court offered \u201cno discussion regarding why Plaintiffs\u2019 rates are deemed reasonable. ...\u201d We disagree. Because the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>trict court based its award on a sufficiently-detailed expert affidavit, we find that the court did not abuse its discretion in determining Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 reasonable hourly rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">We have defined the reasonable hourly rate as \u201cthe prevailing market rate in the relevant legal community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skills, experience, and reputation.\u201d <em>Norman v. Hous. Auth. of City of Montgomery, </em>836 F.2d 1292, 1299 (11th Cir. 1988). The district court reviews an expert affidavit on the prevailing market rate for \u201cdetail[s] .,. on matters such as similarity of skill, reputation, experience, similarity of case and client, and breadth of the sample of which the expert has knowledge.\u201d <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The expert affidavit that Plaintiffs presented in this case provided robust detail. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert opined that Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 rates of $400 and $425 per hour were actually at the low end of the range for similar attorneys doing similar work in the Northern District of Georgia, To support this conclusion, he cited his eight years\u2019 experience using national publications to help establish rates for 100 lawyers within his own firm. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert also cited Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 experience litigating under Medicaid regulations, specifically those regulations related to disabled children. He testified not just to the effectiveness of the attorneys\u2019 work but also to their efficiency, noting that they \u201cstaffed the matter very leanly ... avoiding duplication of effort.\u201d The district court credited this expert affidavit in its fees order, noting that \u201cPlaintiffs supported their fee applications with affidavits, including an expert affidavit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">DCH did not adequately rebut the reasonable rate presented by Plaintiffs\u2019 expert in his affidavit. Instead, DCH responded by stating only that Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys had, earlier in their careers, claimed lower rates. This response ignores our governing precedent,. which\u2014as the district court explained\u2014allows attorneys to be paid their current hourly rate to compensate for their delay in payment. <em>See Norman, </em>836 F.2d at 1306 (noting , that attorneys\u2019 current rates \u201cought to be given every consideration\u201d because of the delay in receiving payment).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by crediting Plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s un-rebutted affidavit in setting the reasonable hourly rates. It also provided a \u201creasonably specific explanation\u201d in relying on the expert affidavit to enable us to review how the court established the rates awarded. <em>Perdue v. Kenny A. ex rel. Winn, </em>559 U.S. 542, 558, 130 S.Ct. 1662, 1676, 176 L.Ed.2d 494 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">\n<em>2. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Determining the Number of Hours Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel Reasonably Expended in This Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">DCH next argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are not entitled to the full number of hours awarded because they did not obtain excellent results and because they lengthened the suit through obstructionist discovery tactics and an unsuccessful motion for class certification. Because the district court enumerated Plaintiffs\u2019 excellent results, because Plaintiffs reduced their hours in response to DCH\u2019s objections, and because the district court accounted for the early dismissal of some of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining the number of hours reasonably spent on this challenging and time-consuming litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">After determining the hourly rate, the district court ascertains \u201cthe number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>at 1939. That determination, rather than being subject to \u201ca precise rule or formula,\u201d is context-dependent. <em>Id. </em>at 436, 103 S.Ct. at 1941. Civil-rights litigation in particular presents special circumstances because the district court must account not just for the relief obtained on behalf of the individual litigants but also for the relief obtained on behalf of the public at large. <em>See Villano v. City of Boynton Beach, </em>254 F.3d 1302, 1307 (11th Cir. 2001). \u201c[V]indicating a constitutional right against a [public] defendant heightens the public benefit created by a lawsuit.\u201d <em>Id</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Also, because civil-rights suits sometimes involve common facts and related legal theories, the district court should not reduce a plaintiffs attorney\u2019s hours merely because the plaintiff won under some theories and not others. <em>See id. </em>at 1307. Simply put, \u201c[w]hether hours were reasonably expended on litigation is a different question than whether hours were necessary to the litigation, the latter standard being the more exacting of the two.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1308. Instead, the district court should focus on the thrust of the \u201coverall relief\u2019 obtained by the plaintiff. <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct. at 1940. But even in cases where a reduction in the number of hours is appropriate, the district court has the- discretion to simply make an across-the-board cut. <em>See Loranger v. Stierheim, </em>10 F.3d 776, 783 (11th Cir. 1994) (\u201cWhen faced with a massive fee application ... an hour-by-hour review is both impractical and a waste of judicial resources.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">DCH complains that the district court reduced the number of hours Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys claimed by only ten. percent, when, in DCH\u2019s view, Plaintiffs failed on nine of eleven claims. DCH asks us to recalculate Plaintiffs\u2019 hours or, alternatively, to remand the case to the district court with clear instructions for recalculation. We decline to do so because we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">First, Plaintiffs themselves voluntarily reduced the number of hours for which they sought compensation from 2,391.65 to 2,241.125. That reduction cut time expended on claims regarding transportation and notice, which were claims unrelated to the substantive relief that Plaintiffs eventually obtained; time expended on claims regarding a party that was ultimately dismissed; and time expended responding to DCH\u2019s motions to compel discovery. Nor\u2014as DCH overlooks in its briefing\u2014did Plaintiffs bill for any time spent on class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Second, as we have explained, the number of claims dismissed at summary judgment is not determinative of the proper award of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>See Hensley </em>at 435, 103 S.Ct. at 1940 (discouraging any view that treats complex litigation as \u201ca series of discrete claims\u201d). Instead,. \u201cthe most critical factor is the degree of success obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 103 S.Ct. at 1941. The district court addressed Plaintiffs\u2019 success when it concluded that Plaintiffs obtained \u201call of the main relief that they sought.\u201d To support its conclusion, the court cited its three temporary restraining orders, two preliminary injunctions, three permanent injunctions, and declaratory judgment\u2014all issued in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">The district court also emphasized that Plaintiffs \u201cobtained substantial amounts of nursing care ... and enjoined ... [DCH] from enforcing a policy to limit medically necessary skilled nursing services using criteria not based on medical necessity.\u201d Significantly, the court relied on the public benefit that Plaintiffs\u2019 success bestowed: As a result of the litigation, children statewide benefited from the state\u2019s change in policy under GAPP. <em>See, e.g., City of Riverside v. Rivera, </em>477 U.S. 561, 574, 106 S.Ct. 2686, 2694, 91 L.Ed.2d 466 (1986) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>(noting that \u201ca successful civil rights plaintiff often secures important social benefits....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Despite Plaintiffs\u2019 success, the district court itself accounted for DCH\u2019s defeat of certain claims by reducing the number of hours by ten percent for two claims dismissed early in the suit. On this record, we find no abuse of discretion in the awarding of $887,847.50 to Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">DCH argues in the alternative that, even if Plaintiffs did obtain substantial relief, they should not be permitted to profit from successes derived from the district court\u2019s earlier, incorrect interpretation of the Medicaid Act. That is, DCH argues that Plaintiffs should not receive fees for any work resulting from the district court\u2019s earlier orders that interpreted the Medicaid Act in a way inconsistent with' this Court\u2019s later decision in <em>Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In 2010, at both parties\u2019 request, the district court stayed discovery pending the outcome of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moore v. Reese, </em>637 F.3d 1220 (11th Cir. 2011), which ruled on the scope of DCH\u2019s ability to review claims under the Medicaid Act. As <em>Moore </em>later revealed, the district court incorrectly interpreted the Medicaid Act to mean that the state\u2019s sole role under GAPP was to screen providers\u2019 requests for fraud or abuse. <em>See Moore, </em>637 F.3d at 1259-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">But DCH cites nothing in the record to suggest that the district court would have otherwise reached a different outcome in the challenged orders. To the contrary, though the district judge may have incorrectly stated the law, the court\u2019s real concern was that DCH made decisions by ignoring physicians\u2019 advice entirely and by advancing a policy agenda unrelated to medical necessity\u2014the very same issues on which Plaintiffs ultimately secured relief. Under these circumstances, we find no reason why our decision in <em>Moore </em>affects the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">This litigation has now stretched on for a period of almost eight years. The district court, which has the \u201csuperior understanding of the litigation,\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941, because it presided over it, did not abuse its discretion in awarding Plaintiffs $837,847.50 in attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\">. Plaintiffs M.H., S.R., J.M., R.E., and Z.R. brought claims in this litigation.
