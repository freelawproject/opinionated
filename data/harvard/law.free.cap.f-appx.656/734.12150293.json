The motion was based on Amendment 782 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which amended the drug quantity table set forth at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), effectively lowering most drug-related base offense levels by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., Appendix C, Amend. 782. Under the amended version of \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), 4.5 kilograms or more of methamphetamine triggers the highest base offense level, 38. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). The district court denied the motion. It determined that because Meza-Flores was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of methamphetamine, his offense level was not reduced by Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">Meza-Flores moves this court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in his appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. His motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir. 1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). If the appeal is frivolous, this court may dismiss -it sua sponte under 5th CiR. R. 42.2. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not a second opportunity to challenge the appropriateness of the original sentence. <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir. 1995). In determining whether a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction based on an amendment to the Guidelines, the court \u201cshall substitute only [the amendment] for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). The district court correctly determined that Meza-Flores was ineligible for a sentence reduction based on the drug quantity\"attributed to him at the original sentencing hearing. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The appeal is without arguable merit; therefore, the motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n.24; 5th Cm. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b757-12\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R, 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
