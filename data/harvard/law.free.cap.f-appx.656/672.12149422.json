The district court denied her leave to proceed IFP on the ground that her appeal is not taken in good faith and is frivolous. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Newsome has challenged the district court\u2019s certification that her appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into Newsome\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-19\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits a sentence modification for a defendant that was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d In the two-step process for considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the first issue is whether the movant is eligible for a sentence reduction and then whether a reduction \u201cis warranted in whole or in part under the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-20\">Newsome challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that she is ineligible for a sentence reduction on the ground that her sentence was based on a plea agreement pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) rather than a subsequently lowered guideline range. A defendant whose sentence was \u201cimposed under a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement might be eligible for a reduction .under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where the agreement: (i) calls \u2018for the defendant to be sentenced within a particular Guidelines sentencing range;\u2019 (ii) provides \u2018for a specific, term of imprisonment\u2014such as a number of months\u2014but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>also make clear that the basis for the specified term is a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the offence to which the defendant pleaded guilty;\u2019 or (iii) \u2018explicitly employs a particular Guidelines sentencing range to establish a term of imprisonment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Benitez, </em>822 F.3d 807, 811 (5th Cir.2016) (quoting <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 522, 538-40, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) (Sotomayor, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"AfGl\">Newsome\u2019s plea agreement did not call for her (i) to be sentenced within a particular sentencing range; (ii) provide for a specific term of imprisonment that was based on a sentencing range applicable to her offense; or (iii) explicitly employ any particular range for determining her sentence. <em>See Benitez, </em>822 F.3d at 811. The agreement does not reference any particular sentencing range or offense level. Moreover, the parties stipulated to a sentence of 108 months, and there is nothing tethering that sentence to the drug quantity involved in the offense or to the corresponding guideline range of 84 to 105 months of imprisonment. The only basis for the upward departure that is apparent from the record is the district court\u2019s reference in its statement of reasons to the binding plea agreement that had been accepted by the court. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C), Because Newsome\u2019s sentence was not \u201cbased on\u201d the drug quantity involved in the offense or the advisory guideline range, she was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B), Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011). This appeal does not involve \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Newsome\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b695-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
