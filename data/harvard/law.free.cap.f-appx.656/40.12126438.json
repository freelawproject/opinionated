Humphrey. </em>The district court then granted the parties\u2019 joint motion to dismiss Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s remaining state law claims. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">I. FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b63-14\">Plaintiff-Appellant Timothy Dodds (\u201cMr. Dodds\u201d) and his wife Dianna Dodds (\u201cMs. Dodds\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are the parents of Timothy Dodds, Jr. (\u201cTimothy\u201d). Timothy was previously married to Adrianna Longoria (\u201cMs. Longoria\u201d), Timothy and Ms. Longo-ria, who are no longer married, have two young children to which Mr. and Ms. Dodds are grandparents. Ms. Longoria is now married to Antonio Longoria (\u201cMr. Longoria\u201d) but continues to share custody of her two children with Timothy.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-15\">According to Mr. Dodds, on the evening of September 17, 2011, he and Ms. Dodds received a call from Timothy stating that he had received a call from his oldest child complaining that both children were at Ms. Longoria\u2019s home alone and they were afraid. After receiving a \u201cwelfare call\u201d from an anonymous caller stating that the children were home alone, a Yorktown Police Department dispatcher contacted Sergeant Eduardo Garcia, Jr. (\u201cSgt. Garcia\u201d), who lived next door to the Longorias, and requested that he go to the home to find out if the children were there alone. When Sgt. Garcia arrived to the home, both Mr. and Ms. Longoria were there. Alex Campbell, a certified detention officer and a friend of the Longorias, was also there. Sgt. Garcia, Campbell, and Mr. Longoria were all on the front porch of the Longori-as\u2019 home when Mr. and Ms. Dodds arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-16\">The facts surrounding the remainder of the incident are somewhat in dispute but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>the record generally reflects that Ms. Dodds exited the vehicle first and walked toward the porch where Sgt. Garcia, Campbell, and Mr. Longoria were standing. Ms. Dodds asked where the children were and Sgt. Garcia identified himself as a police officer with the Yorktown Police Department and told Ms. Dodds to leave the premises. Mr. Dodds then exited the vehicle and began walking toward Ms. Dodds and the three men. Sgt. Garcia again identified himself as \u201cYorktown PD\u201d and told Mr. and Ms. Dodds to leave the premises. When Mr. and Ms. Dodds continued to ignore his commands to leave, Sgt. Garcia announced that he had a taser and told them that they would be arrested if they did not leave the premises. According to Defendants-Appellees, at this point Mr. Dodds went into a \u201cfighting stance\u201d and continued to advance toward Campbell with \u201cclinched fists.\u201d Sgt. Garcia then tased Mr. Dodds <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and called an emergency medical services transport (\u201cEMS\u201d). The record also reflects that, at this time, Sgt. Garcia handed the taser to Campbell<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and instructed him to tase Mr. Dodds if he moved again. Once EMS arrived, Mr. Dodds declined to go to the hospital and both Mr. Dodds and Ms. Dodds were transported to the DeWitt County Jail where they were detained overnight, Mr. Dodds was arrested for criminal trespass, obstruction or retaliation, and terroristic threat. Ms. Dodds was arrested for criminal trespass and interference with the duties of a public servant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Mr. Dodds- was ultimately convicted of retaliation, a third-degree felony, and his conviction was affirmed on appeal. <em>See Dodds v. State, </em>No. 13-13-00288-cr, 2014 WL 6676774, at *8 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi Nov. 25, 2014); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 36.06(a)(1)(A),(e)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>: While the criminal proceedings were pending, Mr. Dodds filed the underlying civil rights suit against Sgt. Garcia and the City of Yorktown, Texas, alleging both federal and state law claims. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In that suit, Mr. Dodds alleged a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim and several other federal law claims which he does not advance on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">The civil suit was temporarily stayed pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings. Once Mr. Dodds\u2019 criminal conviction for retaliation was affirmed on appeal, the civil proceedings resumed and Defendants-Appellees filed a motion to dismiss Mr. Dodds\u2019 claims on grounds that they were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Agreeing that Mr. Dodds\u2019 claims were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Heck-barred, the district court granted Defendants-Appellees\u2019 motion and dismissed Mr, Dodds\u2019 federal law claims. The parties then filed a joint stipulation to dismiss Mr. Dodds\u2019 remaining state law claims which was also granted. Mr. Dodds now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">We conduct a de novo review of a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), applying the same standard as the district court. <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007). We accept \u201call well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted),</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">On appeal, Mr. Dodds\u2019 sole argument is that the district court erred in dismissing his excessive force claim. This court has consistently acknowledged that <em>\u201cHeck </em>prohibits a plaintiff from using a \u00a7 1983 suit to challenge the validity of his conviction or sentence, unless the plaintiff demonstrates that the conviction or sentence has in some way been reversed or invalidated.\u201d <em>Daigre v. City of Waveland, Miss., </em>549 Fed.Appx. 283, 286 (5th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citing <em>Bush v. Strain, </em>513 F.3d 492, 497 (5th Cir. 2008)). As a result, \u201ca plaintiffs claim is Heck-barred despite its theoretical compatibility with his underlying conviction if specific factual allegations in the complaint are necessarily inconsistent with the validity of the conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Bush, </em>513 F.3d at 498 n. 14 (citation omitted)). This is because \u201cfactual assertions in pleadings are ... judicial admissions <em>conclusively </em>binding on the party that made them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Davis v. A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>823 F.2d 105, 108 (5th Cir. 1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">In <em>DeLeon v. City of Corpus Christi, </em>we held that a plaintiffs excessive-force claims were NecA-barred because the complaint described \u201ca single violent encounter\u201d in which the plaintiff claimed he was an innocent participant and necessarily challenged his aggravated-assault conviction. 488 F.3d 649, 656-57 (5th Cir. 2007).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the other hand, we held in <em>Bush v. Strain </em>that a plaintiffs excessive-force claims were not barred because it was clear that she was referring to conduct that occurred \u201cafter she was restrained.\u201d 513 F.3d 492, 499 &amp; n. 18 (5th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">Here, we agree with the district court that many of Mr. Dodds\u2019 alleged facts in his First Amended Complaint are inconsistent with his conviction for retaliation, including his assertions that he never made any verbal or physical threats toward anyone and that Sgt. Garcia\u2019s claim to be a police officer was not credible.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As noted by the district court, these statements are in direct conflict with Mr. Dodds\u2019 conviction for retaliation, wherein it was shown that he intentionally or knowingly harmed or threatened to harm another person by unlawful act in retaliation for or on account of the service or status of another as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>public servant\u2014here, a police officer. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 36.06(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"ALm\">We disagree with Mr. Dodds\u2019 argument that the district court incorrectly applied the doctrine of <em>Heck v. Humphrey </em>in dismissing his claims. Mr. Dodds submits that \u201c[u]nder <em>Heck, </em>if there are any pleaded facts that are not inconsistent with the conviction that can support a claim for excessive force, <em>Heck </em>does not apply.\u201d (emphasis in original). However, as this court has stated, \u201c[w]hen a plaintiff alleges tort claims against his arresting officers, the district court must first consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his <em>conviction or </em>sentence... [i]f so, the claim is barred ... [.] \u201d <em>DeLeon, </em>488 F.3d at 652 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Our review of the record reveals that the district court correctly conducted this analysis under <em>Heck </em>in its review and ultimate dismissal of Mr. Dodds\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In support of his excessive force argument on appeal, Mr. Dodds also attempts to draw a temporal distinction between the first time Sgt. Garcia tased him and the subsequent times he alleges he was tased, arguing that because he was incapacitated after being tased once, any subsequent tasing amounted to excessive force. According to the Memorandum Opinion of the Texas Court of Appeals affirming Mr. Dodds\u2019 criminal conviction for retaliation, when Sgt. Garcia first deployed the taser, the leads \u201cdid not make contact\u201d with Mr. Dodds\u2019 body. <em>Dodds, </em>2014 WL 6676774, at *1. Consequently, Mr. Dodds continued to advance toward Sgt. Garcia and Campbell and picked up the taser leads himself, effectively closing the circuit, which caused him to actually be tased. <em>Id. </em>at *1-2. These events clearly conflict with Mr. Dodds\u2019 excessive force argument before this court that, after tasing him once, \u201cSgt. Garcia tased Appellant repeatedly after he had already been incapacitated ... [.] \u201d Moreover, in referencing Mr. Dodds\u2019 argument appealing his retaliation conviction, the appellate court recounted that he claimed that \u201chis threatening approach [toward Sgt. Garcia] was just a reaction to being struck by the Taser barb or constituted angry gesticulations directed toward Sergeant Garcia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *3. Again, these events are in direct conflict with Mr. Dodds\u2019 argument before the federal district court and on appeal that he never verbally or physically threatened anyone and that he was completely \u201cincapacitated\u201d after being tased by Sgt. Garcia, thereby converting any alleged subsequent tasings to the level of excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Additionally, the evidence in the record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion, which is not disputed by Mr. Dodds, that these events clearly constituted and arose from a \u201csingle violent encounter,\u201d all of which preceded Mr. Dodds\u2019 ultimate arrest. <em>See DeLeon, </em>488 F.3d at 656-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Since the specific factual allegations contained in Mr. Dodds\u2019 First Amended Complaint, as supported by his excessive force argument on appeal, are clearly inconsistent with the validity of his affirmed criminal conviction for retaliation, we hold that the district court did not err in dismissing his claims under <em>Heck v. Humphrey. See Daigre, </em>549 Fed.Appx. at 286-87; <em>see also, Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">For the fprgoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b63-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
