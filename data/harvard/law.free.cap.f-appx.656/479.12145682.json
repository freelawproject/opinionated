R. Crim. P. 35(b), to reduce Zuanetti\u2019s sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methylone. Zuanetti contends (1) the district court was bound by the Government\u2019s determination that she had rendered substantial assistance by testifying against a co-defendant, (2) erred by determining that Zuanetti\u2019s assistance was not substantial because the co-defendant was acquitted, and (3) erred by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-20\">The district court did not misapply Rule 35(b) or otherwise violate the law in denying the Government\u2019s motion to reduce Zuanetti\u2019s sentence. Zuanetti\u2019s plea agreement granted the Government the authority to determine whether Zuanetti provided substantial assistance so as to merit making a Rule 35(b) motion. 1\u215b did not give the Government the discretion to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>whether to <em>grant relief </em>under Rule 35(b), which discretion rests solely with the district court. <em>See Murphy v. United States, </em>634 F.3d 1303, 1313 (11th Cir. 2011); <em>Manella, </em>86 F.3d at 204 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Furthermore, the district court correctly applied Rule 35(b) by considering for itself whether Zuanetti had rendered substantial assistance meriting a reduction in- her sentence. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b)(3) (\u201cIn evaluating whether the defendant has provided substantial assistance, <em>the court </em>may consider the defendant\u2019s presentence assistance.\u201d (emphasis supplied)). We may not review the district court\u2019s conclusion on the merits of that question. <em>See Mamila, </em>86 F.3d at 203 (noting that a challenge to \u201cthe merits of the district court\u2019s Rule 35(b) determination\u201d is unreviewable).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-16\">. We do not consider Zuanetti\u2019s argument that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing on the issue of her assistance, because, unlike the parties in <em>United States v. Yesil, </em>991 F.2d 1527 (11th Cir. 1992), neither Zuanetti nor the Government requested an evidentiary hearing before the district court. <em>See Sunseri </em>v. <em>Macro Cellular Partners, </em>412 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir. 2005) (\"[C]ourts will turn a deaf ear to protests that an evidentiary hearing should have been convened but was not, where the protestor did not seasonably request such a hearing in lower court.\u201d (quotation marks and alteration omitted)),</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-21\">. We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 35(b) motion'as an \"otherwise final sentence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, which limits review to certain claims. <em>United States v. Manella, </em>86 F.3d 201, 202-03 (11th Cir. 1996). \"A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a Rule 35(b) motion is a discretionary one from which an appeal generally will not lie under \u00a7 3742.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203. A defendant may appeal the district court's denial of a Rule 35(b) motion, however, if the defendant\u2019s claim is that the district court misapplied Rule 35(b) and therefore imposed a sentence in violation of law. <em>See id. </em>In such a case, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of Rule 35(b). <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
