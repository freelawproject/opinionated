We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 17 July 1999 at approximately 8:00 p.m., plaintiff and her three-year-old daughter Jalicia Davis (\"Jalicia\") exited a vehicle parked on Morning Glory Avenue, a public street owned and maintained by the City. Jalicia observed other children on theplayground across the street and walked into the street towards the playground ahead of plaintiff. As Jalicia crossed the street, she was struck by a motor vehicle owned by Hassan Raheem Olivio and driven by Mica Jermaine Baldwin (\"Baldwin\"). Baldwin was driving under the influence of an impairing substance when the incident occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Jalica was thrown ninety-two feet by the impact, rendered unconscious, and taken by ambulance to Duke University Medical Center. As a result of the incident, Jalicia suffered severe injuries to her head and pelvic area, for which she received and continues to receive extensive therapy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff filed an action alleging that the City's negligence, i.e., its failure to install crosswalks, speed humps, or other devices warning approaching drivers of the presence of small children, resulted in Jalicia's injuries. The complaint failed to allege that the City waived governmental immunity by purchasing insurance. The City denied plaintiff's allegations, asserted the defense of governmental immunity, and moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the City's motion. Plaintiff appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The sole issue presented is whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the City based on governmental immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Governmental Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff contends the City was not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's negligence claims. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Summary judgment is the appropriate remedy when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2003). \"The showing required for summary judgment may be accomplished by proving an essential element of the opposing party's claim does not exist, cannot be proven at trial, or would be barred by an affirmative defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Dawes v.
