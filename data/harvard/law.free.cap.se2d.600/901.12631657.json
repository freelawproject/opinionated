That morning, in-school suspension (ISS) teacher Mr. Walter reported to Assistant Principal Johnny Owens (Owens) that C.C.M. and two other boys were skipping class. Walter remembered C.C.M. because he should have reported to ISS that day and failed to do so. Both Walter and Owens went to search for the three boys and located them on the second floor hallway. The boys were escorted to Owens' office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Owens telephoned each of the boys' parents to inform them of the incident and also of the corresponding punishment. Owensinformed C.C.M.'s mother that because her son had skipped ISS, his punishment would be different from the other two boys. On realizing that he was going to be given out-of-school suspension, C.C.M. \"became angry, very angry, [and] started shouting using some profanities.\" C.C.M. continued to shout when leaving Owens' office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Officer P. Simmons, the Wake County Sheriff's Department deputy assigned as a school resource officer (SRO), attempted to talk to C.C.M., but C.C.M. \"was really disrespectful to Officer Simmons.\" Owens came out of his office to inform C.C.M. that his behavior toward Officer Simmons was unacceptable, but C.C.M. continued \"talking to Officer Simmons being disrespectful.\" Again, C.C.M. was very angry and using profanity. When Officer Simmons attempted to calm C.C.M. down, telling him it was not worth getting this upset, C.C.M. said \"something to the effect he didn't have to listen to anybody there and he continued using profanities\" and would not calm down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Owens telephoned C.C.M.'s mother a second time to inform her that it would be better if she came to pick up C.C.M. immediately before he got into more trouble. While Owens was on the telephone with C.C.M.'s mother, C.C.M. continued talking to Officer Simmons in a disrespectful manner. C.C.M.'s mother asked to speak to her son on the telephone, which he did. While talking to his mother, C.C.M. suddenly threw the telephone down on to a desk and thereafter began walking out of the office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Simmons instructed C.C.M. to sit down; however, hecontinued walking toward the door. C.C.M. then \"tried to push through [Officer Simmons] to go out the door as [she] was instructing him to sit down in a chair.\" A brief struggle ensued before Officer Simmons was finally able to subdue C.C.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer Simmons filed juvenile petitions alleging C.C.M. was a delinquent juvenile in that he violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-223\">\n    N.C.

These matters came for hearing at the 3 June 2003 juvenile session of Wake County District Court with the Honorable Michael R. Morgan presiding. By orders dated 3 June 2003, C.C.M. was adjudicated delinquent for violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-223\">\n    N.C.

C.C.M. filed notice of appeal on 9 June 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The issues on appeal are whether the juvenile court erred in failing to: (I) grant C.C.M.'s motion to dismiss the charge of disorderly conduct; and (II) dismiss the charge of resisting, delaying or obstructing an officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   C.C.M. first argues that the juvenile court erred in failing to grant his motion to dismiss the charge of disorderly conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To withstand a motion to dismiss charges contained in a juvenile petition, there must exist substantial evidence of each material element of the offense charged.\n   <em>\n    In re Bass,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8520702\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/77/110/#p115\">\n    77 N.C.

After C.C.M. was located on the second floor hallway, escorted to the assistant principal's office, and informed of his punishment, he became angry and began shouting profanities. The assistant principal testified that the shouting was disruptive not only to the school but also to those in the office. The assistant principal telephoned C.C.M.'s mother first to report the \"skipping of class\" incident, and then a second time to request sheimmediately pick up C.C.M. While talking on the telephone to his mother, C.C.M. suddenly slammed the phone on the assistant principal's desk, refused to sit down when instructed by the SRO, talked disrespectfully to the SRO, and attempted to push the SRO out of the way in order to leave the office. Despite this evidence C.C.M. contends his level of interference was not adequately substantial to sustain a conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In reviewing the case of\n   <em>\n    In re Pineault,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9249369\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/152/196/\">\n    152 N.C.

This Court concluded that given the severity and nature of the juvenile's language, coupled with the fact that a teacher was required to stop teaching her class for at least several minutes, the juvenile's actions substantially interfered with the operation of a classroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our Court also re-examined the issue of \"substantial interference\" in the case of\n   <em>\n    In re M.G.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190967\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/156/414/\">\n    156 N.C.

In\n   <em>\n    M.G.,\n   </em>\n   the juvenile, who was 14 years of age at the time of the hearing, was adjudicated delinquent pursuant to of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-288.4\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-288.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6) for yelling a profanity at a group of students in a hallway. The teacher who reported the incident left his assigned position on lunch duty in the cafeteriato escort the juvenile to the school detention center, and reported the incident to the school's dean and SRO before returning to his lunch duty. On appeal, the juvenile argued the juvenile court erred by failing to dismiss the disorderly conduct charge. Our Court concluded that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, was sufficient to establish that the juvenile's conduct substantially interfered with the operation of the school. In reaching this holding, the Court noted the evidence indicated that the reporting teacher was away from his assigned duties for at least several minutes, which was evidence sufficient to show substantial interference with school operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Pineault\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    M.G.\n   </em>\n   and given C.C.M.'s use of profanity, coupled with the fact that both the assistant principal and the ISS teacher were required to stop performing their duties to look for C.C.M., as well as the SRO who had to physically subdue him, there existed sufficient evidence to establish that C.C.M.'s conduct substantially interfered with the operation of the school. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Next, C.C.M. argues that the juvenile court erred in failing to dismiss the charge of resisting, delaying or obstructing an officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure, Rule 10(b)(3), provides that an offender who fails to move to dismiss an action at the close of all of the evidence may not challenge on appeal the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the crime charged. N.C.R.App. P. 10(b)(3). The transcript reveals that C.C.M. only presented a motion to dismiss the charge of disorderly conduct, not resisting, delaying or obstructing an officer. C.C.M. has therefore waived his right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See In re Clapp,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11091655\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/137/14/#p19\">\n    137 N.C.
