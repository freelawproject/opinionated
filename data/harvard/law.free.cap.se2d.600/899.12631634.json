Defendant was sentenced to 14 to 17 months imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 9 October 2002, defendant's girlfriend (Buchanan), drove with her daughter, defendant, and defendant's sister (Stroup) from Gastonia to Lincolnton. Stroup was trying to sell her gun because she needed money to get her two sons out of jail and had asked Buchanan to give her a ride to a potential buyer in Lincolnton. After learning that the potential buyer was unable to purchase thegun that day, Stroup asked Buchanan to drive her to the Gastonia County jail to see her sons. Buchanan drove to Gastonia with Stroup in the front seat together with Buchanan's daughter and defendant in the backseat. When Stroup got into the vehicle, she placed the gun next to her; defendant had been drinking; and there was also a twelve-pack of beer on the floor of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon their arrival at the jail, Buchanan parked the vehicle and Stroup went inside. Buchanan's daughter changed to the front passenger seat. During this period, Officer Shane Johnson (Officer Johnson), a patrolman with the Gastonia Police Department, entered the parking lot. On hearing a male yell \"bitch\" from the direction of Buchanan's vehicle, Officer Johnson approached the vehicle where he observed defendant in the backseat, behind the front passenger's seat, leaning forward with his arm repeatedly reaching forward between the seat and the door. When Officer Johnson asked defendant to get out of the vehicle, he observed a .357 handgun between the passenger's seat and the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Officer Johnson thereafter took defendant to the magistrate's office and charged him with several offenses, including possession of a firearm by a felon. While there, defendant spontaneously stated, \"I told them to hide that thing.\" Defendant's remark was not in response to any question. At the time of the statement, defendant was aware that he had been charged with possession of a firearm by a felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant raises two issues on appeal, which are whether thetrial court: (I) committed plain error by permitting defendant to stipulate to a prior conviction without providing a limiting jury instruction; and (II) erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss for insufficiency of evidence regarding constructive possession of a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court committed plain error by permitting defendant to stipulate to a prior conviction without providing a limiting jury instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a general rule, failure to object to alleged errors precludes raising those errors on appeal. N.C.R. App. P. 10(b)(1). To be entitled to relief, a defendant must show that plain error was committed.\n   <em>\n    State v. Faison,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11656932\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/128/745/\">\n    128 N.C.

Before granting relief based on plain error, the appellate court must be convinced that absent the error the jury probably would have reached a different verdict.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=497%20S.E.2d%20111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The plain error rule . . . is always to be applied cautiously and only in the exceptional case where, after reviewing the entire record, it can be said that the claimed error is a fundamental error, something so basic, so prejudicial, so lacking in its elements that justice cannot have been done.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Odom,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8565416\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/307/655/#p660\">\n    307 N.C. 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 660,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=300%20S.E.2d%20375\">\n    300 S.E.2d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 378 (1983) (internal quotations omitted) (citations omitted). A defendant alleging plain error has a much heavier burden than that imposed upon a defendant who has preserved his rights by timely objection pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1443.\n   <em>\n    State v. Walker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4696125\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/316/33/#p39\">\n    316 N.C. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20S.E.2d%2080\">\n    340 S.E.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,83 (1986). To show plain error and meet his burden, the defendant must establish that \"there is a reasonable possibility that, had the error in question not been committed, a different result would have been reached at the trial out of which the appeal arises.\" N.C.G.S. \u00a715A-1443(a) (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the instant case, defendant entered into a stipulation as to his prior felony of breaking and entering. At the charge conference, defense counsel entered into the following colloquy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [DEFENSE]: I don't know if there is anything . . . in terms of deciding his guilt or innocence, not letting that prior conviction decide that. Of course it is an element of the crime . . . it has to be proven but other than for those limited purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   COURT: I don't know of a pattern instruction that would fit into what you are requesting . . . nor do I feel it would be appropriate. So unless you have something that you want to submit for me to consider, I will decline to make such an instruction. Anything else?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [DEFENSE]: \"No, Your Honor.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the trial court charged the jury, the court asked counsel whether there were any specific requests for corrections or additions to the charge. Defense counsel replied, \"There will be nothing from the defense, Your Honor.\" The jury instruction in pertinent part included the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [T]he State and the defendant have agreed that certain facts shall be accepted by you as true without further proof. The agreed facts in this case are that the defendant hadpreviously been convicted of breaking and entering in Lincoln County on September 9th of 1998. Since the parties have so agreed, you are to take these facts as true for the purpose of this case. Now the second element is that thereafter the defendant possessed a handgun. So the first element is that the defendant was convicted of a felony. The second element, that thereafter the defendant possessed a handgun.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During deliberations, the jury requested a written instruction regarding possession of a firearm by a felon, which the trial court provided, including defendant's stipulation to felony breaking and entering. The trial court asked both parties whether there were any objections to the jury's request. Defense counsel stated, \"No, Your [H]onor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant now argues on appeal that the trial court's failure to provide a limiting instruction on defendant's stipulation was plain error. Defendant neither objected to the trial court's instruction nor specifically requested a limiting instruction, despite an invitation by the trial court to do so. However, unless a defendant expressly requests a limiting instruction as to his prior conviction, the trial court is not required to provide one.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Absent defendant's stipulation, the State would have been required to prove the prior felony conviction as an element of the crime charged. Defendant however fails to show any error by the trial court. Moreover, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   the trial court erred in failing to give a limiting instruction, defendant cannot showprejudice: that is, a reasonable probability a different outcome would have been reached absent the alleged error. Defendant's assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant next argues the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss for insufficiency of the evidence to establish constructive possession of a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   When ruling on a motion to dismiss, the trial court must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, giving the State every reasonable inference to be drawn therefrom.\n   <em>\n    State v.
