From the judgment and commitment sentencing her to an active prison term of 103 to 133 months, defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant first argues that the judge who presided at her trial, the Honorable Steve A. Balog, erred in declining to recuse himself in light of his prior service as the elected District Attorney for Alamance County. In her \"Motion for Recusal of Assigned Judge[,]\" defendant alleged she had been prosecuted for several misdemeanors and one felony in Alamance County between 1987 and 1997, during Judge Balog's tenure as District Attorney. Shefurther claimed without explanation that Judge Balog's \"office\" had hired the current District Attorney in an unspecified capacity. In denying defendant's motion, Judge Balog stated \"for the record I do remember [defendant]'s name, but that is the only thing that I remember about [defendant]. I recognize that I've seen the name before, but that's all.\" Defendant argues that Judge Balog's former service as District Attorney during her previous prosecutions gave rise to \"an appearance of impropriety.\" Under these circumstances, she insists the judge should have either recused himself from her trial or referred the motion to another judge for hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The disqualification of a presiding judge in a criminal trial is governed by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1223 (2003), and Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct. Our statutes require recusal if a judge is \"[p]rejudiced against the moving party or in favor of the adverse party\" in a criminal proceeding. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1223(b)(1). Similarly, Canon 3(C)(1)(a) of the Code of Judicial Conduct calls for the recusal of a judge when \"his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where . . . [h]e has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A party seeking the disqualification of a judge bears the burden of producing \"substantial evidence that there exists such a personal bias, prejudice or interest on the part of the judge that he would be unable to rule impartially.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Fie,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4723431\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/320/626/#p627\">\n    320 N.C. 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 627,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=359%20S.E.2d%20774\">\n    359 S.E.2d 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 775 (1987);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a715A-1223(c) (providing that a motion for recusal \"must be accompanied by one or more affidavits setting forth facts relied upon to show the grounds for disqualification\"). The movant's evidence must show a \"personal disposition or mental attitude of the trial judge, either favorable or unfavorable, toward a party to the action before him.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant failed to satisfy her evidentiary burden under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1223(c), providing no affidavit or evidence to support her motion.\n   <em>\n    See County of Johnston v.

We further find that the circumstances here would not lead a reasonable person to question Judge Balog's personal objectivity in this case. Judge Balog was no longer affiliated with the district attorney's office at the time defendant committed the instant offense and had no role in the prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Cf. Mangum v.

Lacking any evidence of personal interest or bias which would warrant the finding of facts, Judge Balog was not required to set the matter for hearing before another judge and was free to summarily deny the motion.\n   <em>\n    Scott,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"798758\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/343/313/#p325\">\n    343 N.C. at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=471%20S.E.2d%20605\">\n    471 S.E.2d at 612-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We note that defendant's motion included an assertion that Judge Balog's tenure as District Attorney gave him personal knowledge of her prior convictions in Alamance County, which were used by the State at sentencing to establish her prior record level. We find no cause for disqualification on this ground and no prejudice to defendant, inasmuch as the court was free to take judicial notice of its own records.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

However, the record reveals the race of only seven members of the jury pool.
