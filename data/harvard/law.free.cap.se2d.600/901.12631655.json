Defendant moved to set aside the jury's guilty verdict on the ground that it was inconsistent with his acquittal on the breaking or entering charge. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant then entered a plea of guilty to habitual felon status and was sentenced to 121-155 months in the custody of the North Carolina Department of Corrections. After giving notice of appeal, defendant filed amotion for appropriate relief in the trial court, again asserting that his conviction for felonious larceny under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-72\">\n    N.C.

The jury made no finding as to the value of the stolen property.
