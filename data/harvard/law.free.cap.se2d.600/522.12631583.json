We conclude there was no error at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In January 2002, H.N. (\"the child\") was eight years old and lived with her father. Her parents were divorced, and she visited her mother, S.S., every other weekend. She and her ten-year-old brother (\"the brother\") (collectively, \"the children\") were visiting with S.S. on the weekend of 18 January 2002. S.S. had towork and asked defendant, who is her father and the children's grandfather, to babysit the children while she worked that night. Defendant lived in a camper trailer located directly behind Eric Crawford's (\"Crawford\") house. Crawford is S.S.'s ex-husband. Defendant often slept over at Crawford's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   S.S. dropped the children with defendant at Crawford's house. Crawford was not at home when S.S. left the children. S.S. called defendant later in the evening. He said the children were doing well and suggested S.S. allow them to spend the night. The children spent the evening in Crawford's living room playing video games. The child fell asleep, and defendant carried her into an adjoining room. The brother went to sleep in the living room soon afterwards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The child awoke later in the night and found she was lying on a couch in the adjoining room. She noticed her jeans were unbuttoned and unzipped and that the elastic on her underpants was flipped down from the waist. As she awoke, she saw defendant pull his hand out of her underpants. She grabbed the bed coverings, pulled them over her, and turned her back towards defendant. Defendant attempted to pull the child towards him by grabbing her shirt. Defendant asked the child to pull down her pants, and she refused. Defendant told the child, \"It's okay,\" and unbuttoned and unzipped her pants. He placed his hand inside her underpants, inserted two fingers inside her vagina, removed his fingers, and then stuck them in the child's mouth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Crawford's dog began barking, and defendant left the room. The child walked to the door near the living room and whispered the brother's name several times. The brother remained asleep on the couch and did not respond. The child returned to the couch, covered herself with the sheet, and pretended to be sleeping. Defendant returned after yelling at the dog and unbuttoned and unzipped the child's pants. He placed his hands down her underpants and touched the child in \"the same place\" as he did before he left the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant left the room again to check on the brother. The child buttoned and zipped up her pants, curled up in a ball, and covered herself with the sheet. Defendant returned, removed the sheet from the child, placed his hands inside her underpants, and touched \"inside\" her \"bottom\" with three fingers. He also touched the child's chest with his hand. When Crawford arrived home, defendant moved to another couch in the same room as the child and remained on the couch until the next morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   S.S. arrived the next morning at Crawford's house to take the children home. S.S. informed the children that defendant would be babysitting them again that night. The child did not want to return to stay with defendant and told the brother that defendant \"touched me between my legs and on my bottom.\" The brother told the child to tell their mother. The child informed her mother that defendant had \"reached between my legs and he was feeling around and stuff.\" S.S. physically checked the child for injuries and called the police. S.S. also took the child to be examined at Rowan Regional Medical Center on 19 January 2002 and later to theChild Advocacy Center at Northeast Medical Center (\"Child Advocacy Center\") on 11 February 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. Carla Jones (\"Dr. Jones\") with the Child Advocacy Center examined the child and found a small split, or \"notch,\" in the child's hymen and observed no tears in the child's anal area. The child also spoke with Rowan County Sheriff's Deputy G.S. Henline (\"Deputy Henline\") and Julie Brafford (\"Brafford\"), a registered nurse and coordinator of the Child Advocacy Center, and informed them of defendant's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant admitted to social worker Sonia Byrd (\"Byrd\") and Detective Tonya Rusher (\"Detective Rusher\") that he had reached inside his granddaughter's pants and rubbed the outside of her genitals while she was asleep. Defendant denied placing his fingers inside the child's vagina or rectum. Defendant told Detective Rusher that he was \"definitely sorry for what [he] did\" and \"would do anything to take it back.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant did not present any evidence. The jury found defendant to be guilty of three counts of first-degree statutory sexual offense and three counts of taking indecent liberties with a child. The trial court sentenced defendant to imprisonment for 720 to 891 months. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The issues presented are whether: (1) the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Jones to testify regarding whether her examinations were consistent with the child's story; (2) the indictment was sufficient to confer jurisdiction; (3) the State's evidence wasunconstitutionally vague, confusing, and insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the verdicts; and (4) the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury regarding the specific elements for each separate offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Expert Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant contends the trial court improperly allowed Dr. Jones to testify that her physical examination of the child was consistent with the child's statements regarding sexual abuse by defendant. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Rule 702 of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence states, \"[i]f scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion.\" N.C.

Jury Instructions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant contends the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury regarding the specific elements of each separately identifiable offense and improperly shifted the burden of proof to defendant. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The trial court gave jury instructions and recited the specific elements the State was required to prove in order for the jury to find defendant guilty of \"three counts of first-degree sexual offense\" or attempted first-degree sexual offense, and \"three counts of taking an indecent liberty with a child.\" The trial court differentiated among the six charges and instructed the jury separately on each charge, but gave the elements of each charge only once, instead of three times for each respectiveindictment. The trial court also instructed the jury on the State's burden to prove\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   element beyond a reasonable doubt for the three charges of first-degree sexual assault, attempted first-degree sexual offense, and three charges of taking an indecent liberty with a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Although the trial court did not give an instruction for each distinct criminal act allegedly committed, the verdict sheets submitted to the jury identified the six offenses by their respective case numbers, the felony charge, and an identification of each instance. Based on the verdict sheets submitted to the jury, the jury could find defendant guilty or not guilty of: (1) \"First Degree Sex Offense with a Child by penetrating her anal opening with his fingers after getting up to quiet the dog;\" (2) \"First Degree Sex Offense with a Child by penetrating her genital opening with his fingers after getting up to quiet the dog;\" (3) \"First Degree Sex Offense with a Child by penetrating her genital opening with his fingers after getting up to check on the victim's brother;\" (4) \"Indecent Liberties with a Child by rubbing her breast;\" (5) \"Indecent Liberties with a Child by rubbing her buttocks; and/or (6) \"Indecent Liberties with a Child by putting his fingers in her mouth after touching her vaginal area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The jury instructions and the verdict sheets contain the specificity required to insure an unanimous verdict by the jury.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

Defendant does not cite any case law to support his contention. He cites, however, the United States Supreme Court case of\n   <em>\n    Chapman v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The trial court did not err in allowing Dr. Jones's expert testimony regarding whether her findings during the examination of the child were consistent with the child's testimony. The indictments gave defendant sufficient notice of the alleged crimes, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a bill of particulars and instructing the State to provide defendant with more specific information on each charge. The trial court's instructions and verdict sheets submitted to the jury properly identified each distinct charge and did not deprive defendant of any constitutional rights. Defendant's other assignments of error in which no authority is cited or argument is made are dismissed. We find no error in the assignments of error defendant preserved and argued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   No Error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Judges BRYANT and STEELMAN concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Report per Rule 30(e).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
