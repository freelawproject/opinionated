The appeal is on a settled statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">On July 14, 1979, members of the Monrovia Police Department responded to a call of shots being fired. At the scene, suspicion attached to plaintiff, who was placed under arrest, handcuffed, and walked a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 8\">*Supp. 8</page-number>tance of 25 or 30 feet by a police officer to the rear seat of a police car. When so placed, plaintiff \u201cbegan to make inquiries as to what was going on and became vocal. Between five and ten minutes after he was placed in the police car plaintiff began to kick, yell, and writhe around in the back seat of the police car while still handcuffed. At that time plaintiff was sprayed by Mace from a Monrovia policeman.\u201d The spraying caused injury to plaintiff\u2019s head, face and scalp.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Plaintiff filed a complaint against the City of Monrovia, alleging causes of action for battery and false arrest. At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case, the trial judge dismissed the false arrest cause of action on the ground that in the criminal prosecution, in which the charges were dismissed, a specific finding of probable cause had been made. He also dismissed the cause of action for battery, ruling that under section 844.6 of the Government Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plaintiff was a \u201cprisoner\u201d at the time of his alleged injury and the city was immune from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">On appeal appellant challenges only the ruling dismissing the battery cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">No reported decision has defined the status of a person under arrest as being included within the term \u201cprisoner,\u201d as that word is used in section 844 of the Government Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or as being excluded from that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">In <em>D\u00e1til </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 655 [69 Cal.Rptr. 788], a public entity employer was held to be not liable for the death of an individual who had been arrested, taken to the central jail and booked, and from there transported to another jail facility, where he was attacked by a fellow prisoner and killed. In defining the term \u201cprisoner,\u201d the Court of Appeal noted that section 844 uses the word \u201cincludes\u201d and construed that word as evidencing a legislative intent to give a broad meaning to \u201cprisoner.\u201d It noted that a popular meaning of prisoner is a \u201cperson \u2018under arrest,\u2019 \u2018in custody,\u2019 \u2018in jail,\u2019 \u2018in prison\u2019 . . . .\u201d (263 Cal.App.2d 655 at p. 659.) Similarly, in <em>Jiminez </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 9\">*Supp. 9</page-number><em>County of Santa Cruz </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 407 [116 Cal.Rptr. 878], the Court of Appeal, in holding a county immune from an action for the alleged wrongful death of a ward of the juvenile court placed in a camp facility, followed the approach of <em>D\u00e1til.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Conversely, in <em>Larson </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 91 [94 Cal.Rptr. 466], the Court of Appeal gave an expressly narrow construction of section 844 in a personal injury action by one who had been struck in the face by a police officer before being placed under arrest. And in <em>Patricia J. </em>v. <em>Rio Linda Union Sch. Dist. </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 278 [132 Cal.Rptr. 211], a similar strict construction was given in circumstances of a juvenile offender who had been released to the custody of her parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">More recently, in <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 770 [166 Cal.Rptr. 79], the city appealed from a judgment for plaintiff who had been injured in an assault by a fellow inmate while under civil commitment to a jail facility for alcoholism. In rejecting the contention that the city was immune from liability, the Court of Appeal stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-6\">\u201cAuthoritative indication of the legislative intent underlying so-called \u2018prisoner immunity\u2019 (of which \u00a7 844 is the definitive component) may be found in the report of the California Law Revision Commission on which the Legislature relied when it adopted the Government Tort Claims Act in 1963. (A Study Relating to Sovereign Immunity (Jan. 1963) 5 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1963) p. 1 et seq.; see <em>Patricia J. </em>v. <em>Rio Linda Union Sch. Dist., supra, </em>61 Cal.App.3d 278 at p. 284.) The pertinent passages of the report demonstrate that the commission recommended adoption of the doctrine of \u2018prisoner immunity\u2019 in the interest of \u2018correctional policy,\u2019 of the proper supervision of \u2018convicts\u2019 and \u2018prison inmates,\u2019 and of \u2018effective penology.\u2019 (5 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 421-425.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-7\">\u201cThe commission\u2019s terminal recommendation is stated as follows: \u2018It would seem, on the whole, that no tort liability should be admitted for damages sustained as the consequence of conditions which are <em>common to all inmates </em>and which simply represent a reasonable application of <em>general policy determinations </em>by responsible prison or jail authorities <em>with respect to the administration of such institutions </em>....\u2019 (5 Cal. Law Revisions Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 425 [italics added].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 10\">*Supp. 10</page-number>\u201cThe quoted language emphasizes the Law Revision Commission\u2019s\u2014 and the Legislature\u2019s\u2014view that \u2018prisoner immunity\u2019 is a necessary adjunct of <em>penology </em>and <em>corrections </em>in the overall \u2018administration of. . .institutions\u2019 conventionally discharging those functions. Neither function is involved in the governmental activity prescribed in Penal Code section 647, subdivision (ff), which does not define a criminal offense. It identifies the effect of its application as <em>'civil </em>protective custody\u2019 (Italics added.) It implements the \u2018civil\u2019 limitation by providing that \u2018[n]o person who has been placed in <em>civil </em>protective custody shall thereafter be subject to any <em>criminal </em>prosecution.. . based on the facts giving rise to such placement. .. . \u2019 (See fn. 2, <em>ante </em>[italics again added here].)\u201d (107 Cal.App.3d pp. 776-777.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Support for the view that the Legislature, in defining the term \u201cprisoner\u201d in sections 844 and 844.6 intended to limit it to inmates of jails and other correctional facilities incarcerated as a part of the penal process is provided by contrasting those sections with Government Code section 845.8, as amended in 1970. (Stats. 1970, ch. 1099, \u00a7 8, p. 1958.) That section now provides in pertinent part: \u201cNeither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-5\">\u201c(b) Any injury caused by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-6\">\u201c(1) An escaping or escaped prisoner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">\u201c(2) An escaping or escaped arrested person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-8\">\u201c(3) A person resisting arrest.\u201d That the Legislature, in another section of the same chapter, found it necessary to mention both the category of an \u201cescaping or escaped prisoner\u201d and an \u201cescaping or escaped <em>arrested </em>person\u201d is evidence that it drew a distinction between the two and believed an arrested person had not been previously included within that immunity. (See also: <em>Ne Casek </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 131, 139-140 [43 Cal.Rptr. 294].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">Since plaintiff in the present case, although under arrest, had not yet been incarcerated in a penal facility, we believe he was not a \u201cprisoner\u201d within the meaning of sections 844 and 844.6 of the Government Code. It was error, therefore, to rule that the City of Monrovia was immune from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 11\">*Supp. 11</page-number>The judgment is reversed, with directions to grant to plaintiff a new trial on the battery cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">Bernstein, P. J., and Rothman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-8\"> Section 844.6 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-9\">\u201c(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part ... a public entity is not liable for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-10\">\u201c(1) An injury proximately caused by any prisoner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-11\">\u201c(2) An injury to any prisoner.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-12\">Section 844 provides: \u201cAs used in this chapter, \u2018prisoner\u2019 includes an inmate of a prison, jail or penal or correctional facility.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
