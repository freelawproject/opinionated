In view of the fact that April 1, 1955 is the effective date of the Amendment to Regulation No. 7, I must resort to this short Memorandum, initially, with respect to that portion of the application which seeks a restraining order so that the parties may know at the earliest moment the disposition on this phase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>of the application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A more detailed Opinion will be filed subsequently. See 130 F.Supp. 303. So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-22\">.
