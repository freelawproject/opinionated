It was a question of fact whether the sidewalk, apart from the snow and ice, was defective. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Win</em>throp, 213 Mass. 581. <em>Hamlet </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>248 Mass. 473. <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>177 Mass. 82. It was also a question of fact whether the ice was the sole cause of the injury or whether the defective condition of the sidewalk when free from snow and ice was a contributing cause of the accident. <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>174 Mass. 181. <em>Naze </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>250 Mass. 368.
