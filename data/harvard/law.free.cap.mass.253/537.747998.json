She testified that she \u201chad cleaned these globes sometime ago. She did not think she cleaned them very often. . . . She had seen weavers in the little room cleaning globes.\u201d \u201cShe never saw weavers in that room cleaning globes.\u201d Another witness testified that weavers in that room did clean bulbs. The overseer testified that he never told any of the weavers not to clean the bulbs, that he had \u201cseen weavers clean bulbs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>at various times. . . . There was no one there whose specific duty was to clean bulbs.\u201d There was other evidence tending to show that it was no part of the weaver\u2019s duty to. clean the globe or bulb. The question whether the injury arose while the employee was working in the course of her employment was one of fact. There was evidence to support the finding of the board. It must stand. <em>Pass\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 515. <em>Chisholm\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 412, 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
