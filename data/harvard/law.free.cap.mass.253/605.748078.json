When Huntington Avenue was laid out, this space was specially reserved under St. 1894, c. 324, for street railway track location. The case at bar is governed by <em>Crowell </em>v.- <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>234 Mass. 393, where it was held that, under similar circumstances, the traveller was at most' a bare licensee as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>defendant, which owed her no duty except to refrain from wanton or reckless conduct. The differences between that case and the present one are immaterial and do not call for the application of a different principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
