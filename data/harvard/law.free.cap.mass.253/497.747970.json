This box was on land in the town of Chester leased to a corporation separate and distinct from the defendant. The waste paper was used by that corporation in its business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>of polishing granite. The minor plaintiff, going to this box to look at picture papers, found five \u201cmetal objects\u201d or \u201ccaps\u201d and took them away. The defendant occupied for its own use one half of the office building and one half of the barn on the premises otherwise leased to the other corporation. The waste paper box was located at about one hundred and fifty feet from the nearest point of property occupied by the defendant, and the defendant \u201chad nothing to do with this box.\u201d The evidence wholly fails to show any negligence on the part of the defendant. The circumstance that a clerk in its employ occasionally emptied an office waste paper basket into the box falls far short of showing that it deposited \u201cmetal objects\u201d or \u201ccaps\u201d in it or that it had any responsibility for them. Its use of such objects in its quarry in the town of Becket does not connect it in any degree with the presence of those taken by the minor plaintiff from the box. <em>Bigwood </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>209 Mass. 345. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>228 Mass. 545. <em>Andrew Dutton Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>234 Mass. 54. <em>King </em>v. <em>Smart, </em>240 Mass. 174. <em>Hafey </em>v. <em>Dwight Manuf.
