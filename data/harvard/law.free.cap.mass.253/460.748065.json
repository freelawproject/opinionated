On\" September 26, 1921, the defendant wrote the plaintiff cancelling the order. It was agreed that the only question for the jury was the defendant\u2019s liability under the written contract executed by her husband in her name. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>action is for the breach of the contract. In the Superior Court a verdict for the defendant was ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Mrs. Pedro was the owner of a bakery, in which her husband worked as a baker. There was no evidence that he was the defendant\u2019s agent to make the purchase in question or sign the contract. There was nothing in the evidence to show that the relation of principal and agent existed between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The plaintiff contends that the contract was ratified by the defendant. It bases this contention on the evidence that a few days after the contract was signed the plaintiff\u2019s agent saw the defendant and her husband at the bakery, and \u201cthey told him that they would not accept the flour because they did not want to use the brand of flour mentioned in the contract and that no other reasons were given for \"not accepting the flour\u201d; that \u201che visited the defendant\u2019s place of business several times during the period between the date of the contract and the time within which the flour was to be accepted and that each time they refused to accept the flour for the only given reason that they did not wish to use that brand of flour.\u201d This was not sufficient evidence to establish the defendant\u2019s ratification of the unauthorized contract. She disaffirmed the contract on September 26, within four days after it was made. She in no way approved it and she repudiated it within a reasonable time. Ratification is not to be inferred from the fact that she stated to the plaintiff\u2019s agent that she did not wish to use the plaintiff\u2019s brand of flour. She did not adopt the contract and was not bound to give her reasons for her disaffirmance of it. The husband was not her agent, and she was not estopped by her statements to the plaintiff\u2019s agent from cancelling the contract; see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Henry; </em>172 Mass. 559, 568. The plaintiff relies on <em>Boice-Perrine Co. </em>v. Kelley, 243 Mass. 327, <em>Harrod </em>v. <em>McDaniels, </em>126 Mass. 413, <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Rockwell, </em>104 Mass. 167, <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>1 Gray, 139, 147. We find nothing in these cases to support the plaintiff\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The defendant did not file a married woman\u2019s certificate under G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 10; but this circumstance does not help the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
