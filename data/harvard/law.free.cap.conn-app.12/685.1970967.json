The issues presented on appeal are whether the trial court erred (1) in failing to inquire into the defendant\u2019s and defense counsel's claims of breakdown of the attorney-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>client relationship, and (2) in denying defense counsel\u2019s request that new counsel be appointed in her place. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The facts are not in dispute. The defendant was charged with attempt to commit larceny in the second degree and was represented by an assistant public defender. At the commencement of trial the defendant orally complained that he had not had sufficient contact with his attorney during the pendency of the case. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also complained of being brought to the courthouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>on numerous occasions without being brought before the judge. The defendant did not, however, ask that alternate counsel be appointed. The court addressed the defendant\u2019s concerns and explained the limitations placed upon public defenders by their heavy caseloads. The defendant was instructed to discuss his concerns further with his attorney and was advised that he could get a new lawyer only if he retained private counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following a recess, the trial resumed, at which time the assistant public defender orally moved that alternate counsel be appointed to represent the defendant, on the basis of the defendant\u2019s earlier complaint and on counsel\u2019s own representation of a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. After a brief colloquy, the court denied the motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial continued, and the defendant was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The defendant first claims error in the trial court\u2019s failure to inquire into the substance of the complaint that the attorney-client relationship had broken down.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The controlling precedent in this state regarding sixth amendment violations based upon a trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a defendant\u2019s request for substitute counsel is <em>State </em>v. <em>Drakeford, </em>202 Conn. 75, 519 A.2d 1194 (1987). In that case, the defendant asked the court to appoint a public defender after a disagreement arose between the defendant and his privately retained counsel. Despite the vehement protests of the defendant, his request was denied. The defendant in <em>Drakeford </em>made claims, inter alia, identical to those put forth by this defendant; namely, that the trial court erred in failing to inquire into the defendant\u2019s request for new counsel and in failing to appoint alternate counsel. Id., 82. The <em>Drakeford </em>court found no error, holding that the trial court did not, under the circumstances, abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion. Id., 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">With regard to the failure of the trial court to inquire into the underlying reasons behind a request for alternate counsel, the court stated in <em>Drakeford </em>that \u201ca trial judge\u2019s failure to inquire into the defendant\u2019s request for new counsel where the defendant has already made known the reasons for his request is not error. <em>McKee </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number><em>Harris, </em>[649 F.2d 927, 933 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 917, 102 S. Ct. 1773, 72 L. Ed. 2d 177 (1982)] . . . .\u201d Id., 82. \u201c \u2018[W]hen, for the first time, an accused makes known to the court in some way that he has a complaint about his counsel, the court must rule on the matter. If the reasons are made known to the court, the court may rule without more. If no reasons are stated, the court then has a duty to inquire into the basis for the client\u2019s objection to counsel and should withhold a ruling until reasons are made known.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKee </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 934, quoting <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>264 F.2d 363, 369 (D.C. Cir.) (Burger, J., concurring), cert. denied, 360 U.S. 911, 79 S. Ct. 1299, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1262 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In the present case, the reasons for the defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction were known to the court. The transcript discloses that the defendant was given not only an opportunity to place the reasons for his complaint before the court, but also an opportunity to articulate the facts underlying his dissatisfaction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, because the public defender cited no additional rationale as a basis for her motion for alternate counsel, but merely stated that her motion was \u201cbased upon\u201d the defendant\u2019s earlier request, it is difficult to imagine that additional grounds for dissatisfaction would have been gleaned by the court through a more probing inquiry. In this case the reasons for the defendant\u2019s complaint were sufficiently stated on the record. No further inquiry by the trial court was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The defendant\u2019s second claim of error concerns the trial court\u2019s failure to appoint alternate counsel. Given the circumstances of this case we find no fault with the trial court\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>There can be no dispute that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771 n.14, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763 (1970); <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>195 Conn. 636, 639, 490 A.2d 82 (1985); that right, however, is not without limitation. For example, the right to counsel does not include the \u201c \u2018unbridled right to discharge counsel <em>on the eve of trial. . . . \u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Drakeford, </em>supra, 83, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grow, </em>394 F.2d 182, 209 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 840, 89 S. Ct. 118, 21 L. Ed. 2d 111 (1968). This limitation applies to both private counsel retained by an individual defendant as well as court appointed counsel. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gathers, </em>193 Conn. 526, 543, 480 A.2d 435 (1984) and cases cited therein. Furthermore, it is clear that the right to effective assistance of counsel does not include an \u201cunlimited opportunity to obtain alternate counsel.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>198 Conn. 598, 610, 504 A.2d 497 (1986). Inherent in these limitations is a concern for unwarranted interruptions in the administration of justice. \u201cWhile courts must be assiduous in their defense of an accused\u2019s right to counsel, that right may not be \u2018manipulated so as to obstruct the orderly procedure in the courts or to interfere with the fair administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calabro, </em>467 F.2d 973, 986 (2d Cir. 1972), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bentvena, </em>319 F.2d 916, 936 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Ormento </em>v. <em>United States, </em>375 U.S. 940, 84 S. Ct. 345, 11 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1963); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>DiTommaso, </em>817 F.2d 201, 219 (2d Cir. 1987). With these competing interests in mind, we review the actions of the trial court in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The standard of review to be applied when reviewing a denial of a request for alternate counsel is whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining that a factual basis did not exist for granting the request. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Drakeford, </em>supra, 88. In the present case, we find no abuse of that discretion. The trial court had before it the defendant\u2019s complaint concerning his representation. It is clear that the trial judge understood the defendant\u2019s concerns and was able to respond directly to them. In addition, the trial court reviewed with defendant\u2019s counsel, clearly and precisely, the factual record at issue in its denial of her motion for alternate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">\u201cIt is the province of the trial court to determine whether there is a factual basis for disqualification of counsel. . . . In the absence of a factual record showing an abuse of discretion, the trial court\u2019s failure to permit the withdrawal of counsel is not reversible error.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 610. Having reviewed the entire record in the present case, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-6\"> \u201cThe Defendant: The complaint I have with the attorney is I feel that I haven\u2019t been informed fully on my case on how we\u2019re going to go about each day. Each week I\u2019ve been brought back and forth to court and haven\u2019t even been brought in front of the judge and I\u2019ve been brought back and forth over a period of seven or more times. I have all the dates and I have written it out here as legible as possible on both complaints because I didn\u2019t have no access to the typewriter and I\u2019ve been incarcerated now over 90 days and I haven\u2019t had one bond reduction. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">\u2018 \u2018The .Court: Mr. High, Attorney Calderon was appointed to you as a public defender' and under the law, when you apply for a public defender, it\u2019s because you\u2019re claiming indigency, that you cannot afford your own lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, I looked into the matter and I can\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">\u201cThe Court: Well, the law does not require that you have to like your lawyer or anything. You\u2019re saying that this is a complaint against your lawyer and maybe what you need to do is \u2014 you\u2019re a very articulate young man\u00eds articulate and speak with her to improve the communications, because everything you told me is something that normally happens when people are brought back and forth and are unable to post bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">\u201cThe Defendant: The only time I get to see her is when I\u2019m brought to court. I called her office on numerous occasions and she came to visit me one time. , ' .</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s probably because she had a very high case load which is unfortunately what happens in our system where you have only one case to worry about. And, obviously, if you haven\u2019t made bond, you\u2019re sitting there 24 hours a day worried about your case and your own personal situation. She has a great many other matters to do and they cannot include running back and forth to the Corrections Center to see you at will. So I can\u2019t do anything about your complaints.'</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">\u201cIf you want to fire your lawyer, the only way that I can allow that to happen is if you were replacing her with a lawyer of your own choosing. Since you\u2019re not doing that, I\u2019ve listened to your complaint and I\u2019m just explaining to you there\u2019s nothing I can do and, hopefully, things will improve.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-5\"> We note that a defendant\u2019s indigency would not preclude him from representation by an alternate public defender in all circumstances. A blanket refusal to appoint alternate public defenders under all circumstances would be inappropriate and potentially unconstitutional. We limit our application of the court\u2019s denial of alternate counsel to the facts of the present case and do not approve of the court\u2019s statements or reasoning beyond the circumstances presented here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b699-6\"> \u201cMs. Calderon: Yes, your Honor. I have an oral motion based on the oral motion that was made by Chester High earlier today that he was dissatisfied with me as counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">\u201cI would ask that new counsel be appointed to him because of the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship in this case, and I cite <em>[State </em>v. <em>Beckenbach, </em>198 Conn. 43, 501 A.2d 752 (1985)] for the further proposition that if new counsel should be appointed or retained, that there should be granted a reasonable continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t read <em>Beckenbach </em>to say what you said, counsel. Do you want to point that out to me?</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">\u201cMs. Calderon: I\u2019m relying on that case in the second part of my argument, that a reasonable continuance be granted should new counsel be appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s not what I understand you to say, that it said that if there\u2019s a request, whether appointed or on his own, that a continuance should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">\u201cFirst of all, there is no request for a continuance. Mr. High, as I understood, said he had a complaint to make and <em>Beckenbach </em>does not overrule previous decisions that say just being unhappy with your lawyer does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>mean that you\u2019re entitled to appointment of a new public defender. This is a public defender case and, he\u2019s going to bring in his own counsel, which he was not making a request to do \u2014 plus, there has to be a showing because <em>Beckenbaeh </em>did not overrule previous decisions if you read it as I just did. There has to be a showing of an inadequate misrepresentation and Mr. High is not saying he had a lawyer or that he wants who couldn\u2019t be here for whatever reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">\u201cThere is no request. I don\u2019t think that argument is appropriate and I\u2019m going to deny your motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">\u201cYou may have an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">\u201cMs. Calderon: Exception.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b701-9\"> See footnotes 1 and S, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
