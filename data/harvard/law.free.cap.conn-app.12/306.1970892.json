On appeal, the defendant challenges only his conviction for disorderly conduct. He claims that he was denied his constitutional right to notice of the specific nature of the factual allegations against him. In support of his claim, he alleges that the state\u2019s substitute information and bill of particulars improperly charged that he acted intentionally <em>or </em>recklessly in a single count of disorderly conduct. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On the night of January 16,1985, at a late hour, Nancy Presson was driving home from work on Route <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>7 in North Canaan when she noticed a car following her, at first without its headlights on, and later with flashing high beams. As, this car passed her, Presson recognized the defendant, the sole occupant of the car, as a customer earlier that evening in the restaurant where she worked. During this pursuit, the defendant at one point stopped his car in the road ahead of Presson, causing her to do likewise behind him. The defendant approached Presson\u2019s car and asked if she wanted to go for a drink. She refused. He then asked her in vulgar terms if she wanted to have sexual intercourse. Again, she refused and said she was going home. She then locked the car doors, after which the defendant reached through the partially closed car window to unlock the door, but he was unsuccessful when she raised the window. He then shook the window and ordered the victim to unlock the door. She then sped away frightened and went home. She reported the incident to the state police the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">On February 14, 1985, the defendant was charged with breach of the peace, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181, and reckless driving, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222. Thereafter, the state filed a substitute information charging the defendant with disorderly conduct, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182, in addition to reckless driving. Simultaneously, the state filed a bill of particulars alleging in the first count that the defendant \u2018[d]id commit the crime of Disorderly Conduct, in that, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, <em>or </em>recklessly creating] a risk thereof, he did, on the 16th day of January, 1985, on Rt. 7 in the Town of North Canaan, at approximately 11:30 p.m. engage in violent, tumultuous, or threatening behavior, and thereby, did cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm to one Nancy Presson, all in violation of ... \u00a7 53a-182 of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>In response to the state\u2019s bill of particulars, the defendant challenged the state\u2019s allegations by seeking a supplemental bill of particulars. Since the state alleged intentional <em>or </em>reckless conduct in the disjunctive, he requested that the state be forced to elect between them. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion and the state then proceeded with the presentation of its case, which it completed that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">On the following day the defendant\u2019s counsel proceeded with his defense and called the defendant as his only witness. The defendant admitted encountering Presson on the road that evening, but denied the violent actions detailed by the victim\u2019s testimony. He testified that he met her on the road, asked her if she wanted to go for a drink, and when she said no, he left without any further incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The sole issue presented in this appeal is whether the state\u2019s accusatory pleadings, namely, the substitute information together with the bill of particulars, gave the defendant fair notice of the charges against him, as guaranteed by the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the United States, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. The defendant argues that he properly asserted this claim before the trial court, but in any event that the claim implicates his fundamental constitutional rights, which, if adequately supported by the record, may be reviewed under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69-70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cates, </em>202 Conn. 615, 625-26, 522 A.2d 788 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Because we find from the record that the defendant raised this claim below, we need not decide whether it warrants an <em>Evans </em>review. Pursuant to the defendant\u2019s request for articulation, the trial court stated that the \u201cissue was clearly brought to the court\u2019s attention, and it is a subject of the current appeal.\u201d According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>to the trial court\u2019s articulation, the state filed its substitute information and bill of particulars charging the defendant with disorderly conduct immediately prior to jury selection. On that same day, the court conducted a hearing to consider the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and his motion for a supplemental bill of particulars requiring the state to elect between the allegations of intentional and reckless conduct. The court considered both of these motions relevant to the offense of disorderly conduct, and denied them. We find, therefore, that the issue was distinctly raised at trial and warrants bur review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The defendant claims that the state, by its substitute information and bill of particulars, failed to give him proper notice of the charge of disorderly conduct because the bill of particulars alleged in the disjunctive that the defendant, in the commission of the crime, acted intentionally or recklessly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u201cThe language of an [accusatory pleading] serves two primary purposes: it informs the accused of the nature of the crime charged and it acts as a bar to future criminal proceedings on the same cause.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>164 Conn. 162, 167, 319 A.2d 381 (1972); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 490, 508 A.2d 22 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>178 Conn. 163, 168, 422 A.2d 299 (1979). \u201cAn [accusatory pleading] which charges the commission of two or more offenses in the alternative is fatally defective for the reason that it does not definitely apprise the accused of the specific charge against him.\u201d <em>Grasso </em>v. <em>Frattolillo, </em>111 Conn. 209, 212, 149 A. 838 (1930). The defendant \u201cmay not be tried for one act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>or </em>another, <em>or </em>another, at the pleasure of the prosecutor, unless there be as many distinct counts in the information.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>19 Conn. 493, 500 (1849). It has been held, therefore, that alternative allegations contained in a single count, which are stated in the disjunctive, serve to deprive the defendant of his constitutional right to fair notice of the specific offense for which he has been charged. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>192 Conn. 37, 40, 470 A.2d 688 (1984). This is true even when the allegations are patterned after, and use the words of, the criminal statute. Id. 2 F. Wharton, Criminal Procedure (12th Ed. Torcia) \u00a7 291. The defendant\u2019s claim is one of duplicity, \u201cthe charging of separate offenses in a single count.\u201d 2 W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 19.2 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 817<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> states that no information shall be dismissed for duplicity, provided that an offense is charged. In a case such as this, where the allegations of a single count are duplicitous, the proper recourse is a motion for a bill of particulars. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>supra, 168. \u201cNo appeal . . . based on any of the defects enumerated in Sec. 817 [which includes duplicity of charges] shall be sustained unless it is affirmatively shown that the defendant was, in fact, prejudiced in his defense upon the merits and that substantial injustice was done to him because of such defect.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 818.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we find that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>has not affirmatively shown prejudice to the merits of his defense or substantial injustice to him, we conclude that the court did not err in denying his motion to dismiss, and that any error which the court may have made in denying his motion for a supplemental bill of particulars did not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">At the outset, we note that the state\u2019s information and bill of particulars alleged that the defendant violated General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182, disorderly conduct. By so doing, the defendant was given notice of the crime charged and of the elements of that offense, particularly that it expressly proscribed both intentional and reckless conduct. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 405, 429 A.2d 919 (1980) (where indictment charged specific intent crime, defendant put on notice of lesser included offenses that require a less serious degree of culpable intent). Furthermore, the deficiencies alleged by the defendant do not render the pleadings so indefinite as to preclude them from being pleaded by the defendant as a bar to any further prosecution for the same offense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Nowhere in the defendant\u2019s brief, or reply brief, does he allege that he was, in fact, prejudiced by the state\u2019s disjunctive pleading. Our review of the record, furthermore, confirms that any such argument would be unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 provides in the disjunctive that both intentional or reckless conduct is punishable as disorderly conduct. The state\u2019s bill of particulars alleged intentional or reckless conduct and could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>been amended at any time to allege these elements conjunctively or in separate counts. Most important is the fact that the defense offered at trial consisted of a denial that he had engaged in \u201cviolent, tumultuous or threatening behavior.\u201d He likewise denied that the victim suffered \u201cinconvenience, annoyance or alarm.\u201d At no time did the defendant submit to the jury, by either testimony or argument, that he acted with a lesser degree of intent than that prescribed by the statute. From the defendant\u2019s testimony, and defense counsel's closing arguments, it is clear that credibility was the disputed issue in this case, not the defendant\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">On the basis of the record before us, we cannot find that the defendant was, in fact, prejudiced in his defense on the merits or that he suffered substantial injustice from the disjunctive pleading of the alternate mental states prescribed by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>3 Conn. App. 650, 653-54, 491 A.2d 428, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 810, 494 A.2d 906 (1985). The appeal, therefore, may not be sustained.
