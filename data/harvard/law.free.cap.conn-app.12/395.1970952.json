He was found not guilty of risk of injury to a child. The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s interruption of the direct examination of the defendant, its chastising of his counsel, and its limiting of the cross-examination of the victim denied him a fair trial. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On March 30, 1984, the victim, then thirteen years old, spent the night at a girlfriend\u2019s (hereinafter Kelly) house in Stratford. During that evening and into the early morning hours of the next day, Kelly\u2019s mother was working in a nearby restaurant. The defendant, a friend of Kelly\u2019s mother, was also on the premises. The defendant and the mother were involved in a stormy relationship and the defendant lived with the mother at her home on an intermittent basis. The two frequently quarrelled over a 1982 red Corvette which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>had been purchased by the defendant with substantial financial assistance from the mother. At approximately 2:30 a.m., on March 31, 1984, the victim and Kelly retired to Kelly\u2019s bedroom where they occupied a large waterbed. At approximately 2:45 a.m., prank telephone calls for the girls commenced. The defendant knocked on the girls\u2019 bedroom door and asked Kelly to speak to the callers and to tell them to stop. The calls persisted. At approximately 3:30 a.m., the defendant went again to Kelly\u2019s bedroom and asked her to call her mother at the restaurant, using the downstairs telephone, to inform her that the telephone was being taken off the hook. While Kelly complied with this request, the defendant entered Kelly\u2019s bedroom, attempted to fondle the victim, and left a short time later. Upon Kelly\u2019s return to the bedroom, the victim asked Kelly not to leave her alone again and then locked the bedroom door. Some time after 5 a.m., the defendant unlocked the bedroom door with an ice pick and again attempted to touch the victim. She rolled across the bed in an effort to elude the defendant\u2019s touch. Kelly remained asleep. Kelly\u2019s mother\u2019s return home a short time later caused the defendant to leave the bedroom. Later in the morning, the victim informed Kelly what had occurred, and, at approximately 9:30 a.m., the victim informed Kelly\u2019s mother of the early morning events. Charges were filed against the defendant one month later.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In his first claim, the defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s repeated interruptions of his testimony and its chastisement of his counsel throughout the course of the proceedings violated his right to a fair trial and an impartial jury. Although not objected to at trial, these claims are properly reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>8 Conn. App. 35, 41, 510 A.2d 1370 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Due process requires that a defendant be given a fair trial. A fair trial is one conducted with substantial conformity with the law, before an impartial judge and an unprejudiced jury in an atmosphere of judicial calm. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 42; see U.S. Const., amend. XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; <em>Lisenba </em>v. <em>California, </em>314 U.S. 219, 62 S. Ct. 280, 86 L. Ed. 166 (1941); <em>Wojculewicz </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>145 Conn. 11, 19, 138 A.2d 512, cert. denied, 356 U.S. 969, 78 S. Ct 1010, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1075 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u2018\u201cNo more elementary statement concerning the judiciary can be made than that the conduct of the trial judge must be characterized by the highest impartiality. If he departs from this standard, he casts serious reflection upon the system of which he is a part. A judge is not an umpire in a forensic encounter. . . . He is a minister of justice. ... He may, of course, take all reasonable steps necessary for the orderly progress of the trial. ... In whatever he does, however, the trial judge should be cautious and circumspect in his language and conduct.\u2019 ... Tt is his responsibility to have the trial conducted in a manner which approaches an \u201catmosphere of perfect impartiality which is so much to be desired in a judicial proceeding.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>187 Conn. 163, 168-69, 444 A.2d 915 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardwick, </em>1 Conn. App. 609, 611, 475 A.2d 315, cert. denied, 193 Conn. 804, 476 A.2d 145 (1984). The court should never assume a position of advocacy, whether real or apparent, and should avoid any appearance of hostility or skepticism toward the defendant\u2019s case or the state\u2019s case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>200 Conn. 544, 549, 512 A.2d 884 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Drouin, </em>12 Conn. App. 101, 104-105, 529 A.2d 740 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The defendant does not claim that any single interruption of him or rebuking of his counsel was so preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>dicial as to deprive him of a fair trial, but that all of the trial court\u2019s comments taken together infringed upon his right to a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The defendant never moved for a mistrial. Appellate courts are \u201creluctant to award a new trial where those most concerned, better placed than we to assess the courtroom atmosphere, did not view the remarks to be so prejudicial as to warrant a new trial and preferred to stake the outcome on the trial under way. \u2018We have made it clear that we will not permit parties to anticipate a favorable decision, reserving a right to impeach it or set it aside if it happens to be against them, for a cause which was well known to them before or during the trial.\u2019 <em>Krattenstein </em>v. <em>G. Fox &amp; Co., </em>155 Conn. 609, 616, 236 A.2d 466 (1967).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>197 Conn. 629, 642, 500 A.2d 1303 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The record does not disclose what occurred at bench conferences. Some of the allegedly improper remarks were made outside the presence of the jury and, therefore, did not affect the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 42-43. In addition, after a careful review of the entire transcript we find no impropriety in the court\u2019s comments which were made in the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Our review of the transcript discloses that the allegedly improper conduct of the trial court was directed at eliminating leading questions, having the witness respond to the questions asked and avoiding irrelevant testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>The judge took no position of advocacy regarding the outcome of the case, and made no improper comments on the significance of the evidence presented. At no time did the judge convey to the jury his opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Further, neither the judge\u2019s comments nor his questions impugned the defendant\u2019s credibility. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>12 Conn. App. 129, 136-37, 529 A.2d 1333 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Drouin, </em>supra. The trial judge\u2019s actions do not appear to have thwarted the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s ability to defend his client. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>The comments to which the defendant alludes were interspersed over a ten day trial. Furthermore, in its charge to the jury, the trial court complimented both counsel on doing an excellent job during the trial and stated: \u201cIf I have made any reference to the position of the state or the accused I assure you it is not my intention to convey to you, directly or indirectly, how the court feels as to what should be the outcome of the case. The decision rests in your hands and yours alone.\u201d Such a curative instruction is entitled to great weight and will usually prevent a finding of reversible error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>by a reviewing court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 44. On the basis of our careful examination of the trial transcript, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s comments did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial or an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The defendant also argues that the trial court improperly limited his cross-examination of the victim. The defendant duly excepted at trial to the limitation. The defendant sought to inquire into the victim\u2019s alleged hostility toward men and boys in general and, in particular, toward her own father. The defendant claims that this hostility was relevant to the issue of her credibility concerning the accusations made against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">This claim has not been properly preserved because the defendant presented nothing for this court to review. \u201cThe [defendant] failed to observe the requirements of Practice Book 3060F (c) (3) [now \u00a7 4065 (d) (3)] which requires that an appellant\u2019s brief include, inter alia, the question, the objection and its ground, the claimed ground of admissibility, the ruling and the exception. The bare assertion in a brief that the evidence was improperly excluded, coupled with transcript page references, will not suffice. . . . It is our strong policy that rulings claimed as evidentiary errors to be reviewed by this court be provided and printed in the briefs as required and outlined by the Practice Book.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>2 Conn. App. 635, 641, 482 A.2d 77 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"> The trial court\u2019s comments included the following during direct examination of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">\u201cThe Court: You answered the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">\u201cQ.
