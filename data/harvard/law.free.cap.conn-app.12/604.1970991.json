Late in the afternoon of November 12, 1985, the defendant, along with two other prisoners, attacked, assaulted and injured the deputy sheriffs assigned to guard them. The sheriffs\u2019 keys were taken from them and the sheriffs were then locked in a cell. The defendant and his companions attempted in vain to use the keys taken from the sheriffs to open the cell doors leading from the lockup. Ultimately, when other officers arrived on the scene, the defendant and his confederates threw down the keys and ceased their efforts to escape. During this escapade, two of the deputy sheriffs suffered severe and painful injuries including a broken nose in one instance, and a broken rib in another. The defendant was subsequently tried before a jury for the crimes of attempted escape and four counts of assault on a peace officer. He was found guilty of attempted escape, and of two of the counts of assault on a peace officer, but was acquitted of the remaining two counts of assault. This appeal involves only the defendant\u2019s conviction of attempted escape from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In its initial charge, the court instructed the jury that any of the defendant\u2019s acts tending to prove abandonment and renunciation had to occur prior to any acts which constituted an attempt to escape. The defendant excepted to this charge and, upon reflection, the court reinstructed the jury, informing the panel that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>an abandonment and renunciation could occur after the defendant had taken substantial steps towards the completion of the act with the necessary intent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During its preliminary remarks, while recharging the jury, the court stated: \u201cLadies and Gentlemen, I spent a good part of the evening at the library last night because I was concerned about a \u2014 what I think was a minor point \u2014 but nevertheless I like to be accurate.\u201d The court then gave the corrected charge, consisting of six pages of transcript. The transcript of the entire jury instruction, including the original charge, the supplemental charge and an answer to a jury question, consists of fifty pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The defendant claims that, despite the fact that the court fully recharged the jury correctly on the defense of abandonment and renunciation, the court\u2019s use of the phrase, \u201cprobably a minor point,\u201d is reversible error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">As stated above, the entire jury instruction amounted to some fifty pages, while the challenged language was only a few words which, if not trivial, were innocuous. We must look to the charge <em>as a whole </em>in determining whether it is adequate and it will be deemed so if it is \u201clegally correct and present[s] the case to the jury in a just and fair manner.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Candito, </em>4 Conn. App. 154, 160, 493 A.2d 250 (1985). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 746, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979). A party is not entitled to a charge which is \u201cbeyond criticism in every particular\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harman, </em>198 Conn. 124, 134, 502 A.2d 381 (1985), quoted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Knighton, </em>7 Conn. App. 223, 231, 508 A.2d 772 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>(1986); and \u201c[a] charge is not <em>to </em>be critically dissected in a search for inexact or inadvertent statements.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>199 Conn. 14, 27, 505 A.2d 690 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 436, 493 A.2d 865 (1985). Our review of the entire charge fails to support the defendant\u2019s contention that the charge did not present the case to the jury in a just and fair manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(e) When the actor\u2019s conduct would otherwise constitute an attempt ... it shall be a defense that he abandoned his effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
