The issues raised on appeal are (1) whether the court erred in finding that the increase in the plaintiff\u2019s income due to her obtaining employment subsequent to the divorce was not contemplated by the parties, and (2) whether the court abused its discretion in reducing the alimony payments to the plaintiff by $50 per week. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The parties were divorced in 1972. The defendant was ordered to pay alimony in the amount of $100 per week, and child support in the amount of $25 per week for each of the parties\u2019 four minor children, then ages seventeen, sixteen, fourteen and five. He was also ordered to make the payments on the first mortgage on the home owned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not work outside the home at the time of the divorce. Her financial affidavit filed at that time showed that her only income was derived from court-ordered alimony and child support. This income exceeded her expenses by a small amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">At the time of the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to modify in 1987, the plaintiff was employed. Her gross earnings from employment totalled $371.89 per week. This was supplemented by the weekly alimony payment of $100. The four children had reached majority. At the hearing on the motion to modify, the plaintiff testified that, at the time of the divorce, she had expected to get a job and did in fact become employed as a bookkeeper soon thereafter. The defendant testified that, at the time of the divorce, the matter of whether the plaintiff would get a job \u201cwas never discussed\u201d and that since the plaintiff had never worked before, he \u201chad no idea she was going to be going to work.\u201d He also testified that, with respect to his continuing obligation to make the mortgage payments, he \u201cwanted to make sure that the home was kept as a homestead for the children not to upset their day-to-day living.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The court concluded that the defendant had shown a substantial change in circumstances which was not contemplated by the parties. Thereupon, the court reduced the alimony order from $100 per week to $50 per week. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the court erred in finding that the plaintiff\u2019s employment subsequent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>divorce was not contemplated by the parties at the time of the divorce. The plaintiff does not dispute that the trial court was justified in finding the change in her income to be substantial; rather, she challenges the court\u2019s determination that the defendant had shown that the increase in the plaintiffs income due to employment was not contemplated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u201cWe recognize that a party seeking modification of financial orders incident to a marital dissolution judgment must clearly and definitely establish an uncontemplated substantial change of the circumstances of either party which demonstrates that continuation of the prior order would be unfair and improper. <em>Wingerd </em>v. <em>Wingerd, </em>3 Conn. App. 261, 262, 487 A.2d 212 (1985). We also recognize the well established standard of review in this court of the trial court\u2019s actions in such matters. We do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Vanderlip </em>v. <em>Vanderlip, </em>1 Conn. App. 158, 159, 468 A.2d 1253 (1984). Great weight is due the action of the trial court, which will not be disturbed unless the court has abused its discretion or its finding has no reasonable basis in the facts. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>10 Conn. App. 391, 393, 523 A.2d 914 (1987); <em>Wingerd </em>v. <em>Wingerd, </em>supra, 263.\u201d <em>Fabiano </em>v. <em>Fabiano, </em>10 Conn. App. 466, 469, 523 A.2d 937 (1987). We decide, not whether we would have drawn the same inferences or found the same facts, but whether the trial court could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>have reasonably done so. <em>Grayson </em>v. <em>Grayson, </em>4 Conn. App. 275, 294, 494 A.2d 576 (1985), appeal dismissed, 202 Conn. 221, 520 A.2d 225 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In this case, we cannot conclude that the court\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs earnings from employment were not contemplated at the time of the divorce had no reasonable basis in the facts. This conclusion was based upon the defendant\u2019s testimony that it was not contemplated that the plaintiff would go to work, and upon the court\u2019s view that the original alimony award and the order that the defendant make the first mortgage payments reflected the parties\u2019 intent \u201cto further the desirability of [the plaintiff\u2019s] staying home with the children.\u201d The trial court\u2019s finding has a sufficient basis in the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s second claim is that the court erred in reducing the amount of alimony by $50 per week. Having concluded that the court\u2019s finding regarding the plaintiff\u2019s employment cannot be disturbed, our review of the plaintiff\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s determination of the amount of the modification ordered is limited: \u201c \u2018The goal of our analysis is simply to decide whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Griffiths </em>v. <em>Griffiths, </em>12 Conn. App. 807, 807-808, 531 A.2d 1203 (1987) (per curiam), quoting <em>Palazzo </em>v. <em>Palazzo, </em>9 Conn. App. 486, 488, 519 A.2d 1230 (1987). We conclude that the court did not abuse its wide discretion in its modification of the alimony award.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-6\"> We note that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a), which provides for modification \u201cupon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party,\u201d has been repealed and substituted by Public Acts 1987, No. 87-104. That act provides in relevant part that \u201cmodification may be made upon a showing of such substantial change of circumstances, <em>whether or not such change of circumstances was contemplated at the time of dissolution. </em>By written agreement, stipulation or by decision of the court, those items or circumstances that were contemplated and are not to be changed may be specified in the written agreement, stipulation or decision of the court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) That act was not effective until October 1, 1987, and therefore does not affect this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
