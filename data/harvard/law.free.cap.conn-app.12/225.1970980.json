He claims in this appeal that his convictions on the first and second counts for possession of narcotics with intent to sell and possession of narcotics, respectively, violate the federal and state prohibitions against double jeopardy. He also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding in the third count that the defendant possessed the marihuana found in the bedroom dresser. Finally, the defendant claims that the court\u2019s use of examples to illustrate the element of possession constituted an illegal expansion of that element. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts: On June 27,1985, at approximately 12:30 p.m., several members of the New Haven police department executed a search warrant for an apartment at 11 Northwest Drive, New Haven. The apartment was rented to Alexis Laing, who lived there with the defendant and her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">One of the officers executing the warrant, Fredrick Hurley, knocked on the door of the apartment and, after hearing no response, entered through the front door. Upon his entry, he immediately went to the mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>ter bedroom on the second floor. There he found the defendant alone, lying naked on the bed, and wearing only a pair of socks. The defendant was seen rising from a reclining position on the bed. The only occupant of the apartment at that time was the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">On the bed, approximately at an arm\u2019s length from the defendant, was a sandwich bag box from which protruded a plastic bag containing what was determined to be cocaine. A search of the sandwich bag box uncovered a smaller plastic bag containing cocaine, seventeen small tin foil packets or envelopes of cocaine, and two glassine bags. One of the glassine bags contained quinine and procaine. The second glassine bag contained a mixture of heroin, cocaine and quinine.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">A further search of the bedroom yielded three manila envelopes containing marihuana. These envelopes were found in the top drawer of the dresser. Other items seized from the top of the dresser included razor blades, small manila envelopes, a roll of aluminum foil, a set of measuring spoons, cigarette rolling paper and a small grinder or strainer. In the first floor kitchen, aluminum foil, bottles of inositol, and a cent-o-gram scale were seized by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The total amount of narcotics seized was as follows: 79.72 grams (2.81 ounces) of cocaine; 80 milligrams (.10 ounce) of heroin; and 4.97 grams (.17 ounce) of marihuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The defendant was arrested and subsequently charged in four counts as follows: count one, possession of narcotics, to wit, cocaine, with intent to sell, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a); count two, possession of narcotics, to wit, heroin, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a); count three, possession of marihuana, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (c), and count four, possession of drug paraphernalia, a viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tion of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-267 (a). He pleaded not guilty to the charges and elected to be tried by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">At the close of the state\u2019s case, the defendant made an oral motion requiring the state to elect between the first and second counts of the information, arguing that it was a violation of double jeopardy to convict and sentence the defendant for both possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell, and possession of a narcotic substance. The trial court denied the motion. At that time, the defendant also moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the defendant had in-hand possession of the narcotics and marihuana or exclusive possession of the apartment in which they were found. This motion was also denied. Thereafter, the defendant presented his evidence and the case was submitted to the jury, which rendered a verdict of guilty on all four counts. The defendant was sentenced accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The defendant\u2019s first claim on appeal is that his conviction on count one, possession of narcotics with intent to sell, and on count two, possession of narcotics, violates the federal and state prohibitions against double jeopardy and the right to due process. A claim of double jeopardy which is adequately supported by the record is reviewable under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Devino, </em>195 Conn. 70, 73, 485 A.2d 1302 (1985); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitt, </em>8 Conn. App. 478, 485, 513 A.2d 731, cert. denied, 202 Conn. 801, 518 A.2d 648 (1986) (double jeopardy violation recognized as plain error). We find this claim is proper for an <em>Evans </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">\u201cThe double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \u2018nor shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u2019 Connecticut common law also secures this right. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Johns, </em>184 Conn. 369, 373 n.6, 439 A.2d 1049 (1981). . . . Double jeopardy analysis in the context of a single trial is a two-step process. First, the charges must arise out of the same act or transaction. Second, it must be determined whether the charged crimes are the same offense. Multiple punishments are forbidden only if both conditions are met. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>194 Conn. 233, 238, 478 A.2d 1013 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Devino, </em>supra, 73-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">For the first step of this analysis, we look at the state\u2019s information. Counts one and two of the information charge the defendant with violations of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-277 (a) and 21a-279 (a), respectively, and allege criminal conduct of the defendant at approximately 12:30 p.m., on June 27,1985. There can be no doubt that the offenses for which the defendant was charged and convicted arose out of the same act of possession of the two narcotic substances simultaneously at the same time and place. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Devino, </em>supra, 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The state argues that the narcotics violations alleged in counts one and two do not constitute the same act or transaction because count one referred to the possession and sale of cocaine, and count two referred to the possession of heroin. We note, however, that there is no indication that the legislature intended to authorize multiple punishment for the simultaneous possession of more than one narcotic.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Rawls, </em>198 Conn. 111, 121, 502 A.2d 374 (1985). Although the crimes of possession and possession with intent to sell both prohibit illegal transactions involving narcotic sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>stances, a prosecutor may not create one offense of each from a single transaction by particularizing various narcotic substances in separate counts. Id., 120. We find, therefore, that this distinction relied upon by the state is insufficient to base a finding that the two offenses were not the same act or transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\"With respect to the second condition, \u2018where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.\u2019 <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932). In making this determination, we look only to the information and the bill of particulars. <em>State </em>v. <em>Troynack, </em>174 Conn. 89, 96-97, 384 A.2d 326 (1977). \u2018The test for determining whether one violation is a lesser included offense in another violation is whether it is possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser. If it is possible, then the lesser violation is not an included crime.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 52, 61-62, 301 A.2d 547 (1972). Viewed schematically, a lesser included offense is a concentric circle within the greater offense whereas separate but overlapping offenses may be seen as intersecting circles.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>179 Conn. 239, 242-43, 425 A.2d 1293 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Applying this test to the crimes for which the defendant was convicted, we conclude that a person could not commit the greater offense of possession of a narcotic substance with the intent to sell without, likewise, having committed the lesser offense of simple possession. <em>State </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>supra, 243; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Goldson, </em>178 Conn. 422, 423 A.2d 114 (1979) (conviction of possession of heroin and of transportation of heroin violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>186 Conn. 26, 438 A.2d 1183 (1982) (possession of narcotics treated as lesser included offense of possession with intent to sell); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Devino, </em>supra, 75 (conviction for possession of narcotics and for illegal sale of narcotics not a violation of double jeopardy; one may either possess narcotics legally yet sell them illegally or sell narcotics without possessing them).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u201c[E]ven if offenses are the same under <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[supra], the legislature may nevertheless explicitly authorize multiple punishments for their commission without violating the prohibition of double jeopardy. See <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 493, 499 n.8, 104 S. Ct. 2536, 81 L. Ed. 2d 425 (1984); <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 367-68, 103 S. Ct. 673, 74 L. Ed. 2d 535 (1983).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Devino, </em>supra, 76 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We find nothing on the face of these two criminal statutes, nor have the parties indicated the existence of any legislative history that indicates the legislature\u2019s intent to provide multiple punishments for simple possession of narcotics and possession with intent to sell. The state\u2019s argument to the contrary notwithstanding, \u201c[u]nless a clear intention to fix separate penalties for each [offense] involved is expressed, the issue should be resolved in favor of lenity and against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rawls, </em>supra, 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Because the crimes of possession of narcotics, and possession with intent to sell constitute parts of a single offense; <em>State </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>supra, 245; and there is no expression of legislative intent that the crimes warrant separate punishment, the defendant\u2019s conviction on both counts violated the constitutional and common law prohibitions against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">There remains for our consideration of this issue the proper scope of our remand. Had the trial court prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>erly treated the charges of possession with intent to sell and simple possession as greater and lesser included offenses, respectively, it would have made it unnecessary in this case for the jury to consider the lesser offense after finding guilt on the greater. Double jeopardy would have been precluded. We now must circumscribe our order of remand for the trial court to render the proper judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rawls, </em>supra, after finding duplicitous convictions of possession of cocaine <em>and </em>possession of heroin, set aside the judgment on the latter possession of narcotics count.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In <em>State v. Amaral, </em>supra, 245, after holding that the three heroin charges were parts of a single offense, the court found it \u201cnecessary for the judgment to be modified so as to reflect only a sentence of not less than five nor more than ten years imprisonment on the greater offense, sale by a non-drug-dependent person.\u201d After finding that the crime of possession of heroin was a lesser included offense of the crime of transportation of heroin, the court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Goldson, </em>supra, 427, remanded the case with direction to render judgment for the defendant on the first count of the information charging him with such possession of heroin. This court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Stellato, </em>10 Conn. App. 447, 457, 523 A.2d 1345 (1987), set aside the judgment of conviction on the lesser of the duplicitous counts and remanded with direction to render judgment of not guilty on that charge. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitt, </em>supra, 490, the direction was given to the trial court to exercise its discretion and set aside the conviction on either of the two conspiracy counts of unequal severity and to render judgment that the defendant was not guilty on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In <em>Ball </em>v. <em>United States, </em>470 U.S. 856, 105 S. Ct. 1668, 84 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1985), the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Supreme Court held that the vacating of <em>a </em>duplicitous federal criminal conviction by the district court was the only remedy consistent with the congressional intent against multiple punishments. Id., 864. \u201cOne of the convictions, as well as its concurrent sentence, is unauthorized punishment for a separate offense. See <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 368 [103 S. Ct. 673, 74 L. Ed. 2d 535] (1983). The second conviction, whose concomitant sentence is served concurrently, does not evaporate simply because of the concurrence of the sentence. The separate <em>conviction, </em>apart from the concurrent sentence, has potential adverse collateral consequences that may not be ignored. For example, the presence of two convictions on the record may delay the defendant\u2019s eligibility for parole or result in an increased sentence under a recidivist statute for a future offense. Moreover, the second conviction may be used to impeach the defendant\u2019s credibility and certainly carries societal stigma \u00e1ccompanying any criminal conviction. . . . Thus, the second conviction, even if it results in no greater sentence, is an impermissible punishment.\u201d (Emphasis in original; citations omitted.) <em>Ball </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 864-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Following the reasoning of <em>Ball </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, we conclude that multiple convictions for the same offense constitute impermissible punishment under the prohibition against double jeopardy. The defendant\u2019s conviction on the lesser included offense of possession of narcotics, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a), which was contained in the second count must therefore be set aside by the trial court and judgment rendered for the defendant on that count. <em>See Ball </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rawls, </em>supra, 122; <em>State </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Goldson, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Stellato, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitt, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Sufficiency of Evidence of Possession</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty on count three, possession of marihuana in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018In reviewing such a claim, we view the evidence, as we have repeatedly stated, with a view toward sustaining the verdict of the jury. <em>State </em>v. Scielzo, 190 Conn. 191, 196, 460 A.2d 951 (1983). In order to prove illegal possession of a narcotic substance, it is necessary to establish that the defendant knew the character of the substance, knew of its presence and exercised dominion and control over it. . . . Where the defendant is not in exclusive possession of the premises where the narcotics are found, \u201cit may not be inferred that [the defendant] knew of the presence of the narcotics and had control of them, unless there are other incriminating statements or circumstances tending to buttress such an inference.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Vilalastra, 9 Conn. App. 667, 673, 521 A.2d 170, cert. granted, 203 Conn. 806, 525 A.2d 521 (1987).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">It is clear from the evidence that the defendant was not in exclusive possession of the premises where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>marihuana was found. There were, however, other incriminating circumstances which support the inference that the defendant constructively possessed the marihuana found in the top dresser drawer. It is undisputed that the room where the marihuana was located was the bedroom of the defendant, which he shared with Laing. Aside from the double bed, the dresser from which the marihuana was seized was the only piece of furniture in the room. The officer who discovered the marihuana testified that the top drawer in which he found the substance also contained men\u2019s jewelry. The defendant was found lying on the bed, at an arm\u2019s length from a large quantity of cocaine. Furthermore, the police discovered over $1000 in the defendant\u2019s wallet, which was on the dresser, and over $300 in the defendant\u2019s socks, which he was wearing at the time. On the basis of this evidence, the jury\u2019s conclusion that the defendant knew of the presence of the marihuana and exercised control over it was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The defendant further claims that the court\u2019s use of examples in its instructions to the jury on the element of possession erroneously expanded the scope of this element. The defendant relies upon the following examples of possession given by the court during its charge: \u201cI possess, for example, this book on the desk in front of me, even though it actually belongs to the State of Connecticut, simply because it is before me and subject to my control and dominion. I also possess a briefcase which happens to be in my chambers because it is also under my control. I possess my car, which is out in the parking lot, because it is also under my control. I also possess furniture and other items in my home, even though I am not actually there now, for the same reason; because they are under my control and domin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ion. . . . Now, sometimes more than one person may possess the same item. This is known as joint possession. For example, the furniture in my home or in someone\u2019s home might be jointly owned by husband and wife.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018 \u201cIn considering whether an illustration is fair or prejudicial, it is necessary to consider the instructions as a whole and all the facts and circumstances surrounding the trial and shown by the evidence, such as the complexity or simplicity of the issues and the multiplicity of facts.\u201d <em>Luteran </em>v. <em>United States, </em>93 F.2d 395, 401 (8th Cir. 1937), cert. denied, 303 U.S. 644, 58 S. Ct. 642, 82 L. Ed. 1103 (1938).\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 248, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The defendant\u2019s first contention is that the examples given by the court refer to the proximity of the item possessed and the person deemed to have possession of such item. The defendant claims that such examples were contrary to the limitation upon constructive possession set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>195 Conn. 624, 633, 490 A.2d 75 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>supra, 634-35, the court held that the mere presence of marihuana in the kitchen of an apartment shared by the defendant and two other persons did not support the inference that the defendant knew of its presence or exercised dominion and control over it. The court held that additional evidence, circumstantial or supportive, was required to warrant such an inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">We find nothing in the trial court\u2019s charge which is contrary to <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>supra, or which could have reasonably misled the jury on the element of possession. Nowhere in the trial court\u2019s instructions was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>jury told that it may infer possession merely because the defendant was in close proximity to the narcotics. To the contrary, the jury was instructed that \u201cwhere the defendant is not in exclusive possession of the premises where the narcotics are found, it may not be inferred that he knew of the presence of the narcotics and had control over them unless there are other incriminating circumstances tending to buttress such an inference.\u201d Considering the instructions as a whole, we find that the jury was charged correctly on the element of possession in accordance with the holding of <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>supra. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>supra.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The defendant further alleges that the trial court erred by not cautioning the jury that the examples given during its instructions are only examples, and that they must determine guilt or innocence by following the jury instructions as a whole. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>supra, 247-48. At trial, the defendant took no exception to the court\u2019s charge on this basis. We shall not, therefore, review this claim further, other than to note that the failure to caution the jury in this case does not constitute plain error. See Practice Book \u00a7 4061.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">There is error in part, the judgment as to count two, possession of narcotics in violation of General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\u00a7 21a-279 (a) is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment that the defendant is not guilty on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 21a-277.

Our review of the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is still governed by the principles announced in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rutan, </em>194 Conn. 438, 479 A.2d 1209 (1984). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>9 Conn.

The defendant alleges that the use of the phrase \u201csubject to\u201d undercuts the statutory definition of \u201cpossession\u201d which requires that a person \u201chave physical possession or otherwise to exercise dominion or control. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (2). Although we recognize that being \u201csubject to\u201d one\u2019s control or dominion may, in certain contexts, be legally distinguishable from the actual exercise of control or dominion, the defendant\u2019s distinction is drawn with a fine line. Viewing the charge as a whole, we do not find that the jury could reasonably have been misled by the court\u2019s statement. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>201 Conn. 505, 513-17, 523 A.2d 1252 (1986) (defining the term \u201cpossess\u201d and upholding the court\u2019s use of examples identical to those in the present case).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
