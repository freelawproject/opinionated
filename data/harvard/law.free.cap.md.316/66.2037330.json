ORTH, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">The question on this appeal is whether the Circuit Court for Baltimore City erred in ordering disclosure to the federal government for use in a civil proceeding against a private corporation of materials obtained from the corporation by the Grand Jury of Maryland in the course of a criminal investigation. We hold that the court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">About the middle of June 1986, the Attorney General of Maryland, in compliance with gubernatorial mandates, <em>see In Re Special Investigation No. 185, </em>293 Md. 652, 654, 446 A.2d 1151 (1982), brought the attention of the Grand Jury of Maryland, convened in Baltimore City, to a private corporation acting as a pharmaceutical Medicaid provider (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>pharmacy).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Documents, including records of prescriptions filled at two of the pharmacy\u2019s stores, were obtained through subpoenas duces tecum issued by the Grand Jury. The documents concerned the pharmacy and a licensed pharmacist employed by the pharmacy (the employee) in the activities of the pharmacy as a Medicaid provider.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In May 1988, the investigation was discontinued. No indictments were returned. The Grand Jury disbanded. The pharmacy had reported that certain subpoenaed documents which the State permitted it to retain temporarily had been destroyed. Nevertheless, the State felt that any monies that may have been overpaid by Medicaid should be recovered. So it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>turned to State civil procedures. In the middle of June 1988, the State filed a motion in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City seeking authority to disclose to named State agencies all documents obtained by the Baltimore City Grand Jury and the State from the pharmacy \u201cfor the sole purpose of pursuing any State civil and administrative proceedings to recover any amounts previously overpaid to [the pharmacy].\u201d The pharmacy \u201cagreed and consented to\u201d the disclosure but with a proviso. It declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">By consenting to this disclosure, [it] does not waive its rights to object to further disclosure to other persons or agencies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The employee was not a party to the consent. The court granted the motion and issued an order in accord therewith on 14 June \u00cd988.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Then the State decided to request the federal government to pursue civil remedies. On 23 June 1988, the State filed another motion in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City seeking disclosure of certain Grand Jury materials, this time to the federal government so it could seek civil sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Upon a hearing, the court granted the State\u2019s motion by order dated 20 July 1988. On 22 July 1988, the State filed a \u201cMotion for Appropriate Relief (Motion to Supplement Record).\u201d The State sought permission to have a letter of transmittal accompany the documents ordered to be disclosed. The court granted the motion on the date it was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The pharmacy and the employee noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals \u201cfrom the Orders of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City entered in this action on July 20, 1988 and July 22, 1988, authorizing the disclosure of grand jury materials.\u201d We granted appellants\u2019 petition for the issuance of a writ of certiorari before decision by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>THE GRAND JURY</p>\n<p id=\"Ahs\">\n<em>The Common Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The grand jury is of ancient English vintage. It stemmed from the \u201cGrand Assize\u201d established by Henry II, primarily as a weapon for the King\u2019s use in enforcing the King\u2019s peace. Gilbert, <em>The Grand Jury\u2014An Indictment, </em>The Law Forum 4 (fall, 1987). An accusation by the Grand Assize was followed by trial by ordeal in the form of cold water or hot water or hot iron or abominable morsel. <em>Id. </em>The ordeal was of such nature that conviction usually followed an accusation. Although the barbarous trial by ordeal was abolished in 1215, the accuser and the trier of the facts, unlike today, were the same body. <em>In re Report of Grand Jury, </em>152 Md. 616, 619, 137 A. 370 (1927). Gradually, however, the grand jury concept evolved to be that as we now know it. In the forty-second year of Edward III, at a commission of oyer and terminer, \u201cthe sheriff of the county was required ... to return a panel of knights, which the old records designate as \u2018Le Graunde Inquest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620, 137 A. 370. \u201cFrom that early time on to the present,\u201d we observed in <em>In re Report of Grand Jury, </em>152 Md. at 621, 137 A. 370, and quoted in <em>In Re Special Investigation No. 236, </em>295 Md. 573, 577-578, 458 A.2d 75 (1983),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">the grand jury has been continued and preserved as an institution necessary for the preservation of the peace, good order, and dignity of the state in bringing to trial those guilty of violations of law, and in protecting people from being put on trial upon frivolous, unfounded, or false accusations.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">So, at the common law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">just as no man may be convicted and punished of a felony without the unanimous verdict of twelve of his peers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>constituting a petit jury, neither can he be put to his trial for any such offense except upon the presentment or indictment by at least twelve of his fellow citizens, constituting the grand jury.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><em>In re Report of Grand Jury, </em>152 Md. at 621, 137 A. 370. Given that the two great purposes of the grand jury are to bring to trial those who are properly charged with crime, and to protect the citizen against unfounded accusations of crime, it is clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">[t]he grand jury is an accusing body, and not a judicial tribunal, and it acts upon knowledge possessed by its members from any source, whether from witnesses brought before it, or from information gained before its sessions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\"><em>Coblentz v. State, </em>164 Md. 558, 566, 166 A. 45 (1933). We said in <em>Blaney v. State, </em>74 Md. 153, 156, 21 A. 547 (1891):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADG\">[I]n this State they have plenary inquisitorial powers, and may lawfully themselves, and upon their own motion, originate charges against offenders though no prelimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>nary proceedings have been had before a magistrate, and though neither the court nor the State\u2019s Attorney has laid the matter before them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">In the exercise of the broad inquisitorial power enjoyed by the grand jury, however, it is confined to an investigation of violations of the criminal law. <em>In re Report of Grand Jury, </em>152 Md. at 622, 137 A. 370. In <em>In Re Special Investigation No. 236, </em>295 Md. at 583, 458 A.2d 75, we declared: \u201cThe conclusion is inescapable that at common law the grand jury was concerned with matters criminal.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHZ\">\u201c[UJnless such investigations [of matters criminal] disclose facts which would constitute a recognized violation of the criminal law, [the grand jury] have no power or authority to criticize any particular individual or number of individuals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\"><em>In Re Report of Grand Jury, </em>152 Md. at 623, 137 A. 370. In other words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">If the evidence obtained through their investigations warrants a presentment or indictment, under the law and the oath which they are required to take, they are bound to present or indict, and if in their judgment it falls short of showing the commission of a criminal offense, they are bound to refrain from making public the results of their investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\n<em>The Grand Jury Under the Federal Government</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A6_\">As we have seen, an integral part of the common law was the right of a person in a criminal cause to have his fate placed in the hands of his country, that is, in a jury of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>peers. The jury concept encompassed not only the determination of a person\u2019s guilt or innocence of a crime charged, but also whether he should be charged with a crime in the first place. Whether to charge was the function of a \u201cgrand\u201d jury. The determination of guilt or innocence of a crime charged was the function of a \u201cpetit\u201d jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">When the British colonies were established in America, the common law of England followed. The time came when the colonists found it necessary to throw off the English yoke and obtain relief from the suppression of their \u201cunalienable Rights.\u201d They won their independence on the field of battle and proclaimed it by a Declaration of Independence. Then,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Att\">they ordained and established a Constitution for the United States of America. The Constitution became effective on 4 March 1789, the day fixed for the commencement of the operations of the government, by virtue of its ratification by the conventions of eleven states, of which Maryland was one. On 25 September 1789, Congress proposed ten amendments which were declared ratified on 15 December 1791. The amendments became known as the Bill of Rights because they went to ensure and preserve those \u201cunalienable rights\u201d so arduously won in the fight for independence.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">One of the rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights was the entitlement of an accused to a jury. The Fifth Amendment concerned the grand jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury____[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\n<em>The Grand Jury in the State of Maryland</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ASR\">In Maryland, there is no constitutional right of a person accused of a crime to be indicted by a grand jury. The federal constitutional provision is not applicable to the states, <em>see Hurtado v. California, </em>110 U.S. 516, 535, 4 S.Ct. 111, 120, 28 L.Ed. 232 (1884); the Maryland Constitution does not bestow the right, and common law rights may be changed by legislative enactment, judicial opinion, and rules of court. <em>Lutz v. State, </em>167 Md. 12, 15, 172 A. 354 (1934). It once was that in Maryland the right to indictment by a grand jury was given by legislative enactment implemented by the Maryland Rules, but subsequent legislation and rule amendments abrogated the right, although retaining a grand jury indictment as one means of charging an accused of certain crimes. The law as it was and the legislative history of the partial demise of the right to indictment by a grand jury are traced in <em>Moaney v. State, </em>28 Md.App. 408, 346 A.2d 466 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Although there is no Maryland constitutional right to indictment by a grand jury, the organic law of this State recognizes the grand jury concept in our system of criminal justice. \u201cWe, the People of the State of Maryland\u201d declared in Article 5 of the Declaration of Rights</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">That the Inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the Common Law of England, and the trial by Jury, according to the course of that Law____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">And \u201cwe\u201d declared in Article 21 of the Declaration of Rights</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">That in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right to be informed of the accusation against him; to have a copy of the Indictment, or charge, in due time (if required) to prepare for his defence; ... and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury, without whose unanimous consent he ought not to be found guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Although the grand jury is not expressly named, its recognition is implicit in Article 5 by the entitlement to the common law of England, and in Article 21 inasmuch as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>primary purposes of an indictment returned by a grand jury is to fulfill the constitutional requirements contained in that article. <em>State v. Morton, </em>295 Md. 487, 490, 456 A.2d 909 (1983); <em>Ayre v. State, </em>291 Md. 155, 163, 433 A.2d 1150 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Despite the absence of a constitutional right, it is manifest that the grand jury still plays an important role in the administration of criminal justice in this State. A grand jury is convened in every county and in Baltimore City. The Maryland Code is replete with provisions concerning the grand jury and grand jurors. The declared policy of this State is that every citizen who maintains his name on the roll of voters registered for State elections shall have the opportunity to serve on grand juries and the obligation to serve when summoned. Maryland Code (1973, 1984 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-102(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Under the Maryland Rules, a \u201ccharging document\u201d includes an indictment, Rule 4-102(a), and an \u201cindictment\u201d means \u201ca charging document returned by a grand jury and filed in a circuit court,\u201d Rule 4-102(d). More often than not, when charges against an accused originate in the circuit court, they emanate from the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">SECRECY AND THE GRAND JURY</p>\n<p id=\"A4E\">Secrecy is the lifeblood of the grand jury. The Supreme Court said in <em>Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, </em>441 U.S. 211, 218-219, 99 S.Ct. 1667, 1672-1673, 60 L.Ed.2d 156 (1979) (footnotes and citation omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">We consistently have recognized that the proper functioning of our grand jury system depends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. In particular, we have noted several distinct intereste served by safe guarding the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings. First, if preindictment proceedings were made public, many prospective witnesses would be hesitant to come forward voluntarily, knowing that those against whom they testify would be aware of that testimony. Moreover, witness<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>es who appeared before the grand jury would be less likely to testify fully and frankly, as they would be open to retribution as well as to inducements. There also would be the risk that those about to be indicted would flee, or would try to influence individual grand jurors to vote against indictment. Finally, by preserving the secrecy of the proceedings, we assure that persons who are accused but exonerated by the grand jury will not be held up to public ridicule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u201cGrand jury secrecy, then,\u201d the Court pointed out in <em>United States v. Sells Engineering Inc., </em>463 U.S. 418, 424-425, 103 S.Ct. 3133, 3188-3139, 77 L.Ed.2d 743 (1983), quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>319 U.S. 503, 513, 63 S.Ct. 1233, 1238, 87 L.Ed. 1546 (1943), \u201cis \u2018as important for the protection of the innocent as for the pursuit of the guilty.\u2019 \u201d This Court stated in <em>Coblentz v. State, </em>164 Md. at 566-567, 166 A. 45, that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">is an inflexible requirement that [the grand jury\u2019s] investigations shall be carried on secretly and free from outside interference or influence; and great care is taken that they shall be so carried on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In response to a Motion for Reconsideration in <em>Jones v. State, </em>297 Md. 7, 28, 464 A.2d 977 (1983) (citations omitted), we made clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">[t]he rule of secrecy surrounding grand jury proceedings is a product of the common law and \u201cis designed to protect the jury from outside interference or pressure[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXE\">We noted that the secrecy rule is not designed for the protection of witnesses, but for that of grand jurors and in furtherance of public justice. <em>Id. </em>And, we added, nor does the witness have a privilege of having his testimony treated as a confidential communication. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The Court in <em>Coblentz </em>explained that \u201c[t]he purposes of [the secrecy rule] are many.\u201d 164 Md. at 567, 166 A. 45.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE\">Freedom of inquiry is to be preserved, and at the same time individuals whose conduct may be investigated, but against whom no indictment may be found, are to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>protected from disrepute, and all individuals are to be protected from one-sided presentations of unfavorable evidence, without opportunity to reply, before any one present unnecessarily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><em>Id. </em>There is a statutory prescription, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">[a]ll persons who have been selected for grand jury service in the circuit court of any county in the State shall take an oath of secrecy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Md.Code (1973, 1984 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-213(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. And the legislature has declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">A grand juror, except when lawfully required by a court, may not willfully disclose (1) any evidence adduced before the grand jury, or (2) anything which he himself or any member of the grand jury said, or in what manner he or any other grand juror voted, regarding any matter before the grand jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-7\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8-213(b). A stenographer appointed \u201cto take and transcribe the testimony given before the grand jury for the exclusive use and benefit of the grand jury and the State\u2019s Attorney for the county, unless otherwise ordered by the court,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2-503(a), \u201cshall take and subscribe an oath that he will keep secret all matters and things occurring before the grand jury,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2-503(b)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Coblentz, </em>164 Md. at 567, 166 A. 45, the Court said that secrecy is \u201cinherent in the grand jury system with all the force of a statutory enactment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States v. Edgerton, </em>80 F. 374, 375 (D.C.Mont.1897). And it noted that secrecy</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">is found embodied in the familiar grand jury oath that the members sworn shall keep secret the counsel of the state, their fellows, and their own, and shall not present any one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>for envy, hatred, or malice, nor leave anyone unpresented for fear, favor, or affection, or hope of reward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">164 Md. at 567, 166 A. 45. The Court deemed the rule of secrecy to be \u201cnot merely a remedial one, that injury shown to have been sustained by the accused in a particular case shall be remedied, but also a preventive one, which interposes in advance for private benefit and public benefit as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court was aware that \u201c[discriminations between degrees of departure from [the rule] are difficult to manage____\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">unless the bar is maintained in all cases, it can hardly have any effective existence. Therefore, the law must act upon the existence of opportunity, rather than await proof of abuse....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\"><em>Id. See In Re Special Investigation No. 236, </em>295 Md. at 582, 458 A.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\n<em>Exceptions to the Rule of Secrecy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AzEA\">In <em>Dennis v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 855, 870, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 1849, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966), the Court noted \u201cthe growing realization that disclosure, rather than suppression, of relevant materials [obtained by the grand jury] ordinarily promotes the proper administration of criminal justice.\u201d This view has been noticed by both the federal government and this State and is reflected in a rule adopted in each jurisdiction. The federal rale came first. Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is concerned with \u201cThe Grand Jury.\u201d Subsection (e)(2), entitled \u201cGeneral Rule of Secrecy\u201d prohibits the disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury by certain persons under pain of contempt of court. Paragraph (8) sets out exceptions. Sub-paragraph (C)(i) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">(C) Disclosure otherwise prohibited by this rule of matters occurring before the grand jury may also be made\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1I\">(i) when so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">Subsection (e)(5) calls for the court to \u201corder a hearing on matters affecting a grand jury to be closed to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>necessary to prevent disclosure of matters occurring before a grand jury.\u201d Subsection (e)(6) provides that \u201c[r]ecords, orders and subpoenas relating to grand jury proceedings shall be kept under seal to the extent and for such time as is. necessary to prevent disclosure of matters occurring before a grand jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Maryland Rules 4-641 through 4-644 apply to circuit court procedures relating to criminal investigations. \u201c \u2018Criminal investigation\u2019 [includes] inquiries into alleged criminal activities conducted by a grand jury____\u201d Rule 4-641. Rule 4-642(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">Unless disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury is permitted by law without court authorization, a motion for disclosure of such matters shall be filed in the circuit court where the grand jury convened. If the moving party is a State\u2019s Attorney who is seeking disclosure for enforcement of the criminal law of a state or the criminal law of the United States, the hearing shall be ex parte. In all other cases, the moving party shall serve a copy of the motion upon the State\u2019s Attorney, the parties to the judicial proceeding if disclosure is sought in connection with such a proceeding, and such other persons as the court may direct. The court shall conduct a hearing if requested within 15 days after service of the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Rule 4-642(a) requires that \u201c[f]iles and records of the court relating to the conduct of criminal investigations shall be sealed and shall be open to inspection only by order of the court.\u201d Section (b) states that \u201c[h]earings before the court relating to conduct of criminal investigations shall be on the record and shall be conducted out of the presence of all persons except those whose presence is necessary.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>It is apparent that the federal disclosure rule and the Maryland disclosure rule are cut from the same cloth. They are both founded on the tenet that secrecy is inherent in the function of the grand jury. They both recognize that unwarranted intrusion on that secrecy is not to be tolerated. They both insist that generally the secrecy as to records and hearings related to matters occurring before the grand jury must be preserved. They both suggest that \u2018 [i]n the absence of a clear indication in statute or rule, the courts must always be reluctant to conclude that a breach of this secrecy has been authorized.\u201d <em>Sells, </em>463 U.S. at 425, 103 S.Ct. at 3138. They both evidence an awareness, however, that the veil of secrecy with which the grand jury is cloaked must be lifted at times in the interest of justice. But this may be done only discretely and limitedly. In the absence of law permitting disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury without court authorization, a court order is a condition precedent to disclosure. Neither rule, however, offers or suggests a standard under which the order shall be issued. We are informed by the Minutes of the Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of 15-16 October 1982 at p. 15 that Rule 4-642(c) \u201cto a large extent follows the language of [Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(3)(C)(i) ] regarding non-disclosure and exceptions to non-disclosure\u201d and it is indeed manifest that the lineaments of the two rules are fundamentally the same. As a practical matter the two rules are apart in only one respect. The federal rule requires that disclosure be \u201cpreliminarily or in connection with a judicial proceeding.\u201d The Maryland Rule does not have this requirement. It goes no further in that respect than to prescribe that \u201cthe parties to the judicial proceeding\u201d shall be served with a copy of the motion for disclosure \u201cif disclosure is sought in connection with such a proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">To this time we have not been called upon to apply Rule 4-642(c). As we shall see, however, in deciding several cases presenting questions related to disclosure of grand jury matters, we have followed interpretations advanced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the Supreme Court with respect to the federal disclosure rule. When we consider the lack of guidelines in our rule, and when we read the two rules in the light of the basis, objective, and procedures common to both of them, we are constrained to seek guidance in the Supreme Court cases relating to the federal rule. The interpretations of the Supreme Court of the federal rule are, of course, not binding on us, but, in the circumstances, they are most persuasive, and we are inclined to follow them.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">We search for guidelines governing disclosure in the following cases of the Supreme Court:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHs\"><em>United States v.

In <em>Abbott, </em>460 U.S. at 567, 103 S.Ct. at 1361, the Court, observing that the federal rule authorizes the trial court \u201cto permit certain disclosures that are otherwise prohibited by the \u2018General Rule of Secrecy,\u2019 \u201d pointed out that \u201c[t]he scope of that authority has been delineated in a series of cases setting forth the standard of \u2018particularized need.\u2019 \u201d The Court referred to <em>Douglas Oil, </em>441 U.S. at 221-224, 99 S.Ct. at 1674-1676; <em>Procter &amp; Gamble, </em>356 U.S. at 682, 78 S.Ct. at 986, and <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass, </em>360 U.S. at 398-399, 79 S.Ct. at 1240-1241. It appears that the standard on which the Court looked with favor is that as enunciated in <em>Douglas Oil, </em>441 U.S. at 222, 99 S.Ct. at 1674:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad9\">From <em>Procter &amp; Gamble </em>and <em>Dennis </em>emerges the standard for determining when the traditional secrecy of the grand jury may be broken: Parties seeking grand jury transcripts under Rule 6(e) must show that the material they seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding, that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy, and that their request is structured to cover only material so needed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">This standard is referred to by the Supreme Court as the <em>\u201cDouglas-Oil </em>standard.\u201d <em>Sells, </em>463 U.S. at 445, 103 S.Ct. at 3149.

We declare as the standard in Maryland for the particularized need requirement for disclosure to be as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Parties seeking a court order for disclosure under Md.

Persons called upon to testify will consider the likelihood that their testimony may one day be disclosed to outside parties. Pear of future retribution or social stigma may act as powerful deterrents to those who would come forward and aid the grand jury in the performance of its duties. Concern as to the future consequences of frank and full testimony is heightened where the witness is an employee of a company under investigation.

The judge estimated that \u201cthere were a hundred thousand prescriptions in many of those\u201d and a plethora of computer printouts and other documents.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But, noted the judge, \u201cout of all those documents which were submitted,\u201d the State is requesting only \u201c112 documents ... and daily prescription receipts, computer printouts\u201d for two stores covering a period of six months \u201cbe released from grand jury secrecy and be permitted to be disclosed to [the federal government].\u201d The judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">The argument is made that the disclosure of this material is particularized, that grand jury secrecy would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>be compromised by disclosing these documents as they are an infinitesimal part of the total submissions in response to the total grand jury subpoenas. The argument is made that the grand jury has concluded its life, that there were no witnesses who testified, so there\u2019s no testamentary evidence to be transmitted, and that these documents being such an infinitesimal part of grand jury investigation would not in any way compromise or indicate to any person outside that grand jury or outside the confines of those parties in this court what the workings of the grand jury were.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The judge found the arguments to be persuasive and explained why:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">The grand jury is out of existence. Looking at these records, which records are required to be kept in the ordinary course of business of being a part of the medicaid program by [the pharmacy] and records required to be kept by [the employee] ... cannot by any stretch of the imagination, if they are disclosed, show that they were in any way even submitted to a grand jury, much less have been a part of the grand jury process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">With respect to the computer printouts, the judge observed:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">The computer printouts are the end result of all of the information contained on the prescription forms and it was [the pharmacy\u2019s] choice to use the computer printouts without the back-up documents which are the prescription onionskins. These computer printouts are about 4 inches, maybe 5, just looking at them, and would be I guess about one-eighth or one-sixth of a banker\u2019s box of material of a total twelve boxes which are received. In no way would they compromise the secrecy of the grand jury by turning them over or disclosing them to the [federal government].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The judge discussed other arguments made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">The argument is advanced by the [pharmacy and the employee] that to disclose these documents is to violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the secrecy of the grand jury and to make the grand jury a civil investigative arm of a federal agency. The argument is that once these items have been turned into the grand jury in response to the subpoena, that they can no longer be transmitted further without violating the rule of grand jury secrecy and that it is to protect those investigated as well as those against who no indictment has been returned. No indictment has been returned, that is true, and the parties who were the subjects of investigation have not been made public and that is true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXb\">The judge referred to the particularized need requirement and pointed out that to date the Court of Appeals cases as to the requirement were only with respect to testimony before the grand jury for use in criminal proceedings. The judge distinguished those cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\">We don\u2019t have testimony here. Consequently, in this Court\u2019s view at least, there would appear to be absolutely no indication to [the federal government] that the material being disclosed would show the workings of the grand jury, the process of the grand jury, what took place before the grand jury or what testimony was given before the grand jury, and in fact would not invade the secrecy of the grand jury at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The judge added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">One further comment in that area. These are records which have been kept and had to have been kept under law in the ordinary course of business extrinsic of grand jury, and do not have a life only because of the grand jury, but had a life before the grand jury came into existence and have a continuing life for the statutory period under which they\u2019re required to be kept, so that, again, disclosure would not compromise in any way, in this Court\u2019s view, the secrecy of the grand jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The judge continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">Quite the contrary. It would further the purposes for which the State is requesting the disclosure of these documents to the [federal government] and that is in accord with the law which requires that the State and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Federal Government share equally the cost of paying for the medicaid prescriptions in the medicaid program, and that as a possible rollover or end result of cooperation, the State is charged under federal law with determining if there are any problems with reference to fraud and the submission' of medicaid invoices, and if so, then the CMPL [ (federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law) ] Unit was set up specifically to handle those areas or those cases where the Department of Justice, which is referred to as the DOJ, declines prosecution. That isn\u2019t to say that one remedy, the criminal remedy, would be exclusive of a civil remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">Quite the contrary. If the DOJ did decide to prosecute, CMPL would also be able to carry out their civil remedies at the same time or subsequent to any criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The judge made clear, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">[i]n this case, there\u2019s no suggestion that there will be any criminal prosecution. Quite the contrary. The Attorney General\u2019s Office declines to prosecute and under those circumstances, it would not appear likely to this Court that there would ever be a criminal prosecution; however, the possible penalties to be imposed by CMPL, which have been referred to by the respondent as draconian, could conceivably be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The judge did not \u201cknow what the CMPL Unit\u2019s track record has been in terms of what they do with the material that they receive in these situations which would leave them to take action----\u201d But he was fully aware of the possible consequences.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">[T]here would be a $2,000 per prescription penalty which would make it $224,000 and then a double billing of the $1311 which would make that $2622 which would make a total monetary penalty that CMPL could impose would be $226,622, but more than that, CMPL could disqualify [the pharmacy] from any further involvement in the medicaid program. That could have a severe financial impact on [the pharmacy]. Of that, there can be no question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The bottom line was that \u201cthe court believe[d] that, under all the circumstances, disclosure should be permitted of the documents which have been the subject of the hearing....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9M\">In fairness to the pharmacy and the employee, however, the judge decided to \u201cstay the effect of this order----\u201d He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">It would just seem to me logical and reasonable that, since this is a case of first impression and I believe it truly is a case of first impression, that it would be foolish on this Court\u2019s part not to order the stay of the effect of this order pending a final decision.... I just believe that what I say is obviously not the final word and I would not want it to be. I would want to have this matter very carefully reviewed by the Court of Special Appeals and the Court of Appeals, if necessary, and I suspect that it will ultimately reach that level, so that there would be guidance in the future on these kinds of cases, because I anticipate that there will be more of them, and as the Judge charged in this Circuit with the responsibility of hearing the grand jury cases, I would like to have the guidance of the Court of Special Appeals and the Court of Appeals to follow in these areas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\n<em>The Order of Disclosure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The order of 20 July 1988 granted the State\u2019s Motion for Disclosure of Grand Jury Materials.

The first manifold copy of the prescriptions listed on Exhibit A. Manifold prescription forms are frequently the actual invoice submitted to Medicaid by a participating pharmacy. In this case, since [the pharmacy] billed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>[the State Medicaid program] by computer, they merely substantiate the computer billing and the pharmacy\u2019s legal and ethical right to dispense the medication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">2. [The pharmacy\u2019s] daily prescription report for [two designated] stores for October 1, 1985 through March 31, 1986.

The list set out the prescription number, the name of the patient, the date the prescription was originally filled, the date it was refilled, the cost, and the store in which it was filled.

The order stayed the disclosure permitted \u201cuntil the issuance of the mandate of the Court of Special Appeals in the appeal of this matter and, if certiorari is granted, the mandate of the Court of Appeals____\u201d The order further provided: \u201cThis proceeding and all other pleadings thereto are hereby sealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\n<em>The Letter of Transmittal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Two days after the order authorizing disclosure to the federal government, the State filed a \u201cMotion for Appropriate Relief (Motion to Supplement Record).\u201d The State sought permission to forward the documents with an explanatory letter. The request had been anticipated by counsel for the pharmacy and the employee and was questioned at the conclusion of the hearing on the motion to disclose. Counsel asked the judge whether he was going to permit the State as a part of its disclosure to the federal government to provide</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">the summaries of the documents, its analysis of the documents which is prepared in the grand jury sessions and during the grand jury process, and to comment on the nature of a report or cover letter explaining what we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>have here, other than just dropping the documents into an envelope and sending them....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">At the judge\u2019s request the State responded. It explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">the only summary or analysis prepared by Medicaid Fraud Unit investigators during the course of the investigation is contained as Exhibit A to the disclosure motion. It is a summary of the name of the prescription, the date of the original prescription was submitted and paid, and the date that the unauthorized refill was submitted and paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">With reference to statements made by the pharmacy\u2019s counsel and the head of the pharmacy unit, the State\u2019s position was that the statements were outside the grand jury and that they could be put in letter form and submitted to the federal government. The judge pointed out that the \u201cother items you talk about [apparently the statements] have already been agreed by the respondents not to be subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.... \u201d The judge declared that he was not going to comment on those. Counsel for the employee made it clear \u201cfor the record that [he] had not conceded ... that the interviews with [the pharmacy officials] were not testimonial or not protected by the grand jury.\u201d Counsel for the pharmacy made clear that he was concerned with the contents of any cover letter\u2014\u201c[t]hey\u2019re going to write a narrative.\u201d He told the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">I am very concerned about the cover letter. I\u2019m very concerned about the narrative and I\u2019m concerned about the grand jury secrecy in relation thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">He took the judge\u2019s comments as an indication that the judge was going to order that the State</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHe\">may construct a narrative report relating to the interpretation of [the] documents [permitted to be disclosed] made by [the State\u2019s] agents during the course of their investigation of the grand jury subpoenas and on the basis of documents which were produced in response to those subpoenas. [The State] can transmit that narrative and transmit and make that disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Asked by the court to comment, counsel for the State gave assurance</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">that beyond what is appended to the disclosure motion, there are no reports, interpretations, summaries or anything else of the fact of the grand jury investigation, what took place before the grand jury, the analysis and the documents received from the grand jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">But, counsel for the State conceded, there was additional information that she planned to disclose. She said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">I contemplate sending to the [federal government] or otherwise making available to anyone else ... the statements of [the pharmacy\u2019s] counsel as to why the documents were destroyed____ These are statements of counsel made voluntarily without the service of a grand jury subpoena, without there even being a suggestion that anyone should come in and testify before the grand jury. They were made to me. They were not made to an investigator as an interview in order to find out what went on in the [pharmacy\u2019s] stores in furtherance of grand jury investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The order of 20 July 1988, permitting disclosure, did not embrace a letter of transmittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Appended as Exhibit B to the State\u2019s Motion to Supplement the Record was a proposed, letter of transmittal. The motion called attention to the suggestion at the hearing on the Motion for Disclosure by counsel for the pharmacy and the employee that \u201cany transmittal letter explaining documents which the court ordered disclosed might bear on the issues before [the trial] court and the appeals courts.\u201d The Motion to Supplement the Record stated that, therefore, counsel for the pharmacy and the employee</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">consent to the supplementation of the record [by inclusion of the letter of transmittal], but do not thereby consent to any disclosure or transmittal of the contents of Exhibit B.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Without further comment on the record, the judge granted the Motion to Supplement the Record the same day it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>proffered by endorsing thereon \u201cSO ORDERED,\u201d and thereby approved the proposed letter of transmittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The transmittal letter was addressed to the \u201cRegional Inspector General for Investigations, Dept. of Health and Human Services,\u201d under date of 18 July 1988. It enclosed a copy of the order for disclosure issued by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and the documents to be disclosed, \u201cso that the Department of Health and Human Services could pursue any action it deems appropriate under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law.\u201d It warned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">The Order ... strictly limits the use of the documents transmitted herewith to Civil Monetary Penalties Law proceedings against the [pharmacy] and/or [its named pharmacists employee]. Any other use constitutes a violation of the Grand Jury secrecy laws and rules of the State of Maryland, and of the orders of ... the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The letter explained that three sets of documents were transmitted and described each set. The first set of documents consisted of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">[o]ne hundred twelve (112) original prescription forms. These are Maryland Medical Assistance prescriptions filled by [two of the pharmacy\u2019s stores]____ Exhibit A (to the Disclosure Motion) identifies these 112 prescriptions by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">a. Prescription number;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">b. Medical Assistance recipient;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">c. Type of medication and dosage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">d. Date the prescription was filled;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">e. Date the prescription was allegedly refilled;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-15\">f. The amount which Medical Assistance paid on the refill claim; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-16\">g. The store, identified by number, which refilled the prescription.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-17\">These prescriptions were received from [the pharmacy].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abb\">The prescriptions are being forwarded for Civil Monetary Penalties Unit consideration as evidence of false claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>because, as is facially evident, these prescriptions do not contain any authorized refills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The second set of documents consisted of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUz\">[the pharmacy\u2019s] daily prescription audit reports for [a designated store] for the dates October 1, 1985 through March 31, 1986. Separate reports are prepared for each day\u2019s prescriptions. Each daily report lists the prescriptions by prescription number. Other information included in the report is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">a. The method of payment (this information included under the column headed \u201cPlan\u201d);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">b. The [employee] pharmacist who filled or refilled the prescription (\u201cRPH\u201d);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">c. The number of pills or milliliters remaining on the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">prescription (\u201cRemain. Qty\u201d);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">d. Whether the entry denotes an original prescription, a refilling, or a deletion. This information is contained under the heading \u201cTyp\u201d. No entry indicates an original prescription, \u201cR\u201d indicates a refilling, and \u201cD\u201d indicates a deletion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">The data base for these reports is also used for the computerized billings submitted to the Maryland Medical Assistance Program (Medicaid).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">The letter gave the name of the employee pharmacist \u201cshown as submitting the refill claims for the 112 prescriptions forwarded herewith and identified on the daily prescription reports [by initials].\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">The third set of documents consisted of [d]aily prescription audit report for [a designated store] for the period October 1, 1985 through March 31, 1985. This is a single report listing all prescriptions filled during that six month period by prescription number.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">The letter explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-14\">This report was prepared by [the pharmacy] after the daily reports similar to those presented for [the other designated store] were destroyed. Although the daily reports were subject to a grand jury subpoena, [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>pharmacy] retained possession of the original document pursuant to an agreement between the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Attorney General\u2019s Office and [the] Executive Vice-President and Counsel for [the pharmacy]. The Attorney General\u2019s Office was assured by [the Executive Vice-President and the pharmacy\u2019s] District Manager ... that the documents would be properly preserved while retained by [the store]. The Attorney General was further assured that all computer information contained on these documents was protected against loss or tampering because the pharmacy computers were programmed to retain all information which a pharmacist attempted to delete, including making a record of the attempted deletion. Nevertheless, when possession of the daily audit reports for [one designated store] was sought by the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the office was advised that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">a. The daily prescription audit reports had been recently destroyed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">b. The pharmacists destroying the documents were not aware of the agreement between [the pharmacy\u2019s] counsel and the Attorney General\u2019s Office;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">c. All cash sales had since been deleted from the computers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">d. There was no fail safe mechanism for recovering this deleted information as had been originally communicated to the Attorney General\u2019s Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">The document which is transmitted herewith for [the store whose documents were destroyed] was prepared by [the pharmacy] from the information remaining on the computer and, with the exception of all cash sales, contains the same information as that described above for the daily prescription audit reports for.[the other designated store].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The transmittal letter concluded by informing the federal government that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">Maryland Medical Assistance Program payment histories proving paid claims for both original prescriptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>and refills and summarized on Exhibit A are available for your inspection at the Office of the Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, ... or may be obtained from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">THE DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In the light of all we have discussed concerning the grand jury process, we approach the determination whether the trial court erred in ordering disclosure and authorizing the letter of transmittal with the following givens:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">1) Secrecy is inherent in the grand jury system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">2) The general rule of secrecy may be breached by an order of court pursuant to Md. Rule 4-642(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">3) Disclosure of grand jury proceedings <em>vel non </em>is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The trial judge is to be guided by the following principles in the exercise of his discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">a) The party seeking disclosure by an order of court must show a particularized need for breaching the general rule of secrecy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">b) The standard for the particularized need requirement is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">i) the material sought to be disclosed is needed to avoid a possible injustice; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-13\">ii) the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-14\">iii) the request to disclose covers only materials so needed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-15\">The standard for the particularized need requirement involves a balancing. The standard is a criterion of degree; it accommodates any relevant considerations that weigh for or against disclosure in a given case. Generally, among the considerations which may be placed on the scale are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-16\">1) the need to protect the unindicted individual from disclosure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-17\">2) the grand jury has concluded its operations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>8) the particularized need requirement applies to civil governmental agencies as well as to private parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">4) the materials sought for disclosure are rationally related to the civil proceedings contemplated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">5) the materials sought may be available through ordinary discovery or other routine avenues of investigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">6) disclosure will save time and expense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">7) no indictments were returned as a result of the grand jury\u2019s investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">None of these considerations, in itself, is usually sufficient to show that there is or is not a particularized need for disclosure. But each consideration, balanced with other considerations, may weigh for or against disclosure. The weight afforded by the consideration depends upon the particular circumstances. The bottom line is that disclosure is appropriate only in those cases where the need for it outweighs the public interest in secrecy.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">In our review, pursuant to Md. Rule 8-181(c), we glean from the remarks of the trial judge leading to his order, set out in detail <em>supra, </em>that his decision was consistent with the law as we have found it to be. We are satisfied that there was a sufficient basis for the judge to find, upon balancing the relevant factors, that the three prongs of the standard to establish a particularized need for disclosure had been met by the State. Therefore, his judgment on the evidence was warranted, and we shall not disturb it. It follows that there was no abuse of judicial discretion. We hold that the judge did not err in ordering the disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">We are not persuaded to a contrary view by the arguments of appellants. We first observe that we are of a mind with them as to the general rule for grand jury secrecy and the need for the rule. Also, we are in agreement as to the requirement to show a particularized need. But the record does not show, as appellants suggest, that the trial court \u201cdisregarded this requirement, and its common law underpinnings, by granting the Attorney General\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>motions.\u201d And in the light of the standard we have enunciated for a particularized need, and the guidelines to be followed and the principles to be considered, we do not believe that the granting of the motions here will \u201copen the door to automatic disclosure of grand jury materials for civil purposes anytime the disclosure was alleged to be \u2018in the public interest.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In arguing that the trial court erred, appellants claim that the State failed to make a clear showing of \u201cparticularized need\u201d when there has been no indictment. They challenge five reasons advanced by the State and deem them to have been adopted by the trial judge for disclosure of grand jury materials for civil purposes, namely that disclosure</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">1) is in the public interest for fiscal purposes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">2) is convenient for state-federal cooperation in the enforcement of civil laws;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">3) deters other providers from similar acts and omissions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">4) is not offensive because the grand jury investigation had ended;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">5) barely implicated grand jury secrecy here because it was \u201csought only for \u2018documents\u2019 not transcripts of witness testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Appellants declare:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">Most of the arguments advanced by the Attorney General have been expressly rejected as establishing particularized need, and several are inconsistent with the reasons why grand jury matters are kept secret.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">We do not interpret the Supreme Court cases as appellants construe them. It may be that none of the State\u2019s reasons considered by itself is sufficient to establish a particularized need. But, as we have indicated, neither are any of them, alone, enough to show that there is no particularized need. The considerations behind the reasons are to be balanced and weighed according to the circumstances. Then it may be seen which way the scale tips\u2014for disclosure or against disclosure. Appellants tie the third and fourth reasons into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the failure of the grand jury to return indictments. There is no indication that the grand jury investigation was other than a <em>bona fide </em>criminal investigation. The Supreme Court\u2019s comments in <em>Procter &amp; Gamble, </em>856 U.S. at 683-684, 78 S.Ct. at 987, are appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">There is no finding that the grand jury proceeding was used as a short cut to goals otherwise barred or more difficult to reach. It is true that no indictment was returned in the present case. But that is no reflection on the integrity of the prosecution. For all we know, the trails that looked fresh at the start faded along the way. What seemed at the beginning to be a case with a criminal cast apparently took on a different character as the events and transactions were disclosed. The fact that a criminal case failed does not mean that the evidence obtained could not be used in a civil case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">As to the fifth reason, we do not quarrel with the view that the documents ordered disclosed, considered with the letter of transmittal, were within the grand jury proceedings. The documents did tend to reveal the nature, scope, subjects, and direction of the grand jury investigation. But that was why an order pursuant to Md. Rule 4-642(c) was required and why a particularized need had to be shown to support the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Appellants urge that the State\u2019s Motion for Disclosure was premature because the grand jury materials were not sought for use in connection with a judicial proceeding. They</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">recognize that the requirement that grand jury materials be sought \u201cprelminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding\u201d is expressly set out in ... the Federal Rules, while in contrast, Maryland Rule 4\u2014642(c) does not contain such an express requirement, [footnote omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK-\">They assert: \u201cSuch a requirement, however, is implicit in Maryland\u2019s common law of grand jury secrecy.\u201d We do not think that it is. Merely because the two cases in which we addressed the particularized need requirement for disclosure were in the factual posture of a judicial proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>does not read the necessity for a judicial proceeding into our common law. The Rules Committee had the federal rule before it when it drafted Md. Rule 4-642(c). This Court was aware of the provision in the federal rule when it adopted the proposal of its Committee. Neither the Committee nor this Court chose to include a \u201cjudicial proceedings\u201d requirement in the Maryland rule. Even on the assumption that the disclosure sought here was not preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding, that fact, under the particular circumstances here and in the face of our Rules, is not entitled to be weighed in the determination of a particularized need.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Appellants\u2019 final contention is that disclosure should have been denied because the State \u201csought to use grand jury information to make an unauthorized civil presentment.\u201d They declaim that in</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">stark terms, the Attorney General seeks in its actual transmittal letter (a) to brand the [pharmacy] with misconduct and (b) accuse its professional employees of criminal conduct despite the absence of a grand jury indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Of course, as we have seen <em>supra, </em>it is correct that the long-established rule is that if a grand jury does not indict, it may not publicly criticize. Appellants assert that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArQ\">[t]he Attorney General should not be heard to contend that the rule ... is inapplicable to this case because the Attorney General, and not the grand jury, intends to present the written charges against Appellants to the federal agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">We do not hear the Attorney General to that effect. And we agree that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">[t]he entire investigation was under the cloak of the grand jury which compelled the production of information by its subpoena process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">And we do not quarrel with the statement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHL\">[t]he Attorney General cannot use the power of the grand jury to obtain and develop information and then claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>that its investigation was \u201cindependent\u201d of the grand jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">We have detailed the contents of the letter of transmittal earlier in this opinion. We do not see it in the same light as do appellants. Appellants do not pinpoint the \u201cstark terms\u201d in the letter which appear to them to brand the pharmacy with misconduct and its professional employees with criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The notion that the Attorney General sought to brand the pharmacy with misconduct probably was prompted by the explanation in the letter with reference to the prescriptions. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">The prescriptions are being forwarded for Civil Monetary Penalties Unit consideration as evidence of false claims because, as is facially evident, these prescriptions do not contain any authorized refills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Inherent in the approval of the letter of transmittal by the trial judge is that he did not deem this explanation to constitute an open and public accusation of misconduct on the part of the pharmacy. The explanation did not present a conclusion reached by the grand jury. It simply called attention to what was obvious on the face of the prescriptions\u2014that they did not contain \u201cany authorized refills.\u201d Therefore, the Civil Monetary Penalties Unit could consider them, if it chose to do so, as evidence of false claims. We cannot say that the judge\u2019s approval of this explanation was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The claim that the State accuses the pharmacy\u2019s professional employees of criminal conduct apparently stems from the part of the letter concerning certain documents which were not enclosed. The letter explains that the pharmacy was permitted to retain possession of the subpoenaed daily reports of one of the stores by agreement between the State and the pharmacy. The State was assured by officials of the pharmacy that the documents would be \u201cproperly preserved\u201d and that \u201call computer information contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>on these documents was protected against loss or tampering because the pharmacy computers were programmed to retain all information which a pharmacist attempted to delete, including making a record of the attempted deletion.\u201d Later, when the State sought possession of the documents, the State was informed the daily prescription audit reports had been destroyed by pharmacist employees who \u201cwere not aware of the agreement____\u201d Furthermore, \u201c[a]ll cash sales had since been deleted from the computers,\u201d and \u201c[tjhere was no fail safe mechanism for recovering this deleted information....\u201d Nevertheless, the pharmacy was able to prepare a single report covering the period represented by the destroyed documents \u201cfrom the information remaining on the computer....\u201d The letter stated that \u201cwith the exception of all cash sales, [the report] contains the same information as that described above for the daily prescription audit reporte for [the other store].\u201d Even if the destruction of the documents were illegal in the circumstances, the part of the letter concerning it was far from an accusation of criminal conduct. The State was careful to point out that the employees destroying the documents were not aware of the agreement to preserve them. The letter gave a purely factual account providing a necessary explanation of why certain documents were not forwarded. The judge had accepted the explanation and had not placed the destruction of the documents in the balancing process. His judgment in approving the explanation appearing in the letter of transmittal was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in the orders of 20 July and 22 July 1988 permitting disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-4\">.
