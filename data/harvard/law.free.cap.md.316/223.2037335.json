We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-14\">Respondent Smith was serving a sentence in the District of Columbia when the District Court of Maryland issued a warrant for his arrest. To obtain the warrant, Detective R. J. Sheehan filed a sworn application for a statement of charges. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 4-211(b)(1) (describing procedure for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>filing a statement of charges before arrest).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That application alleged in detail the facts relating to Mr. Smith\u2019s proposed arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A District Court commissioner agreed that probable cause existed and issued a statement of charges along with an arrest warrant on the same piece of paper. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 4-212(d)(l). The document was entitled \u201cArrest Warrant on Charging Document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">On March 28, 1986, the State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County lodged that document as a detainer against Smith. On June 17, 1986, the Prince George\u2019s County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office received Smith\u2019s request that all \u201cuntried indictments, informations or complaints\u201d against him be disposed of within 180 days pursuant to the IAD. Smith was indicted on January 21, 1987\u2014218 days after the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office received his request for disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The defendant moved to dismiss the case on the ground that the warrant based on the statement of charges was an untried complaint, which had not been brought to trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>promptly under the IAD. Judge Chasanow granted the motion to dismiss, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Smith, </em>73 Md.App. 378, 534 A.2d 371 (1987). We granted certiorari to consider the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Under the IAD, a prisoner in one state may, through written request, compel the disposition of \u201cany untried indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner\u201d by another state within 180 days after the state prosecutor\u2019s office has received that request. Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 616D(a) (codifying Article III of the IAD).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office failed to act within 180 days after Smith\u2019s request for disposition. If the felony \u201cArrest Warrant on Charging Document\u201d involved here invoked the IAD, the charges against Smith were properly dismissed with prejudice. We therefore consider whether this document was an \u201cuntried complaint\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>under the IAD. <em>See Clipper v. State, </em>295 Md. 303, 307, 455 A.2d 973, 975 (1983) (\u201c[I]t is clear that for the Agreement to become activated, there must be an untried indictment, information or complaint lodged against the prisoner evidenced by a detainer.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u201c[T]he Detainer Agreement is a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact the interpretation of which presents a question of federal law.\u201d <em>Cuyler v. Adams, </em>449 U.S. 433, 442, 101 S.Ct. 703, 708-09, 66 L.Ed.2d 641, 650 (1981). \u201cThe most natural interpretation of the words \u2018indictment/ \u2018information/ and \u2018complaint\u2019 is that they refer to documents charging an individual with having committed a criminal offense.\u201d <em>Carchman v. Nash, </em>478 U.S. 716, 724, 105 S.Ct. 3401, 3405, 87 L.Ed.2d 516, 523 (1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, we have noted that \u201ccomplaint\u201d \u201csimply is a general term intended to refer to a charge that will require the prisoner to go to trial.\u201d <em>Clipper, </em>295 Md. at 308, 455 A.2d at 976.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The term \u201ccomplaint\u201d is not found in the \u201cCriminal Causes\u201d section of the Maryland Rules. However our rules do contain the term \u201cCharging Document,\u201d which is defined as \u201ca written accusation alleging that a defendant has committed an offense.\u201d Md.Rule 4-102(a). There are four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>types of charging documents: citations, statements of charges, informations, and indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The arrest warrant here was predicated on a statement of charges, which is defined as a \u201ccharging document, other than a citation filed in the District Court by a peace officer or by a judicial officer.\u201d Md.Rule 4-102(i).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As is true of all charging documents, a statement of charges \u201cshall contain a concise and definite statement of the essential facts of the offense with which the defendant is charged____\u201d Md.Rule 4-202(a). And \u201c[a] statement of charges shall be signed by a peace officer or by a judicial officer.\u201d Md.Rule 4-202(b). Here, the application for the statement of charges required the complainant to swear to his account of the facts before a commissioner or judge. <em>See generally State v. Smith, </em>305 Md. 489, 505 A.2d 511 (1986) (discussing role of a commissioner in issuing a statement of charges), <em>cert. denied, </em>476 U.S. 1186, 106 S.Ct. 2925, 91 L.Ed.2d 552 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Under the federal system, a \u201ccomplaint is a written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. It shall be made upon oath before a magistrate.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 3; <em>see generally Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>258 (5th ed. 1979). Such a complaint may be used as a basis for the issuance of a warrant. Fed.R.Crim.P. 4. Moreover, a federal criminal complaint activates, upon request for disposition, the timing requirement of Article III of the IAD. 18 U.S.C.App. (1982) (adopting Interstate Agreement on Detainers). The apparent similarity between a federal criminal complaint and a statement of charges suggests that the two be treated in a parallel fashion under the <em>IAD\u2014i.e. </em>that they trigger the same time limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">In addition to this federal analogy, the policies behind the IAD support the notion that an arrest warrant based on a charging document be treated as a complaint under the IAD. As stated by the Supreme Court, \u201clegislative history ... emphasizes that a primary purpose of the Agreement is to protect prisoners against whom detainers are outstanding.\u201d <em>Cuyler, </em>449 U.S. at 448-49, 101 S.Ct. at 712, 66 L.Ed.2d at 654.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The agreement itself states that its goals are 1) \u201cto encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges\u201d and 2) \u201cto provide ... cooperative procedures\u201d among the party jurisdictions to facilitate such disposition. Md.Code Ann. (1947, 1984 Repl.Vol) Art. 27, \u00a7 616B (codifying Article I). Prompt disposition is needed for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">[A] prisoner who has had a detainer lodged against him is seriously disadvantaged by such action. He is in custody and therefore in no position to seek witnesses or to preserve Ms defense. He must often be kept in dose custody and is ineligible for desirable work assignments. What is more, when detainers are filed against a prisoner he sometimes loses interest in institutional opportunities because he must serve Ms sentence without knowing what additional sentences may lie before Mm, or when, if ever, he will be in a position to employ the education and skills he may be developing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-6\"><em>Cuyler, </em>449 U.S. at 449, 101 S.Ct. at 712, 66 L.Ed.2d at 654 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 1018, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1970); S.Rep. No. 1356, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1970) U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News 1970, p. 4864); <em>see also Smith v. Hooey, </em>393 U.S. 374, 379, 89 S.Ct. 575, 577-78, 21 L.Ed.2d 607, 612 (1969); <em>see generally Clipper, </em>295 Md. at 305, 455 A.2d at 974 (\u201cThe IAD was spawned by the extensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>criticism regarding the serious disadvantages the detainer system placed on prisoners.\u201d). These considerations are crucial in interpreting the IAD, given its mandate that it \u201cbe liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1984 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 616J (codifying Article IX).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The congressional concerns quoted above are present whether detainers are based on informations, indictments or felony arrest warrants predicated on statements of charges. The fact that, in the latter situation, the state\u2019s attorney must sometimes get a subsequent indictment before trial does not eliminate these concerns. Thus prompt disposal of a warrant and statement of charges within 180 days of a prisoner\u2019s request is an approach which advances the purpose of the agreement. If we were to reject such an approach, the state could issue detainers based on warrants and accompanying statements of charges without incurring any obligation under Article III of the IAD to promptly dispose of those charges upon prisoners\u2019 requests. <em>Cf United States v. Mauro, </em>436 U.S. 340, 98 S.Ct. 1834, 56 L.Ed.2d 329 (1978) (articulating similar points in finding that a writ of habeas corpus <em>ad prosequendum </em>is a \u201crequest\u201d under Article IV, which invokes that provision\u2019s time limitations).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The State contends that because it could not have prosecuted all of Smith\u2019s alleged offenses on the basis of the statement of charges, that statement, in conjunction with Smith\u2019s request for disposition, could not have activated his rights under Article III of the IAD.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The State refers to our recent determination that Sixth Amendment speedy trial rights do not commence until \u201ca defendant is subject to be tried on [the charging] document.\u201d <em>State v. Gee, </em>298 Md. 565, 574, 471 A.2d 712, 716 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1244, 104 S.Ct. 3519, 82 L.Ed.2d 827 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">We are unpersuaded by this argument. First, we note that <em>Gee </em>interpreted the term \u201caccused\u201d under the Sixth Amendment, rather than the meaning of \u201ccomplaint\u201d as it is used in the IAD. Gee is therefore not binding as precedent in this case. We note that once the Commissioner issued the statement of charges here, those charges could only be disposed of by trial or by action of the State\u2019s Attorney.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus the statement of charges here squarely placed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>prisoner on the path toward trial, although formal prosecution had not yet technically begun for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. <em>See </em>Gee, 298 Md. at 574, 471 A.2d at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Second, under the federal system, a defendant cannot be tried on a complaint alone; instead the prosecutor must obtain an indictment or information. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(a);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>see </em>1 C. Wright, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Criminal </em>\u00a7 121, at 338 (2d ed. 1982). Yet such a complaint would nevertheless activate the IAD upon request for disposition. The State\u2019s reasoning that the prisoner must be capable of being tried on the charging document in order to invoke the IAD is at odds with the way in which federal criminal complaints are handled.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The State also relies on <em>United States v. Bottoms, </em>755 F.2d 1349 (9th Cir.1985) which holds that a warrant does not activate disposition rights under the IAD. <em>See Blackey v. District Court, </em>755 P.2d 1380, 1384 (Mont.1988) (relying on <em>Bottoms </em>in holding that an arrest warrant based on an affidavit of probable cause was not a complaint under the IAD). <em>But see State v. Black, </em>594 S.W.2d 738, 740 (Tenn. Crim.App.1979) (\u201cGiving the act the liberal construction mandated by the Supreme Court, we hold that a \u2018state warrant\u2019 is a \u2018complaint\u2019 for purposes of the [IAD].\u201d). In <em>Bottoms, </em>the prisoner was being detained \u201cby virtue of [an] arrest warrant and the marshal\u2019s advice reciting the authority of that warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1350. According to the Ninth Circuit, such a device did not technically constitute a complaint under the IAD or \u201cas that word is defined in Fed.R. Crim.P. 3.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore the warrant and advice could not activate the IAD time limitations under Article III.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>Bottoms </em>is not directly on point with the instant case. Whereas Bottoms\u2019 warrant was based on the \u201cadvice of a marshal,\u201d Smith\u2019s warrant was issued based on a statement of charges roughly parallel to a federal criminal complaint. Moreover, as Judge Wilner in the court below pointed out, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion strictly construing the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d seems to ignore the IAD\u2019s admonition to give effect to the compact\u2019s purpose. <em>See </em>73 Md.App. at 382-85, 534 A.2d at 373-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In light of the underlying purpose of the IAD and the foregoing analogy to federal criminal complaints, we conclude that an arrest warrant based on a statement of charges constitutes a complaint sufficient to invoke the timing requirements of Article III of the IAD.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201c[I]n the event that an action on the ... complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided ..., the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the ... complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice....\u201d Md.Code Art. 27, \u00a7 616F(c). Here the prosecutor failed to bring the defendant to trial within the required period. The trial court therefore properly dismissed the indictment with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY, MARYLAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-6\">.

Because the detainer remains lodged against the prisoner until the underlying charges are finally resolved, the Agreement requires that the disposition be speedy and that it be obtained before the prisoner is returned to the sending State. The fact that the prisoner is brought before the District Court by means of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum in no way reduces the need for this prompt disposition of the charges underlying the detainer. In this situation it clearly would permit the United States to circumvent its obligations under the Agreement to hold that an ad prosequendum writ may not be considered a written request for temporary custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>Mauro, </em>436 U.S. at 362, 98 S.Ct. at 1848, 56 L.Ed.2d at 348.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">.
