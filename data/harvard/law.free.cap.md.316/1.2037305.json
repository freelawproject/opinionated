Due to our disposition of this case based on the erroneous invocation of the Fifth Amendment before the jury, we further find it unnecessary to discuss the merits of the remaining evidentiary questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">A jury in the Circuit Court for Washington County convicted Petitioner, David Cleveland Adkins (Adkins), of felony murder and robbery. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed Adkins\u2019 conviction for felony murder but vacated the robbery conviction, agreeing with petitioner that it merged with the murder conviction, <em>Adkins v. </em>State, 72 Md.App. 493, 531 A.2d 699 (1987). Pursuant to former Maryland Rule 828(g), (now 8-501(g)), the parties have submitted an Agreed Statement of Facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">According to this Statement, the victim, Joseph Michael Teal (Teal), was last seen alive in a Hagerstown tavern in the company of Adkins and Darryl Troxell (Troxell). Teal bought the rounds and the three men drank together for approximately two hours. Teal\u2019s body was found the next day floating face down in a creek outside of town. His wallet and watch were never recovered. The initial autopsy report listed the cause of death as coronary insufficiency. Dr. Kaufman testified as an expert witness in forensic pathology. Based on a hypothetical containing much of the evidence introduced at trial, Kaufman opined that Teal\u2019s death resulted from a heart attack caused by an attempted strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Lester Beach (Beach), a brother-in-law of Adkins and also related to Troxell, was in custody in Pennsylvania at the time of the ongoing investigation concerning Teal\u2019s death. Pennsylvania authorities agreed to drop pending charges against Beach in return for Beach\u2019s cooperation in the homicide investigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As part of the agreement, Beach visited Troxell in the Washington County Detention Center where Troxell was detained on other charges. Beach donned a body wire, allowing Corporal Mullendore to monitor and record the conversation. By the time of Adkins\u2019 trial, Troxell had been convicted and sentenced for the murder of Teal. Troxell was in the process of appealing his conviction to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">During the trial, an evidentiary hearing was held on Adkins\u2019 Motion in Limine to bar introduction of the recorded Beach-Troxell conversation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the hearing, held out of the jury\u2019s presence, Troxell invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination after conferring with his lawyer. The trial judge admonished Troxell stating \u201cthe Fifth Amendment is not available to you and I would instruct you to answer the questions.\u201d In finding Troxell to be a compellable witness despite his pending appeal, the court apparently relied on the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Ellison v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 321, 500 A.2d 650 (1985), which held \u201cthat the risk of incrimination terminates at the moment the sentence is pronounced and the judgment thereby becomes final.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 500 A.2d at 658. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>subsequently overruled this holding in <em>Ellison v. State, </em>310 Md. 244, 258-59, 528 A.2d 1271, 1278 (1987).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nonetheless, Troxell refused to respond to the prosecutor\u2019s interrogation. The court found Troxell in contempt and sentenced him to six months incarceration consecutive to his other sentences. Troxell indicated that he would also assert his privilege if recalled at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The following morning, the court ruled that portions of the recorded Beach-Troxell conversation were admissible as declarations against Troxell\u2019s penal interest. The parties debated whether Troxell\u2019s invocation of the Fifth Amendment out of the jury\u2019s presence was sufficient to establish his unavailability. The court then permitted the State to call Troxell in the presence of the jury over the objection of the defendant. Troxell asserted he was afraid anything he said might jeopardize his pending appeal. Still in the jury\u2019s presence, the trial judge instructed Troxell that he had no right to refuse to testify and pronounced Troxell in contempt of court for the second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed Adkins\u2019 conviction. Central to the intermediate appellate court\u2019s findings were: (1) the calling of Troxell in the jury\u2019s presence was not reversible error; and (2) Troxell\u2019s statements qualified as declarations against penal interest and their admission did not violate appellant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The Supreme Court has identified two principal theories in analyzing prejudicial error where it is known that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>witness will refuse to testify based on the privilege against self-incrimination. First, \u201cerror may be based upon a concept of prosecutorial misconduct, when the Government makes a conscious and flagrant attempt to build its case out of inferences arising from use of the testimonial privilege.\u201d <em>Namet v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 179, 186, 83 S.Ct. 1151, 1154-55,10 L.Ed.2d 278 (1963). Second, it may be appropriate to consider whether \u201cinferences from a witness\u2019 refusal to answer added critical weight to the prosecution\u2019s case____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, 83 S.Ct. at 1155. Under this theory the Supreme Court noted the danger of allowing the jury to consider inferences in a form not subject to cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Adkins maintains that his defense was prejudiced by the calling of Troxell in the presence of the jury when it was known that he would invoke the privilege against self-incrimination. The State contends that there was no actual prejudice to the defense as a result of the calling of Troxell, and that the procedure was based on a legitimate need to establish the unavailability requirement under the declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule. Based on the standards set forth in <em>Vandegrift v. State, </em>237 Md. 305, 206 A.2d 250 (1965), we agree with petitioner\u2019s position and shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The privilege against compelled self-incrimination is guaranteed under both the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Art. 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The Maryland Constitution provides \u201cthat no man ought to be compelled to give evidence against himself in a criminal case.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Md. Const., Decl. of Rts., Art. 22. Upon assertion of the privilege by a witness, the court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>determine whether there is a reasonable basis for the invocation of the privilege and whether the privilege is invoked in good faith. McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 514.1, at 605 (1987); <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 139, at 341 (E. Cleary 3d ed. 1984); <em>see also Richardson v. State, </em>285 Md. 261, 265, 401 A.2d 1021, 1024 (1979); <em>Hoffman v. United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 486-87, 71 S.Ct. 814, 818, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951); <em>United States v. Klauber, </em>611 F.2d 512, 514 (4th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 908, 100 S.Ct. 1835, 64 L.Ed.2d 261 (1980). \u201cOrdinarily, the court will make the necessary determination in open court <em>but outside the presence or hearing of the jury.\u201d </em>McClain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 514.1, at 606 (1987) (footnotes omitted and emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>In <em>Richardson v. State, supra, </em>we outlined the proper procedure to be followed in determining when a witness may refuse to testify on grounds that the evidence adduced may incriminate him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court noted the standard for a trial judge in assessing the privilege as set forth in <em>Hoffman v. United States, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">To sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result. The trial judge in appraising the claim \u2018must be governed as much by his personal perception of the peculiarities of the case as by the facts actually in evidence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 266-67, 401 A.2d at 1024; 341 U.S. 479, 486-87, 71 S.Ct. 814, 818, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951). The privilege must be accorded a liberal construction in favor of the right that it was intended to secure. <em>Id. </em>at 486, 71 S.Ct. at 818; <em>see also In re Maurice M., </em>314 Md. 391, 397, 550 A.2d 1135, 1138 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>(1988), <em>cert. granted in part, Baltimore City Dept. of Social Serv. v. Bouknight, </em>490 U.S.-, 109 S.Ct. 1636, 104 L.Ed.2d 152 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The availability of the privilege generally depends upon the status of the witness. In Maryland, we have recently firmly adopted the majority rule \u201cthat a witness who has been found guilty and sentenced on criminal charges is entitled to claim the privilege against self-incrimination with regard to matters underlying those charges while the time for appeal or sentence review is running, or while a direct appeal or sentence review is pending.\u201d <em>Ellison v. State, </em>310 Md. 244, 253-54, 528 A.2d 1271, 1275-76 (1987) (other citations omitted). <em>Ellison </em>held an accomplice who had previously been convicted may invoke the privilege as a witness at defendant\u2019s subsequent trial as long as the appeal period or sentence review period had not expired. <em>Id. </em>at 258-59, 528 A.2d at 1278; <em>see generally Smith v. State, </em>283 Md. 187, 388 A.2d 539 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1130, 99 S.Ct. 1050, 59 L.Ed.2d 92 (1979); <em>McClain v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 106, 268 A.2d 572 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>259 Md. 733 (1970). The possibility of incrimination relates to the verdict as well as the sentence imposed. In <em>Ellison, supra, </em>Judge Eldridge writing for the Court commented: \u201cWhile a majority of appeals by defendants in criminal cases may not result in reversals and further proceedings, a criminal defendant\u2019s chance of overturning a verdict or sentence on appeal certainly does not fall into the category of a mere remote possibility.\u201d 310 Md. at 257, 528 A.2d at 1277. There is sufficient possibility of a new trial as a result of a pending appeal. When an appeal or application for leave to appeal is filed, the right to claim the privilege continues during the pendency of the appellate process.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">In <em>Taylor v. Best, </em>746 F.2d 220, 222 (4th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 982, 106 S.Ct. 388, 88 L.Ed.2d 340 (1985), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recognized that \u201cit is possible that post-conviction incriminating evidence could be used against an inmate who had been convicted and sentenced but whose conviction was being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>appealed.\u201d Rather than determining the availability of the privilege on the type of proceeding involved, \u201cwe must base it on the nature of the statement or admission <em>and the exposure which it </em>invites,\u201d 746 F.2d at 223, quoting <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 9, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1434, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967) (emphasis in original). The Fourth Circuit has also applied this principle where the witness is an alleged accomplice of the defendant. In <em>Mills v. United States, </em>281 F.2d 736, 741 (4th Cir.1960), the court held that where a witness had pled guilty to robbery but had not yet been sentenced, nor had her appeal time run, the witness could not be compelled to testify against her accomplice. The court reasoned that statements made by the witness, if she were required to testify, could impact upon the disposition of her appeal or the fixing of sentence. <em>See also Ottomano v. United States, </em>468 F.2d 269 (1st Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1128, 93 S.Ct. 948, 35 L.Ed.2d 260 (1973). Consistent with our reasoning in <em>Ellison, supra, </em>and with the federal authorities cited above, Troxell had the right to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination as his appeal was pending before the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Troxell\u2019s intention to assert the privilege was originally manifested after a hearing was held on Adkins\u2019 Motion in Limine to bar the introduction of the recorded Beach-Troxell conversation. Troxell invoked the privilege at the evidentiary hearing and refused to testify concerning events related to his pending appeal. The court found him in contempt and sentenced him to six months\u2019 imprisonment, consecutive to his current sentence. Troxell expressly indicated that he would refuse to testify if subsequently called, notwithstanding the finding of contempt, and the possibility of an additional sentence being imposed upon a second contempt order. At the conclusion of the hearing, the prosecutor stated, \u201cI think still to satisfy the unavailability issue, I will have to call Mr. Troxell to the witness stand before the jury to get his refusal to testify.\u201d Defense counsel immediately objected to the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>The following morning, the trial judge allowed the State to recall Troxell in the presence of the jury, requiring the Fifth Amendment to be invoked on a question by question basis. Upon direct examination, he clearly revealed Ms intent to invoke the privilege and an unwillingness to testify.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Despite TroxelFs insistence on refusing to testify, the trial judge ordered Mm to answer the prosecutor\u2019s ojuestions before the jury. The following inquiry was conducted before the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">THE COURT: The Court has considered that at an evidentiary hearing, and I have reviewed the case of <em>Ellison v. State </em>[65 Md.App. 321, 500 A.2d 650] and am satisfied, under <em>Ellison v. State [Id.] </em>that the state of the law is that your case which is on appeal could not be jeopardized by your testifying in this trial, and I therefore would instruct you to answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">WITNESS [TROXELL]: I\u2019m sorry, your honor, I guess I will have to take a contempt of court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">THE COURT: Alright. You are in direct contempt of court by reason of refusing to answer the question that was put to you. What\u2019s your next question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">Q: [MR. NORMAN, STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Mr. Troxell, are you going to answer any further questions that I have about the activities of you and the defendant, David Adkins, on the nights of June 26th and June 27th, 1985? A: No, Sir, I will not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">THE COURT: Mr. Troxell, the Court will direct you, instruct you that under law you are required to answer these questions and that if you refuse [t\u00ae answer] these questions, you will be in contempt of court. Now I direct you to answer the question. What is your question, Mr. Norman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Q: Mr. Troxell, where were you on the nights of June 26th and June 27th, 1985, after 10 P.M.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">(No Response).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">MR. NORMAN: Your Honor, I request that the Court direct the witness to answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">THE COURT: Mr. Troxell, the Court does direct you to answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">(No Response).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">MR. NORMAN: Are you going to answer the question, Mr. Troxell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">A: No, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-11\">THE COURT: Alright, Mr. Troxell, are you going to refuse to answer any questions that are put to you about this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-12\">A: Yes, Sir, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-13\">THE COURT: The Court finds you in contempt of court and sentences you to six months in the Department of Correction, the sentence to be consecutive to any sentence that you are presently serving. You are excused from the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">Adkins\u2019 counsel immediately moved for a mistrial, objecting that the above colloquy should not have been conducted before the jury. Counsel additionally argued that revealing to the jury the fact of Troxell\u2019s conviction was prejudicial. That motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-15\">In <em>Vandegrift v. State, </em>237 Md. 305, 206 A.2d 250 (1965), we set forth five factors to be considered in determining whether the calling before the jury of a state\u2019s witness who invokes the privilege constitutes reversible error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-16\">1. That the witness appears to have been so closely implicated in the defendant\u2019s alleged criminal activities that the invocation by the witness of a claim of privilege when asked a relevant question tending to establish the offense charged will create an inference of the witness\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>complicity, which will, in turn, prejudice the defendant in the eyes of the jury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">2. That the prosecutor knew in advance or had reason to anticipate that the witness would claim his privilege, or had no reasonable basis for expecting him to waive it, and therefore, called him in bad faith and for an improper purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">8. That the witness had a right to invoke his privilege;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">4. That defense counsel made timely objection and took exception to the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">5. That the trial court refused or failed to cure the error by an appropriate instruction or admonition to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 309, 206 A.2d at 252. Although some commentators have articulated these standards in a different fashion, we continue to adhere to <em>Vandegrift See </em>Annotation, <em>Propriety and Prejudicial Effect of Prosecution's Calling as </em>Witness, <em>to Extract Claim of Self-Incrimination Privilege, One Involved in Offense Charged Against Accused, </em>19 A.L.R. 4th 868 (1988, 1988 Supp.). It is important to note that we do not require the satisfaction of all five factors in order to support a reversal of a defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>See Vandegrift, </em>237 Md. at 309, 206 A.2d at 253 (where the Court found four out of five factors to be sufficient to warrant a finding of reversible error). The <em>Vandegrift </em>factors serve as guidelines to assess the overall circumstances of the invocation of the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">In applying the <em>Vandegrift </em>test to the present case, it is evident that Troxell was \u201cclosely implicated in the defendant\u2019s alleged criminal activities\u201d such that the first factor is unquestionably satisfied. Troxell was earlier convicted of felony murder for his role in the Teal murder. Troxell\u2019s conviction, pending on appeal, arose out of the same facts and events underlying the charges against Adkins. As to the third factor, our prior discussion as to the availability of the privilege supports the conclusion that Troxell had a right to invoke the privilege. <em>See Ellison, supra, </em>310 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>at 258-59, 528 A.2d at 1277-78. Defense counsel made a timely objection to the questioning of the prosecutor and to the inquiry conducted by the trial judge, and sought a mistrial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With respect to the fifth factor, the court did not instruct or admonish the jury regarding the inferences to be drawn from Troxell\u2019s claim of privilege. Furthermore, the trial judge compounded the situation by holding Troxell in contempt of court in the presence of the jury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As to the second factor, although it was clear that the prosecutor knew Troxell would assert the privilege, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that there was no evidence of bad faith or misconduct on the part of the prosecutor. The question of recalling Troxell in the jury\u2019s presence arose simply because the prosecutor argued that he had to create a record as to whether the witness was unavailable for purposes of introducing hearsay testimony. The prosecutor sought an express finding of \u201cunavailability\u201d by the court before he would proceed. Nonetheless, four of the five <em>Vandegrift </em>factors are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In viewing all of the circumstances of the invocation of the privilege by Troxell, we hold that it was prejudicial error for the trial judge to conduct the second inquiry as to unavailability in the presence of the jury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here, both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>court and counsel were aware that the accomplice intended to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination as a result of the prior Motion in Limine testimony of Troxell. He clearly indicated that he would continue to refuse to testify if recalled before the jury, notwithstanding the earlier finding of contempt. Under these facts, the court should not have allowed the accomplice to be recalled before the jury for the purpose of direct examination. The trial judge should have ruled on Troxell\u2019s availability during the Motion in Limine procedure, making a factual finding on the record, out of the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Here, the prosecutor was allowed to pose leading questions prejudicial to the defendant after it was clear that Troxell would not answer. For example, the state\u2019s attorney asked, \u201cAre you going to answer any further questions that I have about the activities of you and the defendant, David Adkins, on the nights of June 26th and June 27th, 1985?\u201d After the jury was informed that the witness had a case pending on appeal, this questioning created an impermissible inference of Adkins\u2019 guilt from Troxell\u2019s refusal to testify.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It was not harmless error to order the inquiry process to continue in the jury\u2019s presence. <em>Cf. Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 356 A.2d 665, 678 (1976) (\u201c[Ujnless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u2018harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandated.\u201d); <em>Williams v. Zahradnick, </em>632 F.2d 353, 360 (4th Cir.1980) (\u201cAn error is harmless only when the court, after assessing \u2018the record as a whole ...\u2019 can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d). The accomplice\u2019s invocation of the Fifth Amendment before the jury resulted in circumstances such that \u201cinferences from a witness\u2019 refusal to answer added critical weight to the prosecution\u2019s case in a form not subject to cross-examination, and thus unfairly prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>Douglas v.

The procedure outlined above is a reasonable method of protecting a defendant\u2019s privilege against compelled self-incrimination and at the same time ensuring that the jury shall not be exposed to the trial judge\u2019s inquiry. We conclude <em>Richardson </em>does not apply when as here there is clear indication on the record that the witness will invoke the privilege against compelled self-incrimination.

In closing arguments, the prosecutor again referred to Troxell, mentioning the fact that Teal, Adkins and Troxell were seen together on the evening of June 26, 1985, the day before Teal was found dead. He stated that two bartenders \"were the last ones who saw Joe Teal alive; that is, of course, with the exception of Darryl Troxell and David Adkins.\u201d He further commented; \"Now, of course, with respect to Mr. Troxell, it\u2019s too bad that he would not oblige us all by repeating from the witness stand what he told Lester Beach on December 21, 1985, but nonetheless, you\u2019ve heard the tapes and you\u2019ve got copies of the transcripts.\u201d The prosecutor continually referred to the crimes as having been committed by both Troxell and Adkins.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
