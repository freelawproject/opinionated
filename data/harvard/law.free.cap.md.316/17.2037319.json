Mr. Gaver was severely injured, sustaining permanent injuries to his back, body and limbs. He can no longer work, and will continue to experience physical pain indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The accident occurred while Gaver was assisting his neighbor, Roman Harrant, in the construction of a post and beam trellis. Mr. and Mrs. Gaver, on behalf of themselves and their minor children, filed suit against Harrant in the Circuit Court for Frederick County. The complaint contained five counts, labeled negligence, strict liability, gross negligence, loss of consortium, and loss of society and affection\u2014minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Harrant moved to dismiss the minor children\u2019s claim on the ground that the cause of action was not recognized in Maryland. The court (Smith, J.) granted the motion, and the minor children appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We granted certiorari before consideration by the Court of Special Appeals in order to consider this important question.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">A cause of action allowing a minor child to recover for loss of a parent\u2019s society and affection was unknown at early common law. The doctrine of <em>pater familias </em>held that only the husband/father had legal capacity to sue for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>injuries to members of Ms family. Note, <em>The Child\u2019s Right to Sue for Loss of a Parent\u2019s Love, Care and Companionship Caused By Tortious Injury to the Parent, </em>56 B.U.L. Rev. 722, 742 (1976). The wife and children had no right to sue, apparently because they, as \u201cinferior parties\u201d in the relationship, had no rights to the services of the husband/father. Note, <em>Compensating the Child\u2019s Loss of Parental Love, Care, and Affection, </em>1988 Ill.L.Rev. 293, 294 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Over time, the husband\u2019s cause of action for a wife\u2019s services gradually broadened into an action for loss of \u201cconsortium,\u201d which included \u201clove, affection, protection, support, services, companionship, care, society, and ... sexual relations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295. The scope of consortium claims was broadened in <em>Hitaffer </em>v. <em>Argonne Co., </em>188 F.2d 811 (D.C.Cir.1950), <em>cert. denied, </em>846 U.S. 852, 71 S.Ct. 80, 95 L.Ed. 624 (1950), when the court held that the wife also had a loss of consortium claim when her husband was negligently injured. Since that time, most of our sister states have recognized a wife\u2019s loss of consortium claim. As to Maryland, <em>see Deems v. Western Maryland Ry., </em>247 Md. 95, 231 A.2d 514 (1967), discussed <em>infra. See also </em>Note, <em>supra, </em>1983 Ill.L.Rev. at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">A cause of action for a minor child\u2019s loss of parental society and affection due to negligent injury was first recognized in <em>Berger v. Weber, </em>82 Mich.App. 199, 267 N.W.2d 124 (1978), <em>aff'd, Berger v. Weber, </em>411 Mich. 1, 303 N.W.2d 424 (1981). Five other states have since adopted the cause of action at common law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Ferriter v. Daniel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>381 Mass. 507, 413 N.E.2d 690 (1980); <em>Ueland v.

Bradshaw, </em>108 Ariz. 582, 503 P.2d 803 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Courts rejecting the cause of action have generally followed one of three lines of reasoning. Some courts, on public policy grounds, have concluded that the legislature, and not the court, is the governmental body best suited to weigh the burdens of the proposed cause of action against the benefits. For example, in <em>Duhan v. Milanowski, </em>75 Misc.2d 1078, 348 N.Y.S.2d 696, 702 (1973), the court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201c[t]he principal objection of this court to the [cause of action], however, is the complete inadequacy of our judicial system to solve such a complex issue. Untested complaints and appeals are dull and clumsy tools to fashion a new legal form. Yet every facet of that form must ultimately be shaped by an Appellate Court decision. Decades can pass before the new principle of law is finally formed. The matter requires study in depth and resolution by a comprehensive statutory enactment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3\">\n<em>Accord, Zorzos, supra; Huter, supra; Steiner, supra.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Other courts have rejected the cause of action based on their own perception of the necessity of its adoption. For example, in <em>Satin v. Kloempken, </em>322 N.W.2d 736, 742 (Minn.1982), the court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akh\">\u201c... based on our own precedent and on considerations of public policy and the results that would obtain upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>recognition of this type of claim, such as the additional burden placed on society through increased insurance costs and the added expense of litigation and settlement, and in the interest of limiting the legal consequences of a wrong to a controllable degree, a new cause of action on behalf of a child for the loss of parental consortium should not be recognized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\n<em>Accord, Hoffman, supra; Russell, supra; Borer, supra.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Other courts rejecting the child\u2019s cause of action have declined to consider policy grounds, focusing instead upon strictly legal considerations. In <em>Norwest v. Presbyterian Intercommunity Hosp., </em>293 Or. 543, 652 P.2d 318 (1982), the court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">\u201cNo doubt there are genuine wrongs that courts are ill suited to set right, and others that do not merit the social costs of litigation. But if these costs are to be the reason for denying an otherwise meritorious cause of action, that is one judgment to be made by legislatures rather than by courts. Courts exist to serve whatever rights people have, ...; it is not for them to weigh or \u2018balance\u2019 their own institutional concerns against the merits of such a right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">\u201cWe therefore lay aside the pragmatic arguments adduced for and against a child\u2019s damage action for the disablement of a parent and turn to the question how plaintiff\u2019s claim relates to other comparable claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323-24 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">The court discussed analogous causes of action available under existing state law, and noted that the child\u2019s claim involved two characteristics which are somewhat disfavored in tort law: 1) \u201cthe injury to the plaintiff occurs as a consequence of injury to another person, and [2)] this consequential injury is to the plaintiff\u2019s psychic interests rather than to his physical person or tangible property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321. The court ultimately held that the main obstacle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>to adoption of the cause of action was that, under Oregon law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">\u201c... ordinarily negligence as a legal source of liability gives rise only to an obligation to compensate the person immediately injured, not anyone who predictably suffers loss in consequence of that injury, unless liability for that person\u2019s consequential loss has a legal source besides its foreseeability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Courts which have adopted the child\u2019s loss of parental society and affection cause of action have generally started from the premise that the child suffers a real and serious loss when a parent is injured. The Wisconsin Supreme Court, in <em>Theama, supra, </em>noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\"><em>\u201cA </em>child has an interest in the society and affection of his parent ... When the child is deprived of his parents\u2019 society, care, protection and affection he suffers a real injury ... [T]he child\u2019s loss ... deprives him of the essentials for a healthy development and thus results in a real injury to the child.\u201d 344 N.W.2d at 516.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Courts allowing the child\u2019s recovery have also responded to the several public policy concerns raised by adoption of the cause of action, offering solutions to these problems, or holding that the benefits to be gained by recognizing the cause of action outweigh the burdens. A problem commonly cited by courts rejecting the cause of action is the burden of multiple legal actions arising from a single tortious act. <em>See, e.g., Salin v. Kloempken, </em>322 N.W.2d 736, 739 (Minn. 1982). Some courts adopting the cause of action, however, have responded that compulsory joinder can easily solve this problem. <em>See, e.g., Hay, supra, </em>496 A.2d at 943. Others have indicated that the burden posed by multiple actions is outweighed by the benefit of compensation to the child. <em>See Ueland, supra, </em>691 P.2d at 193. (\u201c[t]he rights of a new class of tort plaintiffs should be forthrightly judged on their own merits, rather than engaging in gloomy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>speculation as to where it will all end.\u201d) (quoting <em>Berger v. Weber, </em>82 Mich.App. 199, 210, 267 N.W.2d 124, 129 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Courts which have rejected the cause of action also cite the danger of double recovery. In <em>Salin, supra, </em>the court noted that \u201cthere is actually a ... threat of double recovery by the child because juries may .... already indirectly factor in a child\u2019s emotional loss through an award to the parent.\u201d 322 N.W.2d at 740. On the other hand, courts adopting the cause of action hold that careful jury instructions can avoid this problem. <em>See Hay, supra, </em>496 A.2d at 944. They also note that if such compensation is valid, it is better to allow the claim to be separately evaluated by the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">\u201cRather than having juries make blind calculations of the child\u2019s loss in determining an award to the parent, a child\u2019s loss could be openly argued in court and the jury could be instructed to consider the child\u2019s loss separately. The award would accrue directly to the child rather than be lumped in with that of the parent who may or may not spend it for the child\u2019s benefit.\u201d <em>Berger v. Weber, supra, </em>303 N.W.2d at 427.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Another perceived drawback to the cause of action is the uncertainty and remoteness of damages. \u201cThe intangible nature of the child\u2019s loss makes it difficult to assess damages and provides a further reason against judicial recognition of the cause of action.\u201d <em>Salin, supra, </em>322 N.W.2d at 740. Courts adopting the cause of action generally meet this objection in one of two ways. First, they say that the damages in the child\u2019s action are no more remote or uncertain than in similar claims, such as that for spousal consortium. <em>See, Berger, supra, </em>303 N.W.2d at 427. Second, at least one court has held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL-\">\u201c[w]here the tort itself is of such a nature as to preclude the ascertainment of the amount of damages with certainty, it would be a perversion of fundamental principles of justice to deny all relief to the injured person, and thereby relieve the wrongdoer from making any amend for his acts.\u201d <em>Theama, supra, </em>344 N.W.2d at 519 (quoting C. McCormick, Law of Damages \u00a7 27, at 102 (1935)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Courts rejecting the cause of action have also asserted that money damages do not truly compensate the child\u2019s loss. The California Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">\u201cLoss of consortium is an intangible, nonpecuniary loss; monetary compensation will not enable plaintiffs to regain the companionship and guidance of a mother; it will simply establish a fund so that upon reaching adulthood, when plaintiffs will be less in need of maternal guidance, they will be unusually wealthy men and women. To say that plaintiffs have been \u2018compensated\u2019 for their loss is superficial; in reality they have suffered a loss for which they can never be compensated; they have obtained, instead, a future benefit essentially unrelated to that loss.\u201d <em>Borer, supra, </em>563 P.2d at 862.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">However, courts adopting the cause of action respond that this is a problem common to many tort actions. The Wisconsin Supreme Court was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">\u201c... unswayed by such an argument. Although a monetary award may be a poor substitute for the loss of a parent\u2019s society and companionship, it is the only workable way that our legal system has found to ease the injured party\u2019s tragic loss. We recognize this as a shortcoming of our society, yet we believe that allowing such an award is clearly preferable to completely denying recovery.\u201d <em>Theama, supra, </em>344 N.W.2d at 520.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5v\">Another concern is that the child\u2019s cause of action will lead to similar actions for siblings, grandparents, and parent-substitutes. Courts adopting the cause of action generally respond that the action can be limited by the courts. A similar concern is the cause of action\u2019s potential for greatly expanding the liability of the tortfeasor. The New Jersey Supreme Court noted that \u201c[i]f the claim were allowed there would be a substantial accretion of liability against the tortfeasor arising out of a single transaction.\u201d <em>Russell, supra, </em>295 A.2d at 864. A related concern, of course, is the imposition of the increased costs upon society:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEq\">\u201cRealistically, the burden of paying damage awards will be borne by the public generally in increased insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>premiums or, alternatively, in the enhanced danger that accrues from the greater number of people who may choose to go without insurance. Moreover, we must take into account the cost of administration of a system to determine and pay consortium awards. Since virtually every injury to a parent with minor children would be accompanied by a claim for loss of parental consortium, the expenses of settling or litigating these claims would be sizable.... The social cost resulting from the expenditure of valuable judicial resources in litigating these claims would be substantial.\u201d <em>Salin, supra, </em>322 N.W.2d at 741 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Courts adopting the cause of action have acknowledged the reality of these problems, but have held that \u201cit is the rights of the new class of plaintiffs, and the desire to see justice made available within our legal system, which are of paramount importance.\u201d <em>Hay, supra, </em>496 A.2d at 943. <em>See also, Ueland, supra, </em>691 P.2d at 193. These courts have also held that the burdens of increased costs to society are offset by the benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">\u201c[w]e believe that any burden to society is offset by the benefit to the child, who through compensation may be able to adjust to his or her loss with stability. Ultimately, society will benefit as well, since ideally the child will become a normal adult who is capable of functioning as such in his or her own social setting____ As one writer noted, \u2018The family relationship \u201cis the relationship on which all society must depend for endurance, permanence, and well-being.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Theama, supra, </em>344 N.W.2d at 521 (quoting Note, <em>supra, </em>56 B.U.L.Rev. at 741 (footnote omitted)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Courts allowing a minor child to recover for loss of parental society and affection due to negligent injury to the parent have also offered a number of affirmative reasons for their decisions. The analogy to a spousal consortium claim has been argued by all courts recognizing the cause of action. In <em>Ferriter v. Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>381 Mass. 507, 413 N.E.2d 690, 692 (1980), the court asserted \u201cthat a minor child has a strong interest in his parent\u2019s society, an interest closely analogous to that of the wife in [a spousal consortium claim] ... We are skeptical of any suggestion that the child's interest in this setting is less intense than the wife\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Another argument for adopting the cause of action is the analogy between the child\u2019s claim for loss of parental society and affection in a wrongful death action and a similar claim when the parent is injured. The Michigan Supreme Court, in <em>Berger, supra, </em>held that \u201cthe real anomaly is to allow a child\u2019s recovery for the loss of a parent\u2019s society and companionship when the loss attends the parent\u2019s death but to deny such recovery when the loss attends the parent\u2019s injury.\u201d 303 N.W.2d at 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Other reasons urged in support of the cause of action are the current invalidity of the doctrine of <em>pater familias, Ferriter, supra, </em>413 N.E.2d at 692-93, and a growing trend toward recognition of children\u2019s rights. <em>See Theama, supra, 3</em>44 N.W.2d at 517 (\"Society\u2019s increasing awareness of the child\u2019s humanity has prompted the extension of numerous legal rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Courts adopting the cause of action have also used a tort law line of reasoning. For example, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin reviewed state tort law, noting that it had first recognized a spousal consortium right in the wife, and then had allowed a parent to recover for loss of society and affection of a negligently injured minor child. <em>Theama, supra, </em>344 N.W.2d at 515. The court held that \"[i]t is only logical that the next step in this progression is to protect the child\u2019s interest in the parent-child relationship.\u201d Id. at 518. <em>See also Ueland, supra, </em>691 F.2d at 192 (state statute allows parent to recover for loss of consortium for injury to a minor child).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">HI.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The proposed cause of action has never been recognized at Maryland common law. However, as we have often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>noted, the common law of this State is \u201csubject to judicial modification in the light of modern circumstances or increased knowledge.\u201d <em>Ireland v. State, </em>310 Md. 328, 331, 529 A.2d 365 (1987). <em>See also, Kelley v. R.G. Industries, Inc., </em>304 Md. 124, 140, 497 A.2d 1143 (1985); <em>Jones v. State, </em>302 Md. 153, 161, 486 A.2d 184 (1985); <em>Boblitz v. Boblitz, </em>296 Md. 242, 462 A.2d 506 (1983); <em>Condore v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>289 Md. 516, 425 A.2d 1011 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Indeed, we have not hesitated to change the common law by adopting a new cause of action where such a course was compelled by changing circumstances. Even the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>does not prevent us from \u201cchanging or modifying a common law rule by judicial decision where we find, in light of changed conditions or increased knowledge, that the rule has become unsound in the circumstances of modern life, a vestige of the past, no longer suitable to our people.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Mont. Co. Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 442, 459, 456 A.2d 894 (1983). For example, in <em>Phipps v. General Motors Corp., </em>278 Md. 337, 363 A.2d 955 (1976), we adopted the theory of strict liability in tort as expressed in \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. In <em>Kelley v. R.G. Industries, Inc., supra, </em>we recognized a cause of action in strict liability against marketers and manufacturers for damages caused by \u201cSaturday Night Special\u201d handguns. <em>See also, Boblitz v. Boblitz, supra, </em>(authorizing negligence action by one spouse against the other); <em>Moxley v. Acker, </em>294 Md. 47, 447 A.2d 857 (1982) (changing common law to permit action of forcible detainer even if force not present); <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 432 A.2d 464 (1981) (recognizing tort of abusive or wrongful discharge); <em>Lusby v.

Jones, </em>281 Md. 560, 380 A.2d 611 (1977) (adopting tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Adoption of a new cause of action involves serious public policy concerns. Thus, \u201cin considering whether a long-established common law rule\u2014unchanged by the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>and thus reflective of this state\u2019s public policy\u2014is unsound in the circumstances of modern life, we have always recognized that declaration of the public policy of Maryland is normally the function of the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Harrison, supra, </em>295 Md. at 460, 456 A.2d 894. We have therefore been \"particularly reluctant to alter a common law rule in the face of indications that to do so would be contrary to the public policy of the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Harrison v. Mont. Co. Bd. of Educ., supra, </em>we were unable to say that modem circumstances compelled adoption of comparative negligence, and held that the decision involved \u201cfundamental and basic policy considerations more properly to be addressed by the legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 456 A.2d 894. In <em>Felder v. Butler, </em>292 Md. 174, 438 A.2d 494 (1981), we declined to alter the existing common law rule and hold liquor vendors liable for injuries negligently caused by an intoxicated patron to an innocent third party. <em>See also, Condore v. Prince George's Co., supra </em>(declining to create a cause of action against wife for payment of husband\u2019s necessaries); <em>Murphy v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec., </em>290 Md. 186, 428 A.2d 459 (1981) (refusing to change common law rules as to duty of care owed a trespasser by property owner); <em>Austin v. City of Baltimore, </em>286 Md. 51, 405 A.2d 255 (1979) (refusing to abrogate doctrine of governmental tort immunity); <em>Howard v. Bishop Byrne Home, </em>249 Md. 233, 238 A.2d 863 (1968) (declining to abrogate charitable immunity in tort actions); <em>White v. King, </em>244 Md. 348, 223 A.2d 763 (1966) (declining to change common law rule of <em>lex loci delicti </em>in tort actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\">Therefore, while we are empowered to adopt the proposed cause of action, we first consider whether the existing rule\u2014which does not allow a child\u2019s claim for damages for the loss of parental society and affection due to negligent injury\u2014is \u201cunsound in the circumstances of modem life, a vestige of the past, no longer suitable to our people.\u201d <em>Harrison, supra, </em>295 Md. at 459, 456 A.2d 894. In this regard, it is recognized that \u201cjudges are frequently called upon to discern the dictates of sound social policy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>human welfare based on nothing more than their own personal experience and intellectual capacity.\u201d <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. v. Wash. Nat'l Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 606, 386 A.2d 1216 (1978). In this endeavor, we consider the public policy concerns raised by the parties and by the other courts which have grappled with this issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">First, the alleged uncertainty a,nd remoteness of damages becomes a more important factor when those damages are to compensate a secondary tort victim (recovery for injury to someone other than the plaintiff) and are also intangible (not physical or property damage). In this regard, we note that courts are generally willing to tolerate substantial uncertainty in calculating damages to compensate the primary tort victim. The argument that money is a poor substitute and that the value of pain and anguish is difficult to determine is plainly inadequate to deny recovery to one who has been crippled or disfigured. When the plaintiff is not the primary victim, however, such objections become more significant. Therefore, considerations which would not deter a court from compensating a primary victim may support a refusal to further expand the scope of liability. <em>See Berger v. Weber, supra, </em>303 N.W.2d at 436 (Levin, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The claim that money cannot truly compensate for the child\u2019s loss also takes on greater significance in considering whether to adopt an entirely new cause of action. \u201c[I]n this context the inadequacy of monetary damages to make whole the loss suffered, considered in light of the social cost of paying such awards, constitutes a strong reason for refusing to recognize the asserted claim.\u201d <em>Borer v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>138 Cal.Rptr. 302, 563 P.2d 858, 862 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The likelihood of further expansion of consortium-type claims must also be taken into account. We created a joint husband-wife cause of action for loss of consortium in <em>Deems v. Western Maryland Ry., </em>247 Md. 95, 231 A.2d 514 (1967). There, the legal entity concept which we adopted caused many of the objections to a separate, new cause of action for the wife to \u201cdisappear or become less forceful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 231 A.2d 514. We said, in recognizing the joint right, that it did not involve the \u201cright of other members of the injured person\u2019s family to recover for intangible losses, with possible inordinate expansion of a defendant\u2019s liability for damage resulting from his negligence; the right is confined to injury to the joint relational interest of the spouses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Absent truly compelling circumstances, we are also concerned with the substantial expansion of tortfeasor liability and the accompanying societal costs that will be imposed by this new cause of action. As earlier observed, it contains elements which are generally not favored under tort law. There are few other instances where a secondary tort victim has been permitted to recover for a negligently inflicted injury to a relational interest unaccompanied by physical injury to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">We think the arguments advanced for the cause of action are unpersuasive in light of Maryland law. The analogy to spousal consortium claims has been criticized by other courts, generally based on the significant differences between the spousal relationship and the parent-child relationship. <em>See Salin v. Kloempken, supra </em>(sexual relations); <em>Borer v. American Airlines, Inc., supra </em>(same); <em>Steiner by Steiner v. Bell Telephone Co., supra </em>(a contractual relationship; spouses generally viewed as a united \u201cwhole\u201d). In Maryland, the distinction is even more significant since, in <em>Deems v. Western Maryland Ry., supra, </em>we did not create a new loss of consortium cause of action for the wife; instead, we created a joint husband-wife cause of action for loss of consortium. This, we said, is more than simply requiring joinder of claims, because the loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>consortium claim belongs to neither spouse alone, but to the \u201centity.\u201d \u201cThey are treated in legal contemplation as the partners they are in fact. The wife does not receive the separate right to sue, but she is accorded a new right to recover as part of the marital entity.\u201d 247 Md. at 108, 231 A.2d 514. We recognized in <em>Deems </em>that, \u201cthere is, in a continuing marital relationship, an inseparable mutuality of ties and obligations, of pleasures, affection and companionship which makes that relationship a factual entity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While we recognize the importance of the parent-child relationship, it does not constitute a legal and factual entity like that involved in <em>Deems.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Finally, appellants argue that because Maryland\u2019s Wrongful Death Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides that a minor child may collect damages for loss of parental society and companionship when a parent is killed, a similar action should be recognized when a parent is disabled. We think this analogy is unpersuasive. Courts which have rejected the loss of parental society and affection cause of action have noted that wrongful death actions were created by statute, and that the creation of this new cause of action should similarly be left to the legislature. <em>See, e.g., Zorzos v. Rosen By and Through Rosen, </em>467 So.2d 305 (Fla.1985). The analogy is also unpersuasive in light of the policy reasons underlying loss of society damages in wrongful death. Such damages have been allowed generally because the \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d rule, if strictly applied, could result in no recovery at all if the victim was an unproductive member of society, very old or young, or disabled. <em>See Borer v. American Airlines, Inc., supra, </em>563 P.2d at 865 (\u201cThe services of children, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>elderly parents, or non-working spouses often do not result in measurable net income to the family unit, yet unquestionably the death of such a person represents a substantial \u2018injury\u2019 to the family.\u201d); <em>Norwest v. Presbyterian Intercommunity Hosp., supra, </em>652 P.2d at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">We, of course, are not unmindful of the importance of the parent-child relationship, nor of the magnitude of loss suffered by a child when a parent is seriously injured. We conclude, however, that adoption of the proposed cause of action is not compelled by changing circumstances nor by a pressing societal need. The existing rule has not \u201cbecome unsound in the circumstances of modern life.\u201d <em>Harrison, supra, </em>295 Md. at 459, 456 A.2d 894. We therefore decline to adopt the cause of action at this time, and, \u201cin the present state of the law, we leave any change in the established doctrine to the Legislature.\u201d <em>White v. King, supra, </em>244 Md. at 355, 223 A.2d 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Dissenting opinion by ADKINS, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-10\">.

Industries, Inc., </em>304 Md. 124, 141, 497 A.2d 1143, 1151 (1985). I respectfully dissent because I believe that the legislature\u2019s policy towards children and the importance of the family in Maryland, both embodied in various statutes enacted by that body, indicate that adoption of a cause of action for a minor child\u2019s loss of parental society and companionship when the parent is injured by the tortious act of a third party is wholly consistent with the public policy of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>When this Court has refused to change or modify the common law, its decision has been based upon a clear indication from the legislature that to do so would be contrary to the public policy of this State. For example, in <em>Austin v. City of Baltimore, </em>286 Md. 51, 405 A.2d 255 (1979), we refused to judicially abrogate the doctrine of municipal immunity from tort liability. 286 Md. at 54, 405 A.2d at 257. Because the General Assembly had refused to abrogate the doctrine \u201cin the face of repeated reminders of its role in the matter in the opinions of this Court,\u201d we determined that the public policy of Maryland did not favor our taking action on the matter. <em>Id. </em>at 55-58, 405 A.2d at 257-259. In his concurring opinion, Judge Eldridge pointed out that the issue of State immunity had \u201cconsistently been a legislative matter in Maryland,\u201d and that the legislature, three years previously, had decided that the State\u2019s immunity should be abrogated solely in contract actions. <em>Id. </em>at 70, 405 A.2d at 265 (Eldridge, J., concurring). Thus, the public policy with regard to immunity in tort actions was particularly clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">In <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Bishop Byrne Home, </em>249 Md. 233, 238 A.2d 863 (1968), our decision not to abrogate the doctrine of charitable immunity from tort liability was based upon the fact that the \u201cGeneral Assembly [had] completely investigated the immunity question, and the present statutes are tangible evidence that the Legislature arrived at a solution which it deemed satisfactory.\u201d 249 Md. at 241-242, 238 A.2d at 868. Legislative policy was also clear in our decision not to create dram shop liability. <em>Felder v. Butler, </em>292 Md. 174, 438 A.2d 494 (1981). There, we determined that the failure of the legislature to create dram shop liability in the face both of our refusal to do so thirty years previously and of the growing number of states to create such an action since our decision indicated that the public policy of Maryland was against the trend. 292 Md. at 183-184, 438 A.2d at 499. Similarly, in <em>Harrison, supra, </em>we decided not to replace the contributory negligence doctrine with a comparative fault system because the position of the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>was clearly against the change. Between 1966 and 1982, the legislature had declined to enact twenty-one bills which would have done precisely what was asked of us in <em>Harrison, </em>295 Md. at 462, 456 A.2d at 904. This, we noted, was an indication of the legislature\u2019s intention to retain the contributory negligence doctrine. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">On the other hand, we have not hesitated to change the common law when \u201cit has become unsound in the circumstances of modem life.\u201d <em>Kline v. Ansell, </em>287 Md. 585, 590, 414 A.2d 929, 981 (1980). Often, that conclusion has emanated in whole or in part from legislative action setting public policy. We have, for example, determined that various common law doctrines were unsound in light of the legislature\u2019s passage and subsequent voter ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>See Boblitz v. Boblitz, </em>296 Md. 242, 462 A.2d 506 (1983) (interspousal immunity rule); <em>Condore v. Prince </em>George's <em>Co., </em>289 Md. 516, 425 A.2d 1011 (1981) (necessaries doctrine); <em>Kline, supra </em>(cause of action for criminal conversion).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In <em>Kelley, supra, </em>we imposed strict liability upon the manufacturers and marketers of \u201cSaturday Night Specials.\u201d We determined that the right to possess and carry certain handguns was sanctioned by the legislature. 804 Md. at 144, 497 A.2d at 1152-1158. But one class of handguns, the \u201cSaturday Night Special,\u201d was not protected under the statutory provisions covering other handguns. <em>Id. </em>at 144, 497 A.2d at 1158. Thus, public policy did not oppose, but, in fact, favored the imposition of strict liability for injuries caused by their use. <em>Id. </em>at 157, 497 A.2d at 1159.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These decisions make it clear that we will change or modify the common law when public policy calls for or is consistent with action. I believe action is called for in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>case; public policy clearly supports our adoption of a cause of action for a minor\u2019s loss of parental society and companionship resulting from the tortious act of a third party that causes injury to the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">At common law, a husband/father had a proprietary interest in the services of his wife and minor children. W. Prosser, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 124, at 916 (W. Keeton 5th ed. 1984); <em>see also </em>Note, <em>Child\u2019s Right to Sue for Negligent Disruption of Parental Consortium, </em>22 Washburn L.J. 78, 81-82 (1982) (\u201cA man\u2019s wife and children were perceived as chattel\u201d). When a wife or minor child was injured by the tort of a third party, the husband/father was entitled to recover from the tortfeasor for lost services; this action stemmed from the common law action a master had for the lost services of an injured servant. W. Prosser, \u00a7 125, at 931-935. Over the years, the nature of recovery for \u201closs of consortium\u201d changed from recovery limited to the loss of services to a broader remedy of damages for loss of society, affection, companionship, comfort, and in the case of injury to the wife, sexual relations. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 125, at 931; <em>see also </em>2 F. Harper, F. James &amp; O. Gray, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 8.8, at 536 (2d ed. 1986); Comment, <em>Who Should Recover for Loss of Consortium?, </em>35 Me.L.Rev. 295, 300 (1983). Thus, although the roots of a consortium claim lie \u201cin the father\u2019s [or husband\u2019s] proprietary right to the child\u2019s [or wife\u2019s] services, the origin of the action is of minimal significance today.\u201d Note, <em>The Child\u2019s Right to Sue for Loss of a Parent\u2019s Love, Care and Companionship Caused by Tortious Injury to the Parent, </em>56 B.U.L.Rev. 722, 731 (1976) [footnote omitted]. At common law, neither the wife nor children were entitled to pursue a similar cause of action, with respect to injury to the husband/father. W. Prosser, \u00a7 125, at 931, 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Passage of Married Womens\u2019 Acts in Maryland<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and other states around the close of the nineteenth century <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>gave women additional rights, including the right to sue for torts committed against them, engage in business, and contract, although these statutes were at first construed in a strained and grudging fashion. <em>See generally Boblitz, supra, </em>296 Md. at 244-251, 462 A.2d at 507-510; <em>Lusby v. Lusby, </em>283 Md. 334, 339-346, 390 A.2d 77, 79-83 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">In <em>Deems v. Western Maryland </em>Ry., 247 Md. 95, 231 A.2d 514 (1967), this Court noted that the \u201cmedieval concept\u201d of the common law regarding the inability of a woman to sue for loss of consortium was not totally \u201cin accord with modern legal thought.\u201d 247 Md. at 107, 231 A.2d at 521. In that case the Court recognized that it is the marital relationship or entity that is adversely affected when one of the spouses is physically injured by a third party\u2019s tortious act. <em>Id. </em>at 108, 231 A.2d at 522. <em>Deems </em>changed the common law to permit a joint action, in which both spouses can recover for the injury to the marital relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 115, 231 A.2d at 525. Almost a decade later, we noted it was \u201cclear that the underlying purpose and rationale of the joint action is to compensate the <em>individual </em>persons who form that relationship for the personal injury which <em>they both </em>sustain.\u201d <em>Phipps v. General Motors Corp., </em>278 Md. 337, 355, 363 A.2d 955, 965 (1976) [emphasis added]. Thus, injury to the marital entity results in a compensable injury to two people for which this Court has required that they bring a joint action.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">As In the case of women, recognition of rights of children has been slow in coming. This Court has long permitted a parent (a father only at early common law) to recover for loss of a minor child\u2019s services, society, etc. <em>See, e.g., Hudson v. Hudson, </em>226 Md. 521, 174 A.2d 889 (1961); <em>Seglinski v. Baltimore Copper Co., </em>149 Md. 541, 131 A. 774 (1926); <em>Hussey v. Ryan, </em>64 Md. 426, 2 A. 729 (1886); <em>County Commissioners v. Hamilton, </em>60 Md. 340 (1883); <em>see also </em>Family Law Art., \u00a7\u00a7 5-205, 5-206. Of course, no similar action presently exists for a minor child. <em>See </em>W. Prosser, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 125, at 935 (\u201cThe interest of the child in proper parental care and affection ... ran into a stone wall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>where the defendant was merely negligent in causing injury to the parent.\u201d); Pound, <em>Individual Interests in the Domestic Relations, </em>14 Mich.L.Rev. 177, 185 (1916) (there was no legal right at common law to protect a child\u2019s interest in the society and affection of a parent).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Nevertheless, in the second half of this century, courts have recognized that minor children are not mere chattels, but persons also entitled to many of the same constitutional protections and freedoms as adults. <em>See, e.g., Goss v.

Furthermore, the General Assembly of Maryland has increasingly recognized the social importance of the family, the need to protect this institution, and a particular need to protect children.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Section 4-401 of the Family Law Article establishes the General Assembly\u2019s policy with regard to families with children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">The General Assembly declares:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">(1) that it is the policy of this State to promote family stability, to preserve family unity, and to help families achieve and maintain self-reliance by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">(1) responding to financial and family crisis through direct provision of family counseling and supportiv\u00e9 services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">(ii) referral to appropriate community resources; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">(2) this State has the responsibility to provide services that prevent the kind of family dissolution and breakdown that requires protective services or out-of-home placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Also, in an attempt to preserve the family unit, the legislature has declared that the rights of natural parents may be terminated only upon a finding by a court that to do so is, by clear and convincing evidence, in the best interests of the child. Family Law Art., \u00a7 5-313(a) (1988 Cum.Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Numerous sections of the Family Law Article look to the protection of minor children. Parents are, by statute, made jointly and severally responsible for their child\u2019s \u201csupport, care, nurture, welfare, and education____\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5-208(b)(1); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 5--1002(b)(2) (providing children born out of wedlock with the same rights). Children are protected from child abuse and neglect. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5-701 <em>et seq. </em>(1988 Cum.Supp.). Penalties are provided for leaving young children unattended. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 5-801 (1988 Cum.Supp.). In the case of children placed in child or foster care, the General Assembly has voiced its special concern:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">(a) The General Assembly declares that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">(1) minor children are not capable of protecting themselves; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">(2) when a parent has relinquished the care of the parent\u2019s minor child to others, there is a possibility of certain risks to the child that require compensating measures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">(b) It is the policy of this State:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-11\">(1) to protect minor children whose care has been relinquished to others by the children\u2019s parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-12\">(2) to resolve doubts in favor of the child when there is a conflict between the interests of a minor child and the interests of an adult; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-13\">(3) to encourage the development of day care services for minor children in a safe, healthy, and homelike environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-14\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5-502.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-15\">The common law with regard to the manner in which custody of children is granted to parents upon their divorce has been changed. At common law, the father was entitled to custody of his minor children. <em>DeGrange v. Kline, </em>254 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Md. 240, 242, 254 A.2d 353, 354 (1969). The standard upon which custody of children is now granted to parents is what a court finds to be \u201cin the best interests of the particular child and most conducive to h:is welfare.\u201d <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 174, 372 A.2d 582, 585 (1977); <em>see also </em>Family Law Art. \u00a7 9-202(a) (Maryland Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act provides guidelines for resolving custody disputes, all geared toward the best interests of children); <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>306 Md. 290, 303, 508 A.2d 964, 970 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">This Court has recognized the importance of a stable family. In <em>Frye v. Frye, </em>305 Md. 542, 505 A.2d 826 (1986), we were asked to abrogate the parent-child immunity doctrine. We discussed the purpose of the doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201cThe doctrine is founded upon public policy, and is designed to preserve the peace and harmony of the home, under normal conditions, as well as to recognize the authority of the parent, under normal conditions, responsible for the maintenance of the home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">305 Md. at 550, 505 A.2d at 830 (quoting <em>Yost v. Yost, </em>172 Md. 128, 134, 190 A. 753, 756 (1937)). We declined to abrogate the doctrine and the important social policy embodied within it. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 505 A.2d at 839. The importance and worth of children were also evident in <em>Jones v. Malinowski, </em>299 Md. 257, 473 A.2d 429 (1984), a wrongful birth case, where we required that the parents\u2019 recovery be offset by the nonpecuniary benefits, such as society and companionship, muring to them because of the birth of the child. 299 Md. at 272-274, 473 A.2d at 436-437. Therefore, in Maryland today, the importance of family relationships and the benefits of a healthy and stable family atmosphere inuring to both parents and children are recognized and protected by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Thus, the development of the common law, the needs of contemporary society, and public policy as enunciated by the General Assembly, all favor the cause of action that the Gavers seek to establish. The public policy factor is made especially clear in \u00a7 3-904(d) of the Courts and Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Proceedings Article, which we shall visit shortly. Before doing that, however, it is useful to reflect on the fact that the harm done a minor child through loss of parental consortium is genuine and substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Although the extent of a child\u2019s injury may vary depending upon the physical injury incurred by a parent because of the tortious act of a third party, there can be no doubt that there is a real injury suffered by a child in those circumstances.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\"><em>\u201cA </em>child has an interest in the society and affection of his parent. Furthermore, the society, education, protection and love of a parent is necessary for the child\u2019s welfare and development. \u2018The child, for the full and harmonious development of his personality, needs love and understanding.\u2019 When the child is deprived of his parents\u2019 society, care, protection and affection he suffers a real injury____ Similarly, the child\u2019s loss of his parents\u2019 love, society and protection deprives him of the essentials for a healthy development and thus results in a real injury to the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">\u201cProtection of the child against this type of injury to the family relationship is equally important to the state. Since the character of the child has an impact on society \u2018it is of the highest importance to the child and society that its rights to receive the benefits derived from its mother [or father] be protected.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\"><em>Theama By Bichler v.

Md.Ann.Code (1984 Repl.Vol.), Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud.Proc. Art., \u00a7 3-904(d) [emphasis added].<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe state of the law in this area is anomalous in that a child may recover for loss of consortium if [a] parent dies as a result of another\u2019s negligence, but not if the severely injured parent remains alive but in a vegetative state.\u201d <em>Ueland, supra, </em>103 Wash.2d at 134, 691 P.2d at 192; <em>see also Hibpshman, supra, </em>734 P.2d at 994 n. 10 (\u201cwhen the parent is not so severely injured as to be in a vegetative state; the amount of loss of consortium damages will reflect the degree of the child\u2019s loss\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">An additional anomaly occurs in permitting a spouse (or spouses), and not a minor child, to recover for loss of consortium. A minor child, as noted by the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>of Iowa, is likely to incur a greater injury than a spouse when a parent is physically injured.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">\u201cSince the child in his formative years requires emotional nurture to develop properly, the loss of love, care and companionship is likely to have a more severe effect on him than on an adult; and society has a strong interest in seeing that the child\u2019s emotional development proceeds along healthy lines. Moreover, an adult is in a better position than a child to adjust to the loss of a family member\u2019s love, care and companionship through his own resources. He is capable of developing new relationships in the hope of replacing some of the emotional warmth of which he has been deprived. A child, however, is relatively powerless to initiate new relationships that might mitigate the effect of his deprivation. Legal redress may be the child\u2019s only means of mitigating the effect of his loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\"><em>Weitl, supra, </em>311 N.W.2d at 269 (quoting Note, <em>The Child's Right to Sue, </em>56 B.U.L.Rev. at 742).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Recognition of this cause of action for a minor child would also be consistent with this Court\u2019s view of the importance of a stable and harmonious family. <em>See Frye, supra. </em>Injury to a parent by the tortious act of a third party clearly is an interference with that stability and harmony. <em>See Leach, supra, </em>628 F.Supp. at 303 (\u201cdestruction of the family harmony and tranquility\u201d results from negligence of third party).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The majority opposes the recognition of this cause of action because of the inadequacy of money damages and the speculative nature of recovery. 316 Md. at 30, 557 A.2d at 217. It enlists the aid of the Supreme Court of California which has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">Loss of consortium is an intangible, nonpecuniary loss; monetary compensation will not enable plaintiffs to regain the companionship and guidance of a mother____ To say that plaintiffs have been \u2018compensated\u2019 for their loss is superficial____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>Borer v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>19 Cal.3d 441, 447, 563 P.2d 858, 862, 138 Cal.Rptr. 302, 306 (1977) (en banc). This, however, is an inevitable shortcoming of our tort system. Money damages are \u201cthe only workable way that our legal system has found to ease the injured party\u2019s tragic loss\u201d in this circumstance and in many other areas of tort law. <em>Theama, supra, </em>117 Wis.2d at 523, 344 N.W.2d at 520; <em>see also Hay, supra, </em>145 Vt. at 541, 496 A.2d at 944. The legislature in enacting \u00a7 8-904(d) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article has signified its approval of an award of monetary damages to recover for nonpecuniary losses. And although the nature of the recovery is speculative, it is no more speculative than the solatium recovery presently permitted in wrongful death, or in any award involving pain and suffering, personal injury, or emotional distress. <em>See, e.g., Hay, </em>145 Vt. at 541, 496 A.2d at 943-944; <em>see also </em>C. McCormick, <em>Handbook on the Law of Damages </em>\u00a7 27, at 102 (1985) (it is a perversion of justice to deny relief to an injured plaintiff solely because damages are speculative).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The majority also is concerned about the \u201cexpansion of consortium-type claims.... \u201d 316 Md. at 31, 557 A.2d at 217. It fears \u201cthe substantial expansion of tortfeasor liability and the accompanying societal costs, that will be imposed by this new cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But precisely the same apprehensions arise when a child seeks consortium damages for the wrongful death of a parent; they did not deter the legislature in the wrongful death context. And in any case, these concerns can be addressed. As to the \u201csocietal costs\u201d <em>(ie., </em>insurance costs) even if we speculate that premiums will increase solely because the new cause of action is recognized, that fact alone is not reason enough to deny recovery to a class of plaintiffs that deserves a remedy consistent with the public policy of this State. As the Supreme Court of Michigan has reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">Recognizing the child\u2019s cause of action may result in increased insurance costs, but compensating a child who has suffered emotional problems because of the depriva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>tion of a parent\u2019s love and affection may provide the child with the means of adjustment to the loss. The child receives the immediate benefit of the compensation, but society will also benefit if the child is able to function without emotional handicap. This may well offset any increase in insurance premiums.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><em>Berger, supra, </em>411 Mich. at 15, 303 N.W.2d at 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">As to the supposed problem of multiple litigation, I would hold that a child\u2019s loss of parental consortium must be joined with the injured parent\u2019s claim for damages (as in the case of loss of spousal consortium) whenever feasible. In order to bring a separate action, the child would have to show why joinder was not feasible. <em>See Weitl, </em>311 N.W.2d at 270; <em>Ueland, </em>103 Wash.2d at 140, 691 P.2d at 194. Moreover, I would limit the cause of action to loss of parental consortium by a minor child, thereby paralleling the statutory remedy in wrongful death cases. And I would limit the child\u2019s recovery to loss of society and companionship. This would preclude any double recovery for the parent\u2019s lost wages; the parent could recover for those as part of his or her claims against the tortfeasor, if appropriate. <em>See Hibpshman, </em>734 P.2d at 996; <em>Theama, </em>117 Wis.2d at 526, 344 N.W.2d at 551-552.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">In summary, I am convinced that public policy calls for establishment of a cause of action for a child\u2019s loss of parental consortium when the parent has been tortiously injured by a third party. I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-6\">.
