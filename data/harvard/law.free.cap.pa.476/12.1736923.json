This is a direct appeal from the murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Although two issues are raised, only one has been properly preserved for our review. The appellant\u2019s contention that a portion of his suppressed statement was improperly used for impeachment was not raised at trial or in post-verdict motions, and has been waived. <em>Commonwealth v. Clair, </em>458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">The only issue properly preserved is that the evidence was insufficient to prove malice beyond a reasonable doubt. We have examined this issue and found it to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">Judgment of sentence affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
