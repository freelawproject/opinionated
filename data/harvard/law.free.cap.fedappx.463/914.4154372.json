Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Alice B. Wise\u2019s appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 judgment in <em>Wise v. Shinseki, </em>09-1786, for lack of jurisdiction. Wise opposes. The Secretary replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-22\">In 1975, Mrs. Wise sought dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) benefits following her husband\u2019s death in a motorcycle accident during his military service in Japan. In April 1976, the Department of Veterans Affairs denied Mrs. Wise\u2019s claim, concluding that the veteran\u2019s death was a result of his willful misconduct and was not incurred in the line of duty. Specifically, Veterans Affairs found that the veteran was driving under the influence of alcohol and at an unsafe speed and that this was \u201cdeliberate wrong-doing with wanton and reckless disregard of its probable consequences.\u201d Mrs. Wise did not appeal the decision thereby rendering it final.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>In 2001, Mrs. Wise attempted to reopen her claim, asserting that she had new and material evidence, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108. Mrs. Wise submitted a letter from the veteran\u2019s commanding officer, stating that the veteran \u201capparently skidded upon wet pavement and lost control of his bike that morning.\u201d Mrs. Wise also testified that she did not believe her husband was intoxicated at the time of the accident. She further testified that her husband would not have been drinking heavily because they recently had their first child, and also that he was a careful driver and only a social drinker.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In April 2009, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals found that Wise had not provided new and material evidence to reopen her claim. In its decision, the Board noted that the Department\u2019s regulation defining what constitutes new and material evidence had been amended during the pendency of her appeal. Nevertheless, the Board explained that it would apply the former and more favorable version of the regulation, which stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5i\">\u2018New and material\u2019 evidence means evidence not previously submitted to agency decision makers which bears directly and substantially upon the specific matter under consideration, which is neither cumulative nor redundant and which, by itself or in connection with the evidence previously assembled, is so significant that it must be considered in order to fairly decide the merits of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.156 (2001)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The Board determined that the letter from her husband\u2019s commanding officer was previously considered by the Department and was, therefore, not new evidence. The Board also determined that Mrs. Wise was not competent to testify about what occurred during the accident because she had no personal knowledge of how much alcohol her husband consumed, his state of mind, the weather conditions, or the speed he was driving on the night of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">Mrs. Wise appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, asserting, inter alia, that the Board failed to provide adequate reasons in determining that her testimony was not competent. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. In rejecting Mrs. Wise\u2019s contentions that her testimony regarding her husband\u2019s customary practice of not drinking and driving does constitute \u201cmaterial\u201d evidence, the Court stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-W\">However, as the Secretary notes, the appellant\u2019s argument is misplaced. In order to reopen a claim, the evidence must bear directly and substantially upon the \u2018specific matter\u2019 under consideration and must be \u2018so significant it must be considered in order to fairly decide the merits of the claim.\u2019 See 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.156 (2001). In the April 1976 decision, the RO denied the claim based on a finding that the veteran had been drinking and driving too fast and thus his death was \u2018deliberate wrongdoing with wanton and reckless disregard of its probable consequences.\u2019 R. at 789. The evidence necessary for reopening must therefore relate to the veteran\u2019s mental state and driving manner at the time of the accident, not his normal practice. There is no evidence and the appellant does not contend that she was present at the time of the accident. Thus, the Board properly determined that her statements were not material. The Board also provided adequate reasons or bases for its decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">Our review of Veterans Court decisions is limited by statute. <em>See Yates v. West, </em>213 F.3d 1372,1373-74 (Fed.Cir.2000). By statute, our jurisdiction over appeals from the Veterans Court is limited to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>appeals that challenge the validity of a decision of the Veterans Court with respect to a rule of law or the validity of any statute or regulation, any interpretation thereof, or that raise any constitutional controversies. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. We do not have jurisdiction to hear appeals challenging determinations or the application of law to the facts of a particular case, unless there is a constitutional issue present. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">The parties dispute whether the Veterans Court adopted a legal rule that would give this court jurisdiction over this appeal. Mrs. Wise contends in her brief and her opposition that the Veterans Court adopted an interpretation of \u00a7 3.156 that would categorically exclude evidence of customary practice from being \u201cmaterial\u201d evidence. The Secretary responds that the Veterans Court did not adopt a categorical rule. Rather, the Secretary contends the Veterans Court merely addressed the challenge to the Board\u2019s statement of reasons or bases of its factual findings, including whether Mrs. Wise\u2019s testimony was not competent to the specific issue before the Board, i.e., whether the veteran was under the influence of alcohol and was driving at an excessive speed at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">We agree with the Secretary that the Veterans Court in this case did not adopt a categorical rule that evidence of customary practices could never constitute \u201cmaterial\u201d evidence. As the Secretary points out, the 1976 RO decision made specific findings that the cause of death was due to Mr. Wise being under the influence of alcohol and drove his motorcycle at an excessive speed coming to and through a 30-40 degree curve when he lost control of the motorcycle. Because that was the evidence of record, the Court explained that in this case any \u201cnew and material\u201d evidence \u201cmust therefore relate to the veteran\u2019s mental state and driving manner at the time of the accident, not his normal practice.\u201d The Veterans Court further explained that \u201c[tjhere is no evidence and the appellant does not contend that she was present at the time of the accident. Thus, the Board properly determined that her statements were not material.\u201d In doing so, the court was merely stating the customary evidence presented here could not constitute material evidence because of the specifics of the Board\u2019s prior findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Here, as in <em>Spencer v. Brown, </em>17 F.3d 368, 374 (Fed.Cir.1994), \u201cwe cannot disturb the [Veterans Court\u2019s] holding that there was new and material evidence presented after the Board\u2019s 1987 decision ... as that would require us to review the application of law to the facts of this case, concerning which we have no jurisdiction.\u201d We therefore cannot reverse the Veterans Court\u2019s conclusion in this case that the Board was correct in not reconsidering the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Nor does this court have jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s conclusion that Mrs. Wise was not competent to testify about whether her husband was in fact under the influence of alcohol while driving on the night of his death because she was not there. This court has held in analogous cases that \u201cwhether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a fact issue[.]\u201d <em>Jandreau v. Nicholson, </em>492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motions are granted. The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
