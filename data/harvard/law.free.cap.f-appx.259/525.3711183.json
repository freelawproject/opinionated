Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On appeal, Fields has filed a brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that his sentence of fifty-one months was unreasonable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. First, after making appropriate findings of fact, the court must correctly determine the applicable advisory guidelines range and consult the range in imposing sentence. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). The court is then required to consider \u201cother relevant factors set forth in the guidelines and those factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) before imposing sentence.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. A sentence within a properly calculated advisory guideline range is presumed reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">On appeal, this court will affirm a sentence as long as it is within the prescribed statutory range and is reasonable. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547. Reasonableness review involves procedural and substantive components. <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 434. \u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable, for example, if the district court provides an inadequate statement of reasons ... A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if the court relies on an improper factor or rejects policies articulated by Congress or the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Fields\u2019 sentence was procedurally reasonable. In conformity with this court\u2019s opinion and the presentence report, the district court determined that Fields had a base offense level of twenty and a criminal history category of III. The district court\u2019s calculation resulted in an advisory guidelines range of forty-one to fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. The Government argued that a two level enhancement for obstruction of justice should be applied based on the fact that Fields committed perjury and suborned perjury during his trial. A two level enhancement would have resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 51 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment. Although the district court concluded that Fields committed perjury and suborned perjury, the district court declined to enhance Fields\u2019 sentence, finding that a sentence of fifty-one months was appropriate. Prior to imposing that sentence, the district court considered defense counsel\u2019s arguments for a sentence of forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (2006). The district court rejected counsel\u2019s arguments and determined that the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the need for deterrence, the seriousness of Fields\u2019 offense, and the need to promote respect for the law, were served by a sentence of fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">Fields\u2019 sentence was also substantively reasonable. Fields argues that he should have received a sentence of forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment because his criminal history overrepresented the seriousness of his past conduct and because of physical and mental disabilities he suffered during his teenage years. The district court considered and rejected these arguments at sentencing. Rather, the district court was particularly concerned that Fields\u2019 case involved an <em>AK-4H </em>rifle and determined that a sentence of fifty-one months was appropriate. Fields\u2019 sentence, within his advisory guidelines, is presumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>reasonable, and he has failed to rebut that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Fields, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Fields requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b552-9\"> Fields was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief. He has elected not to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
