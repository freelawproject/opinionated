Roberts, <em>pro se, </em>appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 civil rights action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(B)(2)(ii). Roberts argues that the district court erroneously concluded that <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997) rendered his action incognizable under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">We review \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) dismissals for failure to state a claim <em>de novo, </em>using the same standards that govern Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) dismissals and viewing the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). The district court may dismiss an action if the complaint fails to state a claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). A complaint fails to state a claim if it does not appear plausible that the plaintiff can prove a set of facts which would entitle him to relief. <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965-66, 1968, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-16\">[T]o recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. A claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has not been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-17\"><em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372 (involving \u00a7 1983 complaint alleging that defendants, acting under color of state law, engaged in unlawful acts during the criminal investigation that led to his arrest and conviction). This means that a plaintiff may not obtain damages under \u00a7 1983 if a judgment in his favor \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-18\">The <em>Heck </em>principle has its origins in <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973), which held that the sole remedy in federal court for a prisoner seeking restoration of good-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>time credits is a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See id. </em>at 500, 93 S.Ct. at 1841. The Court reasoned that such an action constitutes an attack on \u201cthe very duration of ... physical confinement,\u201d and thus it lies at \u201cthe core of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487-88, 93 S.Ct. at 1835. Later, in <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), the Supreme Court' reiterated that state prisoners must use petitions for writs of habeas corpus in seeking restoration of good-time credits, but held that actions challenging the validity of the procedures for revoking good-time credits, seeking damages and prospective relief, are properly brought under \u00a7 1983. <em>See id. </em>at 554-55, 94 S.Ct. at 2973-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">However, <em>Balisok </em>limited the <em>Wolff\u2019s </em>holding by relying on <em>Heck. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. at 644-46, 117 S.Ct. at 1587-88 (involving prisoner, who was found guilty of four prison conduct infractions, sentenced to 10 day isolation and 20 days segregation, and deprived 30 days\u2019 good-time credit, seeking monetary damages for use of wrongful procedures and injunctive relief). The <em>Balisok </em>case involved a state prisoner\u2019s claim was limited to the procedures of his disciplinary hearing through which his good-time credits were revoked; it did not directly attack the revocation itself. Nonetheless, the Court held that the claim necessarily implied the invalidity of the punishment imposed and therefore could not be pursued unless the prisoner had succeeded in having the revocation penalty invalidated. <em>Id. </em>at 646-48, 117 S.Ct. at 1588-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Still, the Supreme Court has made clear that <em>Heck </em>is not categorically applicable to all lawsuits challenging prison disciplinary actions. <em>See Muhammad v. Close, </em>540 U.S. 749, 754, 124 S.Ct. 1303, 1306, 158 L.Ed.2d 32 (2004). In <em>Muhammad </em>a prisoner filed a \u00a7 1983 action against a prison official, alleging that the official had charged him and subjected him to prehearing lockup in retaliation for earlier lawsuits and grievance proceedings the prisoner had filed. <em>Id. </em>at 753-54, 124 S.Ct. at 1305. The Court held that, because the suit did not necessarily affect the computation of \u201cgood time\u201d credits, it \u201ccould not therefore be construed as seeking a judgment at odds with his conviction or with the State\u2019s calculation of time to be served in accordance with the underlying sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754-55, 124 S.Ct. at 1306. Because the lawsuit did not implicate a claim that was cognizable in a habeas proceeding <em>\u201cHeck\u2019s </em>favorable termination requirement was inapplicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755, 124 S.Ct. at 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">More recently, in <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 76, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 1244-45, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005), the Court held that the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief by two state prisoners challenging the validity of the procedures for determining parole eligibility that had been used to deny them parole were properly brought in a \u00a7 1983 proceeding. The reasoning was that, because a favorable judgment would not necessarily imply the invalidity of their convictions or sentences, and would not \u201cnecessarily spell speedier release, neither lies at \u2018the core of habeas corpus.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82, 125 S.Ct. at 1248. For that reason, the claims in <em>Wilkinson </em>were held not to fall within \u201cthe implicit habeas exception.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The Florida disciplinary proceeding regulations involved in this case provide that a correctional employee should prepare a formal disciplinary report, if a disciplinary matter cannot be resolved through verbal reprimand or corrective consultation and a supervisor approves the report preparation. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 33-601.303. The regulations prohibit a person from serving on a disciplinary hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>team, if he wrote the charge, witnessed the violation, investigated the violation, or reviews the hearing\u2019s results. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 33-601.306. If found guilty of the charge, the inmate may be placed in disciplinary confinement and lose gain time and visitation privileges. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 33-601.308, 33-601.314, 33-601.731. At the institutional level, the warden is the final reviewing authority for all disciplinary reports where the loss of gain time does not exceed 365 days. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 33-601.308. Florida precedent requires only some evidence supporting a disciplinary adjudication to appear in the record for a judicial affirmance to be in order. <em>Smiley v. State, </em>948 So.2d 964, 965 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In this case, Roberts\u2019s complaint alleges that he was deprived of due process and it seeks damages for the punishment that was imposed on him in the disciplinary proceeding. Roberts has never had the disciplinary adjudication invalidated. Therefore, his \u00a7 1983 action is not cognizable in light of <em>Heck </em>and <em>Balisok. </em>Unlike the claim in <em>Muhammad, </em>Roberts\u2019s claim necessarily would be at odds with the revocation of his good time credits and with the State\u2019s calculation of the time he has left to serve on his sentence. Unlike the claim in <em>Wilkinson, </em>Roberts\u2019s claim necessarily would imply the invalidity of the penalty imposed on him. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Roberts\u2019s action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-11\">. Roberts also argues that he was entitled to pursue and recover based on inhumane conditions of confinement and punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, deprivation of privacy in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and unspecified violations of the Sixth Amendment. However, Roberts did not plead these causes of action or grounds for recovery below. Therefore, they are not considered on appeal. <em>See Continental Technical Services, Inc. v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>927 F.2d 1198, 1199 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
