Because testimony at sentencing supports a determination that Hernandez asserted control or influence over at least one other participant in the crime, the district court did not clearly err in applying the \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) adjustment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.2); <em>United States v. Rose, </em>449 F.3d 627, 633 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-26\">Hernandez also argues on appeal that the district court clearly erred in increasing his offense level by two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice. However, the district court did not clearly err in applying the \u00a7 3C1.1 adjustment because its determination that Hernandez\u2019s statements to his co-defendants constituted threats against speaking with authorities was plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Mann, </em>493 F.3d 484, 498 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Rose, </em>449 F.3d at 633; <em>United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 242 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-27\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b681-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
