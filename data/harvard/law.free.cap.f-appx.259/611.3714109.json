As a condition of his supervised release, the court ordered Johnson to serve twenty-four months in community confinement. Johnson appeals, arguing that the twenty-four month term of community confinement is unreasonable, and that the supervised release term is contrary to the statutory requirement that supervised release terms be concurrent. The Government asserts that Johnson\u2019s challenge to the community confinement condition of supervised release falls within his valid appeal waiver, but concedes that the consecutive supervised release terms result in an illegal sentence and are not barred by Johnson\u2019s appeal waiver. For the reasons that follow, we vacate Johnson\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">A term of supervised release \u201cruns concurrently with any [other] term ... [of] supervised release or parole for another offense to which the person is subject or becomes subject during the term of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(e) (2000); <em>see United States v. Ziskind, </em>471 F.3d 266, 272 (1st Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1902, 167 L.Ed.2d 384 (2007); <em>United States v. Hernandez-Guevara, </em>162 F.3d 863, 877 (5th Cir.1998) (providing that supervised release terms are concurrent, even if imprisonment terms are consecutive).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Here, the district court ran Johnson\u2019s three three-year terms of supervised release consecutively, contrary to the mandate of the statute. This challenge to the legality of the sentence is an exception to Johnson\u2019s appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992) (allowing review despite waiver for claim that sentence exceeded statutory maximum or was based on constitutionally impermissible factor). The Government concedes that the consecutive terms resulted in an illegal sentence, and we agree. It is therefore necessary to vacate Johnson\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">It appears from the record that the district court began its determination of an appropriate sentence by considering the length of supervision. Only after stating that it was necessary to impose a long term of supervision did the court address the imprisonment term and the conditions of supervision. Because we cannot say that the district court would limit the imprisonment term to time served without the lengthy term of supervision it imposed, we do not limit our remand to merely directing that the terms of supervised release be concurrent. Rather, on remand, the district court is free to revisit these issues in light of the fact that Johnson\u2019s terms of supervised release must run concurrently, rather than consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">In conclusion, although we affirm Johnson\u2019s convictions, we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b638-8\"> In light of this disposition, we express no opinion as to the reasonableness of the supervised release condition that Johnson serve twenty-four months in community confinement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
