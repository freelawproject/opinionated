We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue only: \u201cWhether the district court erred in denying appellant\u2019s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal after appellant allegedly requested counsel to do so?\u201d We agree that the district court clearly erred in denying McElroy\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on the grounds that McElroy failed to identify arguably meritorious grounds which he could have pursued on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">It is well-settled case law that \u201ca lawyer who disregards specific instructions from the defendant to file a notice of appeal acts in a manner that is professionally unreasonable.\u201d <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 477, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000) (applying the \u201creasonably effective\u201d legal assistance test from <em>Strickland, v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), to a claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal). There is a presumption of prejudice \u201cwith no further showing from the defendant of the merits of his underlying claims when the violation of the right to counsel rendered the proceeding presumptively unreliable or entirely nonexistent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1029. A defendant need not establish that his direct appeal would have been arguably meritorious; he need only show that his counsel\u2019s constitutionally deficient performance deprived him of an appeal he would have otherwise taken\u2014i.e., the defendant expressed to his attorney a desire to appeal. <em>Id.; see also Gomez-Diaz v. United States, </em>433 F.3d 788, 792 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">Moreover, even when a defendant has not specifically instructed his counsel to file an appeal, his counsel may still have performed deficiently. In such circumstances, a court must inquire \u201cwhether counsel in fact consulted with the defendant about an appeal\u201d\u2014that is, whether he advised the defendant about the advantages and disadvantages of taking an appeal while also making a reasonable effort to discover the defendant\u2019s wishes. <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 478, 120 S.Ct. 1029. If the attorney has consulted with the defendant, \u201cthe attorney has only acted unreasonably if he has ignored the client\u2019s wishes to appeal the case. If not, the court must further inquire whether the attorney had the affirmative duty to consult.\u201d <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em>433 F.3d at 792 (citing <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 478, 120 S.Ct. 1029). This duty to consult arises when either \u201c(1) any rational defendant would want to appeal, or (2) his particular client reasonably demonstrated an interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>in appealing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 480, 120 S.Ct. 1029).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">In the present case, the district court erroneously concluded that to satisfy the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, McElroy was required to establish that he would have had an arguably meritorious claim on direct appeal. Consequently, the district court never determined whether McElroy specifically requested that his counsel file a notice of appeal or whether he had a duty to consult or actually consulted with McElroy about filing an appeal. Furthermore, the record below is insufficient to resolve the factual questions because the record contains both a sworn affidavit from McElroy supporting his version of events and a sworn affidavit from his trial counsel refuting McElroy\u2019s claim that he directed his counsel to file a notice of appeal. Thus, the district erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing to establish the content\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of communications between McElroy and his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Accordingly, in light of <em>Strtckland, Flores-Ortega, </em>and <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em>we vacate and remand to the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine (1) whether McElroy, in fact, requested counsel to file a direct appeal sufficient to trigger the <em>per se </em>duty to appeal; and (2) if not, whether counsel fulfilled his constitutional duty to consult with McElroy by advising him of the advantages and disadvantages of filing an appeal and making a reasonable effort to comply with McElroy\u2019s wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
