Citing former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432, Brown argues that he is a United States citizen based on his mother\u2019s naturalization in 1984, when Brown was age seventeen. Brown argues that the BIA erred in determining that he did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 1432 because his parents were not legally separated at the time of his mother\u2019s naturalization. Brown has shown no error in connection with the BIA\u2019s order. <em>Nehme v. INS, </em>252 F.3d 415, 425-27 (5th Cir. 2001). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b654-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
