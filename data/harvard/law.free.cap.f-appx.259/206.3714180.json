Casper Adamson, a Florida prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against the Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections (the \u201cSecretary\u201d), grievance officers with the Florida Department of Corrections, and prison officials (collectively the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u201cDefendants\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reversible error has been shown; we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In his complaint, Adamson\u2014who asserted that he is \u201ca converted Southern Baptist\u201d\u2014alleged that prison officials refused to mail thirteen letters that he attempted to send to Baptist churches and ministers to request \u201cprayer partners and religious pen pals.\u201d He contended that Defendants violated his First Amendment right to freedom of religion and freedom of speech by enforcing a provision of the Florida Administrative Code\u2014which prohibits the use of \u201ccorrespondence privileges to solicit or otherwise commercially advertise for money, goods or services\u201d and \u201cincludes advertising for pen pals,\u201d see Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 33-210.101(9) (the \u201cRule\u201d)\u2014 in refusing to mail his letters requesting prayer partners.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, Adamson alleged that the Rule was enacted without statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">On appeal, Adamson challenges the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss his complaint after concluding that the interception of Adamson\u2019s outgoing mail pursuant to the Rule was constitutional. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Procunier v. Martinez, </em>416 U.S. 396, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 1811, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974), the district court first considered whether the Rule furthered an \u201can important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression.\u201d After identifying the underlying governmental interest as \u201csecurity and the prevention of inmate fraud and harassment of the unwitting public that has resulted in money order scams and other criminal activities,\u201d the district court explained that the Rule did not restrict Adamson\u2019s First Amendment freedoms more than necessary to protect the governmental interest. The district court therefore concluded that application of the Rule in this case did not violate Adamson\u2019s freedom of speech. The district court also dismissed Adamson\u2019s claim that enforcement of the Rule violated his free exercise of religion because Adamson had not shown a fundamental interest \u201cto be protected or weighed against the security concerns of the prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Magluta v. Samples, </em>375 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cUnder [Fed.R.Civ.P.] 12(b)(6), whether a plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted must be ascertained from the face of the complaint.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Copenhaver, Bell &amp; Assocs., </em>104 F.3d 1256, 1266 n. 11 (11th Cir.1997). A complaint should not be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim.\u201d <em>Beck v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, </em>144 F.3d 732, 735 (11th Cir. 1998) (internal quotation omitted). And \u201c[w]e accept the facts of the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Magluta, </em>375 F.3d at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Here, the record does not show that\u2014 at the early stage of this litigation before the district court\u2014the parties offered argument or cited authority on the governmental interest behind the Rule or the security concerns protected by application of the Rule. Indeed the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss Adamson\u2019s complaint provides no explanation of the reason for the Rule. But the district court, relying on authorities from jurisdictions other than Florida, dismissed Adamson\u2019s complaint after identifying what it perceived to be the governmental interest served by the Rule. Although the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusion may prove correct, its analysis\u2014which proceeded without the benefit of discussion of the Rule\u2019s purpose by the parties or authority explaining the Rule in Florida\u2014appears to be premature in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. For that reason, we cannot say that Adamson can prove no set of facts in support of his First Amendment claims. <em>See Beck, </em>144 F.3d at 735. Therefore, we vacate the district court\u2019s order dismissing Adamson\u2019s complaint and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ADW\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\">. Although it appears that the Secretary has been served with process in this case, the record does not reveal whether the other Defendants were properly served process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\">. Adamson\u2019s complaint also alleged that Defendants\u2019 refusal to mail his prayer-partner letters infringed on his \"right to marry, by preventing him from looking for a girlfriend and fianc\u00e9e\" and that Defendants violated the Constitution in rejecting 50 pen pal addresses that he purchased from \"Soulmates.\" But Adamson does not raise these claims on appeal; they are abandoned. <em>See Horsley v. Feldt, </em>304 F.3d 1125, 1131 n. 1 (11th Cir. 2002) (explaining that <em>pro se </em>appellant abandons issue not argued in initial brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b233-12\">. In addition, we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b234-4\">. We briefly address Adamson\u2019s remaining arguments. We are unpersuaded by his assertion that he has stated a claim that the Rule is an invalid exercise of legislative authority. As the district court discussed, the Florida Department of Corrections has statutory authority pursuant to FI. Stat. \u00a7 944.09(1)(g) to adopt mies about \u201d[m]ail to and from the state correctional system.\u201d In addition, to the extent that Adamson raises\u2014for the first time\u2014arguments about the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc <em>et seq., </em>we do not address these claims. <em>See Walker v. Jones, </em>10 F.3d 1569, 1572 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201d[W]e have repeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court.\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). And we see no reversible error in the district court\u2019s decision to construe Adamson\u2019s motion for summary judgment\u2014which was filed while the district court was considering the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss Adamson's complaint and to which Adamson attached no affidavits, testimony, or other exhibits\u2014as a supplemental response by Adamson to the dismissal motion. <em>See Am. Postal Workers Union v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>823 F.2d 466, 478 (11th Cir. 1987) (explaining that \"Appellee filed no affidavits or testimony in support of its purported summary judgment motion\u201d and that \"[mjerely applying the label \u2018motion for summary judgment\u2019 to a pleading does not make it one\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
