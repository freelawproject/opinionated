He was sentenced within his advisory guideline range to concurrent terms of fifty-seven months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">On appeal, his attorney has filed an Anders<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> brief, noting that, because Berry waived his right to appeal his sentence in his plea agreement, there were no meritorious issues on appeal. Nonetheless, the <em>Anders </em>brief questions whether Berry\u2019s sentence was greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). Berry filed a pro se supplemental brief arguing that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at sentencing. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal based on the appeal waiver. We grant the motion in part and dismiss the appeal with regard to the issue raised in Berry\u2019s formal brief. After a review of the record under <em>Anders, </em>we affirm Berry\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">A defendant may, in a valid plea agreement, waive the right to appeal under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990). Any such waiver must be made by a knowing and intelligent decision to forego the right to appeal. <em>United States v. Broughton-Jones, </em>71 F.3d 1143, 1146 (4th Cir.1995). Whether a defendant has effectively waived his right to appeal is an issue of law we review de novo. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">With regard to the issue raised in the <em>Anders </em>brief, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss. The district court\u2019s plea colloquy was thorough and substantially conformed to the dictates of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. Moreover, Berry does not challenge the voluntariness of his waiver. Because Berry knowingly and voluntarily entered into the plea agreement and the waiver was reviewed at the plea hearing, the waiver is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">The waiver expressly precluded Berry from appealing any sentence that was within or below the advisory guideline range. Because the sentence imposed was \u25a0within the advisory guideline range, any challenge to the sentence imposed, including the issue raised in Berry\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, falls within the scope of that waiver. Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Berry\u2019s appeal as to the claim raised in the <em>Anders </em>brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">The waiver\u2019s enforceability does not completely dispose of this appeal, however. Our interpretation of Berry\u2019s plea agreement is guided by contract law. <em>United States v. McQueen, </em>108 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1997). The appellate waiver expressly permitted an appeal based upon ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct not known to Berry at the time of his guilty plea. Therefore, the waiver provision does not foreclose Berry\u2019s right to appeal with respect to such issues, <em>see United States v. Craig, </em>985 F.2d 175, 178 (4th Cir.1993), and we deny the Government\u2019s motion as it relates to ineffective assistance or prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-14\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Berry claims that counsel provided ineffective assistance at sentencing. Claims of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ineffective assistance of counsel are generally not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Rather, to allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant must bring such claims in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. <em>See id.; United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994). An exception exists where the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999); <em>King, </em>119 F.3d at 295. Because the record does not conclusively show that Berry\u2019s counsel was ineffective, we decline to consider Berry\u2019s claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and found no viable claims of ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct that are clear from the record. Accordingly, we affirm Berry\u2019s convictions and, to the extent of sentencing challenges outside the scope of the appellate waiver, his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">This court requires that counsel inform Berry, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Berry requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Berry. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\"><em> Anders </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
