Greer, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). For the reasons stated below, we will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-19\">Greer filed the underlying complaint against York County and the York County Court of Common Pleas in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, alleging that his civil rights were violated when he appeared in the York County Court of Common Pleas for a contempt hearing before Judge Sheryl Ann Dorney. According to Greer, Judge Dorney was rude and disrespectful to him during the proceedings, and sentenced him unfairly in comparison to the other litigants in the courtroom that he observed being sentenced that day. As relief, Greer requested $7.7 million in damages, release from prison on his own recognizance, and that the District Court remove Judge Dorney from the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-21\">The District Court granted Greer\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>and then dismissed Greer\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). The Court first noted that it has previously dismissed a complaint filed by Greer against Judge Dorney based on essentially the same allegations for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and on immunity grounds pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(iii). The Court then dismissed the instant complaint, holding that the Court of Common Pleas is immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment, <em>see Benn v. First Judicial Dist. of Pa., </em>426 F.3d 233, 238-41 (3d Cir.2005) (holding that all components of unified state judicial system are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity), and is not a \u201cperson\u201d subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, <em>see Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 69-70, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (holding that States or governmental entities considered \u201carms of the State\u201d are not considered \u201cpersons\u201d under \u00a7 1983), and that Greer had failed to state a claim against York County. <em>See City of Canton v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 385, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989) (holding that municipality may be liable under \u00a7 1983 only when its policy or custom causes the constitutional violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-22\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Appellant has been granted <em>informa pau</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>peris </em>status pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, we review this appeal for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal may be dismissed if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). For the reasons given by the District Court, we agree that Greer\u2019s complaint cannot withstand scrutiny under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) &amp; (iii). Accordingly, we will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Greer\u2019s motions for the appointment of counsel are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
