Carrillo-Rodriguez contends that the 16-level adjustment to his offense level for a previous conviction of a crime of violence was erroneous because the Florida statute under which he was convicted of burglary in 2004 extends to conduct beyond the generic definition of burglary of a dwelling because the operative definition of \u201cdwelling\u201d in Flori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>da includes the curtilage of a building. He argues that the district court\u2019s error was not harmless for numerous reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Carrillo-Rodriguez did not raise in the district court his argument about the Florida statute\u2019s inclusion of curtilage in its definition of a dwelling. Our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Cabral-Castillo, </em>35 F.3d 182, 188-89 (5th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The district court erred by adjusting Carrillo-Rodriguez\u2019s offense level based on his Florida conviction. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Guerra, </em>485 F.3d 301, 303-04 (5th Cir.2007). However, the 16-level adjustment did not constitute reversible plain error, whether the district court\u2019s alternative reasoning for imposing a 70-month sentence constituted an upward departure or a non-guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The district court incorrectly considered Carrillo-Rodriguez\u2019s arrest record. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(3), p.s. However, Carrillo-Rodriguez had a total of 11 convictions that were not counted when calculating his criminal history score. The district court did not err by concluding that Carrillo-Rodriguez\u2019s convictions of unlawfully carrying a weapon and battery suggested a history of violence, and that his convictions of petty theft, burglary of a structure, grand theft, and criminal trespass suggested a lack of respect for other peoples\u2019 property. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.3(a)(3), p.s., comment, (backg\u2019d).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The number and nature of Carrillo-Rodriguez\u2019s uncounted convictions suggested that a substantial departure or a relatively high non-guideline sentence was advisable to promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford deterrence against future criminal conduct, and protect the public from Carrillo-Rodriguez. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Because a departure was permissible pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(3), p.s., the sentence was consistent with \u00a7 3553(b)(1), which allows departures when an aggravating circumstance has not been adequately taken into account, in kind or in degree, by the Sentencing Commission. Moreover, given Carrillo-Rodriguez\u2019s evident disregard for the law, a departure was justified on the facts of the case. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2954, 165 L.Ed.2d 975 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">Analyzed as a non-guideline sentence, the district court provided fact-specific, compelling reasons that are consistent with the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a). The district court did not fail to account for any factor that should have received significant weight or, despite the consideration of Carrillo-Rodriguez\u2019s arrest record, give significant weight to an improper factor. Nor did the district court commit a clear error in judgment while balancing the sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707-08 (5th Cir. 2006). The 70-month sentence was reasonable in light of Carrillo-Rodriguez\u2019s extensive history of serious criminal conduct. <em>See id. </em>at 705, 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">Carrillo-Rodriguez also maintains the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a penalty provision and not a separate criminal offense. <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
