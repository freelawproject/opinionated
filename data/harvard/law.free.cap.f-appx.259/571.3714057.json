A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of -a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Simpson has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b597-13\"> While the district judge appeared to indicate that Simpson failed to timely file objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>dation, we find that Simpson\u2019s objections were timely filed. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a), (e), 72(a); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). Given that the district court nonetheless reviewed the record de <em>novo, </em>any error associated with the timeliness of Simpson\u2019s objections is harmless. <em>See generally, Orpiano v. Johnson, </em>687 F.2d 44, 47-48 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
