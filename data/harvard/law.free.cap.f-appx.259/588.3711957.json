We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,\u201d <em>Rush v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and we uphold credibility determinations if they are supported by substantial evidence, <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-22\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding and the ruling that Wang failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on a protected ground, as necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2007) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Moreover, because Wang cannot sustain his burden on the asylum claim, he cannot establish entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum\u2014even though the facts that must be proved are the same\u2014an applicant who is ineligible for' asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3) [ (2000) ].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-23\">Accordingly, we deny Wang\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>terials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b614-17\"> Wang does not challenge the denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture, and therefore, this claim is abandoned. <em>See Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 189 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004) (holding that failure to raise a challenge in an opening brief results in abandonment of that challenge).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
