We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Our review discloses that a prior motion by Felton to reduce sentence based on Amendment 505 was unsuccessful. Moreover, Felton\u2019s claim to reduce his sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is without merit. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Pena, </em>470 F.3d 431, 433 (1st Cir. 2006). Finally, we find that <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 </em>U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), cited by Felton, does not support modification of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">We accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
