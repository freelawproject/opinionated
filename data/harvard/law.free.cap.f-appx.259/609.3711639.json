On appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion and the imposition of a 174-month sentence of imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-21\">This court reviews the factual findings underlying the denial of a motion to suppress for clear error and the legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>400 F.3d 187, 193 (4th Cir.2005). The evidence is construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). The question of voluntariness turns on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d including the \u201ccharacteristics of the defendant, the setting of the interview, and the details of the interrogation.\u201d <em>United States v. Pelton, </em>835 F.2d 1067, 1071 (4th Cir.1987). A statement will be deemed involuntary if the accused\u2019s will has been \u201coverborne\u201d or his \u201ccapacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-22\">We find that the district court did not err in denying Hancock\u2019s suppression motion. We have recognized that truthful statements about the accused\u2019s predicament are not the type of \u201ccoercion\u201d that renders his statement involuntary. <em>See Pelton, </em>835 F.2d at 1072-73. Here, the investigator\u2019s reference to Hancock\u2019s mother was not a threat, but rather a true statement about his mother\u2019s predicament.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The statement was not sufficiently coercive to overbear Hancock\u2019s will or impair his capacity for self-determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-23\">We further find that the district court properly applied the Sentencing Guidelines and considered the relevant sentencing factors before imposing the 174-month sentence under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). We therefore conclude the sentence imposed was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness accorded within-guidelines sentence). Accordingly, we affirm Hancock\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b635-18\"> Significantly, Hancock does not challenge the veracity of the investigator\u2019s statement about his mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
