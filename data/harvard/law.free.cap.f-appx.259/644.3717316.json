Lawrence Boz\u00e9 appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his Motion to Sever Orders for Attorney\u2019s Fees Disgorgement. Appellant argues that this Court has jurisdiction over this appeal under the collateral order doctrine. Because we find that the collateral order doctrine does not apply, we dismiss Appellant\u2019s appeal for want of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AXI\">This case arises out of a series of chemical fires occurring at a chemical warehouse located near Pleasantville, Texas. Thousands of plaintiffs emerged and brought causes of action for various personal injuries and property damage. The underlying case resulted from the consolidation of these claims. Appellant Boz\u00e9 and the firm of Gary, Williams, Parenti, Finney, Lewis, McManus, Watson &amp; Sperando (the \u201cGary Law Firm\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are the attorneys for the Pleasantville Plaintiffs, including <em>565 </em>minor Plaintiffs. The district court appointed Appellee Kim A. Ballew to serve as Guardian Ad Litem for all minor Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-18\">All Plaintiffs ultimately reached a settlement with the Defendants. The district court, however, has yet to enter a final judgment approving all issues relating to the settlements of the minor Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-19\">On January 28, 2003, the district court held a hearing regarding, in part, the amounts of attorney\u2019s fees and costs that were to be paid from the Pleasantville minor Plaintiffs\u2019 settlement proceeds. Despite seeking substantial fees in excess of $1,000,000, the district com\u00ed entered an order awarding Appellant and the Gary Law Firm a nominal amount of attorney\u2019s fees for their representation of the minors. Appellant and the Gary Law Firm appealed this order\u2014along with the denial of their motion for reconsideration and several other orders disbursing funds from the Pleasantville minor Plaintiffs\u2019 settlement proceeds\u2014to this Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which found want of appellate jurisdiction because the orders appealed from were \u201cinterlocutory and unappealable rulings.\u201d <em>Pleasantville Civic League of Houston, Tex. v. Guardian Ad Litem, </em>86 Fed.Appx. 743 (5th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-20\">Thereafter, on February 13, 2006, Appellant filed its Motion to Sever Orders for Attorney\u2019s Fees Disgorgement with the district court, seeking to make the orders concerning attorney\u2019s fees disgorgement final, appealable judgments. On February 24, 2006, the district court denied this motion. Appellant now appeals the denial of its motion, two 2006 orders disbursing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>funds, and all the 2003 orders that Appellant previously appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Appellant concedes that the orders appealed from are not final, but contends that appellate jurisdiction is proper pursuant to the collateral order doctrine, which allows \u201cappeals from orders other than final judgments when they have a final and irreparable effect on the rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan </em>Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 545, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). To come within the collateral order exception, an order must satisfy three conditions: (1) it must \u201cconclusively determine the disputed question\u201d; (2) it must \u201cresolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action\u201d; and (3) it must \u201cbe effectively unreviewable on appear from a final judgment.\u201d <em>In re Lieb, </em>915 F.2d 180, 184 (5th Cir.1990) (internal quotations omitted). Appealable collateral orders are limited to a \u201csmall class which finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\u201d <em>Cohen, </em>337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221. Only serious and unsettled questions come -within the collateral order doctrine. <em>Baldridge v. SBC Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>404 F.3d 930, 931 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">With respect to the order denying Appellant\u2019s motion for severance, this Court has found that \u201cthe collateral order doctrine does not apply to an interlocutory order denying severance of claims or separate trials.\u201d <em>Amie v. City of Jennings, </em>217 Fed.Appx. 338, 339 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also In re Lieb, </em>915 F.2d at 185 (finding that severance orders are analogous to orders under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(b), which are \u201cinterlocutory and nonappealable before final judgment\u201d). Appellant does not adequately explain how denial of a motion for severance constitutes \u201can important issue\u201d or why it is \u201ceffectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>In re Lieb, </em>915 F.2d at 184 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">With respect to the 2003 orders, this Court has already determined that these orders are \u201cinterlocutory and unappealable rulings.\u201d <em>Pleasantville Civic League of Houston, Tex. v. Guardian Ad Litem, </em>86 Fed.Appx. 743 (5th Cir.2004). We will not re-examine this determination. <em>See Fuhrman v. Dretke, </em>442 F.3d 893, 896 (5th Cir.2006) (\u201cThe law of the case doctrine provides that an issue of law or fact decided on appeal may not be reexamined ... by the appellate court on a subsequent appeal.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">With respect to the two 2006 orders disbursing funds, Appellant has wholly failed to explain how these orders come within the collateral order doctrine. Furthermore, these 2006 orders authorize the same types of disbursements as many of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>the 2003 orders that this Court previously found unappealable prior to a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Thus, none of the interlocutory orders Appellant seeks to appeal fall within the collateral order doctrine. Accordingly, these orders are unappealable at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">This is the <em>second </em>time Appellant has improperly attempted to appeal interlocutory orders. Counsel for Appellant is cautioned against filing further interlocutory appeals regarding the disgorgement of Appellant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and warned that such further filing may result in sanctions. This Court will consider Appellant\u2019s contentions on appeal from a <em>final </em>judgment\u2014but not before then.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b671-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-21\">. The Gary Law Firm is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b671-23\">. These orders that were the subject of the first appeal to this Court are referred to collectively as the \u201c2003 orders.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\">. In its brief, Appellant summarily states that \u2018\u2018[i]f the Appellant is not allowed to presently appeal the order denying severance, there quite possibly will be no funds left in the registry of the district court with which to pay the Appellant if and when a final judgment is entered and if it is subsequently found that the Appellant is entitled to his attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Such a conclusory statement is insufficient, however, because Appellant must both \"allege[ ] and prove[ ]\u201d that the fees would be \"unrecoverable\" if appeal must await a final judgment. <em>See Shipes v. Trinity Indus., Inc., </em>883 F.2d 339, 344 (5th Cir.1989). It is undisputed that funds are being held in a qualified settlement fund escrow account, and such funds cannot be disbursed from that account without court order. Even if the district court does disburse all such funds before a final judgment, Appellant offers no evidence that any funds, if paid, would be unrecoverable from the payees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
