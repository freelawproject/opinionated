Hall (\u201cHall\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendant-Appellee Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\u201cMetLife\u201d) on her action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), to recover accidental death and dismemberment benefits and personal accident insurance benefits in the amount of $284,208.00. Hall claimed these benefits as the widow and sole beneficiary of Tommie B. Hall (the \u201cdecedent\u201d), an employee of General Electric Company who suffered a fatal allergic reaction to a bee sting. The decedent was insured under an employee welfare benefits plan that excluded coverage for losses contributed to or caused by disease or physical impairment. The district court held that MetLife properly denied coverage based on this exclusion. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">On July 16, 2004, the decedent, age 37, was stung by a bee on the bridge of his nose. Within minutes, his tongue swelled; he stopped breathing and lost consciousness. Emergency personnel were unable to revive him, and he was pronounced dead little more than an hour after he was stung. The death certificate listed anaphylaxis as the immediate cause of death, noting the bee sting as an underlying cause. The hospital disposition summary listed diagnoses of anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest. The decedent\u2019s family physician agreed that the decedent died after suffering anaphylactic shock from a bee sting, but she noted no prior history of bee sting allergies. An independent consulting physician, retained by MetLife, reviewed the medical records and opined that the decedent likely had an allergy to stinging insects that was not reflected in the medical records, and that this allergy caused the anaphylactic reaction resulting in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">Prior to his death, the decedent had been employed by the General Electric Company (\u201cGE\u201d) and covered under the GE Life, Disability and Medical Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d). As relevant here, the Plan provided accidental death and dismemberment (\u201cAD&amp;D\u201d) and personal accident insurance (\u201cPAI\u201d) benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the Plan, MetLife served as the claims administrator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-17\">[MetLife] will make all determinations with respect to benefits under this Plan. Accordingly, the management and control of the operation and administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>of claim procedures under the Plan, including the review and payment or denial of claims and the provision of full and fair review of claim denial pursuant to Section 503 of [ERISA], shall be vested in [MetLife].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">J.A. 171.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">There is no dispute in this case that the bee sting suffered by the decedent was an accident. The GE Benefits Handbook explains the circumstances in which accidental losses are not covered under the Plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_K\">Benefits under [the AD&amp;D and PAI sections of the Plan] are not paid for losses contributed to or caused by: <em>Disease </em>or medical or surgical treatment of such disease; [intentionally self-inflicted injury; <em>[pjhysical or mental impairment </em>or medical or surgical treatment of such impairment; or [insurrection or any act of war, whether declared or undeclared.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azs\">JA. 365 (emphasis added). After receiving Hall\u2019s claim as the beneficiary under the decedent\u2019s policy, and quoting this exclusionary language, MetLife denied the claim on \u201cthe basis of ... the Plan\u2019s exclusions for accidental losses contributed to or caused by disease and/or physical impairments.\u201d J.A. 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The denial letter cited the death certificate, the hospital disposition summary, the letter from the decedent\u2019s family physician, and the independent physician consultant\u2019s report, concluding that these records \u201cdemonstrate^ that decedent\u2019s allergy to bee stings was both a disease and physical impairment which caused and/or contributed to his death.\u201d J.A. 714. MetLife relied extensively on the independent physician consultant\u2019s report, in which the doctor cited authority to the effect that a bee-sting allergy is a \u201cdisease,\u201d J.A. 718-19, opined that \u201c[a]n allergy is [also] a physical impairment when the allergy is activated,\u201d JA. 719, and rendered the opinion that the decedent had an allergy to stinging insects even though no such allergy was noted in his medical records. The report concluded that the decedent\u2019s reaction to the bee sting was consistent with a severe allergic reaction and that this reaction caused the decedent\u2019s death. JA. 718-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">Hall appealed the denial, arguing that there was no evidence that an allergy was a contributing cause of the decedent\u2019s death\u2014only evidence that the decedent died as a result of being stung on the bridge of his nose. Hall also argued that even if the decedent had a pre-existing sensitivity or allergy to bee stings, this condition was not a \u201cdisease\u201d or \u201cimpairment.\u201d Hall further argued that when an injury activates a <em>dormant </em>disease, the <em>injury </em>should be held to be the direct and exclusive legal cause of death, thereby allowing her to recover. MetLife found Hall\u2019s assertion regarding causation to be contrary to the uncontroverted medical evidence and reiterated its earlier conclusion that the decedent\u2019s bee-sting allergy was a disease and a physical impairment that contributed to or caused his death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Met-Life then wrote,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-12\">Finally, an additional basis [for denial] exists under the coverage language, which requires that the loss result solely and directly from an accident.... [W]e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>find that [the decedent\u2019s] death did not result solely and directly from an accident. ... [W]e must uphold the denial of your client\u2019s claim based on the requirement that the loss be solely and directly due to an accident, and the Plan\u2019s disease and physical impairment exclusions listed above. This letter concludes the administrative review process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">J.A. 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Hall initiated this action in Virginia state court. MetLife removed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court concluded that MetLife had not abused its discretion in denying Hall\u2019s claim based on the aforementioned exclusion. <em>Hall v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>398 F.Supp.2d 494, 499 (W.D.Va.2005). At Hall\u2019s suggestion, the court in the alternative reviewed the denial de novo but nevertheless found that the record evidence that the decedent suffered anaphylactic shock from a bee sting was \u201coverwhelming,\u201d and that the decedent\u2019s allergic reaction fell within the parameters of the disease or physical impairment exclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 501. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Under our well-settled framework for reviewing denials <em>o\u00ed </em>benefits under ERISA plans, we examine the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Sheppard &amp; Enoch Pratt Hosp., Inc. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>32 F.3d 120, 123 (4th Cir.1994). Where a Plan gives a claims administrator discretion to construe plan terms or determine eligibility for benefits, we review the administrator\u2019s denial decision for abuse of discretion. <em>See Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989); <em>Ellis v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>126 F.3d 228, 232-33 (4th Cir.1997). Otherwise, the denial is reviewed de novo. <em>Bruch, </em>489 U.S. at 115, 109 S.Ct. 948. Of course, we review de novo the threshold matter of whether the Plan language at issue limits us to abuse-of-discretion review. <em>Haley v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>77 F.3d 84, 89 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">MetLife argues that the Plan language in this case contains sufficient discretion-conferring authority to require review under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. Although we are inclined to disagree, we need not resolve the issue since, as the district court noted, the outcome here would be the same under either standard. Assuming the applicability of de novo review, which is more favorable to Hall, we assess whether the denial of AD&amp;D and PAI benefits to Hall was appropriate. We are limited to the evidence that was before MetLife at the time it made its decision unless we determine that additional evidence is necessary to facilitate an adequate de novo review of the denial. <em>Quesinberry v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>987 F.2d 1017, 1025 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">Hall urges us to review only the rationale contained in the initial denial letter, J.A. 715 (\u201cthe basis of MetLife\u2019s denial of [Hall\u2019s] claim is the Plan\u2019s exclusions for accidental losses contributed to or caused by disease and/or physical impairments\u201d), and not consider the additional rationale for the denial offered by MetLife for the first time in its denial of Hall\u2019s appeal, J.A. 668 (\u201cthe requirement that the loss be solely and directly due to an accident\u201d). In doing so, Hall relies on the ERISA requirement that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\">[i]n accordance with [applicable regulations], every employee benefit plan shall ... afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133. ERISA\u2019s implementing regulations explain that a claimant must initially be provided with, inter alia, \u201c[t]he specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination,\u201d and \u201c[rjeference to the specific plan provisions on which the determination is based.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-l(g)(l)(i)-(ii). The claimant must then be given \u201cthe opportunity to submit written comments, documents, l\u2019ecords, and other information relating to the claim for benefits,\u201d and the claims administrator must take any such materials submitted into account in deciding the appeal. \u00a7 2560.503-l(h)(2)(ii), (iv). Under either standard of review\u2014de novo or abuse of discretion\u2014 the administrator must comply with these procedural guidelines. <em>See Weaver v. Phoenix Home Life Mut. Ins. Co., </em>990 F.2d 154, 158 &amp; n. 3 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The safeguards in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133 and the implementing regulations \u201chave been read as ensuring that a full and fair review is conducted by the administrator, that a claimant <em>is enabled to prepare an appeal for further administrative review </em>or recourse to the federal courts, and that the courts can ... review! ] a claim denial.\u201d <em>Ellis, </em>126 F.3d at 236-37 (emphasis added). For that reason, this court has previously held, albeit in an unpublished opinion, that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133 and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1 require that judicial review be \u201climited to whether the rationale set forth in the <em>initial </em>denial notice is reasonable.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>30 Fed.Appx. 160, 164 (4th Cir.2002) (unpublished) (emphasis added); <em>see also Robinson v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>443 F.3d 389, 393 (5th Cir.2006) (holding that under \u00a7 1133 the administrative review must focus on the specific reason for the administrator\u2019s decision cited in the initial denial notice); <em>Abatie v. Alta Health &amp; Life Ins. Co., </em>458 F.3d 955, 974 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201c[A]n administrator that adds, in its final decision, a new reason for denial, a maneuver that has the effect of insulating the rationale from review, contravenes the purpose of ERISA.\u201d); <em>McCartha v. Nat\u2019l City Corp., </em>419 F.3d 437, 446 (6th Cir.2005) (holding that an administrator was not in substantial compliance with \u00a7 1133 where the initial denial notice omitted one of the grounds later relied on for the denial of benefits); <em>Abram v. Cargill, Inc., </em>395 F.3d 882, 886 (8th Cir.2005) (noting that ERISA\u2019s procedural requirements are intended to generate a \u201cmeaningful dialogue\u201d between claim administrators and beneficiaries and to avoid beneficiaries being \u201csandbagged by post-hoc justifications of plan decisions\u201d) (internal quotations omitted); <em>Juliano v. Health Maint. Org. of N. J., Inc., </em>221 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The district court below erroneously reasoned that the limitation suggested by these cases would render superfluous another of ERISA\u2019s procedural safeguards\u2014 the requirement that the administrator, in reviewing an appeal of a denial, consider new materials \u201csubmitted by the claimant relating to the claim\u201d after the initial denial. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-l(h)(2)(iv). <em>Hall, </em>398 F.Supp.2d at 501. In doing so, the court failed to distinguish between the obligation of a claim administrator to provide sufficient notice of the precise reason for a denial and the right of a claimant to submit additional information in response to the reason given. The statutory and regulatory text and the case law demand that judicial review take into account only reasons for an adverse benefits determination offered in the initial denial notice, because these are the only rationales on which a claimant might have arguably been given a \u201cfull and fair\u201d opportunity to respond during the administrative process. <em>See Ellis, </em>126 F.3d at 237. Therefore, in this case, we will limit our review to Met-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Life\u2019s initial denial based on the Plan\u2019s disease and physical impairment exclusions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Courts have long grappled with policy exclusions such as the one at issue in this case, which could conceivably preclude coverage in all but a few accident cases. <em>See </em>J.A. Bock, Annotation, <em>Preexisting Physical Condition as Affecting Liability Under Accident Policy or Accident Feature of Life Policy, </em>84 A.L.R.2d 176 (1962). For example, an insured driver in a fatal automobile accident whose end was hastened somewhat by his pre-existing heart disease, even where experts agreed that a perfectly healthy individual would have died under like circumstances, would arguably not be covered under the policy (the disease having contributed, albeit in a minor way, to his death). The waters become murkier still if we depart from the seemingly scientific term \u201cdisease\u201d and also consider death contributed to or caused by \u201cimpairment\u201d or \u201cinfirmity,\u201d which, could conceivably include anything from high blood pressure to the common frailties of youth or old age.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, it is difficult to conjure up scenarios in which no argument could be made that <em>some </em>disease or infirmity contributed to an accidental loss. <em>Landress v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>291 U.S. 491, 499, 54 S.Ct. 461, 78 L.Ed. 934 (1934) (Cardozo, J., dissenting) (\u201cProbably it is true to say that in the strictest sense and dealing with the region of physical nature there is no such thing as an accident.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">In this context, one court has recognized the existence of a \u201clong-standing allegorical tug-of-war\u201d between insurance companies and the courts (with beneficiaries serving merely as \u201chighly partisan spectator[s]\u201d). <em>Collins v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>729 F.2d 1402, 1404 (11th Cir.1984). At one extreme, insurance companies can be characterized as proffering an interpretation of policy provisions in which \u201caccidental death\u201d coverage applies only on facts \u201cwhich [are] the equivalent of a truck dropping from the skies, striking squarely and killing instantly a perfectly fit human specimen clutching a just-issued physician\u2019s clean bill of health.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At the other, the beneficiary of a particularly fragile decedent might claim coverage even when an insignificant trauma had disproportionately debilitating consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">Hall encourages us to solve the causation dilemma before us by drawing a sharp line of demarcation between the accidental bee sting and the allergy, which Hall characterizes as merely a dormant condition activated by the bee sting. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 44. Under Hall\u2019s theory, the allergy must be viewed as arising only after, and as a consequence of, the bee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>sting for purposes of determining legal causation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Our precedent does not permit such fine distinctions. In <em>Adkins v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>917 F.2d 794, 797 (4th Cir.1990), we concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">\u201c[A] pre-existing infirmity or disease is not to be considered as a cause unless it substantially contributed to the disability or loss____ [A] \u2018pre-disposition\u2019 or \u2018susceptibility\u2019 to injury, whether it results from congenital weakness or from previous illness or injury, does not necessarily amount to a substantial contributing cause. A mere \u2018relationship\u2019 of undetermined degree is not enough.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 797 (quoting <em>Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Weartz, </em>636 S.W.2d 891, 894 (Ky.Ct.App.1982)). We later refined this into a two-prong test: (1) whether there is a pre-existing disease, pre-disposition, or susceptibility to injury; and (2) if so, whether the pre-existing disease, predisposition, or susceptibility to injury substantially contributed to the disability or loss. <em>Quesinberry, </em>987 F.2d at 1028. <em>Adkins </em>and <em>Quesinberry </em>control the result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">On the first <em>Quesinberry </em>prong, Hall argues that the evidence of record does not support a conclusion that the decedent suffered from a bee-sting allergy prior to his death. Hall offers a somewhat disingenuous characterization of the decedent\u2019s doctor\u2019s report in support of her position by representing that \u201cDecedent\u2019s treating physician clearly stated that Decedent suffered from no such prior allergy.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 46. In fact, the doctor\u2019s letter stated, \u201c[Decedent] had no history of bee sting allergy. I have reviewed his entire medical chart and there has never been a visit related to any allergic reaction.\u201d J.A. 725. Saying that there is no history of a condition is a far cry from \u201cclearly stating\u201d that no such condition existed. Fairly read, the doctor\u2019s letter is entirely consistent with the other evidence of record establishing that the decedent suffered from an allergy to bee stings that preexisted the fatal sting.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">The record in this case compels the conclusion that the decedent\u2019s bee-sting allergy is properly viewed as a \u201cpre-existing disease, pre-disposition, or susceptibility to injury.\u201d <em>Quesinberry, </em>987 F.2d at 1028. The independent consulting physician\u2019s report and the website submitted by Hall in support of her appeal support such a finding. Further, as the district court noted, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease supports the view that an allergy is a disease or impairment. <em>Hall, </em>398 F.Supp.2d at 500 n. 2. Hall did not argue, nor need we decide, whether an \u201callergy\u201d is a \u201cdisease or impairment\u201d for all purposes, in every case; our decision is grounded in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">We now turn to the second <em>Quesinberry </em>prong and the question of causation. For the one or two people out of every thousand afflicted with the decedent\u2019s condition, a bee sting has the potential to cause a severe anaphylactic reaction. That is precisely what happened here. The death certificate and independent physician\u2019s report document the fact that the decedent\u2019s allergy triggered the anaphylaxis that was the immediate cause of his death. Consequently, on the second prong of <em>Quesinberry, </em>we are constrained to conclude that the decedent\u2019s bee-sting allergy was a preexisting condition that substantially contributed to his death, and the Plan unambiguously excludes coverage on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">We are not unsympathetic to the concern voiced by Hall that an expansive reading of the exclusionary language in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Plan in this case might negate coverage in spite of the legitimate expectations of insured individuals and beneficiaries. <em>See Silverstein v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>254 N.Y. 81, 171 N.E. 914, 915 (1930) (\u201cA policy of insurance is not accepted with the thought that its coverage is to be restricted to an Apollo or a Hercules.\u201d). However, we are satisfied that our analysis, dictated by precedent, of whether a \u201cpreexisting disease, pre-disposition, or susceptibility to injury ... <em>substantially contributed </em>to the disability or loss\u201d selves as an adequate check on insurers\u2019 decisions in accidental loss cases. <em>Quesinberry, </em>987 F.2d at 1028 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\">. The Plan also included basic life insurance benefits, for which MetLife found Hall eligible in the amount of $ 118,420.00.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\">. This language comes from the PAI section of the Plan. The AD&amp;D section contains substantially the same language, except that the first sentence reads, \"Determinations of all benefit payments under the Plan will be made by [MetLife].\" J.A. 151.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-13\">. Regarding the question of whether an allergy is a disease, MetLife cited a website submitted by Hall during the appeal process for the propositions that \u201cAllergies are disorders of the immune system\u201d and that \"Anaphylactic shock, also called anaphylaxis, is a severe, life threatening reaction to certain allergens.\u201d J.A. 667, 671.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b620-6\">. Our customary course of action when faced with an administrator which has failed to comply with ERISA\u2019s procedural requirements is to remand the case to the administrator for a full and fair review. <em>See Weaver, </em>990 F.2d at 159; <em>Berry v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., </em>761 F.2d 1003, 1007 n. 4 (4th Cir.1985). Here, however, because our de novo review leads us to conclude that the plan exclusion cited in the initial denial letter precludes an award of benefits in this case, remand would be futile. Accordingly, we decline to issue the customary remedy of remand, instead curing MetLife's violation by simply reviewing the case as though the new rationale in the appeal denial had not been given.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b620-12\">. Lest we be accused of presenting outrageous extremes, we note that, at oral argument, counsel for MetLife suggested that a hypothetical snake-bite allergy afflicting a random fifty percent of the population, or, alternately, everyone under the age of twelve, would be an infirmity or impairment precluding coverage under the policy (though he later retracted the statement as it pertained to those under age twelve).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\">. Paradoxically, Hall elsewhere argues that \"the sting and the allergy are one-in-the-same and cannot be separated for causation purposes.\u201d Reply Br. at 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
