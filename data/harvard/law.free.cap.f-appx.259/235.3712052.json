On appeal, Ewart contends that the district court erred by denying his motion, because he demonstrated the particularized need required for disclosure of the requested testimony. We review the denial of a motion for disclosure of grand jury materials under Rule 6(e) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Burke, </em>856 F.2d 1492, 1496 (11th Cir.1988). After careful review, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">The general rule is that grand jury proceedings are to be kept secret. <em>See United States v. Aisenberg, </em>358 F.3d 1327, 1346 (11th Cir.2004). Limited exception to the general rule may apply when the grand jury matter is sought \u201cpreliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding,\u201d under Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(E)(i). In <em>United States v. Baggot, </em>463 U.S. 476, 103 S.Ct. 3164, 77 L.Ed.2d 785 (1983), the Supreme Court held that Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-14\">contemplates <em>only </em>uses related fairly directly to some <em>identifiable litigation, pending or anticipated. </em>Thus, it is not enough to show that some litigation may emerge from the matter in which the material is to be used, or even that litigation is factually likely to emerge.... If the primary purpose of disclosure is not to assist in preparation or conduct of a judicial proceeding, disclosure under (C)(i) is not permitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Baggot, </em>463 U.S. at 480, 103 S.Ct. 3164 (emphasis added). Moreover, a defendant\u2019s effort to obtain grand jury materials can only succeed with a showing of \u201cparticularized need.\u201d <em>United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>356 U.S. 677, 683, 78 S.Ct. 983, 2 L.Ed.2d 1077 (1958). The \u201cparticularized need\u201d standard is not satisfied by bare, unsubstantiated allegations. <em>Cf. United States v. Cole, </em>755 F.2d 748, 759 (11th Cir.1985) (unsubstantiated allegations do not satisfy particularized need standard); <em>United States v. Warren, </em>16 F.3d 247, 253 (8th Cir.1994) (bare allegation that grand jury records are necessary did not satisfy \u201cparticularized need\u201d requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Here, when he filed his motion for disclosure, Ewart\u2019s criminal case had concluded and no other judicial proceedings were pending.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor did Ewart enumerate, in the motion, any \u201cidentifiable litigation, pending or otherwise,\u201d to which the requested materials \u201cfairly directly\u201d related. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, to the extent Ewart suggested the materials would undermine the credibility of certain government witnesses, his claims were unsubstantiated and nothing more than bare allegations. On this record, we discern no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion in its denial of the motion for disclosure of the grand jury materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-9\">. We previously affirmed Ewart's convictions for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1), and 846, and possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). <em>See United States v. Ewart, </em>164 Fed.Appx. 925 (11th Cir.2006) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\">. We are unpersuaded by the government\u2019s suggestion that the motion should have been dismissed, rather than denied. The case on which the government relies, <em>United States v. Scott, </em>414 F.3d 815 (7th Cir.2005), is distinguishable. In that case, when the defendant filed his motion for disclosure of grand jury materials, pursuant to Rule 6(e)(3)(E), he had already filed a motion for relief under \u00a7 2255, which had been denied. The Seventh Circuit held that the request for disclosure, in which the defendant stated that he was \"challenging the legality, constitutionality and authenticity of the instant indictment,\u201d constituted a second, or successive, collateral attack for which Scott did not have permission to proceed. <em>Id. </em>at 817. Accordingly, the Seventh Circuit said the district court should have dismissed the motion based on a lack of jurisdiction, rather than denying it on the merits. By contrast, in the instant case, when he filed his Rule 6(e)(3)(E) motion, Ewart had not sought relief on a collateral basis, under \u00a7 2255, or on any other basis for that matter. And in his motion for disclosure, Ewart made no showing that the requested materials\u2014which involved no newly discovered evidence and implicated no new rule of constitutional law\u2014could make available to him permission to file a second or successive habeas petition. Accordingly, we find <em>Scott </em>inapposite to our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">. After the district court denied the Rule 6(e)(3)(E) motion, Ewart filed a motion to vacate his sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, on a wholly unrelated basis\u2014the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
