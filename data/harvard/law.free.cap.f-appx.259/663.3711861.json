Osorio argues that the BIA erred and that the IJ erred by declining to exercise sua sponte authority to grant his out-of-time motion to reopen. He contends that the circumstances in his case rise to the level of exceptional circumstances justifying sua sponte reopening. He also argues that this court should remand his case because he is prima facie eligible for relief under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-21\">This court lacks jurisdiction to review the decision not to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen Osorio\u2019s removal proceedings. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 248-50 (5th Cir.2004). While Osorio relies upon policy considerations that he asserts warrant a remand for consideration of his purported NA-CARA eligibility, he fails to explain why this court would have authority to remand the case when this court does not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s actions. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.43(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">For the foregoing reasons, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider this appeal. The petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b689-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
