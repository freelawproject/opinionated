On appeal, Foster\u2019s attorney has filed an <em>Anders </em>brief,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising the issue of whether the district court complied with Fed R.Crim. P. 32(i)(3)(B) in ruling on Foster\u2019s objection to the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). Foster has filed a pro se supplemental brief arguing that he was improperly determined to be a career offender. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-23\">Under Rule 32(i)(3)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a district court must rule on objections to the PSR or find that a ruling is unnecessary because the disputed matter will not affect sentencing or will not be considered in sentencing. Counsel suggests the district court erred in ruling on Foster\u2019s objection to his classification as a career offender by relying on the PSR and the investigation conducted by the probation officer, without viewing the original state court sentencing sheets.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-24\">We conclude the district court properly considered and ruled at sentencing on Foster\u2019s objection to career offender status based on his 1996 convictions. Moreover, the district court did not err in relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the information contained in the PSR and the testimony of the probation officer at sentencing. When, as here, the district court relies on information in the PSR in making findings, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that the information relied on by the district court is incorrect; mere objections are insufficient. <em>United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998). The only information in the PSR Foster claimed was inaccurate was his date of birth. He did not dispute that he was convicted in South Carolina\u2019s General Sessions court and was sentenced under South Carolina\u2019s Youthful Offender Act. Nor did he dispute the PSR\u2019s recitation of the sentences imposed and time served on those sentences. These facts, rather than Foster\u2019s age, were relevant to the court\u2019s determination that the prior convictions were predicate felonies for career offender classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Career offender classification requires, among other conditions, that the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence or drug offenses. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.1. The Sentencing Guidelines define \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d as \u201ca prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of ... the actual sentence imposed.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n. 1). Furthermore, \u201c[a] conviction for an offense committed before age eighteen is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted....\u201d7d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In addition, before an adult conviction is counted for career offender purposes, the court must consult the guidelines provision for computing criminal history. USSG \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n. 3). <em>United States v. Mason, </em>284 F.3d 555, 558 (4th Cir.2002). Offenses committed prior to age eighteen are to be included in the criminal history calculation if: the defendant was convicted as an adult and received a sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month, \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(l); the defendant has an adult or juvenile sentence to confinement of at least sixty days and was released from such confinement within five years of his commencement of the instant offense, \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(A); or the defendant has an adult or juvenile sentence imposed within five years of the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense, \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">South Carolina does not consider youthful offender convictions as either adult or juvenile; instead, it gives trial judges the discretion to treat youthful offenders as either juveniles or adults depending on the circumstances of the case. S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 24-19-50; <em>see United States v. Pinion, </em>4 F.3d 941, 944 (11th Cir.1993). Thus, proceeding under the analysis of USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, both Foster\u2019s 1996 convictions are countable under \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(A). Foster was released from confinement on the armed robbery convictions on May 30, 2003. On the assault charge, Foster\u2019s parole was revoked on August 6, 2004, and he was ordered incarcerated for sixty days to be served on weekends. The PSR does not reveal when or whether this confinement ended, but at the earliest, it was March 2005. Both of these dates are well within five years of October 2005, the commencement of the instant offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>district court properly considered Foster\u2019s 1996 convictions as predicate felonies for career offender purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Foster\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-16\">. <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\">. Because Foster actually served approximately four years on the armed robbery convictions, his convictions arguably count toward career offender status under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(1). Nevertheless, because Foster\u2019s armed robbery conviction is clearly countable under \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(A), it is unnecessary to decide whether it is also countable under \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
