Russart argues that the district court abused its discretion in departing upward from the sentencing guidelines range based on U.S.S.G \u00a7 5K2.1 and unreasonably deviated upward from the sentencing guidelines range in imposing a non-guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In light of Russart\u2019s reckless conduct resulting in the death of an individual and the fact that the applicable Guideline did not take the possibility of a death into account, the district court did not abuse its discretion in departing upward based on \u00a7 5K2.1. In departing up to the statutory maximum, the district court also properly gave consideration to factors that met the objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including Russart\u2019s need for educational and vocational training and alcohol and drug rehabilitation programs, his lack of serious criminal history, and his recent drug use. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2954, 165 L.Ed.2d 975 (2006). Assuming that the district court could also make a non-guidelines upward deviation at sentencing, the district court properly considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as stated above, and did not give significant weight to irrelevant factors. The sentence imposed did not reflect a clear error in judgment or an abuse of discretion by the district court and was reasonable under the circumstance of the case. The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
