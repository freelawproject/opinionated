We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. <em>See Barry v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 741, 744 (4th Cir.2006). Further, we lack jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s refusal to invoke its sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings. <em>See Zhao Quan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 153, 155 (2d Cir.2007). Accordingly, we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-18\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
