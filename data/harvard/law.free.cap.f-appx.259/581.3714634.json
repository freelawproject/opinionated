Prior to sen-fencing, the probation office prepared a presentence report, in which it determined Estrada to be a career offender. As Estrada was convicted of violating \u00a7 924(c) and determined to be a career offender, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(c)(3) provided the applicable advisory guidelines range. Based on Estrada\u2019s acceptance of responsibility and a three point reduction for that acceptance, section 4Bl.l(c)(3) recommended an advisory range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">On January 9, 2007, the district court sentenced Estrada to 280 months\u2019 imprisonment. Estrada timely noted his appeal and has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In his <em>Anders </em>brief, Estrada questions whether his sentence was reasonable. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. The district court must calculate the appropriate advisory guidelines range by making any necessary factual findings. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir. 2006) . The court should then consider the resulting advisory guideline range in conjunction with the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 and Supp. 2007) , and determine an appropriate sentence. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). However, considering the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) does not require the sentencing court to \u201crobotically tick through\u201d every subsection of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006). On appeal, this court will affirm a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>that falls \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Moreland, </em>487 F.3d at 433. A sentence within a properly calculated advisory guideline range is presumed to be reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Here, Estrada\u2019s sentence was both substantively and procedurally reasonable. Estrada began committing felonies at age fourteen and his involvement with crime has continued unabated. Estrada is only twenty-seven years old. However, in thirteen years, Estrada has accumulated multiple felony convictions, a number of which involve guns and drugs. Estrada\u2019s sentence, near the lower end of his guideline range, appropriately reflects his serious criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Similarly, Estrada\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable. Prior to sentencing Estrada, the district court properly determined Estrada\u2019s advisory guideline range, heard the argument of counsel, and rejected defense counsel\u2019s position that Estrada had a drug addiction. The context surrounding the imposition of Estrada\u2019s sentence indicates that the court considered the arguments and recommendations of counsel and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d at 381. Accordingly, we determine that the sentence was reasonable. <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2459.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Estrada, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Estrada requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Estrada.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-12\"><em> </em>Estrada was informed of <em>his </em>right to file a pro se supplemental brief. He has elected not to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
