Because Aduddle neither alleges nor shows that the alleged violation of his constitutional right to adequate medical treatment arose from the enforcement of an official policy or custom, the district court did not err in dismissing his claims against Fort Bend County and Sheriff Wright in his official capacity. <em>See McKinney v. Irving Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>309 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Woodard v. Andrus, </em>419 F.3d 348, 352 (5th Cir.2005). Aduddle\u2019s claim against Sheriff Wright in his individual capacity fails because he offers nothing more than unfounded assertions to establish that Sheriff Wright\u2019s actions resulted in the alleged denial of medical treatment. <em>See Alton v. Texas A &amp; M Univ., </em>168 F.3d 196, 200 (5th Cir.1999). Dismissal is also warranted because Aduddle fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs. <em>See Hare v. City of Corinth, Miss., </em>74 F.3d 633, 643 (5th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-36\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
