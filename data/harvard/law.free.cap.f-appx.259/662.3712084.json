As Maldonado made a timely Rule 29 motion for acquittal, review is under a \u201crational jury\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Ortega Reyna, </em>148 F.3d 540, 543 (5th Cir.1998). Because the drugs were concealed, knowledge cannot be inferred solely from Maldonado\u2019s control of the vehicle in which the drugs were found; additional circumstantial evidence that is suspicious in nature or demonstrates guilty knowledge is required. <em>See id. </em>at 543-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-22\">There was sufficient circumstantial evidence of Maldonado\u2019s guilty knowledge. Officers at the inspection station noted that Maldonado was nervous, was sweating, avoided eye contact, and failed to answer a question. Although nervousness can be a normal reaction to circumstances which one does not understand, <em>see United States v. Diaz-Carreon, </em>915 F.2d 951, 954 (5th Cir.1990), Maldonado testified that he made frequent trips across the border and was usually subjected to secondary inspection. Maldonado gave differing accounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>of who owned the vehicle he was driving, mentioning both a sister-in-law and a brother-in-law to the officers. At trial, he provided implausible testimony regarding his relationship with the vehicle\u2019s owner, the owner\u2019s sister, and his inability to provide any contact information for them. In addition, he testified that he had not told the owner of the vehicle that he would be using the car or that he would be crossing the border that day, which the jury could have found to be implausible given the amount and value of the drugs in the car. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found that Maldonado knew he was transporting drugs. <em>See United States v. Ramos-Garcia, </em>184 F.3d 463, 466 (5th Cir.1999) (defendant\u2019s nervousness, implausible story, and quantity of drugs supported jury finding of guilty knowledge).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b688-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
