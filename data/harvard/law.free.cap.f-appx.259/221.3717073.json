[he] use[d] or earrie[d] a firearm, or ..., in furtherance of any such crime, possesse[d] a firearm.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). For a defendant\u2019s possession to be \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 a drug trafficking crime, \u201cthere must be \u2018some nexus between the firearm and the drug selling operation.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>447 F.3d 1327, 1340 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1253 (11th Cir.2002)). In determining whether a nexus exists sufficient to sustain the conviction, we consider, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe type of drug activity that is being conducted, accessibility of the firearm, the type of the weapon, whether the weapon is stolen, the status of the possession (legitimate or illegal), whether the gun is loaded, proximity to the drugs or drug profits, and the time and circumstances under which the gun is found.\u201d <em>Timmons, </em>283 F.3d at 1253 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Here, sufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s finding that Morales\u2019s possession of the firearms was \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 his drug trafficking offenses. The search of Morales\u2019s vehicle uncovered: a firearm on the right side of the driver\u2019s seat, where Morales was sitting when officers responded to the scene; another firearm behind the front passenger\u2019s seat; methamphetamine in the pocket of the driver\u2019s side door and beneath the steering wheel; a glass pipe used for smoking methamphetamine underneath the driver\u2019s seat; and $4,800 in the glove compartment. The firearms, which Morales admitted were his, were loaded and easily accessible. The firearms were found in close proximity to the methamphetamine and the money, which the jury reasonably believed to be drug profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The government presented evidence that drug dealers frequently carry <em>firearms </em>to protect themselves, their drugs and their money and that one of Morales\u2019s guns was a type commonly possessed by drug traffickers. Alcocer Jimenez Sabino, Morales\u2019s coconspirator, testified that he had been buying methamphetamine from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Morales for eighteen months and that he had observed Morales carrying a firearm when Morales went to get drugs, but not at other times.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">A reasonable jury could infer from this evidence that the purpose of the firearms found in the car was to protect Morales\u2019s drugs and drug profits that were also found in the car. Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence in the record to establish a nexus between the firearms and Morales\u2019s drug trafficking offenses and for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the firearms were not merely present, as Morales contends, but were possessed in furtherance of Morales\u2019s drug trafficking offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\">. We \"review <em>de novo </em>... the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\" <em>United States v. Tampas, </em>493 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted). To support a guilty verdict, \u201d[i]t is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt....\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>289 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation marks omitted). Rather, \u201d[t]he evidence is sufficient so long as a reasonable trier of fact, choosing among reasonable interpretations of the evidence, could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>389 F.3d 1359, 1367 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
