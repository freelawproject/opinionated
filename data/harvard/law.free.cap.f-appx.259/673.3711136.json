Carrigan does not dispute that the claims raised in the instant \u00a7 2241 petition were raised in his prior \u00a7 2241 petition, which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because he failed to satisfy the criteria of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 savings clause. He argues that he should be allowed to proceed under the savings clause on the basis of the discovery of new information pertaining to his claims, specifically, the addendum to the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-20\">In order to satisfy the criteria of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 savings clause, Carrigan must show that his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and that the claim was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when it should have been raised at trial, on appeal, or in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Carrigan has not made the requisite showing. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Carrigan\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-21\">Carrigan is CAUTIONED that the filing of repetitious or frivolous pleadings will result in the imposition of a sanction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b699-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
