No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">In September 2006, Simon filed a complaint alleging many civil rights violations resulting from his August 2001 arrest in Atlanta, Georgia. The district court dismissed Simon\u2019s complaint as frivolous because the complaint was filed well beyond the two-year statute of limitations for section 1983 claims arising from events that occurred in Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-18\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a claim as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 for abuse of discretion. <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001). \u201c[Bjeeause district judges remain more familiar with and are more experienced to recognize potentially frivolous claims ... [a] determination of frivolity is best left to the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA claim is frivolous if it is without arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-19\">Section 1983 claims are governed by the forum state\u2019s general personal injury statute of limitations, <em>see Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 109 S.Ct. 573, 574, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989); and in Georgia, the statute of limitations is two years. <em>Uboh v. Reno, </em>141 F.3d 1000, 1002 (11th Cir.1998). In this case, Simon\u2019s complaint was filed approximately five years after the August 2001 events giving rise to his claims. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Simon\u2019s complaint was frivolous because it was barred by the two-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-16\"> To the extent that Simon argues that his claims are not barred because the statute of limitations should be tolled while his ante <em>litem </em>notice\u2014which Simon claims was filed with the City of Atlanta in December 2001\u2014 was pending, we reject this argument. According to Simon, the City of Atlanta responded to his ante <em>litem </em>notice in March 2003 by denying his claim. Simon also contends that the Department of Corrections reached a sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ilar conclusion in May 2003. Even if we were to assume that the statute of limitations was tolled until 2003, Simon's complaint\u2014which was filed in September 2006\u2014was still filed beyond the two-year limitations period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
