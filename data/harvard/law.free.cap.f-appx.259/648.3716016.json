The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). We construe Nero\u2019s motion as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). A dismissal for failure to state a claim is reviewed de novo. <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 734 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-17\">Nero argues that changes to the Louisiana Constitution and the repeal of LSA-R. S. 15:571.7 violated ex post facto principles under the state and federal constitutions. Nero\u2019s claim is in the nature of habeas relief because he is challenging the duration of his imprisonment rather than the conditions of his prison life. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 499-500, 93 S. Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). The new amendment to the state constitution requiring the Board of Parole\u2019s approval prior to the governor\u2019s commutation of sentence does not alter the definition of a crime; it does not increase Nero\u2019s penalty in any way. <em>California Dep\u2019t of Corrs. v. Morales, </em>514 U.S. 499, 506 n. 3, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995). Rather, the change in the state constitution constitutes a new procedural rule that does not violate any ex post facto principles. Likewise, the repeal of LSA-R.S. 15:571.7 does not constitute an ex post facto violation because the statute did not afford a constitutional right to a pardon or an early release from a valid sentence. <em>Dunn v. Maggio, </em>712 F.2d 998, 1001-02 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-20\">Accordingly, Nero has failed to present a nonfiivolous issue for appeal. His motion for IFP is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-21\">MOTION FOR IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b674-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
