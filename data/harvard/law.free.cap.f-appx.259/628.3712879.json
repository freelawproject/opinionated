By so moving, Hei\u2019rera challenges the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Herrera\u2019s appellate IFP motion is restricted to the argument that he is entitled to proceed IFP because he is a pauper. He has waived any argument challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith, as well as any challenge to the reasons for the district court\u2019s underlying denial of his initial IFP motion filed jointly with his proposed \u00a7 1983 complaint, by failing to brief them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). He has thus abandoned the only grounds for appeal. <em>Id. </em>The appeal is wholly without arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>see also Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Herrera\u2019s IFP motion is denied, as is his motion for the appointment of counsel. The motion for the temporary reinstatement of his Texas master plumber\u2019s license is similarly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b654-35\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
