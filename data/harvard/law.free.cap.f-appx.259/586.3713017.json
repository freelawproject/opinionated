RApp. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

Greene\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on May 14, 2007. Because Greene failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss her appeal, No. 07-1418.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-24\">With regard to Singleton, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis and affirm in No. 07-1411 for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Culler v. Thrifty Car Rental, </em>No. 3:05-cv01758-MBS, 2007 WL 1031826 (D.S.C. March 30, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-25\">No. 07-1411 <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-26\">No. 07-1428 <em>DISMISSED.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
