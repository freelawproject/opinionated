Kent suffers from the severe impairments of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obesity, and migraines. On appeal, Kent challenges the administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision to give \u201clittle weight\u201d to the opinion of her treating psychiatrist, Dr. Michael M\u00e1rchese, about the degree of Kent\u2019s mental limitations. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-14\">In weighing medical opinions, the ALJ must give a treating physician\u2019s opinion \u201csubstantial or considerable weight\u201d unless the ALJ articulates good cause for not doing so. Winsehel v. Commissioner of Soc. Sec., 631 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir. 2011); see also 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2) (providing that the ALJ will give \u201cgood reasons\u201d for not giving controlling weight to a treating source\u2019s opinion). \u201cGood eause exists when the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclu-sory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d Winschel, 631 F.3d at 1179 (quotation marks omitted). Here, the ALJ\u2019s reasons for discounting Dr. March-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>ese\u2019s opinion amount to good cause and are supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Relevant to this appeal, Dr. M\u00e1rchese opined in his mental residual functional capacity (\u201cMRFC\u201d) assessment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that Kent had \u201cmarked\u201d restrictions in her ability to: (1) remember locations and work-like procedures; (2) understand and remember very short and simple instructions; (3) carry out detailed instructions; (4) perform activities within a schedule and be punctual; (5) work in proximity to others without distraction; (6) make simple work-related decisions; (7) interact appropriately with the general public; (8) ask simple questions or request assistance; (9) get along with co-workers; (10) respond to changes in the work place; and (11) set realistic goals and make plans. Dr. M\u00e1rchese opined that Kent had \u201cextreme\u201d restrictions in her ability to: (1) understand and remember detailed instructions; (2) maintain attention and concentration for extended periods of time; (3) sustain an ordinary routine without special supervision; (4) complete a normal workday and workweek and perform at a consistent pace; (5) accept instructions and respond appropriately to a supervisor\u2019s criticism; and (6) travel in unfamiliar places or use public transport.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">The ALJ gave Dr. Marchese\u2019s MRFC assessment \u201clittle weight.\u201d The ALJ explained that Dr. Marchese\u2019s opinion that Kent had \u201cmarked\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d mental limitations was inconsistent with \u201cthe record as a whole\u201d and in particular with \u201cobjective mental status findings,\u201d including Dr. Marchese\u2019s own findings, \u201cwhich reflect a consistently fair ability in memory, concentration, and attention and no evidence of suicidal or homicidal ideation.\u201d The ALJ further noted that Dr. March-ese\u2019s MRFC opinion was inconsistent with the Global Assessment of Functioning (\u201cGAF\u201d) scores Dr. M\u00e1rchese had assigned in his treatment notes, which indicated \u201cno more than moderate symptoms\u201d and at times \u201cno symptoms to only mild symptoms.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">In part because of the little weight given to Dr. Marchese\u2019s MRFC assessment, the ALJ concluded that Kent did not satisfy the \u201cparagraph B\u201d criteria in Listing 12:04 (affective disorders) or Listing 12.06 (anxiety-related disorders) and thus did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>meet or medically equal a listed impairment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ALJ further concluded that Kent had the residual functional capacity to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels except for the following \u201cnonexertional limitations,\u201d that Kent: (1) \u201cis limited to performing simple repetitive tasks\u201d; and (2) \u201cis limited to performing work where changes in the workplace are infrequent and gradually introduced.\u201d Based on this RFC finding and a vocational expert\u2019s testimony, the ALJ determined that, although Kent could not perform her past relevant work, she could perform other work that exists in the national economy, such as dining room attendant, night cleaner, and mail room clerk. The ALJ thus concluded that Kent was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">The ALJ articulated good cause for giving Dr. Marchese\u2019s opinion less weight, specifically that it was inconsistent with objective mental status findings, including those in Dr. Marchese\u2019s own medical records. Moreover, the ALJ\u2019s articulated reasons are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Kent\u2019s medical records indicate a period of significant instability in the first half of 2009, which is reflected in the record with GAF scores at or below 50, a brief two-day commitment to Shands Vista, and depression and anxiety. At the time, however, Kent was undergoing significant life stres-sors, including her husband\u2019s recent death and her ex-husband\u2019s stalking behavior, and Kent reported that her stay at Shands Vista was due to an accidental overdose, not to a suicide attempt. By July 2009, Kent was working part time.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">Moreover, Kent appeared to improve throughout treatment, especially after she was referred to Dr. M\u00e1rchese in April 2010. In addition to treating her depression and anxiety, Dr. M\u00e1rchese diagnosed her with ADHD, for which he prescribed Adderall, and convinced Kent to attend a bereavement group. Dr. Marchese\u2019s records tended to show a positive response to treatment, which was conducted on an outpatient basis. Additionally, after Kent began seeing Dr. M\u00e1rchese, her GAF scores tended to range between 54 and 76, indicating moderate to mild symptoms, and her brief downturns corresponded to life stressors, such as going through her deceased husband\u2019s belongings or her grandson\u2019s accident. Additionally, Dr. M\u00e1rchese routinely listed Kent\u2019s memory, judgment, and insight as fair and often indicated her mood was euthymic. A routine assessment of \u201cfair\u201d memory, judgment, and insight, along with mild to moderate GAF scores, does not coincide with \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201cmarked\u201d functional limitations. Further, the record shows that Kent was capable of driving short distances, making smaller meals for herself, and doing some light household chores, even if she needed help with some more onerous tasks. This evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Marchese\u2019s opinion contradicted his own treating notes and the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">Kent argues that Dr. Marchese\u2019s opinion is entitled to great weight merely because Dr. M\u00e1rchese is her treating doctor and has expert credentials. Contrary to Kent\u2019s claims, the ALJ is not required to accept the opinion of a treating doctor, even one with expert credentials, if the ALJ finds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>that the opinion is not supported by the doctor\u2019s own records or the record as a whole. See Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 363 F.3d 1155, 1159 (11th Cir. 2004) (explaining that even a treating physician\u2019s opinion may be discounted for \u201cgood cause,\u201d such as the opinion contradicting the physician\u2019s own treatment notes). Furthermore, to the extent Kent relies on Dr. Marchese\u2019s professional resume, this information cannot be found in either the administrative record or the record on appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">There is no merit to Kent\u2019s claim that the ALJ conducted his own \u201cpsychiatric analysis\u201d using Dr. Marchese\u2019s treatment notes. The ALJ properly considered all of the relevant medical and other evidence, including Dr. Marchese\u2019s treatment notes, and assessed Kent\u2019s RFC, a determination reserved to the ALJ. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2), 404.1545(a)(3), 404.1546(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">For these reasons, we must conclude the ALJ committed no error in weighing Dr. Marchese\u2019s opinion and that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Kent was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b988-5\">. Our review is limited to whether the ALJ's decision is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards. Win-schel, 631 F.3d at 1178. \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id.

Residual functional capacity is the most a claimant can do despite any physical or mental limitations caused by the impairment and its related symptoms. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b988-7\">. Dr. Marchese\u2019s MRFC assessment form explained that the level of restriction was \u201cmarked\u201d if the ability to function in the area was very seriously limited and was \"extreme\u201d if there was no useful ability to function in the area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b988-12\">.According to the DSM-IV, GAF is a standard measurement of an individual\u2019s overall functioning \u201cwith respect only to psychological, social, and occupational functioning\u201d using a 1 to 100 point scale. American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 30-32 (4th ed. 2000). A score between 41 and 50 indicates serious symptoms or impairments, a score between 51 and 60 indicates moderate symptoms or impairments, a score between 61 and 70 shows mild symptoms or impairments, while a score between 71 and 80 represents no more than slight impairments.

To meet or equal one of these listings under paragraphs A and B, and thus to be considered disabled, the ALJ had to find, among other things, that Kent had at least two of the following: marked restrictions of activities of daily living, marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning, marked difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace, or repeated episodes of decompensation of extended duration. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1525 &amp; pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, Listing 12.00(A), 12.04(B), 12.06(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b990-9\">.
