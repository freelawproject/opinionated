On appeal, Espinoza primarily challenges the district court\u2019s application of an aggravating-role enhancement, pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G\u201d) \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). He also challenges the length of his statutory minimum sentence. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) described Espinoza\u2019s offense conduct as follows. Espinoza, in concert with Enrique Munoz and Luis Acosta, conspired to smuggle methamphetamine into the United States from Mexico. Espinoza procured the methamphetamine from a source in Mexico and then provided the drugs to Acosta, who distributed the drugs in small amounts to street-level customers. On one particular occasion, Espinoza recruited Acosta to make a delivery of one kilogram of methamphetamine to an unknown individual in Atlanta. In June 2014, Munoz acted as a mule for the drug-trafficking organization at Espinoza\u2019s request. Munoz traveled to California to pick up methamphetamine from Espinoza\u2019s Mexican source and bring it back to Florida. After Munoz was arrested on the drive back to Florida, Espinoza had discussions with the Mexican source, who told Espinoza that he wanted Munoz\u2019s family information so that \u201cthey\u201d could \u201ctake care of this,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Notably, in calculating his guideline range, the PSR applied a role enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl,l(c). The PSR states that \u201cMr. Espinoza was a leader in this conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine in various locations throughout the United States, and he recruited Luis Acosta and Enrique Munoz to distribute methamphetamin\u00e9 for him.\u201d Espinoza objected to the role enhancement, claiming that he was simply an intermediary between his coconspirators and the source of supply, and no evidence showed that he exercised any authority over them. Espinoza did not object to any of the PSR\u2019s factual statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">The district court overruled Espinoza\u2019s objection at sentencing and applied the two-level \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement. The court found that the evidence \u201cin its totality establishes a sufficient organization and coordinating role\u201d for the role enhancement to apply. With the \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement, Espinoza\u2019s applicable guideline range was 168 to 210 months in prison. He faced a statutory minimum term of ten years in prison. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The government recommended the statutory minimum, which is the sentence the district court ultimately imposed. Espinoza now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s application of an aggravating role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c). <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1250-51 (11th Cir. 2000). Clear error occurs when, in light of the entire record, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>572 F.3d 878, 887 (11th Cir. 2009). A sentencing court may rely on undisputed statements in the PSR. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">Section 3Bl.l(c) provides for a two-level increase \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity\u201d that involved fewer than five participants and was not \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>\u00a7 3Bl.l(a) and (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). The commentary to \u00a7 3B1.1 sets forth several factors to assist the sentencing judge\u2019s consideration of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense, including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-4\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger \u25a0 share 'of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n.4. There is no requirement that all of these factors have to be present. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1026 (11th Cir. 2009). The basic goal of \u00a7 3B1.1 is to account for relative responsibility between criminal actors. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cThe sentence adjustment was plainly designed to address \u2018concerns about relative responsibility.\u2019\u201d) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. backg\u2019d).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Although a defendant\u2019s status as a middleman or distributor is insufficient to support a role enhancement, <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1993), \u201cthe assertion of control or influence over only one individual is enough to support a \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement,\u201d <em>Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d at 1251; <em>see Martinez, </em>584 F.3d at 1026 (for \u00a7 3B1.1 to apply, \u201cthere must be evidence that the defendant exerted some control, influence or decision-making authority over another participant in the criminal activity\u201d). Evidence that the defendant recruited participants, instructed participants, or wielded decision-making authority is sufficient to support a role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. <em>United States v. Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d 1214, 1231-32 (11th Cir. 2010) (addressing \u00a7 3Bl.l(a)). \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in applying a two-level aggravating role adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Undisputed facts in the PSR establish that Espinoza was more than simply a middleman or a distributor, and that he exercised control or influence over at least one other participant in the conspiracy. <em>See Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d at 1251; <em>Bennett, </em>472 F.3d at 832. According to the PSR, Espinoza recruited both Acosta and Munoz to do specific actions in furtherance of the conspiracy. With regard to Munoz in particular, the PSR states that Espinoza \u201crecruited Munoz to act as a mule for the organization.\u201d At Espinoza\u2019s request and direction, Munoz traveled to California to pick up methamphetamine from Espinoza\u2019s Mexican source. Then, when Munoz was arrested, the source looked to Espinoza to provide information about Munoz and Munoz\u2019s family, suggesting that the source viewed Munoz as Espinoza\u2019s s\u00fabordinate in the conspiracy. Moreover, Espinoza admits that \u201cEspinoza introduced Munoz to the scheme,\u201d though he disputes whether this qualifies as \u201crecruitment.\u201d Based on this evidence, the district court properly applied an aggravating-role enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). <em>See, e.g., Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d at 1231-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">Espinoza mainly argues that the undisputed facts in the PSR are insufficient to establish any of the seven factors listed in the commentary to \u00a7 3B1.1. However, these factors are relevant mainly to distinguish leadership or organizational roles from managerial or supervisory roles. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n.4. But the distinction between leadership roles and manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>ment roles, <em>compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(b), is \u201cof less significance\u201d when applying \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), which generally covers \u201crelatively small criminal enterprises\u201d that tend not \u201cto have clearly delineated divisions of responsibility,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. baekg\u2019d. Moreover, as explained above, the undisputed facts adequately demonstrate that Espinoza was in a position of greater responsibility relative to Munoz at least in the criminal activity, and that Espinoza exercised some degree of control or influence over him. <em>See Martinez, </em>584 F.3d at 1026. The district court\u2019s decision to apply the \u00a7 3Bl.1(c) enhancement was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Espinoza also argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it is significantly higher than both the sentence his codefendants received and the guideline range that would have applied had he been eligible for safety-valve relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">First, Espinoza is ineligible for the safety valve because the district court properly applied the \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) role enhancement. A defendant who was \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines,\u201d is not eligible for the safety valve. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1333-34 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Second, because Espinoza was ineligible for the safety valve, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), and because the government did not file a motion for a sentence reduction based on substantial assistance, see <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(e), the district court lacked any authority to sentence him below the ten-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1360-62 (11th Cir. 2008) (holding that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including a concern for sentencing disparities between coconspirators, \u201c[do] not provide a legal basis for imposing a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">In sum, we affirm Espinoza\u2019s sentence and the district court\u2019s application of an aggravating role enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-7\">. If the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was \"otherwise extensive,\u201d a defendant receives a four-level increase for being an \"organizer or leader,\u201d \u00a7 3Bl.I(a), and a three-level increase for being a \"manager or supervisor,\u201d \u00a7 3 B 1.1(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
