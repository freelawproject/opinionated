On direct appeal, Jenkins asserts that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AUn\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b943-21\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Jenkins pled guilty to attempted bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). The government\u2019s information charged that Jenkins attempted to rob the bank \u201cby force, violence, and intimidation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-22\">The factual proffer, accompanying the plea agreement, stated that on March 2, 2015, Jenkins entered a Bank of America branch and approached a line of customers at a teller station. After Jenkins informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>a bank employee that he wanted to make a withdrawal, the employee escorted him toward an ATM machine. Jenkins told the employee that Jenkins needed to speak with someone and was not interested in using the ATM machine. Jenkins then entered the line of another teller station.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">When he approached the teller\u2019s counter, Jenkins, while appearing to be shaking, removed a note from his bag and stated, \u201cThis is a stick up, you hear?\u201d He then handed the note to the teller, which read, \u201cneed $3,000 \u2014 $100\u2019s no dye packs please.\u201d The teller took the note and walked back toward the vault while \u201cfrantically\u201d attempting to activate a silent alarm. The teller indicated that she became fearful for her life after being given the robbery note. At some point while the teller was away from her station, Jenkins left the bank without obtaining any of the bank\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">B. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated Jenkins\u2019s base offense level as 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B8.1. The PSI assigned a two-level increase under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l) because the object of the offense involved the taking of property of a financial institution, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">The PSI also classified Jenkins as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.1(a), which provides that a defendant is a career offender if (1) he was at least 18 years old when he committed the offense of conviction; (2) the offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) he has at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The PSI identified these two qualifying prior Florida convictions: (1) a 1999 conviction for robbery; <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) a 2002 conviction for \u201cStrong Arm Robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">As a result of the career offender designation, the PSI set Jenkins\u2019s offense level at 32. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (providing an offense level of 32 if, as in Jenkins\u2019s case, the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction is at least 20 years, but less than 25 years in prison). The PSI reduced Jenkins\u2019s offense level by 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), yielding a total offense level of 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">As to criminal history, the PSI listed Jenkins\u2019s 1992 federal bank robbery conviction and his above two prior Florida robbery convictions. Due to Jenkins\u2019s career-offender status, the PSI raised his criminal history category from III to VI. Based on his criminal history category of VI and an adjusted offense level of 29, Jenkins\u2019s resulting advisory guidelines range was 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">C. Jenkins\u2019s Objections</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">Jenkins objected to the PSI\u2019s career-offender designation under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Jenkins argued that his 1999 Florida robbery conviction was not a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined by \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Specifically, Jenkins contended that at the time of his conviction, Florida\u2019s robbery statute, Florida Statutes \u00a7 812.13, would include a robbery by mere sudden snatching, would not require the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force, and would not present a serious risk of physical injury to another, and thus would not be a generic robbery. Jenkins pointed out that in 1999, after his conviction, the Florida Legislature enacted a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>robbery by sudden snatching statute, Florida Statutes \u00a7 812.131. Jenkins argued that before the new law in 1999, robberies by sudden snatching were prosecuted under \u00a7 812.13. Jenkins argued that the district court was required to assume he was convicted of robbery by sudden snatching in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The probation officer\u2019s Addendum to the PSI responded to Jenkins\u2019s objections. The PSI Addendum stated, inter alia, that on June 17, 1999, Jenkins \u201cwas convicted of robbery under Florida Statute [\u00a7 ] 812.13(2)(c).\u201d The PSI Addendum explained that the carrying of a weapon is not an element of a \u00a7 812.13(1) offense, but rather determined the degree of felony. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.13(2)(c) (making a violation of \u00a7 812.13(1) a second degree felony if the defendant \u201ccarried no firearm, deadly weapon, or other weapon\u201d during the robbery (emphasis added)). The PSI Addendum maintained that Jenkins\u2019s \u00a7 812.13(1) conviction was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2 regardless of whether the offense included sudden snatching.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Jenkins filed an objection to the PSI Addendum, arguing that: ' (1) \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s residual clause was unconstitutionally vague; (2) his \u201cpre-1999 Florida robbery\u201d conviction did not qualify as a crime of violence; and (3) his instant federal bank robbery offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) was committed \u201cby intimidation\u201d and thus was not a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The government filed no objections to the PSI or the PSI Addendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">D. Sentencing Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">At sentencing, Jenkins acknowledged that the district court was bound by this Court\u2019s recent decision in United States v. Matchett, 802 F.3d 1185 (11th Cir.2015), which rejected a constitutional-vagueness challenge to \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s residual clause. Jenkins reiterated all of his previous objections. Jenkins contended that, because the government failed to produce Shepard documents to the contrary, the district court was required to assume that his 1999 robbery conviction was for a robbery by mere sudden snatching. The government responded that Jenkins\u2019s instant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) offense and his prior 1999 Florida robbery conviction were both crimes of violence under all three clauses of U.S.S.G, \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">The district court overruled Jenkins\u2019s objections. The district court found that both Jenkins\u2019s 1999 Florida robbery conviction and his instant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) offense for attempted bank robbery were crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a). The district court calculated Jenkins\u2019s total offense level as 29, his criminal history category as VI, and his advisory guidelines range as 151 to 188 months,</p>\n<p id=\"AlF\">Jenkins\u2019s counsel requested, among other things, a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.3 because of Jenkins\u2019s significant mental health conditions. Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>sel noted that Jenkins was arrested for his Florida robbery offense in 1995, but his conviction was delayed until 1999 because he was not mentally competent to stand trial and was institutionalized for several years. Counsel asked for a 48-month sentence. The government agreed that a downward departure was appropriate and left the extent of the departure to the district court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-3\">After stating that it had considered the parties arguments, the PSI, the Sentencing Guidelines, and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court found that Jenkins had a \u201cdocumented history of severe mental disease\u201d that warranted a \u00a7 5H1.3 downward departure. The district court imposed a 60-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">A. Career Offender Provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">The Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 career offender enhancement, if applicable, changes a defendant\u2019s offense level and sets a criminal history category of VI, usually resulting in an increased advisory guidelines range. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). As noted earlier, to be a career offender, Jenkins\u2019s instant felony offense of conviction must be a crime of violence and he must have two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Section 4B1.2(a) defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a felony that: (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force (the elements clause); (2) is specifically enumerated as a crime of violence within the guideline (the enumerated offenses clause); or (3) otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another (the residual clause). Id. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">B. Jenkmss Instant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">The first issue is whether Jenkins\u2019s instant offense \u2014 attempted bank robbery \u2014 is a crime of violence. Jenkins\u2019s statute of conviction for his attempted bank robbery is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). Section 2113(a) makes it a crime if any person \u201cby force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the person or presence of another, or obtains or attempts to obtain by extortion any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of, any bank, credit union, or any savings and loan association.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (emphasis added). For \u00a7 2113(a) purposes, \u201cintimidation occurs when an ordinary person in the teller\u2019s position reasonably could infer a threat of bodily harm from the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d United States v. Kelley, 412 F.3d 1240, 1244 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">Robbery is listed as an enumerated offense for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.2. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, cmt. n.1; United States v. Lockley, 632 F.3d 1238, 1241-42 (11th Cir.2011). The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d also includes attempts to commit an enumerated offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, cmt. n.l. When an offense is specifically enumerated as a crime of violence, this Court \u201ccompare[s] the elements of the crime of conviction to the generic form of the offense\u201d to determine whether the prior conviction qualifies as a crime of violence. Lockley, 632 F.3d at 1241-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">The generic definition of robbery is \u201cthe taking of property from another person or from the immediate presence of another person by force or intimidation.\u201d Id. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>1244 (quotation marks omitted). Under the generic approach, intimidation is the fear of bodily harm. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The elements of a \u00a7 2113(a) offense are nearly identical to the elements of generic robbery. Both \u00a7 2113(a) and generic robbery at a minimum require the taking to be by intimidation, i.e., a perceived threat of bodily harm. Therefore, we conclude that bank robbery, or attempted bank robbery, under \u00a7 2113(a), even when perpetrated by means of intimidation, is \u00e1n enumerated offense that qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Moreover, a \u00a7 2113(a) offense qualifies under the elements clause. To qualify under the elements clause, an offense must have as an element \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l). The phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d requires \u201cviolent force\u201d or \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person,\u201d not merely an intentional, unwanted touching. See Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. 133, 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1271, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010) (interpreting an almost identical elements clause found in the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">Here, Jenkins\u2019s \u00a7 2113(a) offense committed by intimidation has as an element the \u201cthreatened use of physical force\u201d because \u201cintimidation\u201d requires the defendant to take actions from which an ordinary person could reasonably infer a threat of bodily harm. The threat of bodily harm is sufficient to qualify as the threatened use of \u201cphysical force\u201d or \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d See Johnson, 559 U.S. at 140, 130 S.Ct. at 1271. Thus, a \u00a7 2113(a) offense also qualifies as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)\u2019s elements clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">C. Jenkins\u2019s Prior 1999 Florida Robbery Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">Jenkins\u2019s prior 1999 Florida conviction was for robbery under Florida Statutes \u00a7 812.13(1) and (2)(c). Florida law, both now and in 1995 when Jenkins was arrested, defined \u201crobbery\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-10\">the taking of money or other property which may be the subject of larceny from the person or custody of another, with intent to either permanently or temporarily deprive the person or the owner of the money or other property, when in the course of the taking there is the use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.13(1) (emphasis added). If the defendant \u201ccarried no firearm, deadly weapon, or other weapon,\u201d during the commission of the robbery, the offense, also known as strong arm robbery, is punishable as a second degree felony. Id. \u00a7 812.13(2)(e); Selkirk v. State, 815 So.2d 758 (Fla. 4th Dist.Ct.App.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">In Locldey, this Court concluded that a robbery conviction under \u00a7 812.13(1) categorically constitutes a crime of violence under both the enumerated offenses clause and the elements clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). See 632 F.3d at 1241-45. As to the enumerated offenses clause, the Lock-ley Court determined that the commission of a \u00a7 812.13(1) offense \u201cnecessarily requires,\u201d inter alia, \u201cusing force, violence, or an intentional threat of imminent force or violence against another coupled with an apparent ability to use that force or violence, or by causing the person to fear death or great bodily harm.\u201d Id. at 1242-43. After comparing the elements of the two offenses, the Lockley Court concluded that a robbery under \u00a7 812.13(1) and generic robbery \u201care clear equivalents\u201d and that a \u00a7 812.13(1) offense \u201ccategorically qualifies\u201d as a crime of violence under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>enumerated offenses clause. Id. at 1244-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">As to the elements clause, the Court found that \u00a7 812.13(1) requires either the use of force or violence, the threat of imminent force or -violence coupled with apparent ability, \u201cor some act that puts the victim in fear of death or great bodily harm.\u201d Id. at 1245. The Court stated that it found \u201cit inconceivable that any act which causes the victim to fear death or great bodily harm would not involve the use or threatened use of physical force\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l). Id. Thus, a conviction under \u00a7 812.13(1) also \u201ccategorically qualifies under the elements clause as a predicate for the career offender enhancement.\u201d Id. Under Lockley, therefore, Jenkins\u2019s 1999 \u00a7 812.13(1) robbery conviction is a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">On appeal, Jenkins argues that we are not bound by Lockley because it addressed a 2001 robbery conviction under \u00a7 812.13(1), after the Florida Legislature enacted a separate robbery by sudden snatching statute, Florida Statutes \u00a7 812.131, on October 1, 1999. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.131; 1999 Fla. Laws 969; see also Lockley, 632 F.3d at 1246 &amp; n. 7 (distinguishing \u201c\u00a7 812.13(1) from its less-serious counterpart, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.131(1)\u201d because \u00a7 812.13(1) \u201cconcerns a far more aggressive and potentially violent form of robbery\u201d). According to Jenkins, before the October 1999 enactment (and specifically when he was charged in 1995), a taking by sudden snatching was prosecuted as a robbery under \u00a7 812.13(1). Thus, Jenkins maintains, prior to October 1, 1999, \u00a7 812.13(1) included conduct \u2014 sudden snatching \u2014 that both falls outside the generic definition of robbery and lacks the requisite use of violent force. As such, his pre-October 1, 1999 conviction under \u00a7 812.13(1) cannot categorically qualify as a crime of violence under either the enumerated offenses clause or the elements clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">The problem for Jenkins is' that \u00a7 812.13(1) has never included a taking by sudden snatching, as the Florida Supreme Court explained in Robinson v. State, 692 So.2d 883 (Fla.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">In Robinson, the Florida Supreme Court was called upon to resolve a split among its intermediate appellate courts on the question of \u201cwhether the snatching of property by no more force than is necessary to remove the property from a person who does not resists amounts to robbery in Florida\u201d under \u00a7 812.13(1). Id. at 884-85 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1. The Florida Supreme Court pointed to its 1976 decision in McCloud v. State, 335 So.2d 257 (Fla.1976), and reiterated that snatching does not involve the degree of physical force needed to constitute a robbery under \u00a7 812.13(1) because the physical force used must have overcome the victim\u2019s resistance, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-13\">In accord with our decision in McCloud, we find that in order for the snatching of property from another to amount to robbery, the perpetrator must employ more than the force necessary to remove the property from the person. Rather, there must be resistance by the victim that is overcome by the physical force of the offender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">Id. at 886. The Florida Supreme Court reaffirmed that \u201c[t]he snatching or grab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>bing of property without such resistance by the victim amounts to theft rather than robbery.\u201d Id. at 887. In Robinson, the Florida Supreme Court stated that \u201cFlorida courts have consistently recognized that in snatching situations, the element of force as defined herein distinguishes the offenses of theft and robbery.\u201d Id. In other words, Robinson reaffirmed and clarified what had already been the law in Florida since at least the McCloud decision in 1977 \u2014 that merely snatching property without using force to overcome the victim\u2019s resistance did not constitute a robbery under \u00a7 812.13(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Jenkins points to language in United States v. Welch, 683 F.3d 1304 (11th Cir. 2012), in which this Court addressed whether a 1996 Florida robbery conviction was a violent felony under the ACCA. As to the ACCA\u2019s elements clause, the defendant in Welch made the same argument Jenkins raises in this case \u2014 that Lockley was distinguishable \u201cbecause Lockley was convicted after Florida promulgated the \u2018sudden snatching\u2019 statute, so snatching from the person might furnish the basis for a robbery conviction here but not in Lockley.\u201d Id. at 1310, 1312. The Welch Court acknowledged the defendant\u2019s argument, stating that while the distinction \u201cmay fairly be made,\u201d it saw \u201cno reason not to apply Lockley to 1996 Florida robbery, even if robbery at that time could be accomplished by mere snatching.\u201d Id. at 1312. Noting that \u201cthe issue is not cut and dried,\u201d however\u2019, the Court concluded that it need not reach the elements clause issue because a snatching \u201csuffices under the [ACCA\u2019s] residual clause.\u201d Id. at 1313.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">In addition to not reaching the issue, Welch is unpersuasive in light of the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Robinson, which makes it clear that a \u00a7 812.13(1) robbery has \u201cconsistently\u201d required more force than a sudden snatching. 692 So.2d at 887. As the Welch Court noted, the defendant in that case had pled guilty before Robinson was decided and \u201cin a judicial district,\u201d namely the Fourth District Court of Appeal, \u201cthat had not yet spoken definitively on the question.\u201d Welch, 683 F.3d at 1311 &amp; nn. 31-32. Jenkins, on the other hand, was arrested and charged in Winter Haven, Florida, which is in Polk County, within Florida\u2019s Second District Court of Appeal. The Second District had ruled long before Jenkins\u2019s 1996 robbery arrest that more than a mere snatching was required to sustain a robbery conviction under \u00a7 812.13(1). See, e.g., Goldsmith v. State, 573 So.2d 445, 445 (Fla. 2d Dist.Ct.App.1991); Adams v. State, 295 So.2d 114, 116 (Fla. 2d Dist.Ct.App.1974); see also Robinson, 692 So.2d at 887 (citing the Second District\u2019s Goldsmith decision as one of the decisions in which Florida courts had \u201cconsistently recognized\u201d that a mere snatching was theft rather than robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Moreover, although Jenkins was arrested in 1995, he was not convicted until June 17,1999, more than two years after Robinson was decided on April 24,1997. In other words, if in fact Jenkins\u2019s 1995 conduct had been a mere snatching, by April 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>1997, it would have been patently clear to state prosecutors in every judicial district in the state of Florida that a \u00a7 812.13(1) robbery charge based on such conduct could not be sustained. Thus, unlike the defendant in Welch, Jenkins could not have been convicted under \u00a7 812.13(1) for a taking by sudden snatching.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">In sum, Jenkins\u2019s offense of conviction\u2014 attempted bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) \u2014 qualifies as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). In addition, Jenkins has two prior felony convictions\u2014 his two prior robbery convictions under Florida Statutes \u00a7 812.13(1) \u2014 that also qualify as crimes of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Therefore, the district court properly classified Jenkins as a career offender under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) and correctly calculated his applicable offense level and criminal history category pursuant to \u00a7 4Bl.l(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm Jenkins\u2019s 60-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-13\">. See infra note 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b945-8\">. Based on the current record, we must reject the government\u2019s contention that Jenkins\u2019s 1999 conviction was for \"armed\u201d robbery, not just robbery. Paragraph 25 of the PSI initially labeled Jenkins\u2019s 1999 conviction as an \u201cArmed Robbery,\u201d but did not include any' citation to a Florida statute of conviction or contain any description of the circumstances of the offense. The government did not submit any Shepard documents. Jenkins objected to paragraph 25, arguing that this robbery conviction was not a crime of violence. In response, the probation officer\u2019s PSI Addendum clarified that Jenkins was convicted \"under Florida Statute [\u00a7 ] 812.13(2)(c),\u201d which makes a robbery under \u00a7 812.13(1) a second degree felony when the defendant did not carry a weapon during the offense. Neither party objected to this statement in the PSI Addendum. See United States v. Bennett, 472 F.3d 825, 833-34 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that a failure to object to facts contained in the PSI and any addendum to the PSI admits those facts for sentencing purposes).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b946-7\">. \"We review de novo whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d United States v. Lockley, 632 F.3d 1238, 1240 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b948-6\">. In the district court, Jenkins referred to the challenged Florida robbery conviction as his \"1995 robbery conviction.\u201d In this Court, Jenkins refers to it as his \u201cpre-1999 conviction.\u201d It is undisputed, however, that Jenkins was arrested in 1995, but was not convicted until June 1999. The crux of Jenkins's argument is that he was arrested, charged, and convicted under \u00a7 812.13(1) before Florida\u2019s legislature enacted \u00a7 812.131 in October 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b949-6\">. Welch was decided before Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. -, -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2557, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), which held that the ACCA\u2019s residual clause was unconstitutionally vague. In his subsequent proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, Welch argued that Johnson applies retroactively on collateral review. The Supreme Court agreed and remanded Welch's \u00a7 2255 proceedings to this Court to determine whether the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion was correct \u201con other grounds,\u201d noting that \"the parties continue to dispute whether Welch\u2019s strong-arm robbery conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the elements clause of-the Act.\u201d See Welch v. United States, 578 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1257, 1268, 194 L.Ed.2d 387 (2016).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b950-9\">. Because Jenkins was convicted under \u00a7 812.13(1), which does not include, and never has included, sudden snatching, we have no occasion to address whether a Florida conviction for taking property by sudden snatching, either before or after 1999, constitutes a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b950-10\">. The parties vigorously dispute whether Jenkins\u2019s current 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) conviction and his prior 1999 Florida robbery conviction can or should still qualify as a \"crime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s residual clause in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), this Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Matchett, 802 F.3d 1185 (11th Cir.2015), and the Sentencing Commission\u2019s recent proposed amendment, effective August 1, 2016, deleting the residual clause from \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). Because, for the reasons discussed above, we conclude that both of Jenkins's challenged convictions qualify as \"crimes of violence\u201d under the enumerated offenses clause and the elements clause, we need not address the issues raised as to the residual clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
