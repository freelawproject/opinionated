He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Romero is a citizen of Nicaragua who first came to the United States in 1994. He was deported in 2012, returned, and was deported again in 2013. He returned again, was arrested again, and ultimately pleaded guilty in 2015 to one count of illegal reentry after deportation. His presentence investigation report revealed his lengthy criminal history, including multiple convictions for violent crimes such as aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and resisting an officer with violence. The PSR calculated a guidelines range sentence of 70 to 87 months. Neither party objected to the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">At his sentence hearing, Romero argued for a downward variance to a 30-month sentence. He asserted that a variance was appropriate because his most recent violent crime conviction was in 2005. He also noted that the majority of his criminal history was related to alcohol, and that he had not had any violent crime convictions after getting his alcohol problem under control. The district court rejected those arguments. After considering Romero\u2019s deportations and criminal history, as well as the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), it sentenced him to 70 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. United States v. Irey, 612 F.3d 1160, 1188-89 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc). District courts have a range of choice in deciding what sentence is reasonable so long as they properly weigh the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). Id. at 1188-89. Romero asserts that \u00a7 3553(a) contains a \u201cparsimony command\u201d which the district court violated by imposing a sentence that was greater than necessary to fulfill the purposes of sentencing. He argues that the district court should have considered how he has changed his behavior since his violent crime convictions and that he re-entered the United States to help his family and avoid violence in Nicaragua.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Romero. To begin with, we \u201cordinarily expect a sentence within the [guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d United States v. Gonzalez, 550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008). Romero\u2019s sentence is also \u201cwell below\u201d the applicable 20-year maximum sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) for re-entry after conviction for ah aggravated felony. Id. The court acknowledged that Romero\u2019s arguments for a downward variance had persuasive force, but it found that a guidelines sentence was appropriate given his two deportations and his \u201cdeplorable\u201d criminal history, especially so that the sentence would promote respect for the law. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). In light of the nature and extent of Romero\u2019s criminal history, the district court\u2019s emphasis on that factor was not a \u201cclear error in judgment\u201d that requires us to vacate his sentence. See Irey, 612 F.3d at 1190 (quotation marks omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>ted). As for Romero\u2019s argument that \u00a7 3553(a) contains a \u201cparsimony command,\u201d we have explained that the goal of sentencing \u201cis to lock in a sentence that is not too short and not too long,' but just right to serve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d Id. at 1197. The district court did not abuse its broad discretion in deciding that a 70-month sentence would fulfill the purposes of sentencing in Romero\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
