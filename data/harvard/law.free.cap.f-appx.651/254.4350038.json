Marshall\u2019s motion to file an out of time reply brief is GRANTED. Marshall argues that his commitment \u201cat hard labor\u201d in the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections (the Department) falls outside the parameters of the statutory sentencing provisions under which he was sentenced, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, and denies him a state created liberty interest in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. We affirm the dismissal of the petition as modified. <em>See Janvey v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., Inc., </em>712 F.3d 185, 193 (5th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Marshall\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition alleged that the version of Louisiana\u2019s habitual offender statute under which he was sentenced, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15:529.1(G) (1987),' did not require that enhanced sentences be served \u201cat hard labor\u201d and that the statute did not contain that condition until it was amended in 2010. Marshall reasoned pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15:824(C) that because the version of the habitual offender statute under which he was sentenced did not provide for imprisonment at hard labor, he should not have been .committed to the custody of the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">A post-trial state prisoner seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 is required to exhaust state remedies. <em>Ballard v. Maggio, </em>544 F.2d 1247, 1249 (5th Cir.1977); <em>Rome v. Kyle, </em>No. 93-5551, 1994 WL 708768, *2 (5th Cir. Nov. 30, 1994) (unpublished). Exhaustion, however, is not a jurisdictional requirement but is \u201cfounded on the more flexible principles of comity.\u201d <em>Ballard, </em>544 F.2d at 1249. The parties dispute whether Marshall followed the correct procedure under Louisiana law to exhaust his state remedies. Absent any controlling authority and because the exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional, <em>see Ballard, </em>544 F.2d at 1249, we pretermit the exhaustion issue because Marshall\u2019s \u00a7 2241 claims are mer-itless.</p>\n<p id=\"Am9\"> Marshall contends that the retroactive application of the 2010 amendment to \u00a7 15:529.1(G) violates his ex post facto rights. The Ex Post. Facto Clause is triggered only by a statute which \u201cpunishes as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after, its commission, or which deprives one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Lensing, </em>943 F.2d 9, 10-11 (5th Cir.1991) (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he construction of state laws is the exclusive responsibility of the state courts.\u201d <em>Speiser v. Randall, </em>357 U.S. 513, 522 n.7, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958); <em>see also United States v. Escalante, </em>239 F.3d 678, 680 n. 6 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">In <em>State v. Douglas, </em>72 So.3d 392, 398 (La.Ct.App.2011), the court held that while the \u201cat hard labor\u201d language was not added to the habitual offender statute until 2010, the addition of that condition did not modify the sentencing provisions of the underlying predicate offense. 72 So.3d at 398. The court stated that the sentence conditions required by \u00a7 15:529.1(G) were \u201cadditions to, rather than replacements of, those conditions required by the sentencing provision for the underlying offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence enhanced under the habitual offender statute, the court held, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>computed by reference to the underlying offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-19\">Marshall\u2019s underlying felony offense was armed robbery, and the sentencing provision for that offense provides for imprisonment \u201cat hard labor.\u201d <em>See </em>La, Rev. Stat. ANN. \u00a7 14:64(B). Because the underlying offense allowed for a sentence at hard labor, that condition was a legal component of Marshall\u2019s sentence as a habitual offender. <em>See Douglas, </em>72 So.3d at 398. Consequently, the 2010 amendment to the habitual offender statute did not increase the punishment to which Marshall was subjected or make his punishment more burdensome; therefore, the Ex Post Facto Clause was not triggered. <em>See Wilson, </em>943 F.2d at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-20\">Insofar as Marshall argues that \u00a7 15:529.1(G) (1987) created a liberty interest in his avoiding imprisonment at hard labor in the custody of the Department, that claim is also rendered meritless by <em>Douglas. </em>In order to establish a state created liberty interest, Marshall must show that his imprisonment at hard labor in the custody of the Department \u201cimposes atypical and significant hardship on [him] in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Fisher, </em>813 F.3d 216, 222-23 (5th Cir.2016) (quoting <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995)). <em>Douglas </em>holds that Marshall\u2019s imprisonment \u201cat hard labor\u201d was conditioned upon his underlying offense rather than the habitual offender statute. 72 So.3d at 398. Therefore, his imprisonment at hard labor is not an \u201catypical hardship\u201d which arose as a result of the 2010 amendment but rather was mandated by the statute of his underlying conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-21\">In light of <em>Douglas, </em>Marshall\u2019s ex post facto and due process claims are meritless. Accordingly, we modify the judgment to reflect that the \u00a7 2241 petition is dismissed with prejudice, and we affirm as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-17\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
