California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir. 2011). Washington has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-21\">During the pendency of this appeal, Washington completed the 14-month sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release and was released from custody. Because no additional term of supervised release was imposed, the instant appeal is moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>United States v. Clark, </em>193 F.3d 845, 847-48 (5th Cir. 1999). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED as moot, and counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
