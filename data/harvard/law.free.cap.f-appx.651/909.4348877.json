According to that guideline (and subject to some exceptions not relevant here), an offender\u2019s base offense level is the offense level prescribed by the drug quantity table,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-12\">except that if (A) the [offender] receives an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2 [for being a minor participant in the offense]; and (B) the base offense level under [the table] is ... (ii) level 34 or level 36, decrease by 3 levels; or (iii) level 38, decrease by 4 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5). The drug quantity table \u2014 found at \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) of the guidelines \u2014 is a table that correlates quantities of drugs with offense levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">The district courts in these consolidated appeals all applied \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5) to calculate the appellants\u2019 base offense levels. In each appellant\u2019s case, the sentencing court concluded that the drug quantity table assigned an offense level of 38. Because each appellant also received a reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2 for being a minor participant in the offense conduct, the courts calculated the appellants\u2019 base offense levels to be 34 (38 minus 4). That is exactly what \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5) required and no one contends otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">After the appellants\u2019 sentences had become final, the United States Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 782, which retroactively reduced by two levels all of the offense levels designated in the drug quantity table, which would reduce the appellants\u2019 drug quantity offense levels from 38 to 36. Based on that amendment, the appellants filed motions for reduced sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which allows a district court to reduce an otherwise final sentence if the offender was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Commission\u201d and the \u201creduction is consistent with applicable policy statements\u201d of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">Everyone agrees that the appellants are eligible for reduced sentences, since, by reducing their drug quantity table offense levels, Amendment 782 reduced their base offense levels and thereby lowered their guidelines ranges. The real question presented by the appellants\u2019 motions \u2014 and the only question on appeal' \u2014 is how much of a reduction in then* base offense levels the appellants are entitled to. In their motions, the appellants all contended that they were entitled to two-level reductions in their base offense levels. Their argument was (and is) that, because Amendment 782 purported to amend only the drug quantity table \u2014 and not \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5) \u2014 the district courts should not have reconsidered and lowered the amount of the \u201cminor participant\u201d reduction the appellants had been awarded under \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">The district courts held otherwise. They agreed with the appellants that Amendment 782 reduced their drug quantity table offense levels by two \u2014 from 38 to 36. They further determined, however, that because the appellants\u2019 amended offense levels under the drug quantity table were 36 instead of 38, they were eligible for only a three-level reduction in offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5)(B), instead of the four-level reduction they had previously received. The net effect of Amendment 782 was a one-level reduction in the appellants\u2019 base offense levels. On that basis, the district courts partially granted and partially denied the appellants\u2019 motions, sentencing them to reduced prison terms based on one-level reductions in their base offense levels and the lower guidelines ranges that resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">The district courts were right. The guidelines instruct that, in determining the extent to which a guidelines amendment warrants a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), \u201cthe court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) to the guidelines ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. Consistent with that provision, we have held that \u00a7 3582(c)(2)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-10\">gives the defendant an opportunity to receive the same sentence he would have received if the guidelines that applied at the time of his sentencing had been the same as the guidelines that applied after [a given] amendment. But he is not to receive a lower sentence than he would have received if the amendment had been in effect at the time of his sentencing. The goal is to treat a defendant sentenced before the amendment the same as those sentenced after the amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-15\">United States v. Glover, 686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir. 2012) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That principle decides these appeals. If we adopted the appellants\u2019 view, they would all end up with lower base offense levels (and presumably lower sentences) than if they had been sentenced after Amendment 782 took effect. Recall that the appellants were originally assigned base offense levels of 34. They argue that those base offense levels should be reduced by two levels (to 32) in light of Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>Had the appellants been sentenced after the Commission issued Amendment 782, however, they would not have been assigned base offense levels of 32. Instead, under \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5), their base offense levels would have been calculated by taking the 36 levels the drug quantity table assigned them and subtracting three levels (because the appellants received minor participant reductions under \u00a7 3B1.2), yielding base offense levels of 33. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5)(B)(ii). None of the appellants disputes that conclusion, which is to say that all of them implicitly concede that they are asking for lower adjusted offense levels and guidelines ranges than they would have received had Amendment 782 been in effect when they were originally sentenced. That isn\u2019t how \u00a7 3582(c)(2) works. See Glover, 686 F.3d at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-6\">. The appellants argue that our decision in Glover was abrogated by Guidelines Amendment 780. That amendment clarified only that, where an offender provides substantial assistance to the government so as to become eligible for a sentence below a statutory man-datoiy minimum, a court should not consider the mandatory minimum when ruling on the offender\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Although Amendment 780 may have affected another part of Glover, it does not call into question the part we have quoted in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
