After the State dropped the charges, he sued Furdge Turner, the police officer who swore out the arrest warrant against him!<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ovington alleged that, in applying for the warrant, Turner had lied about or failed to disclose a number of key facts, leading to issuance of an arrest warrant that was not actually supported by probable cause. The district court granted summary judgment to Turner on all of Ovington\u2019s federal and state law claims. It held that he was shielded from the federal claims by qualified immunity and from the state claims by the Georgia doctrine of official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-16\">Ovington challenges the district court\u2019s judgment on just three grounds. First, he argues that the district court improperly adopted Turner\u2019s version of certain disputed material facts. The district court did not abuse its discretion in doing so, however, because Ovington never filed a proper response to Turner\u2019s statement of undisputed facts. Northern District of Georgia Local Rule 56.1(B)(1) requires a movant for summary judgment to include with his motion and brief \u201ca separate, concise, numbered statement of the material facts to which the movant contends there is no genuine issue to be tried. Each material fact must be numbered separately and supported by a citation to evidence proving such fact.\u201d N.D. Ga. R. 56.1(B)(1). The next paragraph in the rule requires respondents to include with their responsive briefs \u201c[a] response to the mov-ant\u2019s statement of undisputed facts.\u201d Id. at R. 56.1(B)(2)(a). The rule clearly explains that the response \u201cshall contain individual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>ly numbered, concise, nonargumentative responses corresponding to each of the movant\u2019s numbered undisputed material facts.\u201d Id. at R. 56.1(B)(2)(a)(l). Ovington never filed a response to Turner\u2019s statement of undisputed facts \u2014 at least not one that conformed to the local rule\u2019s requirements. He did file a \u201cStatement of Facts as to Which a Genuine Dispute Remains,\u201d but that document did not purport to respond to Turner\u2019s statement of undisputed facts. It also did not function as the type of response the rule calls for. Its opening paragraph is argumentative and none of its paragraphs corresponds to Turner\u2019s numbered undisputed facts. Turner noted the problem in his reply brief, but Ovington never sought leave from the district court to fix it.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Ovington\u2019s failure to comply with the rule\u2019s unambiguous requirements is not an unimportant defect. Rule 56.1(B) \u201cis designed to help the court identify and organize the issues in the case.\u201d Mann v. Taser Int\u2019l, Inc., 588 F.3d 1291, 1303 (11th Cir. 2009) (citing Reese v. Herbert, 527 F.3d 1253, 1268 (11th Cir. 2008)). Noncompliance hampers the court\u2019s handling of the case and adds to the court\u2019s already substantial workload. That is why the rule imposes consequences on parties who fail to comply with its terms. Specifically, it requires a district court to \u201cdeem each of the movant\u2019s facts as admitted\u201d unless the response: N.D. Ga. R. 56.1(B)(2)(a)(2). The district court reasonably concluded that Ovington\u2019s response failed to do those things. Accordingly, it acted well within its discretion when it deemed admitted the admissible facts set out in Turner\u2019s statement of undisputed facts. See Clark v. Housing Auth. of Alma, 971 F.2d 723, 727 (11th Cir. 1992) (noting that district courts get \u201cgreat deference\u201d in interpreting their local rules).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-6\">(i) directly refutes the movant\u2019s fact with concise responses supported by specific evidence (including page or paragraph number); (ii) states a valid objection to the admissibility of the movant\u2019s fact; or (iii) points out that the movant\u2019s citation does not support the movant\u2019s fact or that the movant\u2019s fact is not material or otherwise has failed to comply with the provisions set out in [Local Rule 66.1B(1) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">The next issue before us is whether, in light of the undisputed facts before it, the district court properly granted Turner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, based on qualified immunity, on Ovington\u2019s federal law claims. Qualified immunity covers a police officer\u2019s action in swearing out an arrest warrant so long as the officer had \u201carguable probable cause\u201d to arrest the subject of the warrant. Madiwale v. Savaiko, 117 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir. 1997). Arguable probable cause exists whenever any reasonable officer \u201cin the same circumstances and possessing the same knowledge as the [defendant police officer] could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest [the plaintiff arrestee].\u201d Von Stein v. Brescher, 904 F.2d 572, 579 (11th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">Turner had arguable probable cause to arrest Ovington. A tipster informed police that the subject of a photo from the robbery looked like a former employee of the Subway restaurant on Piedmont Road in Atlanta \u2014 where Ovington used to work. An employee at that Subway told Turner that the subject of the photo looked like Oving-ton, and another employee there agreed that the photo \u201cfavored\u201d Ovington. From those facts, taken together, a reasonable police officer could have believed he had probable cause to arrest Ovington.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">Ovington\u2019s arguments to the contrary either misrepresent the record or misinterpret the law. He contends, for example, that Turner repeatedly lied in his warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>application about what the Piedmont Road Subway employees had told him. But Turner\u2019s warrant application did not include any representations about anyone having told him anything. The application merely described the robbery and stated that \u201cto the best of [Turner\u2019s] knowledge and belief, Peyton John Ovington\u201d was the one who had perpetrated it. Whatever the application\u2019s other shortcomings, it did not include lies about what people told Turner. That fact, among others, distinguishes this case from Kingsland v. City of Miami, 382 F.3d 1220 (11th Cir. 2004), on which Ovington relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Ovington also suggests that \u201c[t]he law holds that a person\u2019s build is insufficient for identification to establish probable cause for an arrest,\u201d but the Ninth Circuit case he cites for that proposition \u2014 United States v. Ricardo D., 912 F.2d 337 (9th Cir. 1990) \u2014 is plainly distinguishable from this one. In Ricardo D., witnesses told sheriffs deputies in Sierra Vista, Arizona to be on the lookout for a Mexican man who was \u201cyoung,\u201d \u201cthin,\u201d and \u201cnot too tall.\u201d Id. at 342. The Ninth Circuit decided that the witnesses\u2019 generic descriptions did not support probable cause to arrest the defendant in the case since, \u201c[i]n a location only thirty miles from the Mexican border, it can hardly be said that the presence of a young, Mexican male is highly unusual.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The evidence against Ovington was patently stronger than the evidence in the Ricardo D. case. In this case, three people were separately shown the photo of the robber. Even though the photo did not show his face (he was wearing a mask), it revealed a lot about him beyond just his height and weight. It showed a tattoo on his upper left arm (Ovington has a tattoo there as well); the shoes, hat, and clothing he was wearing; his posture; the width of his shoulders \u2014 the sorts of specific details that could help support an identification but that were entirely absent in Ricardo D. Having observed those details, all three people agreed that the subject of the photo looked like Ovington. There is simply no comparison between that kind of evidence and what the deputies relied on in Ricardo D.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Ovington emphasizes that, although three people separately told police that the subject of the photo looked like him, none of them was completely certain about it. Complete certainty, however, is not the standard in qualified immunity cases like this one. Arguable probable cause is. See Kingsland, 382 F.3d at 1232. And arguabl\u00e9 probable cause is a standard lower than probable cause, see Knight v. Jacobson, 300 F.3d 1272, 1274 (11th Cir. 2002), which itself requires only a \u201creasonable probability and not certainty.\u201d Craig v. Singletary, 127 F.3d 1030, 1042 (11th Cir. 1997). We reject Ovington\u2019s arguments to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">The only remaining issue is whether the district court erred in holding that Georgia\u2019s doctrine of official immunity shielded Turner from Ovington\u2019s state law claims. Because Turner\u2019s actions were discretionary and within the scope of his official authority, he is entitled to official immunity unless Ovington shows that Turner acted with actual malice or intent to injure. See Cameron v. Lang, 274 Ga. 122, 549 S.E.2d 341, 345 (2001). Ovington has made no such showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-12\">. Ovington also sued Atlanta Investment Group, Inc. and the City of Atlanta. His claims against those defendants are not before us and so we say no more about them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
