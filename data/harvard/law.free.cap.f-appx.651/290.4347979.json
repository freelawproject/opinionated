On appeal, Solis argues that because the district court failed to include his proposed definition of \u201cwillfully\u201d in the jury charge, the charge did not require that the jury find he acted with knowledge that his conduct violated the law; thus, the jury did not have to find one of'the elements of a \u00a7 1001(a) offense to convict him. The parties dispute wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>er the applicable standard of review is de novo or for abuse of discretion. As Solis\u2019s argument fails regardless of the standard used, we need not deeide the question. <em>See United States v. Crawley, </em>463 Fed.Appx. 418, 420 n. 1 (5th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The district court gave this Circuit\u2019s pattern instruction, which stated that the term \u201cwillfully\u201d has historically meant \u201cthat the act was committed voluntarily and purposely, with the specific intent to do something the law forbids; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.\u201d Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal) \u00a7 1.38 (2012). The pattern instruction also tracks the statutory language. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1001(a). We have found that where the jury instruction given mirrored our pattern instruction and tracked the statutory language, the district court did not err by giving the instruction. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>740 F.3d 956, 965 (5th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Furthermore, the Supreme Court has stated that in general, \u201cwhen used in the criminal context, a \u2018willful\u2019 act is one undertaken with a \u2018bad purpose.\u2019 In other words, in order to establish a \u2018willful\u2019 violation of a statute, \u2018the Government must prove that the defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.\u2019\u201d <em>Bryan v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 184, 191-92, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998). Thus, an act undertaken with a \u201cbad purpose\u201d and an act committed \u201cwith knowledge that [the] conduct was unlawful\u201d are two different ways of formulating the same intent requirement. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Consistent with <em>Bryan, </em>the instruction given by the district court required a jury finding that Solis acted with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law. While Solis\u2019s proposed addition is correct, \u201c[t]he District Court may properly decline to give a requested instruction which ... is stated elsewhere in the instructions.\u201d <em>United States v. Neal, </em>951 F.2d 630, 633 (5th Cir. 1992). Solis was entitled to, and received, a jury instruction which accurately reflected the law and the issues. <em>See United States v. Montgomery, </em>747 F.3d 303, 310 (5th Cir. 2014); <em>Bryan, </em>524 U.S. at 191-92, 118 S.Ct. 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
