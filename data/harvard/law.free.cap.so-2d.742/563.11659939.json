Accordingly, relator\u2019s sentence is vacated and this case is remanded to the trial court for resentencing in accord with the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-17\">In accordance with the supreme court\u2019s order, the trial court held a hearing to resentence the defendant. As stated in this Court\u2019s previous ruling dated April 15, 1994 (see attachment), the trial court was aware that it had the authority to suspend the defendant\u2019s sentence or place the defendant on probation when he was sentenced on January 11, 1985 based on the hearing transcript. After a hearing, the trial court knowingly chose to impose the life sentence, which was authorized. However, we note that the record in this case is incomplete and we cannot determine whether the defendant was resentenced with or without benefits of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. At the time of this offense, La. R.S. 40:966(B)(1) did not prohibit benefits for offenders sentenced to life laimprisonment. Regardless, the trial court had no authority to revoke the defendant\u2019s sentence or to suspend defendant\u2019s sentence and place the defendant on active probation on October 14, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-20\">Accordingly, the ruling of the trial court dated October 14, 1998 relative to the defendant\u2019s sentence is reversed, and the previous sentence dated January 11, 1985 is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-21\">WRIT GRANTED; RELIEF GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-22\">BYRNES, J., concurs with reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-23\">JONES, J., dissents with reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-24\">| ATTACHMENT</p>\n<judges id=\"b595-25\">Before LANDRIEU, LOBRANO and PLOTKIN, JJ.</judges>\n<p id=\"b595-26\">\n<em>WRIT GRANTED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-27\">Relator\u2019s application for supervisory writs is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-28\">The defendant\u2019s sentence imposed on January 11, 1985 was not illegal. It has become executory and the time period during which defendant could have applied for post-conviction relief on the grounds alleged has expired. Moreover, on the merits, it is apparent from the sentencing transcript, dated January 11, 1985, that the trial court was aware of its authority to suspend defendant\u2019s sentence or place defendant on probation. The trial court knowingly chose, instead, to impose a sentence of life in prison which was authorized at that time by statute. Therefore, the trial court how has no authority to revoke defendant\u2019s sentence nor to suspend any portion thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-29\">We assume the trial court judgment inadvertently mentions commutation of sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>tence, but we note for the record that commutation is a power of the Executive Branch and not of the Judicial Branch of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The judgment of the trial court dated March 16, 1994 relative to the defendant\u2019s sentence is reversed and the previous sentence dated January 11, 1985 is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">New Orleans, Louisiana this 15th day of April, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">JUDGE MOON LANDRIEU</p>\n<p id=\"AL6\">JUDGE ROBERT L.

BYRNES, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Atj\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">I concur in the re-imposition of the defendant\u2019s life sentence for distribution of heroin. The trial court considered that the defendant\u2019s sentence could be suspended and the defendant could be placed the defendant on probation; however, the trial court sentenced the defendant to life imprisonment on January 11, 1985. The defendant\u2019s sentence was final and could not be amended after the defendant began serving his sentence because it was a felony offense, which was to be served at hard labor. The trial court did not have the authority to amend the defendant\u2019s sentence once the defendant began serving his properly-imposed felony sentence at hard labor. La.C.Cr.P. art. 881; <em>State v. Neville, </em>95-0547 (La.App. 4 Cir. 5/16/95), 655 So.2d 785, <em>writ denied, </em>95-1521 (La.9/29/95), 660 So.2d 851.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b596-10\"><em>II </em>JONES, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AH8T\">dissenting with reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">I respectfully dissent from the majority on the basis that the 1977 sentencing judge and the 1985 sentencing judge, sentenced the defendant to life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence. The language <em>without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence </em>made the sentence illegal. <em>See </em>La. R.S. 40:966(B)(1) as <em>amended by Acts </em>1973, No. 207\u00a7 3; <em>See also State v. Sullivan, </em>359 So.2d 186 (La.1978); and <em>State v. Domino, </em>360 So.2d 194 (La.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">However, the sentencing judge in the case sub judice attempted to correct these sentences by amending them to include eligibility for probation and suspension of sentence. Thus, I find no error by the sentencing court in the instant matter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
