The trial court distinguished between those employees that were involuntarily terminated, granting them relief, and dismissed the claims of the remaining nine former employees who left the school system voluntarily. From this judgment, the nine dismissed claimants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">Twelve Plaintiffs were employed by the Vermilion Parish School Board, hereinafter \u201cDefendant,\u201d as twelve month employees subject to an annual leave policy, File CGPI, which was adopted on January 9, 1992. From the lower court\u2019s judgment dismissing their claims for reimbursement of accrued, unused vacation time, nine employees, Irma Ball, Louis Boudreaux, Thomas Harris, Mildred Haynes, ^Stanislaus Kasperski, Michelle Labit, Carlene 0. LeMaire, Johnny Picard and Velton Vincent, hereinafter \u201cPlaintiffs,\u201d bring this appeal. Plaintiffs assert Defendant has improperly deprived them of their vested interests in unused, accrued vacation time under La.R.S. 23:631, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">Defendant\u2019s annual leave policy does not address how unused, accrued annual leave (vacation) is handled when an employee is terminated or voluntarily leaves. Nevertheless, Defendant produced evidence in the form of testimony from three of its administrative employees indicating that it was a general practice to encourage employees to use up vacation time before separation or retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-16\">\n<em>LAW AND ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AM8\">I. Accrued Vacation</p>\n<p id=\"b622-17\">La.R.S. 23:631 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-18\">A. (l)(b) Upon the resignation of any laborer or other employee of any kind whatever, it shall be the duty of the person employing such laborer or other employee to pay the amount then due under the terms of employment, whether the employment is by the hour, day, week, or month, on or before the next regular pay day or no later than fifteen days following'the date of resignation, whichever occurs first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQY-\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-19\">D. (1) For purposes of this Section, vacation pay will be considered an amount then due only if, in accordance with the stated vacation policy of the person employing such laborer or other employee, both of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-20\">(a) The laborer or other employee is deemed eligible for and has accrued the right to take vacation time with pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-21\">(b) The laborer or other employee has not taken or been compensated for the vacation time as of the date of the discharge or resignation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>(2) The provisions of this Subsection shall not be interpreted to allow the forfeiture of any vacation pay actually earned by an employee pursuant to the employer\u2019s policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAsd\">^Additionally, La.R.S. 23:634 strictly forbids an employer from requiring an employee to, by contract, forfeit wages upon termination, to wit, section (A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcAB\">No person, acting either for himself or as agent or otherwise, shall require any of his employees to sign contracts by which the employees shall forfeit their wages if discharged before the contract is completed or if the employees resign their employment before the contract is completed; but in all such cases the employees shall be entitled to the wages actually earned up to the time of their discharge or resignation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Our focus of review considers when does vacation pay become an \u201camount due under the terms of employment\u201d or \u201cwages\u201d and when is vacation \u201cactually earned\u201d or vested within the meaning of La.R.S. 23:631 and La.R.S. 23:634. In his Reasons for Ruling, the trial judge cited <em>Beard v. Summit Institute, </em>97-1784 (La.3/4/98); 707 So.2d 1233, and language therein indicating that the essence of what brings accrued vacation time wages within the meaning of La.R.S. 23:634 is consideration, that is, \u201cwhen an employer agrees to pay employees for unused vacation time as a condition of their employment....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1235. The trial judge emphasized that \u201c[i]n this case, no evidence was presented to prove that the school board ever agreed to pay for accrued but unused vacation time.\u201d The trial judge explained that \u201cdefendant never agreed to pay for accrued but unused vacation time, and under the <em>Beard </em>case, this is not in contravention of the plaintiffs rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We acknowledge that the jurisprudence is replete with the general statement, \u201c[vjacation pay is considered to be wages for purposes of LSA-R.S. 23:631.\u201d <em>Draughn v. Mart, </em>411 So.2d 1188 (La.App. 4 Cir.1982), <em>writ denied, </em>415 So.2d 944 (La.1982); <em>Baudoin v. Vermilion Parish School Bd., </em>96-1604 (La.App. 3 Cir. 4/2/97), 692 So.2d 1316, <em>writ denied, </em>97-1169 (La.6/20/97), 695 So.2d 1358; <em>Barrilleaux v. Franklin Found. Hosp., </em>96-343 (La.App. 1 Cir. 11/8/96), 683 So.2d 348, <em>writ denied, </em>96-2885 (La.1/24/97), 686 So.2d 864; <em>Macrellis v. Southwest La. Indep. Ctr., </em>|494-1155 (La.App. 3 Cir. 5/3/95), 657 So.2d 135. Nevertheless, jurisprudence delimiting the phrases \u201camount then due under the terms of employment\u201d or \u201cwages\u201d and \u201cvacation actually earned\u201d within the meaning of La.R.S. 23:631 <em>et seq. </em>has been sparse. A review of the jurisprudence illuminates the principles and policy concerns behind these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In <em>Huddleston v. Dillard Dept. Stores, Inc., </em>94-53 (La.App. 5 Cir. 5/31/94); 638 So.2d 383, the court found that where an employer has a clearly established policy that vacation time is not considered wages for the purposes of La.R.S. 23:631(D)(2), an employee is not entitled to reimbursement for unused, accrued vacation time. In <em>Huddleston, </em>the employee handbook clearly stated that vacation is a benefit and not an earned wage and that vacation pay is not available to employees terminated for cause. So, for our purposes, vacation pay under the policy in <em>Huddleston </em>would not fall under the category of something \u201cactually earned by an employee pursuant to the employer\u2019s policy\u201d under La.R.S. 23:631 D(2). The <em>Huddleston </em>court recognized that unless otherwise provided, earned vacation is a wage. <em>Id., citing Howser v. Carruth Mortg. Corp., </em>476 So.2d 830 (La.App. 5 Cir.1985), <em>Landry v. Pauli\u2019s Inc., </em>496 So.2d 431 (La.App. 5 Cir.1986), <em>writ denied, </em>500 So.2d 428 (La.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">In <em>Landry, </em>the court referenced <em>Howser v. Carruth Mortg., </em>to award the claimant reimbursement for unused vacation time where the employer\u2019s policy was poorly defined and where the evidence indicated that it was generally accepted that an employee would get ten vacation days per year. In <em>Howser, </em>the reviewing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>stated that vacation time is considered wages for the purposes of La.R.S. 23:631 and, discussing the employment contract, noted the \u201cILOIP merely provides that time off is at the discretion of the originator; no time limits are set.\u201d <em>Id., </em>476 So.2d at 836. The court then, without further analysis, affirmed the trial judge\u2019s denial of compensation | \u00f1of unused vacation time based on the defendant employer\u2019s explanation that an unwritten policy prohibited compensation to employees for vacation time not taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">In <em>Lee v. Katz and Bestoff, Inc., </em>479 So.2d 459, 460 (La.App. 1 Cir.1985), the vacation policy provided: \u201cUnused vacation is forfeited upon separation of employment or notice of intent to terminate employment. No vacation days will be carried over to the following year.\u201d In <em>Lee, </em>the reviewing court refused to grant summary judgment, emphasizing vacation pay is considered wages under La.R.S. 23:631 and that La.R.S. 23:634 renders any contract forfeiting wages upon discharge unlawful. The <em>Lee </em>court further observed that the employee handbook fell \u201cwithin the concept of a \u2018standard contract\u2019 or \u2018contract of adhesion,\u2019 \u201d and noted that \u201csuch a contract is \u2018usually ... prepared by a party of superior bargaining power for adherence or rejection of the weaker party.\u2019 Comment (c) under La. C.C. art. 2056 (1984).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460. La. Civ. Code art. 2056, entitled \u201cStandard-form contracts,\u201d provides, in pertinent part, \u201c[a] contract executed in a standard form of one party must be interpreted, in case of doubt, in favor of. the other party.\u201d The contract in the. matter <em>sub judice </em>is not unclear; it simply does not address the problem of accrued, unused vacation time. However, we note the policy concerns discussed in Comment (c) to Article 2056 resonate throughout La.R.S. 23:634 which forbids an employer\u2019s, requiring an employee to contract out of earned wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In <em>Morse v. J. Ray McDermott &amp; Co., Inc., </em>344 So.2d 1353 (La.1976), the Supreme Court held that a forfeiture clause in the employer\u2019s profit-sharing plan was manifestly unjust where the employer\u2019s unilateral act, discharging the employee without cause, prevented fulfillment of the condition required for the employee\u2019s rights to vest in the benefits. The <em>Morse </em>case involved delayed compensation that was denied an employee after he was terminated without cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">|6In <em>Blankenship v. Southern Beverage Co., </em>520 So.2d 440, 442 (La.App. 1 Cir.1988), <em>writ dismissed, </em>522 So.2d 574 (La.1988), the employer decided to withhold vacation compensation to an employee who quit suddenly; the employer, in the absence of a written policy, sought to exercise a case-by-case discretionary policy regarding vacation time. The court in <em>Blankenship </em>noted, \u201c[sjince plaintiff had clearly earned two weeks paid vacation upon completing one year of employment with defendant, which was well prior to his resignation, defendant\u2019s refusal to pay him for this benefit amounted to an impermissible forfeiture of earned wages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In <em>Berteau v. Wiener Corp., </em>362 So.2d 806 (La.App. 4 Cir.1978), <em>writ denied, </em>365 So.2d 242 (La.1978), the defendant argued that its policy prohibited payment of benefits to non-employees. Finding the policy vague and not directly addressing the issue, along with the fact that many others were unaware of the asserted policy, the court found that the plaintiffs rights had vested when she finished the year and when she requested compensation for the vacation time. After finding the plaintiffs rights vested, the <em>Berteau </em>court noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">A vested right is defined as that case when \u201cthe right to enjoyment, present or prospective, has become the property of some particular person or persons as a present interest. The right must be absolute, complete and- unconditional, independent of a contingency, and a mere expectancy of future benefit ... does not constitute a vested right.\u201d <em>Tennant </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>v. Russell, </em>214 La. 1046, 39 So.2d 726 (1949).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 808, 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">\u201cOnce an employee\u2019s right to vacation benefits has vested, an employer cannot force forfeiture of this earned right.\u201d <em>Barrilleaux v. Franklin Foundation Hosp., </em>96-0343 (La.App. 1 Cir. 11/8/96); 683 So.2d 348, 353, <em>citing Blankenship, </em>520 So.2d at 441; <em>Lee, </em>479 So.2d at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In <em>Macrellis, </em>657 So.2d at 137, the court held the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">Under the terms of SLIC\u2019s manual, annual leave was accumulated on the basis of the years of employment and was earned even during the | ./probationary period. However, it could be used only after the employee had completed probation, attained regular full-time status, and been employed by the agency for one year. Although the right to enjoy the annual leave was prospective, it became the property of the employee as it was earned during the first year of employment. Thus, the earned annual leave was an \u201camount then due\u201d under La.R.S. 23:631(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">In <em>Baudoin, </em>an employer, the present Defendant in an earlier suit, changed its policy to require the plaintiff to forfeit vacation time. The court held that an employer could not change a policy so as to deprive an employee of vacation time already earned, reasoning, \u201c[ujnder the provisions of LSA-R.S. 23:631 a resigning or discharged employee is entitled to recover vacation pay accruing prior to his discharge unless the employer\u2019s established policy precludes compensation for unused vacation days.\u201d (Citation omitted), <em>Id., </em>692 So.2d at 1318, <em>quoting Landry </em>at 432-433. This reasoning suggests there should exist a presumption in favor of reimbursement of an employee\u2019s accrued, unused vacation time, which appears to be the import of both La.R.S. 23:631 and La. R.S. 23:634. This court in <em>Baudoin </em>found no clear or consistent policy addressing compensation of unused annual leave and found that if the unwritten policies asserted by the school board were in effect, they would be in contravention of the plaintiffs rights under <em>Knecht v. Bd. of Trustees for State Colleges and Univ. and Northwestern State Univ.,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>591 So.2d 690 (La.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">Finally, we consider the learned words of Justice Tate in footnote 10 of <em>Morse v. J. Ray McDermott &amp; Co., Inc., </em>344 So.2d 1353, 1359 (La.1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-13\">The courts of this state have noted that forfeitures of wages are not favored under our law. See <em>Knight v. Oden, </em>282 So.2d 612 (La.App. 1st Cir.1973); <em>United Shoe Stores Co. Inc. v. Dryer, </em>16 La.App. 605, 135 So. 50 (2nd Cir.1931). We do not believe adoption in 1966 of Act 536 (LSA-R.S. 23:640) expressly including pensions and other fringe benefits payable under collective bargaining agreements was intended to have the effect of excluding other fringe benefits from the definition 1 sof \u201cwages.\u201d Passage of the act is indicative of the legislature\u2019s responsiveness to the concerns of labor interests that fringe benefits <em>might </em>not be considered \u201cwages.\u201d If anything, it indicates that the legislature does consider fringe benefits wages within the meaning of La.R.S. 23:634.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">(Emphasis Added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">In the matter under review, Defendant relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision which considered compensation for an employee\u2019s unused vacation, <em>Beard, </em>707 So.2d 1233, and argues that an employer owes reimbursement for unused vacation time to an employee only where such is part of the employee's consideration for the job. In <em>Beard, </em>the defendant had in place a policy which provided for the compensation of unused vacation time, but the policy contained an exception requiring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>forfeiture of all accrued benefits if an employee quit without cause or voluntarily resigned without notice. The <em>Beard </em>claimant sought reimbursement of accrued vacation pay, and the defendant refused, claiming that she abandoned her position and therefore forfeited her right to her accrued benefits. Noting that where the policy provided for the compensation of unused vacation time, such compensation is considered \u201cwages\u201d within meaning of La.R.S. 23:634, the court found that the policy violated La.R.S. 23:634 to the extent it required the forfeiture of the earned wages, that is, unused vacation time. The court ultimately held, \u201c[w]hen an employer agrees to pay employees for unused vacation time as a condition of their employment, that accrued vacation pay is compensation that is earned during a pay period under <em>Boudreaux.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As such, accrued vacation time is an \u2018amount then due under the terms of employment\u2019 and constitutes wages under La. R.S. 23:631.\u201d <em>Beard </em>707 So.2d at 1235. The <em>Beard </em>court further explained, \u201cclearly if an employer may not require an employee to sign a contract providing for forfeiture of wages upon termination or | flresignation, an employer cannot require an employee to forfeit wages simply by enacting a policy to that effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This reasoning readily reflects the concepts of La.R.S. 23:634.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Both parties propound arguments under <em>Beard. </em>Defendant\u2019s argument essentially asserts that an employer owes an employee compensation for unused vacation only if the employer agrees to such. This rationale supplies a presumption in favor of an employer in that, without an agreement otherwise, an employer does not owe an employee anything since an employee has no vested rights in unused vacation time. This rationale might ring true as long as the benefits are not \u201can amount then due under the terms of employment\u201d or \u201cwages\u201d which La.R.S. 23:631 <em>et seq. </em>protects from forfeiture. However, we can not ignore the overwhelming jurisprudential consensus that unused, annual leave is part of an employee\u2019s \u201cwages.\u201d More importantly, the <em>Beard </em>decision overturned the Second Circuit\u2019s holding that an employer\u2019s wage forfeiture policy may be permissible where it penalizes an employee\u2019s voluntary act of quitting a job without notice to the employer. <em>See Beard v. Summit Inst. of Pulmonary Med., </em>29,603 (La.App. 2 Cir. 6/18/97); 697 So.2d 621. That is, the Supreme Court overruled the same rationale used by the trial court in the present matter which awarded compensation only to those employees involuntarily terminated by Defendant and in effect, penalized those employees who quit voluntarily by depriving them of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Plaintiffs also set forth their argument under <em>Beard, </em>707 So.2d 1233, along with <em>Winkle v. Advance Prod. &amp; Sys. Inc., </em>98-694 (La.App. 3 Cir. 10/28/98); 721 So.2d 983, and contend their vacation time is an earned, vested right under La.R.S. 23:631 which was inappropriately divested by virtue of an impermissible policy under La. R.S. 23:634. <em>Winkle </em>involved an employee, who upon termination, requested payment for unused vacation time. The employer in <em>Winkle </em>refused such | ^reimbursement, arguing that it had in place a policy, albeit unwritten, that precluded post-termination reimbursement for unused vacation time. This court found that the plaintiffs vacation time was an \u201c \u2018amount then due under the terms of employment\u2019 and constitutes wages under La.R.S. 23:631.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 986, <em>quoting Beard, </em>707 So.2d at 1235. Additionally, we found in <em>Winkle </em>that the plaintiffs rights \u201caccrued\u201d or vested when she fulfilled the condition set forth in the vacation policy of completing the allotted time of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs did not expect to be reimbursed for their unused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>vacation time until approached by the successful attorney who represented the <em>Baudoin </em>plaintiff. Defendant presented testimony at trial evidencing that while not a written practice, it was an administrative practice to enforce a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d policy. The record indicates that Daniel R. Dartez, Superintendent of the Vermilion Parish School Board, Clifford Alleman, Jr., the Assistant Superintendent in charge of Administration and Personnel, and Theresa Dubois, payroll accountant for Defendant, all testified the administrative policy required an employee's to use annual leave while employed or lose it. Dartez testified that the policy was in place before he became Superintendent and that there was an 1983 policy authorized by the Board that required the forfeiture of any vacation days over thirty. Dartez noted, in 1992, the 1983 policy was written out by the Board and was expanded to be cumulative. Dartez acknowledged that the Board\u2019s current policy contains no language requiring the forfeiture of annual leave. Alleman explained that when an employee wants to retire, \u201cwe normally extend the retirement the number of days of annual leave days that the person has accumulated on the books, so that, in effect, they will use up all of their retirement leave when they leave the system.\u201d Alle-man testified that the Board has 1,200 employees in Vermilion Parish and that he has not spoken with most of these people about what happens to unused annual leave upon retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">|11 We find, however, even if Plaintiffs had no previous expectation of reimbursement, that alone does not divest Plaintiffs of rights vested by virtue of their completed work time. Defendant\u2019s annual leave policy, File CGPI, for \u201cTwelve Month Management Personnel\u201d is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">Annual leave shall be granted to all twelve-month full-time employees. Twelve (12) month employees will accumulate annual leave as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">(a)Less than three (3) years of continuous service, at the rate of (1) day per month for a total of twelve (12) days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">(b) Three (3) years but less than ten (10) years of continuous service at a rate of one and one-fourth (1%) days per month for a total of 15 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">(c) Ten (10) or more years of continuous service at a rate of one and one-half (lj\u00e9) days per month for a total of 18 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Zu\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">No annual leave may be taken without prior approval by the Superintendent. No employee may take annual leave exceeding 18 consecutive work days. No employee may take annual leave in excess of 40 work days in any school year, provided, however, that any employee who has accumulated more than 100 days of annual leave may take a maximum of 50 working days of annual leave during any school year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-13\">In the event of the development of catastrophic illness an employee may exceed the annual leave limitations provided that the medical condition is supported by appropriate medical documentation and approved by the Superintendent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">While the policy makes no provisions that require the forfeiture of unused annual vacation it does provide that unused leave may be carried over from one year to the next, given the forty day maximum for leave that may be taken in any year. Additionally, leave is based on years of continuous service and determined by a monthly calculation which suggests that leave is earned, therefore vested, at the completion of each month. As such, we find that where an employment policy provides for the accrual of vacation time upon the completion of a specified amount of work, the policies against forfeiture of wages dictate that an employee\u2019s rights vest hgonce the condition precedent, the allotment of work, is completed. We now hold that in the absence of a clear, written policy establishing that vacation time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>granted by an employer to an employee is nothing more than a mere gratuity and not to be considered an amount due or a wage, accrued but unused vacation time is a vested right for which an employee must be compensated upon discharge or resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><em>Rosell v. ESCO, </em>549 So.2d 840, 844 (La.1989), provides the standard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">It is well settled that a court of appeal may not set aside a trial court\u2019s or a jury\u2019s finding of fact in the absence of \u201cmanifest error\u201d or unless it is \u201cclearly wrong,\u201d and where there is conflict in the testimony, reasonable evaluations of credibility and reasonable inferences of fact should not be disturbed upon review, even though the appellate court may feel that its own evaluations and inferences are as reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Presently, in light of the long line of jurisprudence deeming vacation time an \u201camount then due under the terms of employment\u201d or \u201cwages\u201d within the meaning of La.R.S. 23:631 and La.R.S. 23:634 respectively, and with a view for the disfavor surrounding wage forfeiture under our law, we find the lower court manifestly erred when it failed to find Plaintiffs had a vested right in their accrued, unused vacation time, despite their voluntary resignation. We find Plaintiffs\u2019 rights in vacation time vested upon completion of each month interval of employment, pursuant to Defendant\u2019s annual leave policy, File CGPI.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">II. Penalties</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">La.R.S. 23:632 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">Any employer who fails or refuses to comply with the provisions of R.S. 23:631 shall be liable to the employee either for ninety days wages at the employee\u2019s daily rate of pay, or else for full wages from the time the employee\u2019s demand for payment is made until the employer shall pay or tender the amount of unpaid wages due to such employee, whichever is the lesser amount of penalty wages. Reasonable attorney fees shall be allowed the laborer. Any employer who fails or refuses to comply with the provisions of R.S. 23:681 shall be liable to the employee either for ninety days wages at the employee\u2019s daily rate of pay, or else for full wages from the time the employee\u2019s demand for 1^payment is made until the employer shall pay or tender the amount of unpaid wages due to such employee, whichever is the lesser amount of penalty wages. Reasonable attorney fees shall be allowed the laborer or employee by the court which shall be taxed as costs to be paid by the employer, in the event a well-founded suit for any unpaid wages whatsoever be filed by the laborer or employee after three days shall have elapsed from time of making the first demand following discharge or resignation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">La.R.S. 23:632 is a penal statute which much be strictly construed. <em>Brown v. Navarre Chevrolet, Inc., </em>610 So.2d 165 (La.App. 3 Cir.1992). \u201cIn order to recover penalty wages, the employer must be found to have acted in bad faith or in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner, and penalty wages are not to be absolutely imposed when there is an equitable defense.\u201d <em>Macrellis, </em>657 So.2d at 138. The trial judge ruled in favor of three employees that were involuntarily terminated, awarding reimbursement of their accrued, unused vacation time, attorney fees and penalty wages. We now award the same to the remaining nine Plaintiffs, including Stan Kasperski and Velton Vincent upon the trial court\u2019s finding their claims have not prescribed. (See Decree.)</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">III. Defendant\u2019s Answer</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">In its answer to Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, Defendant seeks to appeal the judgment of the trial court, arising out of the same matter as the present appeal, which ruled in favor of Clarence Suire, Paul C. Bou-dreaux and Marcedell Joiner. La. Code Civ.P. art. 2133 allows an appellee to seeks modification, revision or reversal of a judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ment rendered in favor of the appellant in the answer. La.Code Civ.P. art 2133(A) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe answer filed by the appellee shall be equivalent to an appeal on his part from any portion of the judgment rendered against him in favor of the appellant and of which he complains in his answer.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Suire, Boudreaux and Joiner, however, are not parties to the appeal brought by Plaintiff; Defendant cannot circumvent the statutory delays within which an appeal may be 114brought on behalf of Suire, Boudreaux and Joiner by simply inserting these parties via an answer. <em>Shelton v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>334 So.2d 406 (La.1976). Furthermore, as Defendant failed to brief the issues brought in its answer, pursuant to the Uniform Rules\u2014 Courts of Appeal 2-12.4, they are considered abandoned. Accordingly, we find the assignments of error set forth in Defendant\u2019s answer not properly brought before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\n<em>DECREE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">As an initial matter, where earlier the trial court found the exception moot and declined to consider it, upon remand we order the lower court to rule <em>on </em>Defendant\u2019s exception of prescription as to the claims of Stan Kasperski and Velton Vincent. We award to Plaintiffs $5,000.00 in attorney\u2019s fees, reimbursement of each Plaintiffs determined unused, accrued vacation time and penalty wages in accordance with La.R.S. 23:632, together with legal interest thereon; accordingly, we remand this matter for determination and calculation of vacation time and penalty wages owed to Irma Ball, Louis Bou-dreaux, Thomas Harris, Mildred Haynes, Michelle Labit, Carlene O. LeMaire, Johnny Picard, and also to Stan Kasperski and Velton Vincent if their claims are found timely. Costs to be paid by Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\">. In <em>Knecht, </em>the defendants tried to abolish a contractual policy which retroactively divested its employees of remuneration for overtime worked. The <em>Knecht </em>court held that the employees had a vested property right interest in the accrued compensatory time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-5\">. <em>Boudreaux v.
