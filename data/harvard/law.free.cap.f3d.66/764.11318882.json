Arnica moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that, as a matter of law, Cicciarella was not a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the policy in question. The district court concluded that no genuine issues of material fact existed and that, as a matter of law, Cicciarella was not a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the policy. On appeal, Cicciarella urges that genuine issues of material fact exist, making summary judgment inappropriate. As we agree with Cic-ciarella, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"AqAF\">A <em>The Dwellings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Doctor and Mr. Halloran own a single-family dwelling<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Houston, Texas, in which they spend a majority of their time each year (Houston Dwelling). The Hallorans also own a single-family dwelling in Brooklyn, New York (Brooklyn Dwelling) in which Cicciarel-la, Dr. Halloran\u2019s mother, lives year-round. For the past 16 years, the Hallorans have spent a total of approximately 60 days a year in the Brooklyn Dwelling. Thus, the Hallo-rans and Cicciarella spend about 60 days a year under the same roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Both the Hallorans and Cicciarella have their own separate rooms in the Brooklyn Dwelling. The Hallorans maintain year-round wardrobes at the Brooklyn Dwelling, pay all utility bills and repair costs for the Brooklyn Dwelling, and support Cicciarella financially: She pays no rent and is, for federal income tax purposes, a dependent of the Hallorans. When the Hallorans are not in Brooklyn, Dr. Halloran speaks with Cic-ciarella by telephone one to three times each day.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">B. <em>The Accident</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">On September 1, 1991, Arnica re-issued a policy of automobile insurance (Policy) to the Hallorans. On April 11, 1992, the Hallorans traveled to Brooklyn to attend a medical seminar. On the following day \u2014 while the Policy was still in full force and effect, with all premiums thereon paid in full \u2014 the Hallo-rans and Cicciarella were injured in an automobile accident: The rental ear in which they were riding was struck by a vehicle driven by Karl Healy. The collision was the direct and proximate result of Healy\u2019s negligence; however, he was underinsured. Cic-ciarella and the Hallorans filed claims with Arnica under the Policy\u2019s uninsured/underin-sured motorist coverage, but Arnica withheld payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">C. <em>District Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">Cicciarella and the Hallorans filed this suit, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the duties of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of Article 21.21 of the Texas Insurance Code. Cicciarella and the Hallorans sought to recover $100,000 in actual damages plus exemplary damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-15\">Arnica entered into a complete settlement with the Hallorans. Even though Cicciarella stipulated and agreed to its terms, the Hallo-rans\u2019 settlement in no way affected her claims or causes of action against Arnica. Thereafter, Cicciarella and Arnica both moved to sever the extra-contractual claims for bad faith and violations of the Texas Insurance Code from the remaining uninsured/underinsured motorist claim. The district court ordered such severance, leaving Cicciarella and Arnica as the only parties to the severed contractual damage claim under the Policy. Arnica then moved for partial summary judgment, seeking dismissal of Cic-eiarella\u2019s underinsured motorist claim and alleging that, as a matter of law, Arnica was entitled to judgment because the undisputed facts established that Cicciarella was not a \u201cresident of [the insureds\u2019] household\u201d and thus not a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the Policy. The district court agreed with Arnica, holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>that no genuine issue of fact existed to preclude summary judgment because \u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 Cicciarella was not a resident of the same household as the Hallorans, the named insureds. The district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Arnica, dismissing Cicciarella\u2019s uninsured motorist claim. Cicciarella timely filed a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-3\">D. <em>The Issue an Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">As she did in district court, Cicciarella insists that genuine issues of material fact as to her residential status vis-a-vis the Hallo-rans\u2019 \u201chousehold\u201d do exist, thereby precluding summary judgment. Thus, the sole issue on appeal is whether Cicciarella is correct that there exist genuine issues of material fact on the question whether she is a \u201cresident of [the insureds\u2019] household,\u201d as that phrase is used in the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">We review a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment under the same standards that the district court applied to determine whether summary judgment was appropriate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate if the record discloses \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the summary judgment will be affirmed only if we are \u201cconvinced, after an independent review of the record, that \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u2019 and that \u2018the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We begin our review with the language of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\"><em>The Policy </em>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">The Policy provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-13\">[Arnica] will pay damages to which a covered person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by a covered person, or property damage caused by an accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-14\">The Policy defines the term, \u201ccovered person,\u201d as \u201c[the insureds] or any family member.\u201d The Policy then defines \u201cfamily member\u201d as a \u201cperson who is a resident of [the insureds\u2019] household and related to [the insured] by blood, marriage or adoption.\u201d The words \u201cresident\u201d and \u201chousehold\u201d are not defined in the Policy; neither are those words modified by adjectives such as \u201cprincipal,\u201d \u201cprimary,\u201d or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-15\">None dispute that, for Cicciarella to <em>recover </em>under the Policy, she must prove that (1) she is a relative of Dr. Halloran, and (2) she was a resident of the insureds\u2019 (the Hallo-rans) household at all pertinent times. But merely to avoid summary judgment and \u201chave her day in court,\u201d Cicciarella need only raise a material issue of disputed fact with respect to either prong of the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cfamily member.\u201d The first prong presents no problem, as no one contests that Cicciarella and Dr. Halloran are related for purposes of the Policy. Thus the only point of contention is whether Cicciarella was a \u201cresident\u201d of the Hallorans\u2019 \u201chousehold.\u201d We examine, in turn, those two terms and how they are used relative to each other in the phrase \u201cresident of [the insureds\u2019] household.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-16\">1. <em>Contractual Construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-17\">In Texas, insurance policies are controlled by the rules of construction that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>are applicable to contracts generally.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We will not rewrite the terms of the Policy; instead, we enforce it as written.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our primary concern is to give effect to the intentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, in interpreting the Policy, we construe all parts of the document together, giving effect to the intent of the parties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The determination whether terms are ambiguous is a question of law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A contract is ambiguous only \u201cwhen its meaning is uncertain and doubtful or it is reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Only if the court makes the determination that the contract cannot be given a certain and definite legal meaning, and is therefore ambiguous, can a question of <em>fact </em>be submitted to the jury as to the meaning of the contract.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Once the document is found to be ambiguous, the determination of the parties\u2019 intent through extrinsic evidence is a question of fact.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We must interpret and construe insurance policies liberally in favor of the insured, especially when dealing with exceptions and words of limitation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">2. <em>Apples and Oranges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">We note preliminarily that some confusion results from the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cfamily member\u201d in terms of a \u201cperson who is a <em>resident </em>of [the insureds\u2019] household.\"<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The word \u201cresident\u201d embodies the concept of <em>place, </em>connoting the physical or geographical location or locale where individuals dwell or reside. On the other hand, the word \u201chousehold\u201d (as distinguished from \u201chouse,\u201d \u201cresidence,\u201d \u201cabode,\u201d and the like), is universally defined in terms of <em>persons </em>\u2014 an agglomeration of individuals who dwell as a unit under one roof. Had the phrase in the Policy read \u201cresident of [the insureds\u2019] <em>house </em>(or <em>residence </em>or abode),\u201d the concepts of place and person would not have been mixed; conversely, had the phrase in the Policy read \u201cperson who is a <em>member of </em>[the insureds\u2019] household,\u201d thus consistently using terms that connote persons rather than mixing persons and places, the point would have been equally clear. As it is, however, we are required to parse the phrase actually used in the Policy and examine more closely the intent of the parties to that insurance contract, which uses \u201cresident\u201d and \u201chousehold\u201d in the subject phrase, to see if both words as thus used \u2014 and the phrase in which the words are used together \u2014 are susceptible of but one reasonable meaning and thus are not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">3. <em>Household</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">As noted, the term \u201chousehold\u201d is not defined within the four comers of the Policy; neither is household truly a legal term of art. Rather, it is a term of ordinary, conversational usage and understanding. Random House defines \u201chousehold\u201d as \u201cthe people of the house collectively; a family, including its servants.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Webster defines \u201chousehold\u201d as \u201c[t]hose who dwell under the same roof and compose a family: a domestic establishment: a social unit comprised of [sic] those living together in the same dwelling place.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And, even though Black\u2019s contains annotations within its definition of \u201chousehold,\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>definition essentially parrots Webster.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus a \u201chousehold\u201d is not a <em>place </em>\u2014 not a house or a <em>building </em>or a <em>residence </em>\u2014 but is group or set of individuals, i.e., natural persons, who together dwell \u201cunder the same roof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Significant to the instant inquiry is whether it can be said with certainty that, as used in the Policy, \u201chousehold\u201d can mean <em>any </em>household or only the <em>primary </em>household, <em>principal </em>household, <em>permanent </em>household, or household <em>for the greatest or greater part of the year. </em>As the Policy is devoid of any adjective or phrase modifying \u201chousehold,\u201d the answer to that question is not apparent from the document. What is apparent, however, is that in the Policy, \u201chousehold\u201d is susceptible of more than one interpretation\u2014 indeed, multiple interpretations. This is quintessential ambiguity and thus a quintessential factual question for resolution by the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">4. <em>Resident</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">In Texas, \u201c[t]he controlling test of whether persons are residents of the same household at a particular time, within the meaning of the policy in question, is not solely whether they are residing together under one roof.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Instead, \u201c[t]he real test is whether the absence of the party of interest from the household of the alleged insured is intended to be permanent or only temporary, i.e., whether there is physical absence coupled with an intent not to return.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201ca person may, and many do, have more than one residence.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-17\">Generally, in the cases that establish this test, the inquiry focuses on whether a child or spouse who is not living under the same roof as the insured is, nonetheless, a \u201cresident of the same household\u201d for purposes of the insurance policy.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The test focuses on intent of the non-insured person for whom coverage is being sought: whether or not that individual intended his or her departure from the residence of the insured to be permanent or only temporary. If the child or spouse intends to return, the departure is only temporary and the child or spouse remains a \u201ccovered person.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> If, on the other hand, the child or spouse has no intention to return, the departure is permanent and the individual is not a \u201ccovered person.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-18\">In the instant case, the broader question\u2014 whether the individual seeking coverage is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>resident of the insureds\u2019 household \u2014 remains; but the focus has shifted. For here we know where the individual for whom coverage is sought resided: At all pertinent times, Cicciarella was a resident of the Brooklyn dwelling only and never intended to leave. What we do not know is whether at those times the insureds \u2014 the Hallorans\u2014 were \u201cresidents\u201d of the Brooklyn dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">If the Hallorans were <em>residents </em>of the Brooklyn dwelling, then Cicciarella was a \u201cresident of [the insureds\u2019] household\u201d and was a \u201ccovered person.\u201d On the other hand, if the Hallorans were not <em>residents </em>of the Brooklyn dwelling but merely periodic visitors or sojourners, they could not have been members of a household in that location. Thus Cicciarella could not have been a \u201cresident of [the insureds\u2019] household\u201d and could not have been a \u201ccovered person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Additionally, as we have seen in the ease with the word \u201chousehold,\u201d the word \u201cresident\u201d is not modified by adjective or phrase to give us insight into the question whether the parties intended, for purposes of the Policy, that an insured could be a \u201cresident\u201d of more than one dwelling place and thus a member of more than one \u201chousehold.\u201d The term \u201cresident\u201d has different meanings in the legal world, depending on the context and usage.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Here, we are unable to discern from context and usage the intended definition of the term \u201cresident.\u201d As \u201cresident\u201d is susceptible of more than one sensible meaning for purposes of the Policy, it too is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">5. <em>\u201cResident of [the insureds\u2019] Household\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">We have now determined that neither \u201cresident\u201d nor \u201chousehold\u201d is a legal term of art or a term defined in the Policy and that both words are ambiguous under the circumstances of the instant ease. As both \u201cresident\u201d and \u201chousehold\u201d are ambiguous, it follows that the key phrase, \u201cresident of [the insureds\u2019] household\u201d is ambiguous and thus a question of <em>fact.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Moreover, as the ultimate outcome of this litigation turns on the meaning ascribed to that key phrase, the parties\u2019 intended meaning is <em>material. </em>Accordingly, the district court erred in not allowing the jury to determine (1) the parties\u2019 intended meaning of \u201chousehold,\u201d \u201cresident,\u201d and \u201cresident of [the insureds\u2019] household\u201d; and (2) whether, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the Hallorans \u2014 together with Cicciarella\u2014 constituted a \u201chousehold,\u201d given that the Hallorans are present in the Brooklyn Dwelling intermittently for a total of some 60 days per year, and that the Hallorans apparently do constitute a \u201chousehold\u201d (of which Cicciar-ella clearly is not a member or \u201cresident\u201d) in the Houston Dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">As we conclude that material questions of fact persist as to whether Dr. Halloran is a \u201cresident\u201d of the Brooklyn Dwelling and, if so, whether the Hallorans and Cicciarella constitute a \u201chousehold\u201d there, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Arnica and remand Ciceiarel-la\u2019s contractual claim for uninsured motorist coverage to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-9\">.

In light of Arnica\u2019s settlement with the Hallo-rans on their contractual claim and the district court\u2019s severance of the non-contractual claims from Cicciarella\u2019s contractual claim, the partial summary judgment dismissing Cicciarella\u2019s breach of contract claim was a final judgment for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, the jurisdictional basis for this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b827-10\">. <em>Herrera </em>v. <em>Millsap, </em>862 F.2d 1157, 1159 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b827-18\">.
