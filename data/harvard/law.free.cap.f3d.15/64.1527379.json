BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b151-24\">This appeal concerns the alleged \u201cmalicious political persecution\u201d and malicious prosecution of plaintiff-appellant Charles E. Saunders (\u201cSaunders\u201d), a <em>pro se </em>litigant, by officers, agents and/or employees of the United States, in violation of the Federal Tort Claims Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cFTCA\u201d), the First, Fifth and Eighth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-25\">Saunders\u2019 suit has its origin in an administrative proceeding brought against him by the United States Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d). On March 5, 1990, the Acting Administrator of DOL\u2019s Wage and Hour Division filed a complaint with DOL\u2019s Office of Administrative Law Judges, through defendant James E. White, Regional Solicitor for DOL\u2019s Office of the Solicitor of Labor. The DOL complaint alleged that Saunders, doing business as American Shamrock Building Maintenance (\u201cAmerican Shamrock\u201d), violated certain provisions of the McNamara-O\u2019Hara Service Contract Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u201cMcNamara-O\u2019Hara Act\u201d) pertaining to classification of employee wage rates, and calculation of employee work hours and holiday pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>A formal hearing on the DOL complaint was conducted before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) on October 30-31, 1991. Defendant Daniel Curran, an attorney with DOL\u2019s Office of the Solicitor, represented DOL in this hearing. On February 27,1992, the ALJ issued a Decision and Order finding no violations of the McNamara-O\u2019Hara Act by Saunders d/b/a American Shamrock and ordering DOL to remit all monies withheld from payment under DOL\u2019s contract with Saunders. DOL\u2019s Acting Administrator is currently appealing the ALJ\u2019s Decision and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">On March 17, 1992, Saunders filed the instant suit, claiming that the defendants falsely, maliciously and without probable cause, conspired to bring a claim against him d/b/a American Shamrock for violations of the McNamara-O\u2019Hara Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, Saunders\u2019 amended complaint asserts that \u201c[d]efendant White, in conspiracy with unknown others[,] acted with malice and without probable cause in issuing the complaint ... and instigating the prosecution, ... with the intent to injure and damage [Saunders].\u201d He further charges that \u201c[defendant George H.W. Bush, with constructive knowledge[,] conspired and acted in concert with the defendant co-conspirators by giving tacit approval of [DOL\u2019s] abuse of the legal process to injure and damage [Saunders].\u201d Saunders\u2019 amended complaint contains no allegations pertaining to defendant Lynn Martin, the former Secretary of Labor, and defendant Curran\u2019s role in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">According to Saunders\u2019 amended complaint, the defendants undertook these acts of alleged \u201cmalicious persecution\u201d and malicious prosecution in direct retaliation for a civil rights complaint previously filed by Saunders against the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) and former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These acts are also alleged to be \u201cin furtherance and continuation of twenty-one years of harassment, attempted intimidation, and political persecution [of Saunders] resulting originally from his \u2018whistle-blowing\u2019 concerning racial discrimination in the United States Air Force ... [and] his unrelenting quest for social, economic and political equality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">When the, defendants moved to dismiss Saunders\u2019 suit, the district court obliged. The court construed Saunders\u2019 amended complaint to charge the defendants with malicious prosecution under the FTCA and dismissed such claims with prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). It also dismissed Saunders\u2019 \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1985 claims without prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Rule 11 sanctions were imposed against Saunders, calculated as a $500 fine, reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. Saunders filed this timely appeal on November 4, 1992, requesting review of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims and of the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">A. Dismissal of FTCA Claims under Rule ' 12(b)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">The district court correctly treated Saunders\u2019 malicious prosecution claims as tort claims under the FTCA. The FTCA creates a statutory cause of action against the United States for torts committed by federal officials within the scope of their employment. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671, <em>et seq. </em>The tort of malicious prosecution, however, is not cognizable under the FTCA. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2680(h). Moreover, persons seeking recovery under the FTCA must first present their \u201cclaim to the appropriate Federal agency,\u201d and such claim must be \u201cfinally denied by the agency\u201d before suit may be brought in Federal Court. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2675(a). In light of this law, the district court correctly dismissed Saunders\u2019 malicious prosecution claims under the FTCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>Reynolds v. United States, </em>748 F.2d 291 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">B. Dismissal of <em>Bivens, </em>\u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1985 Claims on Immunities Grounds</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Saunders\u2019 amended complaint charges the defendants with violating the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments as well as \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1985 of Title 42.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Apparently the district court did not construe Saunders\u2019 amended complaint to raise any <em>Bivens </em>claims. <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971) (recognizing a right implied directly under the Constitution to recover damages against a federal official for a violation of a constitutional right). While we find no fault in the court\u2019s construal, we nevertheless, in the interest of thoroughness, address the dismissal of any <em>Bivens </em>claim. Assuming without deciding that <em>Bivens </em>claims are cognizable under these Amendments, we conclude that such claims, as well as his \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1985 claims are barred in the present action by the defendants\u2019 absolute and qualified immunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Former President Bush enjoys absolute immunity from damage liability for acts within the \u2018\u201couter perimeter\u2019\u201d of his official responsibility. <em>Nixon v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 731, 755, 102 S.Ct. 2690, 2704, 73 L.Ed.2d 349 (1982). Here, the only \u201cact\u201d with which the President is charged is \u201cgiving tacit approval[,]\u201d as \u201cthe president and chief executive officer of the Government of the United States of Ameriea[,]\u201d of the DOL\u2019s alleged \u201cabuse of the legal process to injure and damage plaintiff.\u201d This allegation charges the former President with conduct within the perimeter of his responsibilities as chief of the executive branch. Therefore, he is absolutely immune from suit. <em>See Id. </em>at 756, 102 S.Ct. at 2705.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Defendant White is charged with liability for his \u201cinstigation] [of] the [DOL] prosecution[.]\u201d \u201c[0]fficials who are responsible for the decision to initiate or continue a proceeding subject to agency adjudication are entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability for their parts in that decision.\u201d <em>Butz v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 516, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 2916, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978). White is entitled to absolute immunity from suit. <em>See Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Saunders does not make any allegation as to Defendant Curran\u2019s role in the DOL prosecution. However, the record reflects that Curran was the DOL attorney who actually prosecuted the complaint against Saunders at the two day hearing. \u201c[A]n agency attorney who arranges for the presentation of evidence on the record in the course of an adjudication is absolutely immune from suits based on the introduction of such evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516, 98 S.Ct. at 2916. Curran is absolutely immune from suit. <em>See Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Federal officials are accorded qualified immunity from liability for damages arising from conduct which is not violative of \u201cclearly established law\u201d of which a reasonable person would have known. <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 807, 819, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2732, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); <em>Austin v. Borel, </em>830 F.2d 1356, 1358-59, 1363 (5th Cir.1987), <em>reh\u2019g denied, en banc, </em>836 F.2d 1346 (5th Cir.1987). Saunders not only fails to allege any facts indicating that defendant Martin violated clearly established law, but also fails to make <em>any </em>allegations against Martin whatsoever.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Martin is entitled to immunity as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>C. Rule 11 Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">In previous matters of which the district court took judicial notice, Saunders\u2019 claims against then President Reagan were dismissed as frivolous on the basis of the President\u2019s absolute immunity. Saunders was warned that sanctions would be imposed if he filed another frivolous suit. Despite this warning, Saunders filed yet another frivolous suit, this time against former President Bush. We find no abuse in the district court\u2019s discretionary imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is in all respects AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-16\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671, <em>et seq. </em>(1965 &amp; Supp.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AxA\">. 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 351, <em>et seq.; </em>29 C.F.R. Parts 4, 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b152-6\">. Saunders filed his original complaint on March 17, 1992. On May 15, the defendants filed their initial motion to dismiss. Thereafter, on May 21, Saunders filed an amended complaint. The defendants responded to Saunders\u2019 amended complaint with a second motion to dismiss, filed June 1. In addressing the defendants\u2019 subsequent motion, the district court ruled that Saunders\u2019 amended complaint was controlling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b152-14\">. Saunders initially filed this administrative complaint against HUD in November, 1989. \u2022</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">. Saunders\u2019 pleading explicitly states that the defendants' malicious prosecution of the DOL complaint was a form of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The pleading is less clear as to the bases of Saunders\u2019 first and fifth amendment claims. We glean from his amended complaint, responsive motions and appellate briefs that Saunders is claiming that the alleged malicious prosecution violated his fifth amendment right to equal protection. Based on a combined reading of the aforementioned documents, it does not seem that Saunders predicates any recovery or relief on an alleged first amendment violation. Rather, Saunders seems to be using his first amendment right to petition the courts for redress as a sword with which to strike down the defendants immunities defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b153-13\">. Saunders may be relying on the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>as a basis for imposing liability on the former Secretary as well as the former President. However, that doctrine of vicarious liability is not a permissible basis for holding these defendants liable. <em>See Abate </em>v. <em>Southern </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>Pacific Transp. Co., </em>993 F.2d 107, 111 (5th Cir.1993); <em>cf. Monell v. Dept. of Soc. Serv. of City of N.Y., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
