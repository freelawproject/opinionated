Jennings, Jr., appeal from an order of the United States Claims Court, No. 91-1242C (April 28, 1992), dismissing their complaint seeking compensation for a taking under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>Golden Pac. Bancorp v. United States, </em>25 Cl.Ct. 768 (1992).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-20\">Golden Pacific is a bank holding company and owns approximately 90 percent of the stock of Golden Pacific National Bank (Bank). Jennings owns 6,400 shares of the stock of Golden Pacific. Golden Pacific and Jennings filed an action in the Claims Court alleging that the actions of the Comptroller of the Currency (Comptroller) in declaring the Bank insolvent and appointing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver constituted a taking for which they were entitled to compensation under the Fifth Amendment. The Claims Court granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment after concluding that the actions of the Comptroller did not constitute a compen-sable taking. <em>Id. </em>at 771.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-21\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b918-22\">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. The Bank was a national bank, with its principal place of business in New York City. <em>Id. </em>at 769. The Bank was chartered pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>ant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 27 (1988)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and subject to the regulatory authority of the Comptroller pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (1988). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Acting on an informant\u2019s tip, the Comptroller undertook a surprise investigation of the Bank on June 17, 1985. <em>Id. </em>The Comptroller\u2019s actions were taken as a result of the Bank\u2019s practice of issuing \u201cyellow\u201d certificates of deposit (Yellow CDs). <em>Id. </em>The Bank purportedly regarded Yellow CDs as non-book \u201cinvestments\u201d made by it on behalf of the CD holders. <em>Id. </em>Based upon his investigation, however, the Comptroller determined that the Yellow CDs were, in fact, deposits. <em>Id. </em>As deposits, the Yellow CDs were liabilities of the Bank, and the Bank was required to maintain offsetting assets, or it would be technically insolvent. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Since the Comptroller was not satisfied that the Bank possessed such assets, he began preparing a cease and desist order to halt the practice of issuing Yellow CDs. <em>Id. </em>Before the cease and desist order could be issued, however, rumors of the Comptroller\u2019s investigation precipitated a run on the Bank. <em>Id. </em>Faced with what he regarded as inadequate assets and a run on the Bank, the Comptroller declared the Bank insolvent pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 191<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and placed it in FDIC receivership pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(c)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">After the Bank was closed, Golden Pacific brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. In its district court complaint, Golden Pacific</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">sought (i) review of the Comptroller\u2019s actions under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1988), alleging that the Comptroller\u2019s actions were \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;\u201d (ii) damages from the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2680(a) (1988), for the Comptroller\u2019s actions; and (iii) damages and injunctive relief under the Fifth Amendment. On December 1, 1986, the district court granted summary judgment for the government. <em>Golden Pac. Bancorp v. Clarke, </em>No. 85-2384, slip op. at 1 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 1986). In so doing, the district court addressed Golden Pacific\u2019s APA and FTCA claims. After considering the administrative record, the district court concluded that, in declaring the Bank insolvent and placing it in receivership, the Comptroller had acted within the scope of his statutory authority and that his actions were not arbitrary, capricious, or undertaken in bad faith. <em>Id. </em>at 6.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">The district court did not address Golden Pacific\u2019s claim under the Fifth Amendment for monetary and injunctive relief. Golden Pacific had acknowledged at an earlier stage of the proceedings that any monetary claim it was asserting against the government sounded in tort. Thus, when the district court granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Golden Pacific was no longer asserting any monetary claims under the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As far as Golden Pacif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>ic\u2019s claim for injunctive relief under the Fifth Amendment was concerned, it appears that the district court either overlooked the claim or viewed its decision with respect to the APA and FTCA claims as being dispositive of any request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the district court judgment. <em>Golden Pac. Bancorp v. Clarke, </em>837 F.2d 509, 513 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 890, 109 S.Ct. 223,102 L.Ed.2d 213 (1988). The court of appeals determined that Golden Pacific's action was \u201cnothing more than a claim for damages under the FTCA\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court concluded, however, that a FTCA cause of action was not available to Golden Pacific because the Comptroller\u2019s actions fell within the discretionary function exception to the FTCA <em>Id. </em>at 511-512.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court declined to reach Golden Pacific\u2019s claim under the Fifth Amendment because it was argued on appeal only in a reply brief. <em>Id. </em>at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">On June 21,1991, appellants filed an action in the Claims Court, alleging that the Comptroller\u2019s actions constituted a compensable taking under the Fifth Amendment, a breach of an implied contract between the Comptroller and the Bank and its shareholders, and a mistake of fact.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In response, the government moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, or in the alternative, for summary judgment, asserting that res judi-cata barred the taking claim under the Fifth Amendment and that the Comptroller\u2019s actions did not constitute a compensable taking under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">The Claims Court held that the actions of the Comptroller in declaring the Bank insolvent and placing the Bank in FDIC receivership did not constitute a compensable taking under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Golden Pac. Bancorp, </em>25 Cl.Ct. at 771. The Claims Court determined that appellants \u201clacked \u2018one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property the right to exclude others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 770 (quoting <em>Kaiser Aetna v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 164, 174, 179-80, 100 S.Ct. 383, 390, 392-93, 62 L.Ed.2d 332 (1979)). Without the right to exclude others, the court stated, appellants did \u201cnot have the \u2018historically rooted expectation of compensation\u2019 necessary to establish a fifth amendment taking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 770-771 (quoting <em>California Hous. Sec., Inc. v. United States, </em>959 F.2d 955, 958 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 324, 121 L.Ed.2d 244 (1992)). The court also stated that appellants\u2019 \u201creasonable investment-backed expectations could not possibly have been interfered with given the highly regulated nature of the banking industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 771. Since it found the Fifth Amendment issue to be dis-positive, the Claims Court did not address the government\u2019s contention regarding res judicata. <em>Id. </em>at 771 n. 3. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">\u201cSummary judgment is properly granted only where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Mingus Constructors, Inc. v. United States, </em>812 F.2d 1387, 1390 (Fed.Cir.1987) (citations omitted). In reviewing a grant of summary judgment by a trial court, we determine whether the standards for summary judgment have been met and are not bound by the trial court\u2019s ruling that there was no material factual dispute present in the case. <em>Id. </em>at 1390. In this case, there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the Claims Court did not err in concluding that the government was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">As a preliminary matter, the government argues that Golden Pacific\u2019s taking claim is barred by the doctrine of res judicata, in the sense of claim preclusion, based upon the district court judgment and the affirmance of that judgment on appeal. Under the doctrine of res judicata, a judgment on the merits in a prior suit bars a second suit involving the same parties or their privies based upon the same claim or cause of action. IB James W. Moore et al., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice f 0.401[1] (2d ed. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">The doctrine of res judicata does not apply because Golden Pacific\u2019s taking claim before the Claims Court was not the same as Golden Pacific\u2019s APA and FTCA claims before the district court. The taking claim was never litigated in the district court action. As noted above, the district court regarded Golden Pacific\u2019s action as, for all intents and purposes, a tort action requesting tort relief, <em>see supra </em>note 8, as did the D.C. Circuit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The district court also did not discuss Golden Pacific\u2019s claim for injunctive relief under the Fifth Amendment in its decision granting summary judgment for the government. Moreover, the taking claim could not have been litigated, in the district court action, in view of the fact that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Golden Pacific\u2019s taking claim because it was a non-tort monetary claim exceeding $10,000. <em>Golden Pac. Bancorp v. Selby, </em>No. 85-2384, slip op. at 4 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 1986). Accordingly, Golden Pacific\u2019s taking claim is not barred by the doctrine of res judicata because the suit before the Claims Court was not based upon the same claim as the suit before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">Turning to the merits, the Fifth Amendment states that \u201cprivate property [shall not] be taken for public use without just compensation.\u201d A regulatory imposition may result in a compensable taking in either of two ways. First, as a result of a regulatory scheme, a property owner may suffer a physical invasion or permanent occupation of his or her property. In <em>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798 (1992), the Supreme Court stated that a regulation that compels a property owner to \u201csuffer a physical \u2018invasion\u2019 of his property\u201d is a category of regulatory action which is \u201ccompensable without case-specific inquiry into the public interest advanced in support of the restraint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. at 2893. In general, in the case of physical invasions, the Court pointed out, \u201cno matter how minute the intrusion, and no matter how weighty the public purpose behind it, we have required compensation.\u201d <em>Id,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, in <em>Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 U.S. 419, 102 S.Ct. 3164, 73 L.Ed.2d 868 (1982), the Court held that placement of certain equipment on a building pursuant to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>New York statute requiring a landlord to permit installation of cable television facilities on her property at a government-fixed rate was a taking because it constituted a physical occupation of her property. In <em>Lor-etto, </em>the Court concluded that \u201ca permanent physical occupation authorized by [the] government is a taking without regard to the public interests that it may serve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426, 102 S.Ct. at 3171. In addition, the Court stated that \u201c[i]n such a case, the property owner entertains a historically rooted expectation of compensation, and the character of the invasion is qualitatively more intrusive than perhaps any other category of property regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441,102 S.Ct. at 3179. The kind of physical invasion and permanent occupation that was involved in <em>Loretto </em>has been referred to as a taking per se. <em>See id. </em>at 442, 102 S.Ct. at 3179.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">A regulatory scheme may also result in a compensable taking without a physical invasion or occupation of property. Such a taking occurs \u201cwhen regulations go \u2018too far\u2019 and impinge on private freedom.\u201d John A. Humbach, <em>\u201cTaking\" the Imperial Judiciary Seriously: Segmenting Property Interests and Judicial Revision of Legislative Judgments, </em>42 Cath.U.L.Rev. 771, 777 (1993) (quoting <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, </em>260 U.S. 393, 415, 43 S.Ct. 158, 160, 67 L.Ed. 322 (1922)). In <em>Mahan, </em>the claimant had sold the surface rights to particular parcels of property but had reserved the right to remove the coal underlying the parcels. A Pennsylvania statute which was enacted after these transactions prohibited any mining of coal that caused the subsidence of any house, unless the house was the property of the owner of the underlying coal and was more than 150 feet from the improved property of another. Because the statute made it commercially impracticable to mine the coal and thus had nearly the same effect as the complete destruction of rights claimant had reserved from the owners of the surface land, the Supreme Court held that the statute effected a taking without just compensation. 260 U.S. at 414-15, 43 S.Ct. at 159-60. In the words of Justice Holmes, the Pennsylvania statute went \u201ctoo far.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415, 43 S.Ct. at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">In cases where a regulatory scheme does not involve a physical invasion or occupation of property, the Supreme Court \u201chas generally \u2018been unable to develop any \u201cset formula\u201d for determining when \u201cjustice and fairness\u201d require that economic injuries caused by public action\u2019 \u201d must be deemed a compensable taking. <em>Kaiser Aetna v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 164, 175, 100 S.Ct. 383, 390, 62 L.Ed.2d 332 (1979) (quoting <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 2659, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978)); <em>accord Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Ass\u2019n, </em>452 U.S. 264, 295, 101 S.Ct. 2352, 2370, 69 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981). The type of case-by-case approach that is required is set forth in <em>Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., </em>467 U.S. 986, 104 S.Ct. 2862, 81 L.Ed.2d 815 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-7\">The inquiry into whether a taking has occurred is essentially an \u201cad hoc, factual\u201d inquiry. <em>Kaiser Aetna, </em>444 U.S. at 175 [100 S.Ct. at 390]. The Court, however, has identified several factors that should be taken into account when determining whether a governmental action has gone beyond \u201cregulation\u201d and effects a \u201ctaking.\u201d Among those factors are: \u201cthe character of the governmental action, its economic impact, and its interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations.\u201d <em>Prune-Yard Shopping Center v. Robins, </em>447 U.S. [74] at 83 [100 S.Ct. 2035, 2042, 64 L.Ed.2d 741 (1980) ]; <em>see Kaiser Aetna, </em>444 U.S. at 175 [100 S.Ct. at 390]; <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 124 [98 S.Ct. at 2659].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">467 U.S. at 1005, 104 S.Ct. at 2874.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Golden Pacific\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that the highly regulated nature of the banking industry does not preclude its taking claim. Put another way, Golden Pacific contends that the Claims Court erred when it held, 25 Cl.Ct. at 770-71, that Golden Pacific did not have the historically rooted expectation of compensation necessary to establish a Fifth Amendment taking and that the Comptroller\u2019s actions did not interfere with any reasonable investment-backed expectations on the part of Golden Pacific. Golden Pacific also argues that, in declaring the Bank insolvent and placing it in FDIC receivership, the Comptroller \u201creneged\u201d on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>prior commitment to value Yellow CDs in determining bank solvency, and that the closure of the \u201csolvent\u201d Bank without shareholder compensation failed to advance a legitimate government purpose and deprived Golden Pacific of its property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. We turn first to Golden Pacific\u2019s principal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">In arguing that the actions of the Comptroller vis-a-vis the Bank constituted a taking for which compensation is due, Golden Pacific appears to rely both upon a per se analysis and also upon an analysis grounded in the factors set forth above in <em>Monsanto. </em>This is not surprising. On the one hand, when the Comptroller placed the Bank in FDIC receivership for liquidation there was, in a very real sense, a physical invasion and permanent occupation, certainly as far as the premises of the Bank were concerned. On the other hand, the Comptroller did not actually take Golden Pacific\u2019s property, its shares of stock in the Bank. Rather, it may be argued that, through his actions, the Comptroller reduced, if not eliminated, the value of those shares. Thus, Golden Pacific states that \u201c[t]he property rights that the shareholders are seeking to vindicate have absolutely nothing to do with their right to physical possession and management of the bank\u2019s premises.\u201d According to Golden Pacific, \u201c[t]he shareholders maintain that the government\u2019s action deprived them of the value of their stock. They are not seeking to redress wrongs to the corporation.\u201d However, we need not decide the question whether the claim of a party in Golden Pacific\u2019s situation is for a taking per se or for a taking that is found after an analysis of the factors stated in <em>Monsanto. </em>The reason is that, whichever way one looks at this case, Golden Pacific is unable to establish a compensable taking.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The resolution of this case is controlled by our decision in <em>California Housing Securities. </em>There, California Housing Securities, Inc. (CHS) sought compensation for an alleged taking under the Fifth Amendment, based upon the appointment and subsequent actions of the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) as conservator and receiver of Sarato-ga Savings and Loan Association (Saratoga). <em>California Hous. Sec., </em>959 F.2d at 957. In so doing, CHS relied on <em>Loretto </em>in contending that the actions of the government resulted in a permanent occupation and physical taking of Saratoga\u2019s property in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s taking clause. We held that the \u201cRTC\u2019s occupation and seizure of Saratoga, and its subsequent liquidation of Saratoga\u2019s assets, cannot constitute a physical fifth amendment taking because neither Saratoga nor CHS could have developed a historically rooted expectation of compensation for such a seizure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 958. \u201cSara-toga lacked the fundamental right to exclude the government from its property at those times when the government could legally impose a conservatorship or receivership on Saratoga.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201c[a]s a consequence of the regulated environment in which Saratoga voluntarily operated, Saratoga and CHS held less than the full bundle of property rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reaching our conclusion in <em>California Housing Securities, </em>we reviewed the pertinent regulatory scheme, <em>id. </em>at 955-956, and pointed out that when Saratoga obtained federal deposit insurance, it voluntarily subjected itself to the highly regulated banking industry. \u201cIt is well known that \u2018[bjanking is one of the longest regulated and most closely supervised of public callings.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 958 (quoting <em>Fahey v. Mallonee, </em>332 U.S. 245, 250, 67 S.Ct. 1552, 1554, 91 L.Ed. 2030 (1947)).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">The regulatory scheme applicable to federally-insured savings and loan associations, such as Saratoga in <em>California Housing Securities, </em>is similar to the regulatory scheme applicable to national banks, such as the Bank here. <em>Compare </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464(d)(6)(A) (1988) (grounds for appointment of receiver for savings and loan association) (current version at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464(d)(2)(A) (Supp. IV 1992)) <em>with </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 191 (1988) (grounds for appointment of receiver for national banking association) (current version at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 191 (Supp. IV 1992)). Golden Pacific voluntarily entered into the highly regulated banking industry by choosing to invest in the Bank. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>The actions of the Comptroller simply enforced \u201cportions of an extensive regulatory scheme designed to promote the public interest in a sound banking system.\u201d <em>American Continental Corp. v. United, States, </em>22 Cl.Ct. 692, 696 (1991). At those times when the Comptroller could legally inspect the Bank or place it in receivership, the Bank \u2014 which Golden Pacific owned \u2014 was unable to exclude the government from its property. <em>See California Hous. Sec., </em>959 F.2d at 958. Just as Saratoga did not have the right to exclude the RTC in <em>California Housing Securities, </em>the Bank did not have the right to exclude the Comptroller. Consequently, neither the Bank nor Golden Pacific \u201ccould have developed a historically rooted expectation of compensation\u201d for the seizure which resulted from the Comptroller\u2019s actions. 959 F.2d at 958. For this reason, Golden Pacific\u2019s <em>Loret-to </em>claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Golden Pacific fares no better if its claim is viewed as one based upon a regulatory taking not involving the physical invasion or occupation of property. We need only focus upon the third of the three factors set forth above in <em>Monsanto: </em>interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations. <em>Monsanto </em>teaches that \u201cthe force of this factor [may be] so overwhelming ... that it disposes of the taking question____\u201d 467 U.S. at 1005,104 S.Ct. at 2874. Indeed, that is precisely the case here. Given the highly regulated nature of the banking industry, just as under a <em>Loretto </em>analysis Golden Pacific could not have had a historically rooted expectation of compensation for the Comptroller\u2019s actions, so too, the Comptroller\u2019s actions could not possibly have interfered with a reasonable investment-backed expectation on the part of Golden Pacific. Put most simply, Golden Pacific could not have reasonably expected that the government \u201cwould fail to enforce the applicable statutes and regulations.\u201d <em>See American Continental, </em>22 Cl.Ct. at 697. Indeed, Golden Pacific\u2019s expectations could only have been that the FDIC would exert control over the Bank\u2019s assets if the Comptroller became satisfied that the Bank was insolvent and chose to place it in receivership. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 191 (1988) (\u201cwhenever the Comptroller shall become satisfied of the insolvency of a national banking association, he may ... appoint a receiver, who shall proceed to close up such association\u201d) (current version at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 191 (Supp. IV 1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Golden Pacific\u2019s reliance on <em>Monsanto, </em>467 U.S. 986,104 S.Ct. 2862, and <em>United Nuclear Corp. v. United States, </em>912 F.2d 1432 (Fed.Cir.1990) is misplaced. In <em>Monsanto, </em>the Supreme Court found a regulatory taking of proprietary trade secrets by reason of a federal statute forcing disclosure of the trade secrets. 467 U.S. at 1016, 104 S.Ct. at 2879. In <em>United Nuclear, </em>this court found a regulatory taking in an agency action dispossessing a plaintiffs leasehold interest in Indian lands. 912 F.2d at 1433. However, the trade secret interest in <em>Monsanto </em>and the leasehold interest in <em>United Nuclear </em>are fundamentally different from the interest represented by Golden Pacific\u2019s investment in the Bank. Monsanto and United Nuclear each possessed reasonable investment-backed expectations, the reason being that, inherent in each of their respective interests \u2014 Monsanto\u2019s ownership of trade secrets and United Nuclear\u2019s status as a lessee \u2014 was, in one sense or another, the right to exclude others. <em>See Monsanto, </em>467 U.S. at 1011, 104 S.Ct. at 2877 (\u201c[w]ith respect to a trade secret, the right to exclude others is central to the very definition of the property interest\u201d); <em>United Nuclear, </em>912 F.2d at 1436 (\u201cThe fact that United agreed that the leases would be subject to future regulation does not indicate that United fairly can be said to have anticipated that the Secretary would apply a new policy requiring tribal approval of mining plans to leases entered into almost six years earlier, in reliance on which United had expended some $5 million.\u201d) As we stated in <em>Hendler v. United States, </em>952 F.2d 1364, 1374 (Fed.Cir.1991), \u201c[i]n the bundle of rights we call property, one of the most valued is the right to sole and exclusive possession \u2014 the right to <em>exclude </em>strangers, or for that matter friends, but especially the Government.\u201d By contrast, as already seen, Golden Pacific did not possess either the historically rooted expectation of compensation or the reasonable investment-backed expectation necessary to support a Fifth Amendment taking because it chose to invest in an entity \u2014 the Bank\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>which did not possess the right to exclude others. And the reason the Bank did not possess the right to exclude others \u2014 most notably the Comptroller \u2014 was that the Bank was a member of a highly regulated industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Golden Pacific\u2019s second argument\u2014 that the government \u201creneged on a commitment to value Yellow CDs\u201d \u2014 is based upon the contention that the Bank engaged in the same \u201cinvestment\u201d practice in 1981 as it did in 1985 and was not criticized for it then. It appears that Golden Pacific is making this argument in order to have us conclude that conduct on the part of the Comptroller in 1981 created a regulatory environment of non-interference as far as the Bank\u2019s Yellow CD program was concerned. Presumably, Golden Pacific would have us hold, based upon that conclusion, that it did in fact have the kind of reasonable investment-backed expectation necessary to support a taking claim. Specifically, so the argument goes, by reason of the actions of the Comptroller, an expectation arose that the value of Golden Pacific\u2019s investment in the Bank would not be diminished by any actions of the Comptroller stemming from a finding that the Yellow CD program was improper or stemming from a refusal by the Comptroller \u201cto credit the asset side of [the Bank\u2019s] balance sheet when treating the Yellow CDs as liabilities.\u201d Stated another way, Golden Pacific is arguing that the Comptroller\u2019s alleged conduct vis-avis the Yellow CD program had the effect of creating a regulatory environment different from the one which compelled our holding in <em>California Housing Securities.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">There are two problems with this line of argument. First, the district court found, as a factual matter, that there was no conduct on the part of the Comptroller in 1981 that amounted to a commitment with respect to the treatment of the Yellow CDs. Golden Pacific is collaterally estopped from contesting that finding. ' \u201cUnder collateral estoppel, once a court decides an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision precludes relitigation of the same issue on a different cause of action between the same parties.\u201d <em>Kremer v. Chemical Constr. Corp., </em>456 U.S. 461, 467 n. 6, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 1890 n. 6, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982) (citing <em>Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 153, 99 S.Ct. 970, 973, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979) and <em>Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 326 n. 5, 99 S.Ct. 645, 649 n. 5, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979)).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, the factual underpinning for Golden Pacific\u2019s argument is lacking. Second, and more fundamentally, even if the necessary factual predicate did exist, it would be of no help to Golden Pacific. Even if in 1981 the Comptroller had made the kind of \u201ccommitment\u201d asserted by Golden Pacific, he would not have been estopped from concluding in 1985 that he had made a mistake and from acting accordingly. <em>See Schweiker v. Hansen, </em>450 U.S. 785, 789-90,101 S.Ct. 1468, 1471-72, 67 L.Ed.2d 685 (1981) (government cannot be estopped from enforcing compliance with valid regulation merely because it has not enforced that regulation in the past). Consequently, even if the conduct on the part of the Comptroller alleged by Golden Pacific had taken place, it would not have changed the regulatory environment so as to compel a result different from the one reached in <em>California Housing Securities.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">Golden Pacific\u2019s final argument\u2014 that the Comptroller closed a solvent Bank and therefore failed to advance a legitimate government interest \u2014 requires little discussion. Golden Pacific is arguing that the Comptroller \u201cmade a mistake\u201d when he closed the Bank and that therefore compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>sation is due under the Fifth Amendment. This argument assumes, of course, that Golden Pacific had either the historically rooted expectation of compensation or reasonable investment-backed expectation necessary to support a taking claim, which it did not. That point aside, though, a mistake may give rise to a due process claim, but not a taking claim. <em>Tabb Lakes, </em>10 F.3d at 803. And the due process clause of the Constitution is not a money-mandating provision. <em>See Hamlet v. United States, </em>873 F.2d 1414, 1416 (Fed.Cir.1989) (the due process clause \u201cstanding alone, cannot be ... interpreted to command the payment of money\u201d). Such a money-mandating provision is required for a suit, such as this, under the Tucker Act. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 216, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 2967, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983). Golden Pacific\u2019s mistake argument must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">In its ownership of the Bank, Golden Pacific did not have either the historically rooted expectation of compensation or the reasonable investment-backed expectation necessary to support a Fifth Amendment taking claim.
