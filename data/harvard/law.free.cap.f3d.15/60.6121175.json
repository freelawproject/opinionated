(Phoenix) was executory when Murexco filed its Chapter 11 petition. As we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the bankruptcy court erred in holding that the contract was execu-tory, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-21\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-22\">Murexco and the predecessor of Phoenix, HarCor Property Management, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the APA) on February 29, 1988. Under the APA, Murexco agreed to sell many of its assets in two independent stages: At the first closing, all of Murexco\u2019s proven undeveloped reserves and possible reserves, along with certain other assets \u2014 including Murex-co\u2019s operating rights under all of its oil and gas well operating agreements \u2014 would be sold to HarCor. At the second closing, all of Murexco\u2019s proven developed, producing, and behind the pipe reserves would be sold to HarCor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-23\">The first closing was completed as scheduled on February 29, 1988. Murexco received $500,000 for the sale, of which $289,-419.61 was allocated to HarCor\u2019s acquisition of Murexco\u2019s oil and gas well operating rights. The Letter Agreement accompanying the APA (Exhibit 11 to the APA) provided that HarCor would be the contract operator for Murexco \u201cuntil such time as HarCor becomes the operator of record.\u201d Murexco was the operator of record on wells in Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma. Although it is clear that HarCor became the \u201ccontract operator,\u201d the parties dispute whether HarCor, or its successor, Phoenix, ever became the \u201coperator of record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-24\">The second closing never occurred because disputes erupted between the parties as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Murexco\u2019s ability to convey clear title to the developed reserves that it was supposed to deliver at the second closing. By letter agreement dated August 30, 1988, HarCor agreed to pay Murexco approximately $180,-000 as liquidated damages for failure of the second phase to close. Thus no performance remained due between the parties as to the second closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-4\">Murexco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 4, 1992, and filed a \u201cMotion of Debt- or to Reject Executory Contract.\u201d The purpose of the motion was to enable the trustee to reject the Letter Agreement, which is considered a severable portion of the APA. Phoenix contested the motion, arguing that the APA was not executory and thus the severable Letter Agreement \u2014 and the sale of Murexco\u2019s operating rights \u2014 could not be rejected by the Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">At the trial on the motion, Murexco\u2019s president testified that Murexco still had a duty \u2014 but only one duty \u2014 to perform under the APA: to obtain consents of nonoperating working interest owners in the affected wells to Murexco\u2019s sale of its operating rights. Murexco relies on the Joint Operating Agreements (JOAs) to supply this duty. Without those consents, Murexco argued, HarCor could not become the operator- of record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">The bankruptcy court construed the Letter Agreement and the APA. That court concluded that the provisions of the APA 'that set up the contract operatorship were execu-tory, and held that the contract operating agreement was executory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Phoenix appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">The district court reversed, holding that the contract was not executory, as failure to have HarCor named the operator of record would not result in a material breach of the APA. The trustee appeals the ruling of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-12\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-13\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-14\">Although this case has already been reviewed on appeal by the district court, we review the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings as if this were an appeal from a trial in the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error; its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-15\">B. <em>Executory Agreement?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-16\">To dispose of this appeal, we need only review the conclusion that the APA or the Letter Agreement was executory at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-17\">Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that \u201cthe trustee, subject to the court\u2019s approval, may assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This provision allows a trustee to relieve the bankruptcy estate of burdensome agreements which have not been completely performed. The Code does not define \u201cexec-utory contract,\u201d but both parties agree that the relevant inquiry is whether performance remains due to some extent on both sides.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Courts applying \u00a7 365(a) have indicated that an agreement is executory if at the time of the bankruptcy filing, the failure of either party to complete performance would constitute a material breach of the contract, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>by excusing the performance of the other party.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">Harcor has the continuing duty to perform under the Letter Agreement as the contract operator. The issue, then, is whether Mu-rexco has any duties the nonperformance of which would constitute a material breach of the letter agreement. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">First, the Letter Agreement obligates Murexco to make HarCor the contract operator of the wells in question. Neither disputes that HarCor is the contract operator of the wells.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, the Letter Agreement requires Murexco to use its \u201cbest efforts to cause HarCor to become the operator of record.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Whether this condition has been met is not necessarily decisive of the executo-ry or non-exeeutory status of the Letter Agreement: the issue is whether Murexco\u2019s failure to perform this obligation would constitute a material breach of the Letter Agreement. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that nonperformance of Murexco\u2019s duty to use its \u201cbest efforts\u201d would not constitute a material breach. We rely on the APA itself to reach this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">The parties agreed that \u201cbest efforts\u201d means \u201ca good faith attempt by each party to cause the designated actions to occur\u201d; provided that \u201cif one or more of such actions do not occur, the validity of the Agreement, and the actions otherwise required to be taken by the Parties, shall not be affected.\u201d Thus as a matter of law, the failure of Murexco to complete performance would not constitute a material breach of the contract \u2014 it would not excuse HarCor\u2019s performance. The parties\u2019 clearly intended that if Murexco did not succeed in having HarCor named the operator of record, the remainder of the APA \u2014 including HarCor\u2019s duty to perform as the contract operator of the wells \u2014 would be unaffected by such failure. Clearly, then, Murexco\u2019s failure to perform any duty subject to the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause would not constitute a material breach excusing performance by HarCor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-13\">Nevertheless, Murexco argues that Har-Cor\u2019s \u201cacquisition\u201d of consents of the working interest owners or gaining operator of record status was a condition precedent to the first closing under Article VIII of the APA. But Article VIII of the APA specifically states that \u201c[a]ll conditions precedent shall be deemed to have been satisfied upon the occurrence of the First Closing.\u201d As the first closing did occur, the \u201coutstanding duty\u201d\u2014 that Murexco insists is a condition precedent \u2014 was deemed satisfied by the plain wording of the APA. As that duty is thus deemed performed by agreement of the parties, Murexco cannot now argue that it has an outstanding, unperformed duty under the APA. It follows, then, that as neither the APA nor the severable Letter Agreement is executory, neither may be rejected by the trustee under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-15\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-16\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that at the time Murexco\u2019s Chapter 11 petition was filed, neither the APA nor Exhibit 11 to the APA was not executory. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s reversal of the bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>ruptcy court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATTa\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1152-16\">.
