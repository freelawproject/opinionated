On each side of the track was a platform on the level of the floor of the ordinary freight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>car. The distance between the roof of the car and the roof of the storehouse was about three feet. The car farthest in the' storehouse, provided with an automatic coupling, did not couple to the other cars when the switching crew backed against them, but was pushed still farther into the house and left there. The conductor of a switching engine then was directed by his superior to go behind the car to see what was on the track before he \u201cmade a hitch,\u201d and, in doing so fell into a slot or opening which ran across the platforms and was used for the closing and opening of a fire door. In an action against the proprietor of the storehouse for injuries so received, it was <em>held, </em>that a finding was warranted that use of the platform by the conductor to pass behind the car was natural and probable under the circumstances, so that he might be found to have been an invitee of the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b314-3\">At the trial of the action above described, there was evidence that the storehouse was dark, that the defendant was accustomed, when the door was open, to place a plank over the opening and that it was the duty of an employee of the defendant so to place the plank, but that there was no plank there when the plaintiff fell in. <em>Held, </em>that a finding was warranted that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by negligence for which the defendant was responsible.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b314-4\">On the evidence above described it also was <em>held </em>that the question of the due care of the plaintiff was for the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b314-5\">It was <em>held, </em>that at the trial of the action above described, evidence was admissible in explanation of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct and as illustrative of his acts, tending to show that the plaintiff\u2019s superior directed him to go behind the car to see what was on the track back of it before he \u201cmade a hitch.\u201d</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-6\">Tort for personal injuries received on November 4, 1912, when the plaintiff, as the conductor of a switching engine of the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad Company, was on the defendant\u2019s premises removing a car from a shed, the injuries being caused by his falling into a slot or opening one foot wide through which a sliding fire door was opened and closed, and which ran across a platform beside the track along which he was passing to see if the track back of the car was clear before he caused the engine to bump against the car sufficiently to cause its automatic coupling to operate.

If the jury find that the plaintiff\u2019s going into the storehouse as far as the slot or hole into which he fell was due solely because of the bumping back of the car and the order of the station agent, the defendant is not liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-9\"><em>\u201c5. </em>If the jury find that, as the car stood in the storehouse, there was no reason why the defendant or its servants should an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ticipate that the plaintiff would go as far into the storehouse as the fire doors slot, the defendant was not negligent and is not liable in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-3\">\u201c 6.

If when the car failed to couple, the conductor under the orders of the freight agent, his superior, stepped to the platform to investigate whether the track inside was clear, \u201cbefore I hit that car again,\u201d his use of the platform as a feasible means of communication could be found to be as natural and probable under the circumstances, as if the area traversed had been left open and unoccupied.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">It is not contended that before he was injured the plaintiff knew of the sunken slot or channel twelve inches in width where the fire door ran, which if left unguarded the jury could find might make the use of the platform hazardous to those unacquainted with the premises. The uncontradicted evidence of the defendant\u2019s superintendent shows, that when as on the day of the accident the door remained unclosed, the slot was covered by a movable plank, the placing of which \u201cwas the business of the man that was sent to the storehouse in charge of the gang to handle this plank, to put it into the slot.\u201d And \u201c that at the time of the accident the man who had charge of the gang that was sent ... to the storehouse determined whether the car should be unloaded\u201d on the portion of the track inside of the building, \u201cor whether they should be unloaded on the outside.\u201d If the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>representative knew or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known of the absence of the plank, the defendant is bound by his knowledge and conduct. <em>Ruddy </em>v. <em>George F. Blake Manuf. Co. </em>205 Mass. 172, 181. It could have been found further on the evidence of the freight agent, that whenever the door was open the plank usually was in the slot. And the entire evidence if believed was sufficient to convince the jury, that not only was the placing and removal of the plank as well as the opening and closing of the door wholly within the supervision and control of the defendant, with which the employees of the railroad never interfered, but the use of the platform by trainmen when switching cars had not been forbidden nor shown to be unreasonable or unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The evidence of the superintendent being sufficient to justify the jury in finding that the track and platform were concurrently used in the prosecution of the defendant\u2019s business, of which the switching in and out of cars on the entire length of the spur track formed a part, it could not be ruled as matter of law that the platform or any part of it had been designed or reserved for the exclusive use of the defendant\u2019s own employees, over which the plaintiff would pass at his peril. It was a question of fact whether a reasonably prudent and careful man familiar with his own premises where the work he requested was to be performed, and the manner and means ordinarily required for its accomplishment, should have been aware that the men engaged in moving the cars might suffer injuries if the plank was not in place, or if being ignorant of its existence they were not warned of the slot in the platform, which if left exposed might make the use of the premises in the prosecution of their work unsafe and dangerous. <em>Garfield &amp; Proctor Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Rockland-Rockport Lime Co. </em>184 Mass. 60, 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The plaintiff, however, had the burden of proving his own due care, and the evidence, that he passed to the platform by the cotemporaneous direction of the freight agent to the plaintiff, to see what was on the track back of the car before he \u201c made a hitch,\u201d was admissible in explanation of his conduct, and as illustrative of his acts. <em>Conklin </em>v. <em>Consolidated Railway, </em>196 Mass. 302, 306. Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7 1770. The accident happened in the day time. But on the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, which the jury were at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>liberty to follow, the storehouse was unlighted and quite dark, and never having been there before he was unfamiliar with the place. The only light visible to him came through the doorway as he walked down the platform followed by the freight agent immediately behind him. While we all agree that the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence was for the jury, only a majority of the court are of opinion that, whether the plaintiff by reason of the darkness and his unfamiliarity with the surroundings should have paused and investigated his footing before attempting to pass, was also for their determination. <em>Hanley </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>201 Mass. 55, 57, 58. <em>Faxon </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>206 Mass. 500, 504, and cases cited. <em>McLeod </em>v. <em>Rawson, </em>215 Mass. 257, 260. <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>221 Mass. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The motion to direct a verdict for the defendant, and the fourth, sixth and seventh requests were denied rightly for reasons previously stated. The fifth request could not have been given in terms. It omitted the essential element already pointed out, that the plaintiff as an invitee was on the premises to perform work, which included whatever became reasonably necessary to remove the cars, even if this required him to go outside the line of the slot of the fire door. The request as thus modified having been given, the exceptions should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
