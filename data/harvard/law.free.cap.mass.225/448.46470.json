Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated November 2, 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-13\">The answer set up, among other defences, \u201cthat the plaintiff charged a rate of interest in violation of law and that the said transaction was illegal and void.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-14\">At the trial in the Municipal Court it appeared that interest was paid on the loan in excess of twelve per cent per annum and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>that at the time the loan was made the plaintiff was not licensed to conduct the business of making small loans. There was evidence that this was the only time the plaintiff ever lent a sum of money of an amount of $300 or less. At the close of the evidence the defendants asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">\u201c1. Upon all the evidence judgment should be rendered for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Upon all the evidence the court must find that the amount paid for interest on said loan exceeded in the aggregate twelve per cent per annum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">\u201c3. Upon all the evidence the court must find that the plaintiff is an unlicensed person and that the loan was made in violation of St. 1912, c. 675, \u00a7 5, and is therefore void.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-8\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings, and found for the plaintiff. At the request of the defendants he reported the case to the Appellate Division.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">The Appellate Division made an order dismissing the report, and the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-10\">St. 1911, c. 727, \u00a7 3, as amended by St. 1912, c. 675, \u00a7 2, is as follows: \u201cNo person, partnership, corporation, or association within the Commonwealth, shall directly or indirectly engage in the business of making loans of three hundred dollars or less, if the amount to be paid on any such loan, for interest and expenses, exceeds in the aggregate an amount equivalent to twelve per cent per annum upon the sum loaned, without first obtaining from the supervisor of loan agencies a license to carry on said business in the city or town in which the business is to be transacted. When an application for a loan, or for an endorsement or guarantee, or for the purchase of a note is made by any person within this Commonwealth, and the money is advanced, or the endorsement or guarantee is made or furnished by any person, partnership, corporation, or association situated without the Commonwealth, the transaction shall be deemed a loan made within the Commonwealth, and such a loan and the parties making it shall be subject to the provisions of this act.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfEs\">This is an action of contract between the original parties to the instrument to recover upon a promissory note for $200. There was evidence tending to show that interest in excess of twelve per cent was charged and paid. The defence is that the loan is in violation of the small loans act.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">It is provided by St. 1912, c. 675, \u00a7 5, that, \u201cWhoever not being duly licensed . . . engages in or carries on, directly or indirectly, either separately or in connection with or as a part of any other business, the business of making loans ... to which the provisions of this act apply, shall be punished. . . . And any loan made ... by an unlicensed person ... in violation of this act shall be void.\u201d Small loans are defined in the statute to be $300 or less. The plaintiff is not licensed. The evidence being uncontradicted that this was the only time the plaintiff ever lent a sum of money of an amount of $300 or less, the judge found that \u201cthe plaintiff was not engaged, either directly or indirectly, in the business of making [small] loans\u201d under the statute. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The question presented is whether a single loan for less than $300 at more than twelve per cent interest by one not engaged in the business of making small loans is void under the statute. The statute does not prohibit all such loans except by licensed persons. It simply forbids the making of such loans as a business unless one is licensed. The making of a single loan might be sufficient under appropriate circumstances to warrant a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>that the one making the loan was carrying on the business. But it does not require such a finding. The statute declares void only-loans made in violation of the act, that is, those made as a part of carrying on the business of making such loans by one who is unlicensed. The statute does not inhibit the making of one such loan by a person not engaged in that business. The occupation and not the isolated act is interdicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
