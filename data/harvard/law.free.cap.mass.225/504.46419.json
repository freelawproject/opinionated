If the policies which the defendant desired to see carried out were to prevail, it was important that he and his. friends should control a majority of the stock at the time of the annual meetings. Care was needed constantly to maintain such a majority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-9\">In 1908, one Petts, one of the dissatisfied stockholders, was making an effort to secure shares of stock in order to be able successfully to oppose the influence and policies of the defendant. Information in regard to this reached the defendant and his friends in the directorate; and they also learned that there was an opportunity to head off the acquisition of stock by Petts through the purchase of certain blocks of stock. After informal consultation, it was decided to buy in these blocks of stock. Six hundred and ten shares were secured in accordance with this decision at different\" times between April and October, 1908. They were paid for in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>following way: the defendant and one Heffernan, and possibly one Doherty, went to the National Shawmut Bank and explained a desire to get stock for the corporation. The defendant guaranteed the National Shawmut Bank, and it, with its money, purchased the stock from the owners, paying the prices which the defendant directed, and taking the certificates which came to it in the form of \u201cstreet certificates.\u201d These it later transferred into the name of Henry F. Smith, an employee of the bank and a friend, at that time, of the defendant. The negotiations with the former owners and the determination of the price to be given for the stock were carried out by the defendant or under his direction, and he notified the bank what and whom to pay. Various prices were paid for this stock; some of them rather more than the market value of the stock, but, in the main, not more was paid for these six hundred and ten shares than the price which then, owing to Petts\u2019 operations, could have been obtained for the stock in the market. This stock continued to remain in the name of Smith, who, however, indorsed the certificates in blank and handed them to the defendant, and the latter kept them in his safe deposit box. Proxies were given to the defendant, and the six hundred and ten shares were voted for directors and officers in. sympathy with the policies of the defendant and his friends. No note nor obligation was given to the bank by the corporation. The transaction was to be kept secret until an opportune time came for the corporation openly to acquire the stock. The originators of the plan intended that the corporation eventually should pay for the stock and own it, and believed this to be a benefit to the corporation. There was no formal action of the directors, and it is possible that one or two of them did not know of the plan and its carrying out; but McCormick, Heffernan, Doherty and others, \u2014 a majority of the board of directors, \u2014 did know and approve of the plan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-5\">.The management was working in the interest and for the benefit of the corporation, and the maintenance of their policies was advantageous to the corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-6\">In 1912 the defendant, desiring to sever his official relations with the corporation, wished to get relief from his guarantee to the National Shawmut Bank; he did not desire to own the Smith stock personally, and he brought up the matter of carrying out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the rest of the transaction in regard to the Smith stock in conversation with the directors familiar with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-3\">At a meeting of the directors on November 13, 1912, five of the seven directors were present, \u2014 Heffernan, Gately, Logan, the defendant and Sullivan. All but Sullivan had been directors since the organization of the corporation, and Heffernan, the defendant and Logan were familiar with this transaction. Gately was a \u201cnominal\u201d director only. Sullivan, at that time and now the president of the corporation, was a large owner of stock, all of which he had purchased later than 1910 at a less price than the prices paid by the National Shawmut .Bank for the Smith stock, and he was ignorant of the Smith transaction. The absent directors were Doherty and Petts, of whom Doherty was familiar with the Smith transaction and Petts was the man it had been directed against.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-4\">After some discussion, which, however, did not inform Sullivan or Gately in regard to the early history of the matter, but in which the defendant stated that it would be a good idea to have the stock in the treasury, as it would lessen the outstanding stock and make dividends more probable, the following vote, prepared by Logan and offered by Gately, was passed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\">\u201cIt was moved by Mr. Gately and seconded by Mr. Sullivan that the treasurer, Thomas McCormick, be authorized and empowered to pinchase in behalf of the Commercial Brewing Company the six hundred and ten shares of stock of said company now held by Henry F. Smith, and place the same in the treasury as treasury stock, and it was so voted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-6\">Some six months later, on June 14, 1913, the defendant carried out this vote and made the purchase. He paid to the National Shawmut Bank $34,126.75, the amount it paid originally for the stock, with interest to that date, \u2014 a sum considerably larger than the fair market price of the stock on the day of this purchase. This purchase was made by the defendant in part with money obtained by him by discounting the notes of the corporation at the International Trust Company. These notes were signed by him as the treasurer of the corporation. He did not inform the board of directors what price he was about to pay for the Smith stock. The by-laws of the corporation provided that all notes should be signed by the president and the -treasurer jointly, and that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>money for extraordinary purposes should be borrowed without obtaining the consent of the board of directors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-5\">As a result, the defendant was protected on his guarantee and had had the benefit of the stock for the control of the corporation from the time of the purchase by the bank until the purchase by the corporation. The possession of these six hundred and ten shares by the defendant was not enough to maintain a control of the corporation unless other shares, which he did not control,, voted in accordance with his policies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-6\">The transaction was probably of real benefit to the corporation, and the defendants purpose was to benefit the corporation and to secure his own way, rather than to make money or to gain pecuniary advantage for himself out of the transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-7\">The entire transaction was carried out in accordance with the understanding of those who had planned it originally; and they, as already stated, were a majority of the directors of the corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-8\">The defendant resigned as treasurer on June 26, 1913. Sometime after the purchase, and after his resignation, Doherty, learning for the first time what had been paid for the stock, immediately objected and brought the matter again to the attention of the-directors and stockholders by a letter addressed to them and dated August 29, 1914, with the result that this bill in equity was begun.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-9\">The judge stated: \u201cI am unable from the evidence and the-records of the corporation to find that any action was ever taken by the board of directors authorizing the original purchase or approving of the plan; and I find and rule that the original acquisition by Smith was not a purchase by the corporation. The vote of the directors in November, 1912, was valid, and was not procured by any undue influence of Mr. McCormick or his friends.. I construe that vote to authorize and require a purchase at the fair market value of the stock at the date of the purchase by the corporation thereunder, although three of the five who voted for it may have intended it to authorize a purchase for the price-originally given with carrying charges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-10\">\u201cI find the fair market value at the time of the purchase to have been $35 per share.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-11\">By order of the judge a final decree was entered directing the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $12,776.75, being the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>difference between $21,350, the fair market value at which he was authorized to purchase the stock, and $34,126.75, the amount which he actually paid to the National Shawmut Bank for the stock, together with interest from June 14, 1913, amounting in all to $14,788, and awarding costs to the plaintiff. The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-3\"><em>F. L. Norton, (G. H.

Smith, \u2014 an employee of the bank and friend of the defendant, \u2014 at the request of the defendant with the individual approval of a majority of the persons who with him constituted the directorate of the Commercial Brewing Company, the indorsement in blank and delivery of stock and proxies to the defendant for the purpose of ensuring the annual election of a board of directors whose votes would support and sustain him in retaining the control of the management and the direction and determination of the policies of the corporation, until an opportune time came for the corporation openly to acquire and pay for the stock, were inoperative, \u2014 even if conceded to be beneficial to the corporation, \u2014 to bind the corporation to pay for the stock on demand and tender of the certificates or to raise an implied promise binding the corporation to save the defendant harmless upon his guarantee of the purchase price to the bank, for the reason that the purchase, transfers and plan were always intentionally kept secret from the minority of the board of directors and were assented to and approved by the majority of the board acting individually and not collectively.

Cook on Corporations, (7th ed.) \u00a7 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The vote of the board of directors in 1912, whereby the treasurer, the defendant, was authorized and empowered to purchase the stock \u201cnow held by Henry F. Smith,\u201d was not in terms a ratification of the purchase of stock and of the plan to.use it in furtherance of the policies of the defendant until an opportune time came to transfer it to the corporation; nor can the vote by implication be held to ratify and adopt the irregular action of the individual majority members of the board of 1908, because a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>minority of the board authorizing the purchase of the Smith stock were ignorant of, and intentionally kept in ignorance of, the purchase and the scheme and plan for the use and final disposition of the stock assented to, adopted and finally carried out by the individual members, who in 1908 as in 1912 constituted a majority of the members of the board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">A majority only of the board of directors knew that since 1908 the treasurer, the defendant, had held the legal title to the stock standing on the stock books of the corporation in the name of Henry F.
