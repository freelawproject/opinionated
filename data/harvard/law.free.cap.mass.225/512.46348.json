Writ dated August 29, 1911; and Contract by the defendants in the first action against the plaintiff in that action, alleging that on August 5, 1910, they entered into a contract with the defendant Ozzola by which he agreed to sell and deliver to the plaintiffs five hundred loaves of Reggiano cheese, that the plaintiffs were at all times ready and willing to perform their part of the contract but. that the defendant utterly refused to deliver the cheeses as agreed. Writ dated November 18, 1912.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-6\">In the Superior Court the cases were tried together before <em>Aiken, </em>C.

The facts that could have been found upon the evidence are described briefly in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-7\">The letter of Musolino and Berger to Ozzola, referred to in the opinion, was dated at Boston, August 5, 1910, and was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-8\">\u201cTo your favors of the 11th and 20th ult.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-9\">\u201cReggiano.

On all the evidence the Court must find that there was a binding contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants whereby the defendants were bound to ship cheese to the plaintiffs, and that the defendants failed to carry out their contract and committed a breach thereof, and for such breach the plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-10\">\"6. The plaintiffs are entitled to recover from the defendants the difference between the price specified in the contract, namely, 210 lire per quintal, and the price which would have to be paid for cheese at the time and place specified in the contract for delivery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-11\">The Chief Justice refused to make these and other rulings and found for the defendant.

They agree that they realized from the sale of it an amount substantially equal to the price charged by the plaintiff. They also contend that they sold the cheese for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s account, and that they are entitled to deduct from the amount received a commission on the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The plaintiff lives in Italy and the defendants\u2019 place of business is in Boston. The negotiations between the parties were conducted wholly by correspondence, which appears in the bill of exceptions. Whether the goods were sold directly to the defendants or were shipped to them on consignment to be sold on the plaintiff\u2019s account, was a question to be determined by the trial judge upon the evidence as disclosed by the correspondence. <em>1 </em>Upon this evidence the defendants were liable as matter of law as purchasers of the goods for the contract price. Accordingly their request for a ruling could not have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The second action is brought for breach of an alleged contract to deliver to the plaintiffs five hundred loaves of cheese. The question whether a binding contract was entered into between the parties is, in the first case, to be determined solely by their correspondence. A careful examination of the letters which passed between the parties, all of which we do not consider it necessary to refer to, shows that no binding contract was made before August 5, 1910. On that date by letter to Ozzola, Musolino and Berger accepted the offer that Ozzola had made in previous letters. Its binding force cannot be affected by Ozzola\u2019s letter of August 16, in which he writes that he cannot \u201cmake out\u201d whether the contract has been concluded or not. The letter of August 5 is definite and free from ambiguity; it contains a clear and unconditional acceptance of the defendant\u2019s offer, and there is nothing to show that the contract was afterwards waived by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">As the defendant in this action is liable for breach of contract in failing to deliver the goods, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover as damages the difference between the contract price and what the goods would have been worth at the time and place specified in the contract for delivery. The plaintiffs were entitled to have the judge make the rulings embodied in their second and sixth requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">If it is necessary, to protect the rights of the plaintiffs in this case, that further proceedings in the first case should be continued until the final disposition of this case, application for that purpose can be made in the Superior Court. R. L. c. 170, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages is to be determined in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\">It follows that in the first case the exceptions are overruled, and in the second case the exceptions are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
