A witness for the plaintiff testified that \u201cthe appearance of the pump and of the street in the photographs\u201d was the same as when he saw them the day after the injury. Subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, the presiding judge admitted the testimony of another witness that, from his observation of the pump four or five times a week for approximately four weeks preceding the injury and for two weeks after it, the representations in the photographs corresponded with his recollection. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was clearly admissible, its weight and application being for the jury under proper instructions.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-12\">In the same case it was <em>held </em>that the defendant\u2019s night watchman, called by the plaintiff as a witness, who had a fireman\u2019s license of the first class, properly was allowed to explain the location of the shut-off valve, which was not shown in the photographs, and also to state that the pump was a suction pump which would have to be primed with water \u201cin order to get a lift,\u201d this being competent to show the construction and method of operation of the pump.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-13\">In the same case it also was <em>held, </em>that the presiding judge was right in excluding the question, asked the defendant by his counsel, \u201cNow, was the way in which this pump was put in place and guarded by this fence the usual way in which pumps were installed and guarded in work of that kind?\u201d and in ruling that \u201cproof of the usual mode of installing and guarding similar pumps would not be a defence if the jury found that the defendant knew or in the exercise of due diligence should have known that, because of its location, the operation of the pump might endanger the safety of persons using the street.\u201d</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Tort for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff on June 26, 1913, when he was eight years of age, from being scalded by hot water from a steam pump maintained by the defendant in Cove Road, a public highway in New Bedford, where the defendant was engaged in constructing a sewer, it being alleged that the pump was left carelessly in the highway without guard, fence or warning and that it was operated negligently and recklessly. Writ dated October 11, 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-3\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>King, </em>J. It appeared that the plaintiff was playing marbles with another boy in the street and that one of the marbles rolled down under the pipe of the pump and that the plaintiff went to get it, when the water spirted out and scalded him. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,800; and the defendant alleged exceptions to the admission and exclusion of evidence which are described in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-4\"><em>II.

And, the plaintiff having recovered a verdict, the case is here on the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the admission and exclusion of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The plaintiff without objection having put in evidence certain photographs of the pump with its surroundings, which the jury could find were taken within four days after the accident and a witness for the plaintiff, whose evidence the jury were at liberty to believe, having testified that \u201cthe appearance of the pump and of the street in the photographs\u201d was the same as when he saw them the day after the injury, the testimony of another witness that from his observation of the pump four or five times a week for approximately four weeks preceding, and two weeks after the event, the representations in the photographs corresponded with his recollection, was clearly admissible. Its weight and application were for the jury under proper instructions. <em>Laplante </em>v. <em>Warren Cotton Mills, </em>165 Mass. 487, 489. <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Creamer, </em>160 Mass. 496. <em>White Sewing Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Phenix Nerve Beverage Co. </em>188 Mass. 407, 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The testimony of one Hall, the defendant\u2019s night watchman who operated the pump and had a fireman\u2019s license of the first class, presumably granted under R.

While the defendant was entitled, as the judge correctly ruled, \u201cto show ... in detail how that pump was placed, how it was guarded, and everything in that regard relevant or competent upon that point,\u201d proof of the usual mode of installing and guarding similar pumps would not be a defence if the jury found that the defendant knew or in the exercise of due diligence should have known that, because of its location, the operation of the pump might endanger the safety of persons using the street. <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Creamer, </em>160 Mass. 496, 498. <em>French </em>v. <em>Sabin, </em>202 Mass. 240, 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">We have considered all the exceptions which have been argued, and finding no error of law they must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
