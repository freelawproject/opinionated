Palmer, Dwight N. Carpenter and the executor of the will of Frank V. Doolittle, alleging in substance that the plaintiff, a real estate agent, was employed by Carpenter and Doolittle to sell for them a farm at Gill in this Commonwealth owned by them as tenants in common, they representing to him that the farm \u201cwould cut seventy tons of hay per year;\u201d that Palmer owned a farm in Newfane in Vermont and represented to the plaintiff that it was a good farm and \u201cwould cut forty tons of hay per year;\u201d that the plaintiff made to Palmer the representations as to the Gill farm that he had been authorized to make by Carpenter and Doolittle, and made to Carpenter and Doolittle the representations as to the Newfane farm that Palmer had made to him, and that negotiations resulted in an exchange; that subsequently Palmer brought an action at law in Vermont against the plaintiff and Carpenter and Doolittle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>sounding in tort for deceit; that in such action service was made upon the plaintiff but not upon Carpenter or Doolittle, and that it was the purpose of Palmer to discontinue that action as to Carpenter and Doolittle and to compel the plaintiff to defend as the sole defendant. On information and belief the plaintiff further averred that Palmer\u2019s representations as to the Newfane farm were false, but that such falsity was no defence to Palmer\u2019s action against him; that although by the laws of Vermont the plaintiff would have a right to compel Carpenter and the estate of Doolittle to indemnify him for loss sustained by reason of the representations as to the Gill farm made by him as their agent at their request, it was doubtful whether he could avail himself of such fact in defence of the action in Vermont, and that by reason of the above facts he would be compelled to engage in a multiplicity of suits causing great and irreparable loss, damage and injury to him. The prayer of the bill was for a permanent injunction preventing the prosecution of the action in Vermont.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\">In the Superior Court the suit was heard by Aiken, C.

L. c. 159, \u00a7 1, should have dismissed the bill in the exercise of its judicial discretion upon the grounds stated in <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>149 Mass. 52, 53, 56. <em>Kempson </em>v. <em>Kempson, </em>13 Dick. 94. The defendant Palmer, who is the appellant, not only was subject- to the territorial jurisdiction of the court, but appeared, answered and filed a cross bill. And after a trial on the merits a final decree was entered granting permanent injunctive relief as prayed for in the original bill. The defence, that for the wrongs complained of the plaintiff could have no relief in equity because he had a plain and adequate remedy at law which was available in the action pending against him in the courts of Vermont, could be taken advantage of only by demurrer, or setting up this defence specially in his answer. The objection comes too late after a defendant has answered generally, asked for relief by a cross bill, and submitted himself to the jurisdiction. <em>Tarbell </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>103 Mass. 341, 345. <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>133 Mass. 91, 102. <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>184 Mass. 221, 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s right to general relief having been settled, and the evidence not having been reported, the only question before us is whether the decree as to the appellant is warranted by the charging part of the bill and is consistent with the findings of the judge. <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>169 Mass. 52. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>182 Mass. 266, 267. <em>Kaatz </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>215 Mass. 311. We have considered all the questions argued and the decree being in accordance with these requirements cannot be reversed. But, as it appears that the cross bill was ordered dismissed without costs, the decree must be modified by the insertion of a clause to this effect and as thus modified it should be affirmed. <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Schofield, </em>211 Mass. 234, 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
