In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>14 Gray, 87, it was decided that it is a criminal offence at common law to procure a person summoned as a witness to absent himself from the trial. This decision was made on the authority of 4 Bl. Com. 126,1 Russ, on Crimes, (7th Am. ed.) 183, <em>State </em>v. <em>Keyes, </em>8 Vt. 57, <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>20 Vt. 9. Of these authorities <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter </em>is the only one where it affirmatively appears that the witness was under process to testify. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Keyes </em>it appeared affirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>tively that he was not. The language of the other authorities and the cases on which they are founded (see 1 Hawk. P. C. (8th ed.) c. 6, \u00a7 15; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Lawley, </em>2 Stra. 904) is general. In addition there is authority for the proposition-that the crime is made out although the person who is in fact a witness is not under process to attend. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>141 Ky. 477, and cases there cited. However that may be, there can be no doubt but that it is a criminal conspiracy to agree together to obstruct the course of justice by procuring a material witness to absent himself from the trial although he is not under process to attend. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>30 Maine, 132. <em>State </em>v. <em>De Witt, </em>2 Hill (S. C.) 282. <em>King </em>v. <em>Mawbey, </em>6 T. R. 619. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Hamp, </em>6 Cox C. C. 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">There is nothing in the suggestion that R. L. c. 210, \u00a7 37, defining the crime of compounding a felony, has impliedly brought to an end this common law crime. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">2. The indictment, although not well drawn, is sufficient at least under R. L. c. '218, \u00a7 34. After setting forth the pendency in court of a complaint against one Winter for the illegal sale of intoxicating liquor, and the fact that the defendant Perkins was a material witness at the trial thereon, the indictment in substance charges the defendants with having conspired to obstruct the course of justice by agreeing in consideration of the payment of $500 to bring it about that Perkins should absent himself from the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">It is not necessary to consider the cases relied on by the defendants decided before the enactment of what is now R. L. c. 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
