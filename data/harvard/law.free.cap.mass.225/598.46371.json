Lind, co-partners doing business under the firm name of Peterson and Lind, for personal injuries caused by the plaintiff falling through an unguarded trap-door in a bar room conducted by the defendants. Writ dated January 15, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-10\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Lawton, </em>J. The material facts relating to the death of the defendant Lind and the discontinuance of the action as to-his estate, and the evidence as to the plaintiff\u2019s due care are described in the opinion. The plaintiff contended and the evidence tended to show that the accident to the plaintiff was caused by the negligence of Lind alone. There was a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $160; and the defendant Peterson alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b624-11\"><em>J. M.

The action was founded upon the personal conduct of the deceased copartner.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The partners were liable jointly and also severally for the wrong of one committed in the course and within the scope of the business of the firm. <em>Lothrop </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>133 Mass. 471. <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Norcross, </em>172 Mass. 331, 337. <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Kavanaugh, </em>242 U. S. 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The discontinuance against one partner was not a release. It was no nearer a release than an agreement not to sue, which has been held not to be a release. <em>Matheson </em>v. <em>O\u2019Kane, </em>211 Mass. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The question of the plaintiff\u2019s due care was for the jury. He stepped backward, as he was leaving the bar room of the defendant, into a trap-door opened a moment before. The degree of light or darkness about the place is not plainly shown by the record. The cases of <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>White, </em>171 Mass. 170, and <em>Marwedel </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>154 Mass. 235, relied on by the defendant, are so clearly distinguishable that they need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
