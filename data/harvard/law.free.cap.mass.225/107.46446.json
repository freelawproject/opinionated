Writ dated August 19, 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-11\">The plaintiffs\u2019 declaration originally contained two counts. A demurrer of the defendants was sustained by <em>Callahan, </em>J., and thereafter the plaintiffs amended their declaration by inserting certain words in the first and second counts and adding a third count which was not demurred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-12\">The first and second counts of the amended declaration were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-13\">\u201cFirst Count: Now come the plaintiffs in the above entitled action and say that the defendants, without justifiable cause, and maliciously intending and designing to injure the plaintiffs in their business, did conspire together to deprive the plaintiffs of means of carrying on their business by attempting to prevent and by preventing the plaintiffs from employing master masons and journeymen masons in their business, and for said purpose did circulate a certain communication, a copy whereof is hereto annexed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>marked \u2018A,\u2019 among masons and journeymen masons; and the plaintiffs say that as a result of the circulation of said statement they have been and \u00e1re prevented from employing or contracting with master masons or journeymen masons, and from carrying on their business, and have suffered great loss and damage by reason thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-5\">\u201cSecond Count: \u2014 And the plaintiffs say that the defendants are members of an association known as \u2018Bricklayers\u2019 and Plasterers\u2019 Union No. 36,\u2019 operating in Greenfield, in said County of Franklin; that said organization, intending and designing to injure the plaintiffs in their business, and without justifiable cause, did pass a certain vote, copy whereof is hereto annexed, marked \u2018A,\u2019 and did circulate said vote among master masons and journeymen masons, with intent and for the purpose of preventing the plaintiffs from employing or contracting with said master masons and journeymen masons to perform services for them, and the plaintiffs say that the defendants, by the circulation, have heretofore deprived and are now depriving the plaintiffs of their right to employ or contract with said master masons and journeymen masons by intimidating said master masons and journeymen masons, and the plaintiffs have suffered great damage thereby.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-6\">The copy marked A annexed to the declaration was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\">\u201cBricklayers\u2019 and Plasterers\u2019 Union No. 36 of Massachusetts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-8\">Headquarters Meetings</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-9\">304 Main Street. 1st and 3d Wednesday Evenings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-10\">Greenfield, Mass., July 11, 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-11\">A. 0.

The charge, otherwise stated, is that the defendants intended to cause damage to the plaintiffs and used the notice as a means to that end, well knowing that the class of persons to whom the notice was directed would be induced thereby to refuse to have business relations with a firm that employed non-union workmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">There is nothing in the allegations to the effect that the plaintiffs were in dispute with employees or with the union, and, so far as may be inferred, the action of the defendants as members of their union was taken with a purpose to cause damage to the plaintiffs because of their relation to unionism, with the motive to thereby strengthen the local union and place it in better position to assert its demands for a union shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">This motive, if it existed, affords no justification or excuse for their conduct. <em>Hartnett </em>v. <em>Plumbers\u2019 Supply Association, </em>169 Mass. 229, 235. <em>Plant </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>176 Mass. 492. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>198 Mass. 294. <em>Folsom </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>208 Mass. 336. <em>Hoban </em>v. <em>Dempsey, </em>217 Mass. 166, 171. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>217 Mass. 351. It follows that the demurrer to the first amended count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>should have been overruled. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>107 Mass. 555, 562. <em>Sherry </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>147 Mass. 212. <em>Morasse </em>v. <em>Brochu, </em>151 Mass. 567. <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Dunphy, </em>177 Mass. 485. <em>Pickett </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>192 Mass. 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The demurrer to the amended second count was sustained rightly, as that count contains no allegation that the defendants voted or otherwise acted or assented to the vote or to the circulation of a copy of the vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\n<em>Demurrer to first count overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">\n<em>Demurrer to second count sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
