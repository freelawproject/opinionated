More than nine years later the inventor brought a suit in equity against the corporation for royalties alleged to have become due to him since the close of the three year term of the first contract. <em>Held, </em>that the suit must be dismissed because from the express provisions of the contract and also from the conduct of the parties the first contract was terminated when the employment of the inventor ceased at the end of the three years, and that his retainer as a consulting expert was not continued employment under the first contract.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-9\">Bill in equity, filed in the Superior Court on April 29, 1915, for an accounting as to royalties alleged to be due to the plaintiff from the defendant under the provisions of an agreement between them dated January 27, 1903, and relating to employment of the plaintiff by the defendant and royalties to be paid to the plaintiff upon an invention called the \u201c Perfection Nail.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-10\">The suit was referred to a master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-11\">The master found that the contract in question was as follows: \u201c1. The Morley Button Manufacturing Co. agrees to pay R. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Ellery for services a salary of $30.00 a week for three years from Jan. 1, 1903, and a royalty of 4 cts. per M on such Perfection Nails as it shall make and sell during a term of three years from January 1,1903, guaranteeing that said royalty shall amount to $50.00 per month. The first payment of $50.00 to be made February 1st, and $50.00 the first of each month following during the period of three years above mentioned.

That is, if thereafter, the Perfection Nail should prove unsatisfactory or unprofitable and the Morley Button Company should, manufacture at a profit any other article invented by Mr. Ellery, the Morley Co. shall continue to pay said Ellery $50.00 a month. It is understood that if the Perfection Nail does prove satisfactory, the royalty of 4 cts. is to continue with a guaranteed royalty of $50.00 per month. If royalties on Perfection Nails continue the amount of $50.00 or more all other articles shall be free from royalty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-4\">\u201c3.

Dated at Portsmouth, Jan. 27, 1903.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">The master further found as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-6\">\u201cAbout two months prior to January 1, 1906, the plaintiff and Merrill had a conversation, in which the former asked if the contract was to continue after the first of January and the latter replied that the defendant would not continue it, and the plaintiff then said that he \u2018should have to look around for something else to do.\u2019 He did not then ask Merrill to see a copy of the contract. On January 1, 1906, the plaintiff physically left the defendant\u2019s employ and never since has done any work for the defendant or performed any duties similar to those which he had been performing for a long time prior thereto. He then began to take measures to form a new corporation ... for the purpose of competing with the defendant ...</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-7\">\u201cAs a result of . . . negotiations the parties, on February 19, 1906, executed the following instrument: \u2018The undersigned, R. L. Ellery of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, having been for many years in the employ of the undersigned Morley Button Manufacturing Company, a Maine corporation, and being desirous of getting out into a different line of business, and the company desiring to retain Mr. Ellery as a consulting expert in its business, in consideration of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) paid to-day by the company to Mr. Ellery, receipt of which he acknowledges, he (R. L. Ellery) agrees that for a term of fifteen years from date, he will engage to hold for the benefit of the Morley Button Manufacturing Company his knowledge and experience of the business of manufacturing and selling shoe buttons, gaiter buttons, tufting buttons (including both shank and clinch tufting buttons of all kinds), washers, collar buttons, upholstery nails and ring travelers, and for the purpose of securing to the company the full benefit of the service intended to be covered by this retainer, he agrees that he wrill not directly or indirectly engage in or aid others to engage in any of the above named businesses in a manner that will be in any way detrimental to or conflict with the interests of the Morley Button Manufacturing Company. It is understood that future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>services or consultations involving any appreciable amount of work which Mr. Ellery may actually perform for the company under this agreement shall be paid for by the company in addition to the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) already paid, at a rate to be satisfactory to Mr. Ellery, but to be named by him when possible in advance of his commencing to perform the special service, and it is also agreed that the company shall not have the right to demand that Mr. Ellery leave or neglect any outside business in which he may at the time be engaged for the purpose of consultations or performing service for the Company as provided in this agreement, but that such service may be rendered at such times as Mr. Ellery can arrange, so as not to conflict with his outside interests.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-4\">\u201cThe sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) was paid by the defendant to the plaintiff on the date of the contract above set out; and such payment was intended and received as a retainer, and not in lieu of royalties, or in settlement of all claims. The various businesses which are mentioned in the above contract were all businesses in which the defendant was engaged at the time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">Other material facts found by the master are stated in the opinion. Exceptions by the plaintiff to the master\u2019s report were heard by <em>Fox, </em>J., by whose order an interlocutory decree overruling the exceptions and confirming the report and a final decree dismissing the bill with costs were entered. The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-6\"><em>F. L. Simpson, (F. E. Knowles &amp; L. Swig </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-7\"><em>N. W. Bingham, Jr., </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b523-8\">De Courcy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arq5\">The plaintiff, who for years had been the foreman of the finishing department in the defendant\u2019s factory in 1902 invented a device called the \u201cPerfection Nail\u201d which was an improvement on an upholstering nail manufactured by the defendant. This invention he sold to the defendant in May, 1902, for a royalty aggregating $500, which was fully paid to him by October of that year. In January he took steps to start a company that would compete with the defendant, but, after a conference with one Merrill, the defendant\u2019s treasurer, he executed the written agreement dated January 27, 1903, on which the present suit for royalties is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>It is the contention of the plaintiff that under this contract of 1903 he was entitled to royalties so long as the defendant continued to manufacture the \u201cPerfection Nail\u201d at a profit, regardless of whether he remained in its employ; or, if any physical service by him was essential, that there was in fact such continuous service as the contract required down to the filing of this bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The contract of 1903 was drawn up by the defendant\u2019s treasurer without legal advice, and its interpretation is not free from difficulty. There is force in the argument of the plaintiff, that what the contract contemplated was, to obtain the inventions which the plaintiff might make and to avoid his active competition. But by its terms it contemplated also his physical services. It recited that the defendant \u201cis desirous that said R. L. Ellery shall remain in their employ.\u201d The royalty in excess of $50 per month was to be paid quarterly \u201cas soon after receipt of R. L. Ellery\u2019s report of nails shipped and checking of same as convenient.\u201d Paragraph 5 expressly stipulated: \"R. L. Ellery agrees to remain with the Morley Button Manufacturing Co. on these terms for a period of .at least three years. Should he at any time leave the employ of the Morley Manufacturing Co. this agreement is to cease without notice from either party. It is understood that this agreement shall stand after said three years, so long as the Morley Co. shall continue to employ R. L. Ellery and continue to manufacture articles invented by said Ellery.\u201d From these and other provisions it seems plain, notwithstanding the ambiguity of one isolated clause in paragraph 2, that the agreement contemplated the employment of the plaintiff; and in fact he continued in such employ until January 1, 1906. All the royalties due for that period were paid to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">One of the provisions of the second paragraph was: \u201cAt the end of three years from January 1,1903, the Morley Button Manufacturing Company, if it shall continue thereafter to employ said Ellery, shall pay said Ellery a royalty of at least $50.00 per month, if it shall manufacture at a fair profit any article invented by R. L. Ellery.\u201d The master finds that on January 1, 1906, the plaintiff physically left the defendant\u2019s employ and never since has done any work for the defendant nor performed any duties similar to those which he had been performing. In January he started measures to form a. new corporation; but after some negotiations with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>defendant\u2019s treasurer the parties executed the agreement of February 19,1906. The 1906 agreement did not purport to continue the plaintiff in the defendant\u2019s employment. On the contrary it recited that, \u201chaving been for many years in the employ of\u201d the defendant, he was \u201cdesirous of getting out into a different line of business.\u201d It seems quite apparent in the light of the circumstances that the main purpose of the retainer of $10,000 was to prevent competition by the plaintiff. His possible future services under the agreement were to be rendered only if and when they would not conflict with his outside business. If there were any doubt as to whether after the execution of the 1906 contract the defendant did \u201ccontinue ... to employ said Ellery\u201d under the 1903 agreement, thereby entitling him to continuing royalties, the construction placed on the earlier agreement by the parties themselves, as manifested by their conduct, plainly was that the 1903 contract ended for all purposes after the term of three years. For more than nine years thereafter the plaintiff made no claim on the defendant for royalties and never asked for any report of the number of \u201cPerfection Nails\u201d which had been sold. During all this interval he was engaged in a business on his own account. The master has found that \u201cAt the time when the parties signed the agreement of 1906, both understood that there was no subsisting rights or liabilities under the agreement of 1903.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">In view of our interpretation of the 1903 agreement, it is unnecessary to consider the defences of loches and the* statute of limitations. The interlocutory decree confirming the master\u2019s report, and the final decree dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s bill, must be affirmed with costs; and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
