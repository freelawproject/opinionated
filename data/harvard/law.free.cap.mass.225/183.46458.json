She went into the house and came out bringing some of his clothes which she gave to him, saying, \u2018Now get out of my sight; I never want to see you again; I will never live with you again.\u2019 Immediately following the words quoted, the wife went toward her sister\u2019s house and the man toward the water-front, and-they have never since lived together, and neither party has since asked the other to live with him or her.\u201d The judge then said, \u201cUpon the foregoing facts, I am not satisfied that the libellee deserted the libellant, and therefore, shall dismiss the libel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The only question before us is whether the judge erred in refusing to rule, as requested, that the libellant was entitled to a decree of divorce. The burden was on the libellant to satisfy the judge that the libellee voluntarily and without justification left him with the intention of not returning; that her refusal to cohabit with him continued for three consecutive years next prior to the filing of the libel; and that he did not consent to the original separation or to its continuance. Separation by mutual consent does not constitute desertion. R. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1. <em>Lea </em>v. <em>Lea, </em>8 Allen, 418. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>143 Mass. 577. <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>160 Mass. 258. The judge found that the allegation of desertion was not in fact proved. Even assuming that he credited the testimony of the libellant, he well may have inferred from his conduct that the separation was not against the will of the husband but was with his consent. There were facts indicating such consent; among others, his lack of effort to find his wife when he found the house closed; his visit with her to the house, apparently to get his clothes; his acquiescence in her excited declaration that she would not live with him; and his failure for three years afterwards to ask his wife to come back or to make any attempt to effect a reconciliation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>We cannot say as matter of law that the judge was wrong in finding that a case of desertion was not made out. Having so found, he could not give the ruling requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
