Evidence as to the defendant's financial condition was as follows: The defendant stated that he was born and always had lived in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and he had been in the garage business there, owning a garage, since-November, 1911. The garage business done by him consisted in part of repairing and of a very little storage. The garage property was subject to mortgages for a greater amount than \u201c it will bring.\u201d' He had been interested \u201cto a very small amount\u201d in a small corporation engaged in the fish business, which he said had been \u201cpractically dissolved\u201d in the year 1914, and he was not then interested in the fish business, and was hot doing business in the form of a corporation at the time of the trial. There was real estate which was assessed for $9,000 for taxation, the legal title to which was. in the defendant at the time of the trial and which had been owned by the defendant continuously since a time earlier than June 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>1910. He bought this real estate for $8,000 in November, 1911, and gave a mortgage back for $8,000 and had paid no interest on it after the first year of the mortgage. He had no other real estate and no automobile \u201cin the name of\u201d anybody. He had borrowed no money anywhere during the last year before the trial, which was on November 4, 1915, and had not borrowed money in the year 1911. He did not have to have any money to go into the garage business. He had not borrowed any money at all during the last six years before the trial. He did his banking with a national bank in Gloucester, but never had had a balance as large as $500 to his credit. He was the only person who ever had been interested financially in the garage business run by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-5\">Other material evidence is described in the opinion.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ana\">This is an action upon a promissory note. The defence is the statute of limitations. The plaintiff contends in avoidance of that defence that the evidence showed a sufficient acknowledgment and promise in writing within R. L. c. 202, \u00a7 12. Reliance in support of that contention is placed upon two letters of the defendant. The one under date of June 16, 1910, was written to the plaintiff\u2019s wife some time before the expiration of six years from the time of the last payment on the note. Its pertinent words are, \u201cI have received a notice ... in regard to the note of $500. . . . Now this seems very hard to me, as you well know that I should have paid the note and interest long ago if I had been able. . . . It seems as if in our relations that you might give me a little better chance than to place this in the hands of an attorney for collection, as you well know that you will get your money some day with interest if it is .any way possible for me to do it.\u201d Whatever else may be said about these words, it is plain that at most they amount only to a conditional promise to pay when the promisor is able. There is no evidence in the record that the condition has been performed by his becoming able to pay. <em>Mitchell\u2019s claim, </em>L.
