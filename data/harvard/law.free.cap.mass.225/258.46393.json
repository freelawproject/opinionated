The evidence before the arbitration committee as reported.by the Industrial Accident Board is described in the opinion. The board found \u201cthat the personal injury received by Charles Moore on Saturday, June 26, 1915, did not arise out of his employment, that it occurred as the result of fooling between Moore and Bourne, and that the employee is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>not entitled to compensation for the incapacity for work resulting from an injury caused by such fooling.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\">The judge made a decree affirming the decision of the Industrial Accident Board, and adjudged that the injury to the employee did not arise out of and in the course of his employment and that the employee was not entitled to compensation under the act. The employee appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-7\"><em>G.

Two other employees, Bourne and Patrowsky, were being carried on the elevator; and it was ascending from the first to the second floor at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">On conflicting testimony the arbitration committee, and later the Industrial Accident Board, .found in substance that Moore left his position at the elevator rope and took hold of the colored boy Bourne by the chest; that Bourne pushed him back and he (Moore) fell down, and that in the scuffle or \u201cfooling\u201d Moore\u2019s heel was caught and injured. The finding of the board that the injury \u201coccurred as the result of fooling between Moore and Bourne\u201d is as conclusive on the employee as the verdict of a jury. It must stand if there was any evidence to warrant it. <em>Diaz\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 36. An examination of the record shows that the finding was amply supported by the testimony of Patrowsky, corroborated by that of the foreman Graff.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">On the facts as found the board rightly ruled that the employee\u2019s injury \u201cdid not arise out of his employment.\u201d His foot got beyond the edge of the elevator floor in consequence of a scuffle in which he himself was the aggressor and after he had abandoned his post of duty at the elevator rope. The injury thereby suffered did not originate in any risk connected with and caused by his employment. See <em>Wrigley </em>v. <em>Nasmyth Wilson &amp; Co. Ltd. </em>6 B. W. C.
