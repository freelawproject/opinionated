There was evidence tending to show that, on December 1, 1913, Sulo Siira, Aksel Salmi and Nestor Sporoos gave a mortgage, which belonged to the plaintiffs at the time of the foreclosure hereinafter described, of certain specifically described personal property \u201cand all other property whatever name or description, now located at number 109 Mechanic Street, in\u201d Fitchburg to secure the payment of $1,100; that on November 2, 1914, the plaintiffs foreclosed the mortgage by taking possession of the goods then in the store, including those described in the declaration; that on November 5, 1914, the defendant entered upon the store premises and, on a writ against Alfred Talvola, Axel Salmi, Suli Siira, Nestor Sporoos, Ivar Aglen and John ICerenen, doing business as the Finnish Baking Company, took possession only of the goods described in the declaration and removed them, and that none of the goods taken possession of by the defendant were on the store premises when the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage was given and recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-6\">It was admitted by the defendant that the value of the property taken by him was $311.71, and that there was a breach of the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage at the time of foreclosure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-7\">At the close of the evidence the plaintiffs requested the judge to rule and instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-8\">\u201c1. On all the evidence you must return a verdict for the plaintiffs for such sum as you may find from the evidence to be a fair market value of the property in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-9\">\u201c 2.

In this case the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the fair market value of the property if you find from the evidence that the defendant carried the property away, or caused it to be carried away by his agents or servants, against the will and without the consent of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-11\">\u201c4. I instruct you, as a matter of law, that on the evidence produced, the plaintiffs were in possession of the property in question at the time of the alleged conversion of the same by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201c5. If an officer, or his agents and servants, acting under him, break open a dwelling-house or such shop or other part of a dwelling-house that comes under the same roof and protection of a dwelling-house itself, for the purpose of making an attachment of the property therein, without the owner\u2019s consent, he is a trespasser and such attachment so made by means of such unlawful breaking is invalid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\">\u2022 <em>\u201c7. </em>If you find from the evidence that the plaintiffs were in possession of the property in question, under their mortgage, for the purpose of foreclosing the mortgage at the time of the alleged conversion, then the burden is on the defendant to prove that the property was not embraced in the mortgage executed and delivered to the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">The requests were refused. In the course of his charge the judge, subject to an exception by the plaintiffs, instructed the jury as follows: <em>\u201cSo </em>far as this case is concerned I am going to ask you also to determine the question as to whether or not the property in question was the property of the five men who are mentioned in the writ under which the defendant made the attachment and removed it, or whether it was the property of any of the five. . . . If you should find . . . that the property in that store was the property of these five defendants or three of them or any of them,, and this officer went there with the writ and took the property away he would be justified in what he did, if you are satisfied that it was the property of these defendants or any of them because he was representing the creditor, or he was representing at least the man who pretended and claimed to be a creditor of these five defendants, and if you find the property was theirs, he would have a right under that writ to attach it and take it away and would xpot be liable in this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-7\">The judge submitted special questions to the jury, which, with the jury\u2019s answers thereto, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-8\">\"1. Was the property described in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration included in the property mentioned and described in the mortgage from Sulo Siira and others to Ida Nurminen as shown in exhibit one?\u201d The jury answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-9\">\u201c2. Was the property described in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration the property of the several defendants or any of them mentioned and described in the writ under which they were attached and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>removed by Horace F. Gove, the defendant in this action?\u201d The jury answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-5\">There was a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-6\">The case was -submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-7\"><em>J.

It is familiar law, however, that even if possession for the purposes of foreclosure had been taken, the title to after acquired property would not pass in the absence of a provision in the mortgage to that effect, which is not shown by the record. <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Cooke, </em>144 Mass. 207, 222, 223. It appears that nearly a year had elapsed between the date of the mortgage and the commencement of proceedings to foreclose, during which the business of the bakery had been carried on by the mortgagors, and the jury were warranted upon conflicting evidence in finding as they did in answer to the first question, that \u201cthe property described in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration\u201d had not been mentioned in or covered by the mortgage. It accordingly is plain that the first, second and third requests could not have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">But if the answer is conclusive on this issue, the plaintiffs further contend, that having taken possession before the defendant, a deputy sheriff, attached the goods on mesne process in an action against the mortgagors, they had a possessory title sufficient to enable them to recover damages. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Kaler, </em>106 Mass. 448, 449. It was discretionary with the presiding judge whether he would submit to the jury the second question, namely, \u201cWas the property described in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration the property of the several defendants or any of them mentioned and described in the writ under which they were attached and removed by . . . the defendant in this action?\u201d <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Brierley, </em>189 Mass. 598,604. The plaintiffs, on whom the burden of proof rested, could not recover unless at the time the goods were attached and removed by the defendant they had therein a complete property, either general or special, as well as actual possession or the right to immediate possession. <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>George, </em>206 Mass. 566, 570. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>And the affirmative answer to this question having been fully-justified by the evidence, the fourth and fifth requests became immaterial, while the seventh was properly refused. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Kaler, </em>106 Mass. 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The property in question having been in the bake shop, the jury were also rightly instructed that if when seized they found it belonged to the mortgagors, the defendant had the right of removal for which he incurred no liability to the plaintiffs. <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>16 Pick. 553, 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
