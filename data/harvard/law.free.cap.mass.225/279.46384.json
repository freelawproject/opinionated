The plaintiff made no offer of proof and no statement showing what answer was expected. <em>Held, </em>that it could not be said as matter of law that the exclusion of the question was wrong.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Tort for personal injuries sustained on May 19, 1906, when the plaintiff, who was an expressman and had been sent to receive certain ice to be delivered by the defendant from a freight car at the Union Freight car yard back of Commercial Wharf in Boston, was alleged to have been struck with an ice pick by reason of the negligence of a servant of the defendant in handling the ice. Writ dated March 15, 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-5\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Brown, </em>J.

It is apparent from the plaintiff\u2019s uncontradicted testimony that he was not required to assist in loading the ice, and until it was loaded he \u201chad nothing in particular to do in the car.\u201d If nothing more appeared he must be held while in the car to have been at most a mere licensee to whom the defendant owed no duty except to refrain from the infliction of wilful injury, of which there is no evidence. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>United Fruit Co. </em>223 Mass. 300, 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">But to meet this initial difficulty, and, after the plaintiff in cross-examination had reiterated that he had \u201cnothing to do there except to wait for the ice,\u201d he was asked in redirect examination, \u201cWas there any reason other than you testified to? \u201d when there followed a colloquy between counsel for the plaintiff and the presiding judge during which the judge said, \u201cHis duty did not call him in there,\u201d and the witness, interposing, said, \u201cNot at that time.\u201d While the witness immediately was told by his counsel \u201c Don\u2019t you answer,\u201d it is clear from all of his evidence, including this statement, that unless some sufficient reason not pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>viously disclosed was given for Ms presence in the car Ms rights had not been enlarged, and he could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">The question finally having been excluded, the plaintiff contends there was error and that a new trial should be granted. But no offer of proof, nor any statement showing the answer expected was made. Nor can we infer from the record what the answer might have been. Under such circumstances it cannot be held as matter of law that the ruling was wrong. <em>Bachant </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>187 Mass. 392, 396. <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>214 Mass. 568, 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
