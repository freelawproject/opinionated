The defendants\u2019 motion was not verified by affidavit, no evidence was offered in support thereof, and the facts on which the defendants relied were not admitted by the plaintiff.. After hearing, and upon consideration of the case, I denied the motion to recommit and ordered judgment on the auditor\u2019s report. To this action the defendants excepted. No other exceptions were taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-8\">\u201cThe matters referred to in paragraphs 5 to 12, both inclusive, of the defendants\u2019 bill of exceptions [relied upon by the defendants as the ground for recommitting the auditor\u2019s report and described briefly in the opinion] did not appear before me by any evidence or through any source admissible' as evidence, or by agreement of parties; and if I had been authorized to make any findings as to the same I could not have done so.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajk\">This is a petition to establish exceptions. The respondent, the plaintiff in the original action, moves that the petition be dismissed on the ground that it is apparent upon a cursory examination of the exceptions as filed that no substantial question of law is involved. The action is in contract. It was referred to an auditor with an agreement by the parties that his findings of fact should be final. The auditor\u2019s report was in favor of the plaintiff. Thereafter, the plaintiff moved that the report be confirmed and that judgment be rendered against the defendants. The defendants, the present petitioners, moved that the report be recommitted to the auditor because he did not show that an objection had been made to the introduction in evidence of a certain letter, whereas in truth such objection had been made, and that the auditor, although requested to make a statement of such ruling in his report, had not done so. St. 1914, c. 576, \u00a7 2, amending R. L. c. 165, \u00a7 55. The judge denied the motion of the defendants and granted that of the plaintiff. To this action an exception was taken, and this is the only exception alleged in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">This exception raises no question of law. The certificate of the Superior Court judge in disallowing the exceptions, the truth of which in this respect is not disputed by the petitioners, shows that the facts stated in their motion were not verified by affidavit, were not supported by any evidence and were not admitted by the opposing party. Under these circumstances it is too clear for discussion that the granting of the motion to recommit the case to the auditor rested wholly in the discretion of the judge. <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Peerless Motor Car Co. </em>212 Mass. 352, 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Since no substantial question of law is set forth in the bill of exceptions as filed and disallowed, the parties and the Commonwealth ought not to be put to the expense of a hearing on the petition to establish the exceptions, but the petition should be dismissed. <em>Bishop, petitioner, </em>208 Mass. 405, 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
