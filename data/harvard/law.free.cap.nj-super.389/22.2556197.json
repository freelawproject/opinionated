David was not married and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>no children. In October 1998, Minerva adopted Betty MacDonald, who was the daughter of her deceased twin sister. Particularly after David\u2019s death, Betty and Minerva became very close. It is undisputed that \u201cBetty provided the assistance and care Minerva and Sam required due to their advancing age [and that] Minerva was extremely grateful to Betty and wanted to ensure that this care would continue in the event Minerva predeceased Sam.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Minerva died on February 18, 1999, leaving a Last Will and Testament and a codicil, both dated November 23, 1998.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The will, which was admitted to probate on April 1, 1999, created the QTIP trusts. Article Third of Minerva\u2019s will directed that her residuary estate was to be divided into a \u201cSpouse\u2019s Part Trust\u201d and \u201cFamily Part Trust\u201d for Samuel\u2019s benefit during his life. Minerva\u2019s will further provided the manner in which the QTIP trusts would be distributed after his death and for the payment of estate taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Specifically, Article First of Minerva\u2019s will related to the payment of taxes on her estate. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">(b) I direct that all estate, inheritance, transfer, legacy or succession taxes, including state and federal, which may be assessed or imposed upon the transfer of any property under this Will, or upon property which may be part of my taxable estate for the purpose of any said tax shall, in the event my husband, SAMUEL LEE, survives me, be paid out of the Family Part of my residuary estate, as hereinafter defined in Article THIRD, it being my intention that the Spouse\u2019s Part and any other property passing to my husband which is not included in my estate for federal estate tax purposes be exonerated to the greatest extent possible from payment of all said state or federal taxes. In the event my said husband, SAMUEL, does not survive me, said taxes shall be paid out of my residuary estate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any tax shall be payable at, after or with respect to my death, pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 2036 (as permitted under 2207B), Section 2041 or Section 2044 or Chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or corresponding provision under state law, no part of such tax shall be paid from my estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Any estate and other related taxes due at my death by virtue of any charitable remainder unitrust or any other trust created by me during my lifetime, shall be payable from my residuary estate. It is my intent that the secondary beneficiaries of such trust\u00a9 shall not be liable for any of such taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Article Third divided the residuary estate into two parts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">In the event my husband, SAMUEL, shall survive me, my entire residuary estate shall be divided into the following two parts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">The first such part, hereinafter called the \u201cSpouse\u2019s Part,\u201d which shall constitute a pecuniary legacy and not a fractional share of my estate, shall be equal in value to that amount determined pursuant to Article TWELFTH of this Will.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">The second such part, hereinafter called the \u201cFamily Part,\u201d shall consist of the remainder of my estate after the allocation of assets to the \u201cSpouse\u2019s Part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Each part was then placed in trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Article Fourth embodied the residuary estate. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-11\">Upon the death of my husband, SAMUEL, any balance of property remaining in the trusts being administered under paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article THIRD, or in the event my said husband, SAMUEL, does not survive me, all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, as the case may be, I give, devise and bequeath to my trustees, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-12\">First, I give and bequeath the sum of One Hundred Sixty Five Thousand ($165,000.00) Dollars to my child, BETTY MacDONALD, absolutely and forever, if living, and if not, to her lawful issue, per stirpes, and if none, then this legacy shall lapse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Second, I give and bequeath the sum of Six Hundred Thousand ($600,000.00) Dollars to my trustees, hereinafter named, to be held for the benefit of my child, BETTY MacDONALD, for the following uses and purposes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">Third, <em>all the rest, residue and remainder </em>of my estate I give and bequeath as follows: <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">(1) One-half (J\u00e9) thereof I give, devise and bequeath to the Endowment Foundation of North Jersey and Greater Clifton-Passaie Federations [now known as \u201cUJA\u201d] ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">One-half (J\u00e9) thereof, I give, devise and bequeath to Stevens Institute of Technology, located in Hoboken, New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">As recited in the Settlement Agreement, \u201cMinerva\u2019s Executors elected to divide, and did divide, the Spouse\u2019s Part Trust into two separate trusts (collectively, the \u2018QTIP <em>Trusts\u2019), </em>and elected to treat the QTIP Trusts as qualified terminable interest property under \u00a7 2056(b)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\u201d That election deferred the tax on the trusts until Samuel\u2019s death when the value of the trusts became part of his gross estate<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> under 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2044.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">On November 23, 1998, Samuel executed a Last Will and Testament. He also executed codicils in August and September 2002. On February 26, 2003, he executed a new will which provided for charitable donations different than his wife\u2019s bequests and did not provide for Betty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Samuel died on March 12, 2003. In accordance with Minerva\u2019s will, the QTIP trusts were included as part of his taxable estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">On March 28, 2003, the executor appointed in Samuel\u2019s 2003 will filed a complaint in the Probate Part, seeking an order admitting the 2003 will to probate. Betty filed a caveat alleging, among other things, that the 2003 will had been \u201cthe product of undue influence and/or executed without testamentary capacity.\u201d Betty sought to set aside the 2003 will and admit Samuel\u2019s 1998 will and subsequently executed codicils to probate. One of the issues involved \u201cthe apportionment of the estate tax liability generated as a result\u201d of including the QTIP trusts established in Minerva\u2019s will as part of Samuel\u2019s taxable estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">On March 28, 2005, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, admitting the 2003 will to probate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The settlement agreement provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">The QTIP Trusts shall be required to pay Samuel\u2019s estate an amount equal to (a) the total amount of federal estate taxes and New Jersey estate taxes payable by reason of Samuel\u2019s death, less (b) the total amount of those taxes which would have been payable by reason of Samuel\u2019s death if the QTIP Trusts had not been includible in Samuel\u2019s gross estate for federal estate tax purposes (collectively, the \u201cEstate Tax Contribution Amount\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">With regard to payments by the QTIP trusts, the settlement agreement also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">Within five (5) business days after the Effective Date of this Agreement, the QTIP Trust shall pay to Samuel\u2019s estate an amount equal to one-half <em>Qk) </em>of the fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>market value as of the date of Samuel\u2019s death of all the assets owned by the QTIP trusts as of that date (the \u201cApproximate Estate Tax Contribution Payment\u201d), on account of the QTIP Trusts\u2019 aforesaid obligation to pay Samuel\u2019s estate for such estate taxes. Upon the completion of the federal estate tax proceeding and the New Jersey estate tax proceeding for Samuel\u2019s estate, the QTIP Trusts shall thereupon pay to Samuel\u2019s estate (if the amount of the Approximate Estate Tax Contribution Payment is less than [the] Estate Tax Contribution Amount), or Samuel\u2019s estate shall pay the QTIP Trusts (if the Approximate Estate Tax Contribution Payment is more than the Estate Tax Contribution Amount) the difference between the Approximate Estate Tax Contribution Payment and the Estate Tax Contribution amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">Within five (5) business [days] after the Effective Date of this Agreement, the QTIP Trusts shall pay to Samuel\u2019s estate an amount equal to one-half \u00ae of the aggregate sum of the fiduciary income received or accrued by, plus the net principal gains (both realized and unrealized) earned by, the QTIP Trusts from December 12, 2003 through the Effective Date of this Agreement (the \u201cIncome Component\u201d). Upon the computation of the Estate Tax Contribution Amount and the determination of the adjustment, if any, required by the immediately preceding paragraph of this Agreement, the Income Component shall be similarly adjusted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Under the Settlement Agreement, the 2003 will was admitted to probate in the \u201cFinal Judgment\u201d entered on May 16, 2005. The Settlement Agreement, however, did not resolve all the issues among the parties. It did not resolve issues relating to the payment of estate taxes and the impact thereof on the balance of the QTIP trusts and Family Part Trust and the amounts for distribution among the remainder beneficiaries. As a result, \u201cthe trustees of the QTIP Trusts and Family Part Trust and all the remainder beneficiaries of those trusts reserve[d] all of their rights\u201d to contest the allocation and payment of federal and state taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">On May 27, 2005, appellant and UJA (the \u201ccharities\u201d) filed a motion for an order holding that the QTIP trusts\u2019 estate tax obligation should be charged to Betty\u2019s shares alone and that they should receive their reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Betty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>countered with the certification of Alan S. Sussman, Esq., the Lee\u2019s attorney and the scrivener of the 1998 wills, and Alan Merker, a certified public accountant, and executor and trustee of the trusts created by Minerva. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In his certification, Sussman \u201cunequivocally state[d] that Minerva\u2019s intention with respect to the QTIP Trust, was to benefit her husband, Sam Lee, first; her daughter, Betty MacDonald, second; and the charities third.\u201d He further \u201cunequivocally state[d] that Minerva intended the specific legacies to Betty and Betty\u2019s trust to be paid in full and that the amount passing to charity, if any, consist of the balance after the payment of any debts expenses and liabilities, including taxes.\u201d Similarly, Merker stated that \u201c[t]here was no question in [his] mind that Minerva\u2019s intent was that the Trusts should benefit Betty MacDonald and her family.\u201d He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">Betty had become like a daughter to her. In fact, as one is well-aware, Minerva adopted Betty, a clear indication of her feelings. Betty was the daughter of her deceased twin sister. Betty was her companion in her later years. Minerva wanted to insure that should something happen to her, Betty would be there to help take care of Sam, a task which Betty did extremely well without later interference of others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">As for the charitable bequests in her will, Merker certified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">While Minerva was somewhat charitable in her life, she would often say to me, \u201cI already gave them money. Why do they want more?\u201d The charitable bequests in her Will, therefore, were an afterthought. While she wanted to give them something, she certainly did not want them to have the majority of the Trusts\u2019 interest. Those monies were to be reserved for her blood kin, Betty MacDonald and her children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Thus, Merker \u201cfirmly believe[d] that Minerva Lee would not have wanted Betty MacDonald\u2019s share diminished by the taxes the charities seek to extract from her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>In a written opinion, dated April 5, 2005, following oral argument, the judge concluded that the trusts were required to account to the estate for the taxes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court found that the express terms of the QTIP trusts established under Minerva\u2019s will directed the order and preference for the distribution of their assets. He noted that \u201cMinerva\u2019s will clearly lays out that there are to be specific legatees which are to take place before distribution to the charitable institutions,\u201d and therefore found \u201cno reason that the Charities are in fact entitled to any amount before distribution takes place.\u201d He thus concluded that \u201c[tjaxes assessable to the QTIP Trusts by virtue of [their] inclusion in Samuel\u2019s gross estate shall be paid out of the Trusts\u2019 corpus before distribution,\u201d with the remainder to then be \u201cdistributed in accordance with the terms of Article Fourth of Minerva\u2019s will.\u201d According to the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">Here, it is apparent to this court, both by the testamentary direction itself and the testimony provided in the certifications, that Minerva did in fact intend to provide for individual beneficiaries, and specifically that of her \u201cchild\u201d, her daughter Betty. Taxes assessable to the QTIP Trusts\u2019 by virtue of inclusion in Samuel\u2019s gross estate shall be paid out of the Trusts\u2019 corpus before distribution, the remainder shall then be distributed in accordance with the terms of Article Fourth of Minerva\u2019s Will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred by failing to find that the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cI.R.C.\u201d), 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2207A, and its implementing regulations, 26 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 20.2207A-1, \u201cexonerate the charitable beneficiaries from the federal estate taxes attributable to the QTIP trusts.\u201d Specifically, appellant argues that <em>\u201cI.R.C. </em>\u00a7 2207A and the Treasury Regulations govern the apportionment of the federal estate taxes among the QTIP trusts beneficiaries,\u201d thereby preempting any state law analysis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>predeceased spouse\u2019s intent. Appellant further argues that, under 26 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 20.2207A-l(a)(l), there is no right of recovery from the QTIP trusts of assets for which a charitable deduction was allowed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, appellant contends that the tax obligation for the QTIP trusts should be charged only against Betty and her family\u2019s share of the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In its written opinion, the court noted that \u201c[generally, state law controls the apportionment of federal and state tax liability,\u201d and \u201c[i]n the absence of directions to the contrary, <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>3B:24-4] apportions the estate tax pro rata among the beneficiaries.\u201d The court, however, recognized that QTIP trusts imposed \u201cadditional considerations concerning recovery with regard to federal estate taxes.\u201d Specifically, the court found that <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 2207A(a)(l)(a) gave Samuel\u2019s estate \u201cthe right to recover federal estate taxes from the [QTIP trusts\u2019] beneficiaries named by the pre-deceased spouse\u2019s will in order to pay estate taxes pursuant to the inclusion of a QTIP trust in a gross estate\u201d; and by virtue of <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 2207A(a)(l), \u201c[t]he estate may seek to recover the amount by which the total estate tax paid exceeds the total tax payable that would have been payable if the value of the property had not been included in the gross estate.\u201d <em>See </em>26 <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7 2207A(a)(l)-(2). Thus, although federal law exempted charitable beneficiaries of QTIP trusts from taxation, the court nonetheless concluded that absent any express provision in her will to the contrary, Minerva\u2019s intent controlled the appropriate distribution of the assets remaining in the QTIP trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The Internal Revenue Code, 26 <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7 2001(a), imposes a tax on the transfer of the taxable estate of every decedent who is a citizen or resident of the United States.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Generally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u201cCongress intended that the federal estate tax should be paid out of the estate as a whole and that the applicable state law as to the devolution of property at death should govern the distribution of the remainder and the ultimate impact of the federal tax----\u201d <em>Riggs v. Del Drago, </em>317 <em>U.S. </em>95, 97-98, 63 <em>S.Ct. </em>109, 110-11, 87 <em>L.Ed, </em>106, 110-11 (1942). Instead, so long as the federal estate taxes are paid, state law governs the distribution of the remainder of the estate and the \u201cultimate thrust of the tax.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Therefore, absent congressional enactments to the contrary, state law governs the allocation of the tax burden. <em>Ibid. </em>However, where Congress has spoken, such as with the marital deduction, federal law controls. <em>McAleer v. Jemigan, </em>804 F.2d 1231, 1233 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201cin the absence of congressional enactments to the contrary, state law governs the allocation of the burden of taxes as to property that is part of the estate [but] where Congress has spoken ... federal law governs\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The Internal Revenue Code allows a marital deduction for the value of property transferred to a surviving spouse. 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2056. The marital deduction permits a testator to provide for his or her spouse, up to the limits set forth in the federal statute, without incurring federal tax liability therefor. <em>Gesner v. Roberts, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>379, 381, 225 A.2d 697 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 extended the marital deduction to property in QTIP trusts. 26 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B). <em>In re Will of Adair, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>591, 597-98, 695 A.2d 250 (1997). A QTIP trust provides the surviving spouse with \u201congoing income support for the surviving spouse while retaining the corpus for the children or other beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The election of QTIP treatment, therefore, allows the decedent to control the property\u2019s ultimate disposition after the surviving spouse\u2019s death and obtain an estate tax benefit. <em>Id. </em>at 597, 695 A.2d 250; <em>In re Estate of Branigan, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>324, 328, 609 A.2d 431 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(i) defines QTIP property as property (1) that passes \u201cfrom the decedent,\u201d (2) \u201cin which the surviving spouse has a qualifying income interest for life,\u201d and (3) \u201cto which an election\u201d was made at the time of payment of the decedent\u2019s estate taxes. The value of the QTIP property that passes to the surviving spouse is deducted from the decedent\u2019s gross estate, and no estate taxes are paid on it upon the death of the first spouse. 26 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 2056(a); <em>Adair, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 598, 695 A.2d 250. Such was the case here. As a result, the tax owed on the QTIP property was deferred until the death of Samuel, the surviving spouse, at which time the QTIP property was included in his gross estate pursuant to 26 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 2044. <em>See Adair, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 598, 695 A.2d 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Under 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2207A(a)(l), if the surviving spouse\u2019s gross estate includes any QTIP property, the executor or administrator may recover the amount of estate tax attributable to the inclusion of that property from a \u201cperson receiving the property.\u201d Specifically, 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2207A(a)(l) provides that the amount recoverable is the portion of the tax resulting from the inclusion of the QTIP in the gross estate, that is the amount by which the total estate tax exceeds the total estate tax that would have been payable if the QTIP had not been included. The right of recovery, however, does not apply if the decedent otherwise directs by will. 26 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 2207A(a)(2); <em>see Adair, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 594-95, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>695 A.2d 250 (holding that federal estate tax was not at issue where predeceased spouse\u2019s will directed his trustees to pay any federal taxes due on the QTIP trust from the trust principal before distributing the balance to decedent\u2019s children, but did not mention the payment of state death taxes).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">However, a decedent waives the right of the estate to recover from the person receiving the QTIP property a portion of the estate tax attributable to its inclusion if the will \u201cspecifically indicates an intent to waive any right of recovery.\u201d 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>2207A(a)(2).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">As the trial court observed, Samuel\u2019s 2003 will (prepared by a new scrivener) suggested that he wanted to waive the right of recovery. However, as the judge also recognized, the Settlement Agreement subsequently provided otherwise. Specifically, the interested parties all agreed that the QTIP trusts would pay Samuel\u2019s estate the federal and state taxes attributable to inclusion of the QTIP trusts in Samuel\u2019s gross estate. The court approved the Settlement Agreement, thereby conferring authority upon the executor and trustees to comply with its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">We agree with appellant that federal law controls the federal taxation of estates, and that the estate is not entitled to recover from the charitable beneficiaries their pro rata share of the federal estate taxes. The applicable Treasury regulation provides that \u201c[tjhere is no right of recovery from any person for the property received by that person for which a deduction was allowed from the gross estate if no tax is attributable to that property.\u201d 26 <em>C.F.R. </em>20.2207A-l(a)(l). That regulation is consistent with congressional intent to provide a special rule for transfers of interests in property to a spouse and a qualifying charity for which there is no federal estate tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>There can be no dispute that 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2207A applies to the question before us, and preempts state law regarding the payment of federal estate taxes attributable to QTIP property. <em>See Cleveland v. Compass Bank, </em>652 So.2d 1134, 1137-38 (Ala. 1994) (holding 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2207A preempted state law but made no specific provision for the apportionment of state estate taxes). Because 26 <em>C.F.R. </em>20.2207A-1 implements the statute and excludes the right of recovery for property for which a deduction for estate tax purposes was allowed, the charitable beneficiaries cannot be required to reimburse Samuel\u2019s estate for their proportionate share of the federal estate taxes attributable to the QTIP trusts. As the trial judge recognized, charitable bequests are \u201cexempt from taxation since the estate will take a charitable deduction following the distribution of the property.\u201d As a result, the federal statute and regulation preempt state law with respect to the payment of federal estate taxes, and the charitable beneficiaries cannot be assessed their proportioned share for federal estate tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We nevertheless affirm the judgment. While the trial court\u2019s analysis of probable intent may not have been relevant to the issue of federal estate taxation attributable to the charitable beneficiaries of the QTIP trusts, construction of a will is a matter of state law, and state law governs the allocation of the tax burden in the absence of congressional intent to the contrary. <em>See Riggs, supra, </em>317 <em>U.S. </em>at 98-99, 63 <em>S.Ct. </em>109; <em>McAleer, supra, </em>804 F.2d at 1233; <em>Cleveland, supra, </em>652 So.2d at 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">To that end, in interpreting a will, courts in this State endeavor to \u201cascertain the intent of the testator.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Payne, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>324, 335, 895 A.2d 428 (2006). The doctrine of probable intent is long established in New Jersey\u2019s jurisprudence. <em>In re Estate of Branigan, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 331, 609 A.2d 431.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As Justice Wallace has recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>In interpreting a will, our aim is to ascertain the intent of the testator. \u201c[Wlhen we say we are determining the testator\u2019s intent, we mean his probable intent.\u201d <em>Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Robert, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>561, 564, 178 A.2d 185 (1962) (citation omitted). We continue to adhere to the view of the doctrine of probable intent expressed in <em>Fidelity Union. </em>In that case, the Court stated that in determining the testator\u2019s subjective intent, \"courts will give primary emphasis to his dominant plan and purpose as they appear from the entirety of his will when read and considered in the light of the surrounding facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564-65, 178 A.2d 185. The trial court should \u201cascribe to the testator 'those impulses which are common to human nature and ... construe the will so as to effectuate those impulses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565,178 A.2d 185 (citation omitted). More recently, this Court emphasized that \u201c[cjourts are enjoined to \u2018strain\u2019 toward effectuating the testator\u2019s probable intent 'to accomplish what he would have done had he envisioned the present inquiry.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Estate of Branigan, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>324, 332, 609 A.2d 431 (1992) (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">The trial court is not \u201climited simply to searching out the probable meaning intended by the words and phrases in the will.\u201d <em>Engle v. </em>Siegel, 74 <em>N.J. </em>287, 291, 377 A.2d 892 (1977). Extrinsic evidence may \u201cfurnish[ ] information regarding the circumstances surrounding the testator [and] should be admitted to aid in ascertaining [the testator\u2019s] probable intent under the will.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Flowers, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>250, 260, 277 A.2d 199 (1971). To be sure, the testator\u2019s own expressions of his or her intent are highly relevant. <em>Id. </em>at 262-63, 277 A.2d 199. Once the evidence establishes the probable intent of the testator, \u201cthe court may not refuse to effectuate that intent by indulging in a merely literal reading of the instrument\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260, 277 A.2d 199.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\"><em>[In re Estate of Payne, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>324, 335, 895 A.2d 428 (2006).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-8\"><em>See also In re Estate of Ericson, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>300, 310, 377 A.2d 898 (1977) (considering impact of trial testimony of attorney who prepared the will in question and the trust officer to whom the testator expressed his wishes); <em>Danelczyk v.

As the trial court noted, neither fiduciary appears to have a motive, \u201cstake\u201d or personal interest which might compel us to ignore their certifications. Further, appellant offers no contrary proofs or reason to disregard them.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The certifications of Sussman and Merkel provide adequate proof that Minerva intended to provide Betty and her trust with a specific legacy following Samuel\u2019s death, and that the specific legacies were to be fully satisfied, with all debts, expenses, and liabilities including taxes, paid before the charities received the balance. Such direct statements of intent by Minerva\u2019s scrivener and co-trustee were properly considered by the trial court, <em>see In re Estate of Ericson, supra </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 310, 377 A.2d 898; <em>Wilson, supra </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 263-64, 277 A.2d 199, and are consistent with a mother\u2019s natural inclination to provide for her children and grandchildren. <em>See In re Estate of Ericson, supra </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 306, 377 A.2d 898.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">As noted, the trial judge thoroughly detailed Minerva\u2019s intent by reference to the certifications of her attorney-scrivener and her accountant, the latter of whom was an executor and trustee under her will. The attorney \u201cmet and spoke with Minerva on numerous occasions between 1992 and her death in 1999 to discuss various issues related to her estate plan.\u201d He certified that the charities were to receive the balance of the estate only after the specific legacies to Betty and her trust were \u201cpaid in full\u201d and the \u201cdebts, expenses and liabilities, including taxes\u201d were paid. Similarly, her accountant Merker certified that Betty considered the charities as \u201can afterthought,\u201d because her \u201cmonies were to be reserved for her blood kin, Betty MacDonald and her children.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>We interpret <em>the </em>trial judge\u2019s opinion to require modification of Minerva\u2019s will to provide the charities with a lesser share of the residuary estate if federal estate taxes could not include apportionment of their share. Stated differently, the record demonstrates that, as a matter of the testatrix\u2019s probable intent, Betty MacDonald and her family would have received a greater share of the estate (whether or not their legacies were part of the residuary estate) if federal estate taxes were to be paid exclusively from their shares. Consistent with the well-established doctrine of \u201cprobable intent,\u201d <em>see In re Estate of Branigan, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 336, 609 A.2d 431, permitting reformation of a will (\u201cto modify the existing provision of [QTIP] trust funds in order to derive maximum benefits under the federal estate tax laws\u201d); <em>In re Estate of Ericson, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 310, 377 A.2d 898 (construing will to maximize marital deduction and minimize estate taxation), we affirm the judgment regarding federal estate taxation based upon a construction of the will which modifies the residuary estate to provide a greater bequest to Betty MacDonald and her family in order to provide for payment of the federal estate tax liability or for the recovery of federal taxes attributable to the QTIP trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Appellant contends that the trial court also erred by fading to exonerate the charitable beneficiaries of the QTIP trusts from the apportionment of New Jersey estate taxes. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>54:38-1 to -16.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Essentially, the appellant argues that the court erred in applying the doctrine of probable intent to the construction of Minerva\u2019s will and in concluding from the testamentary document itself and extrinsic evidence that Minerva intended first to create a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>specific legacy for Betty and her family, and then to leave the residuary to the charitable beneficiaries after the payment of taxes. We have already noted that the Sussman and Merker certifications provided uncontested proof which was sufficient to demonstrate Minerva\u2019s testamentary intent and that appellant did not provide enough to warrant an evidentiary contest on that issue. <em>See Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 532, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). <em>See also, e.g., In re Estate of Ericson, supra, 74 N.J. </em>at 309-10, 377 A.2d 898; <em>Danelczyk, supra, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 431-32, 616 A.2d 1311 (construing intent based on extrinsic evidence of attorney who drafted will).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Appellant nevertheless argues that New Jersey law exonerates charitable beneficiaries from state taxation in order to maximize the tax advantage for the estate. It relies on <em>In re Estate of Rankin, </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>317, 326-28, 404 A.2d 1200 (App.Div.1979), in which we held that a charitable beneficiary did not have to contribute its share of the residuary estate to the payment of federal estate taxes and New Jersey transfer inheritance taxes. Among other things, we found that \u201cwhere a will is silent,\u201d and there was no extrinsic evidence of contrary intent, \u201cpublic policy suggests that a gift which, because deductible, lessens taxes on the estate as a whole, should not be made to bear any part of the tax attributable to other tax generating parts of the estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 404 A.2d 1200. We further found that this policy was consistent with the presumption under New Jersey law that a testator intended the maximum tax advantage for his estate. <em>Ibid. </em>However, as the trial judge here noted, we also expressly stated that we would indulge that equity \u201conly in the absence of contrary testamentary intent derived from the will or from extrinsic evidence of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 404 A.2d 1200. Because both Minerva\u2019s will and the certifications refute the presumption that Minerva intended the maximum tax advantage for her estate at the expense of her family, the charitable beneficiaries cannot be exonerated from paying their share of the New Jersey tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm, substantially for the reasons stated by the trial judge and the reasons given by us to sustain the judgment regarding apportionment of federal estate taxes, the judgment regarding the New Jersey state tax as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Affirmed as to state taxes and modified as to rationale with respect to federal taxes, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-10\"> The August 26, 2005 order incorporated a settlement agreement of March 28, 2005 and a \"Final Judgment\" of May 16, 2005.
