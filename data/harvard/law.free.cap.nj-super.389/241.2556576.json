Defendant was sentenced to eight years in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections on count three, one of the second degree endangering convictions, and to concurrent seven-year terms for the other endangering convictions. He also received a concurrent five-year term for the aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">On this appeal defendant raises issues relating to the sufficiency of the evidence, the introduction of testimony, and the jury instructions. He also challenges the sentence. Because we conclude that the admission of testimony by a DYFS worker who interviewed the victim at a hospital after the third incident of alleged child abuse was not harmless, we reverse the conviction. Specifically, we hold that the statement to the DYFS worker was inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Federal Constitution (and the co-extensive provisions of the New Jersey Constitution, <em>see N.J. Const, </em>art. I, \u00b6 10; <em>State v. Daniels, </em>364 <em>N.J.Super. </em>357, 371-72, 835 A.2d 1261 (App.Div. 2003), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>80, 861 A.2d 808 (2004))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, and cannot constitute harmless error. In so doing, we sustain the introduction of other statements which were admissible under traditional hearsay exceptions and present no concerns under the Confrontation Clause. Those statements may be admitted on the retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">For purposes of our analysis of the present record, we adopt the State\u2019s version of facts as detailed in its brief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">The three-year old victim in this case, N.M., was [allegedly] assaulted by defendant on three separate occasions between July 2nd and October 18th, 2002. The last assault was the most severe, resulting in injuries to the child that required a two-week hospital stay. Specifically, Dr. Steven Kairys, the Chairman of Pediatrics and Director of the Child Protection Center at Jersey Shore University <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Medical Center, found \u201cextensive injuries primarily to the head, the scalp, the eyes, the ears, the back of the neck ____ a combination of extensive bruising that covered large parts of his neck and scalp. Both eyes were bruised ... were beginning to show what\u2019s called raccoon eyes, bleeding blood around the eyes. Both ears were swollen red. There was bruising both in the earlobes, themselves, as well as behind the earlobes. There was bruising along the neck.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">The victim had been residing in defendant\u2019s home for a brief period before the first injury occurred. Prior thereto, the child had never suffered a suspicious injury and DTP'S had never been involved in preserving his safety and wellbeing. The child had been living with his teenage mother and her parents since his birth in November of 1998, but had been placed in defendant\u2019s home and in harm\u2019s way <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when his mother moved in with defendant upon their engagement. As part of joining together as a family, defendant wanted and encouraged little N.M. to call him \u201cDaddy.\u201d The boy\u2019s mother, defendant and N.M. did things together that families typically enjoy, such as having dinner, watching TV, playing cards, watching fireworks, going out for ice cream and going to parks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">The first indication that N.M. was being physically abused by defendant was on July 3rd, 2002. That morning, as N.M.\u2019s mother [Christine] was driving the boy to her sister\u2019s house for daycare, as she usually did on weekdays when she worked, he blurted out from the backseat that, \"Daddy beat me.\u201d The statement was voluntary and unsolicited. Christine was understandably surprised by the remark[ ] and asked N.M. when that had happened, to which the boy responded, \u201c[a]t night.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">Later that day, Christine received a phone call at work from her mother ... advising that N.M. had an injury to his buttocks. Unbeknownst to Christine at that time, [Christine\u2019s mother and sister] took photos of the bruising, which to them looked to be in the shape of a handprint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">Christine asked defendant about the injury to N.M.\u2019s buttocks; defendant said the boy had fallen in the bathtub. Christine accepted defendant\u2019s explanation and, at least for the time being, the episode was over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">The next incident was sometime in the month of August or September 2002. Again out of the presence of Christine, N.M. allegedly \u201cfell\u201d after getting out of the bathtub. When Christine returned home, defendant and his brother ... who was also present in the house, told her about the alleged fall. Some small bruises were noticeable, so Christine called Community Medical Center to inquire as to what she should do. She was told to just watch the child carefully for certain neurological symptoms and to bring him in only if his condition appeared to worsen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-12\">The following day, while N.M. was at his grandparents\u2019 house, his grandfather [Christine\u2019s father] noticed the bruises on the child\u2019s head, and more photos were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>taken. The grandparents then kept N.M. at their home for several days after this incident, having argued with their daughter Christine about defendant abusing the child but Christine still not believing that he had inflicted those injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">On October 16, 2002, while [Christine\u2019s sister] was babysitting, defendant arrived to pick him up and bring him home. N.M. became visibly upset at the realization that he was going to leave his aunt\u2019s house with defendant, and he said he didn\u2019t want to go home with \u201cRyan.\u201d Defendant became upset at the child\u2019s faitee to call him \u201cDaddy,\u201d and an argument ensued between defendant and [the aunt], [The aunt] accused defendant of being an abuser and refused to hand the child over to him. The police were summoned to the house and, upon their call to Christine to inquire whether defendant had her permission to take the child, N.M. was sent home with defendant. Neither [the aunt] nor his grandparents saw N.M. again until the night of October 18, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">On the morning of October 18, Christine left N.M. in the care of defendant when she went to work, altering her usual routine of bringing him to [her sister\u2019s] house. She testified that when she returned in the early evening, N.M. was sitting in the darkened living room watching television. After getting herself settled, she approached N.M. and screamed out loud when she noticed a big red mark on the back of his neck. There were also marks or discolorations under his eyes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">N.M. was taken to the emergency room at Community Medical Center, where a doctor who examined the child immediately called DYFS and other authorities to report his suspicion that N.M. had been abused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">Miriam Nurudeen, the \u201cfirst response\u201d DYFS worker who was sent to the hospital to investigate, arrived at the child\u2019s room about the same time as [the grandparents]. The child was crying and begging his grandparents to take him home with them. Ms. Nurudeen asked [Christine\u2019s parents] to leave the room so that she could talk to N.M. alone, which is standard procedure when a DYFS representative is attempting to ascertain if a child has been abused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">Once the grandparents were gone, Ms. Nurudeen asked N.M. what had happened to him. He said that he fell in his room, and he wanted to go home to grandma. She then asked him if anybody had beaten him. The child responded, \u201cDad says nobody beat me. I fell when I was sleeping in my room.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">Officer Kenneth Hess also responded to Community Medical Center and asked N.M. how he was doing. The child replied, \u201c[m]y heart hurts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-12\">N.M, was transferred to Jersey Shore Medical Center later that night, where he spent two weeks recovering from his injuries in the pediatric intensive care unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-13\">Also later that night, defendant was interviewed by Investigator Kenneth Hess of the Ocean County Prosecutor\u2019s Office and Detective Brian Lomer of the Dover Township Police Department. Defendant was given his <em>[Miranda </em>] rights, which he waived in writing. He denied inflicting any physical abuse on N.M. but told the officers that the child had fallen on two prior occasions, and maybe the child had fallen again on that day. He did not tell the officers that anyone had been home with him all day except for the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-14\">Dr. Steven Kairys testified as an expert in pediatric medicine and identification of child abuse injuries. He told the jury that he examined N.M. on October 21st, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>at which time he found extensive injuries to the child\u2019s head, scalp, eyes, ears and neck, with lesser injuries to his left flank and scrotum. His eyes were dark and swollen, as were his ears. There were also large areas of blood collecting under his scalp. The manifestation of the injuries had worsened significantly from the night they were discovered, on October 18, and the child had lost a lot of blood internally. The doctor testified that the injuries to the child were purposely inflicted upon him and were not the result of a fall, as evidenced by their type and pattern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">Defendant and Christine were charged with endangering the welfare of a child. Defendant was also charged with third degree assault on N.M. for the October 18th incident. Christine was not allowed to see N.M. for three and a half months, and then only under supervision. Upon his release from the hospital, N.M. went to live with his grandparents. Christine eventually entered into a plea bargain with the State to testify truthfully against defendant, in exchange for which she pled to a lesser charge and the State agreed not to seek incarceration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">At trial, defendant and his mother, Joyce Hart[e], both testified that she was with him all day at his home on October 18th and that neither one saw anything happen to the child. When asked why they had not told anyone earlier that Ms. Hart was allegedly at the house all day, defendant testified it was because Ms. Hart had a warrant outstanding for her arrest. However, the outstanding warrant did not prevent Ms. Hart from bringing defendant and her other son to the police station for questioning, where she waited for over two hours on a bench in a common area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">Defendant testified at trial that he did not assault or harm N.M. at any time. He blamed Christine\u2019s parents for the accusations of abuse, supposedly because they did not want N.M. to move out of their house in the first place. After his conviction and at his sentencing, defendant still claimed that he never hurt N.M.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Defendant challenges the admission of N.M.\u2019s statements that \u201cDaddy beat me\u201d to his mother while they were riding in the car together on July 3, 2002. Defendant also contends that the statements, \u201cI fell down in my room. I want to go home to grandma\u201d and \u201cDad says nobody beat me. I fell when I was sleeping in my room,\u201d made to the DYFS worker at the Medical Center on October 18, 2002 were inadmissible. Defendant claims the statements were \u201cinadmissible hearsay\u201d and violated his constitutional right to confrontation. Clearly, the admission of the statements at the hospital must have prejudiced defendant, particularly in light of the July statement and the fact that the words \u201cDad says nobody beat me\u201d were stated in response to the DYFS worker\u2019s \u201cdirect question\u201d asking \u201cif anybody beat him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>After an <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing and deferring a ruling until hearing part of the State\u2019s ease, the trial judge concluded that both statements were admissible as \u201cexcited utterances,\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(C)(2). Such statements must be made \u201cwhile the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition and without opportunity to deliberate or fabricate.\u201d <em>Ibid. See generally, State v. Branch, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>338, 357-67, 370, 865 A.2d 673 (2005) (excluding child\u2019s statement because she \u201chad the opportunity to deliberate before making the statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370, 865 A.2d 673); <em>State v. Cotto, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>316, 329-31, 865 A.2d 660 (2005) (narrative responses to police questions \u201cnot sufficiently spontaneous to assure reliability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">While the statements in this case were each made at least several hours after the events occurred, we cannot conclude that the trial judge abused his discretion in finding that the prerequisites for admitting the statements under the Rule were satisfied. The judge could have reasonably found on the record presented that the then three-and-one-half and four-year-old child addressed the beatings at the first opportunity he had to do so, while still nervous and excited. The October statement was not made to a family member, was in response to an interrogation interview, and could have been made earlier to N.M.\u2019s mother either when she observed the marks or en route to the hospital. However, defendant was with them at the time. While admission of the statement to DYFS worker Nurudeen, a Supervising Family Service Specialist, therefore presents a closer question under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(2), <em>see State v. Branch, supra, </em>at 370, 865 A.2d 673, we nevertheless decline to hold that the inferences preclude the finding that both statements were made in response to a \u201cstartling event\u201d while N.M. was \u201cunder the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition\u201d and were made \u201cwithout an opportunity to deliberate or fabricate.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(2). <em>See State v. Bass, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>466, 480-81, 535 A.2d 1 (App.Div.1987), <em>certif. denied, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>186, 540 A.2d 182 (1988); <em>State in Interest of C.A., </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 32-33, 492 A.2d 683 (App.Div.1985). According to Ms. Nurudeen, when she arrived at the hospital, N.M. \u201cwas crying\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u201cvery emotional,\u201d and his grandparents helped her \u201ccalm him down.\u201d N.M. \u201cwas crying\u201d and \u201cseared\u201d while talking to Ms. Nurudeen. Moreover, unlike the statement to a police officer in <em>Branch, </em>in this case there was no prior discussion with the child declarant about the identification of the perpetrator and the child\u2019s statement did not relate to the identification of a stranger.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See also State v. Cotto, supra, </em>(statements to police by adults).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Recent case law requires reconsideration of the admission of the excited utterances in light of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>36, 53-54, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1354, 1365, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, 194 (2004), the United States Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment prohibits \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d More recently, the Court considered the meaning of \u201ctestimonial\u201d evidence in <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2266, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>224 (2006).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court made clear that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>[statements are non-testimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-h\"><em>[Id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2273-74,165 L.Ed.2d at 237.] <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In <em>Davis, </em>defendant was convicted of felony violation of a domestic no-contact order, <em>id. </em>at -, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2271, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 235, based on the contents of a recorded 911 telephone call during which the police dispatcher ascertained the perpetrator\u2019s name and a description of what was occurring. <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2271, 165 L.Ed.2d at 234-35. The conviction was upheld by the Washington Supreme Court because \u201cthe portion of the 911 conversation in which [defendant was identified] was not testimonial, and [] if other portions of the conversation were testimonial, admitting them was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2271-72, 165 L.Ed.2d at 235. In <em>Hammon v. Indiana, </em>decided with <em>Davis, </em>the police responded to the scene of a reported domestic disturbance, asked some questions, and had the wife \u201cfill out and sign a battery affidavit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2272, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 235. The wife did not testify at trial; the officer who had questioned her recounted her statements at the scene. <em>Id. </em>at -, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2272, 165 L.Ed.2d at 236. Hammon\u2019s conviction for domestic battery was sustained by the Indiana Supreme Court, because the wife\u2019s oral statements were not \u201ctestimonial,\u201d as they constituted \u201cexcited utterances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2273, 165 L.Ed.2d at 236, and while the affidavit was \u201ctestimonial,\u201d its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The <em>Davis </em>Court made clear that \u201cinterrogations solely directed at establishing the facts of a past crime, in order to identify (or provide evidence to convict) the perpetrator\u201d constituted \u201ctestimonial hearsay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2276, 165 L.Ed.2d at 240. However, \u201cat least the initial interrogation conducted in connection with a 911 call[] is ordinarily not designed primarily to \u2018establis[h] or prov[e]\u2019 some past fact, but to describe current circumstances requiring police assistance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As a result, the Court determined that the circumstances surrounding the 911 call in <em>Davis </em>\u201cobjectively indicate its primary purpose was to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency[,]\u201d and therefore admissible. Simply stated, the wife \u201cwas not acting as a <em>witness; </em>she was not <em>testifying.\u201d Id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2277, 165 L.Ed.2d at 240.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">However, the Court reversed the Indiana conviction in <em>Hammon. </em>In that case, \u201c[t]here was no emergency in progress\u201d and when the officers responded to the scene, the victim stated there was \u201cno immediate threat to her person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2278, 165 L.Ed.2d at 242. The officer questioning the wife was \u201cnot seeking to determine (as in <em>Davis) </em>\u2018what is happening,\u2019 but rather \u2018what happened.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cObjectively viewed, the primary, if not indeed the sole, purpose of the interrogation was to investigate a possible crime \u2014 which is, of course, precisely what the officer <em>should </em>have done.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Of significance, the interrogation was conducted away from the perpetrator, although not conducted in a police station or similar environment, the statement recounted \u201chow potentially criminal past events began and progressed,\u201d and the interrogation \u201ctook place some time after the events described were over.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>As <em>Davis </em>makes clear, \u201cit is in the final analysis the declarant\u2019s statements, not the interrogator\u2019s questions, that the Confrontation Clause requires us to evaluate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2274, 165 L.Ed.2d at 237, n. 1. While the portions of the 911 call concerning events as they were actually happening, were non-testimonial, the Court stated that \u201c[i]t could readily be maintained\u201d that aspects of the call occurring after the event occurred and the perpetrator left the scene \u201cwere testimonial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2277, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 241. Hence, courts considering 911 calls following the decision in <em>Davis </em>have held that a report of an ongoing event or transaction was \u201cnon-testimonial.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Galicia, </em>447 <em>Mass. </em>737, 857 N.E.2d 463, 470 (2006) (statement to 911 operator \u201cabout an assault that was actually happening\u201d admissible, but statements of victim to officers responding to scene inadmissible); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>453 <em>F.</em>3d 838 (7th Cir.2006); <em>Jackson v. State, </em>931 So.2d 1062 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2006); <em>Cook v. State, </em>199 S.W.3d 495 (TexApp. 2006); <em>Harkins v. State, </em>143 P.3d 706 (Nev.2006); <em>Cook v. State, </em>199 S.W.3d 495 (Tex.App.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The <em>Davis </em>Court assumed that 911 operators \u201cmay be at least agents of law enforcement when they conduct interrogations of 911 callers,\u201d <em>Davis, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2274, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 238, n. 2, although the Court found it \u201cunnecessary to consider whether and when statements made to someone other than law enforcement personnel are \u2018testimonial[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Without definitively addressing the issue of agency when DYFS workers investigate a complaint of abuse, <em>see generally State v. P.Z., </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>86, 703 A.2d 901 (1997), we note that a recent report of the Joint Sub-Committee of the Criminal and Family Practice Committees recommended procedures for handling issues in child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>abuse eases involving simultaneous DYFS proceedings and criminal charges,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and we can take note of the fact that some interviews of victims of abuse are conducted by DYFS workers in the presence of law enforcement officers. In fact, DYFS is charged with taking action, using court proceedings, to protect the best interests of a child and \u201cshall immediately report all instances of suspected child abuse and neglect\u201d to the County Prosecutor. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.36a; <em>see also N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-1.4. In this case, the responding DYFS worker talked with Prosecutor\u2019s Investigator Kenneth Hess before interviewing N.M. Moreover, and significantly, she was called to the hospital to conduct an investigation, because the examining physician suspected wrongdoing.

There is no claim in this case that the witness was unavailable or that there was a \u201cprior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d Nor is there a claim that the defendant somehow prevented the witness from testifying, which can be deemed a forfeiture or waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. <em>See Davis, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2279-80, 165 L.Ed.2d at 244; <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 62, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1370, 158 L.Ed.2d at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">As the statement in question was both offered and received for the substance of what was said, and because there is no contention or basis for a finding of harmless error in terms of its impact on any count, we reverse the conviction on all counts. In doing so, we make clear that the statement or \u201cblurt out\u201d to N.M.\u2019s mother after the first incident in July would pose no problem under <em>Crawford </em>or <em>Davis </em>in terms of admissibility at any retrial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We also believe that our opinion may be read to be consistent with that part of <em>State in the Interest of J.A., </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>544, 897 A.2d 1119 (App.Div.2006), in which we noted that \u201cspontaneous or volunteered statements to law enforcement officers, or statements that are in response to open-ended or minimal question by law enforcement, particularly those at the scene of the crime\u201d are admissible, as are responses to \u201con-the-spot police questioning\u201d if not aimed at producing or preserving evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 555, 556, 897 A.2d 1119. However, a statement to a DYFS worker who reports to a hospital in response to a call concerning possible child abuse, even if taken outside the presence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>of a police officer or prosecutor\u2019s investigator, is taken to gather evidence for use in court proceedings if it is decided that action for protection of the child is required. Here, the interview by the DYFS worker was not at the scene or while the abuse was occurring; it was at the hospital where the victim was being treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Accordingly, we must reverse the conviction based upon the statement admitted through the DYFS worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">We generally agree with the additional comments of our concurring colleague, particularly about the fact-sensitive nature of the analysis and the need for a case-by-case development of the law. We add only that we find no case failing to apply the <em>Crawford-Davis </em>rule to a direct appeal, given the impact of its principle to the truth-telling function. <em>See, e.g., Griffith v.

More significantly, in displacing the former two-part test of <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>56, 66, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 2539, 65 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 597, 608 (1980) (allowing statements which categorically satisfied certain \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d hearsay exceptions or which otherwise had \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d), <em>Crawford </em>has dramatically affected the day-to-day prosecution of criminal trials and appeals across the nation. <em>See, e. g., </em>Michael D. Cicchini &amp; Vincent Rust, <em>Confrontation After Crawford v. Washington: Defining \u201cTestimonial\u201d, </em>10 <em>Lewis &amp; Clark L.Rev. </em>531 (2006); Jerome C.

This sea change in criminal practice cannot be underestimated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In making that observation, I do not question the historical or doctrinal merits of <em>Crawford </em>in fulfilling the intended aims of the Confrontation Clause. I simply note that the practical implications of <em>Crawford </em>and its progeny are very substantial, and that we as an appellate court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> have an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>obligation to be mindful of those practicalities in applying the tenets of these new rules of constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Recognizing the avulsive changes in law and in practice brought about by <em>Crawford, </em>it is worth noting that the Supreme Court declined in that case to supply the bench and bar with a \u201ccomprehensive definition\u201d of what is testimonial under the Court\u2019s new standards. <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 68,124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1374, 158 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 203. Instead, the Court left that task to a later day. That day arrived, at least in part, on June 19, 2006, when the Court decided <em>Davis </em>and a companion case, <em>Hammon v. Indiana, </em>in a consolidated opinion that put some meat on <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>bare doctrinal bones. It is also worth noting that the trial in the present appeal was conducted in January 2005, ten months after <em>Crawford </em>was decided but more than a year before the Supreme Court clarified its teachings in <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The majority\u2019s scholarly opinion faithfully applies the post-<em>Crawford </em>standards expressed in <em>Davis </em>to this case retroactively, even though the trial judge, the prosecutor and defense counsel could not have reasonably predicted in January 2005 the specific doctrinal rules announced in <em>Davis </em>in June 2006. On that score, the United States Supreme Court recently heard oral argument in <em>Bockting v. Bayer, </em>399 <em>F.</em>3d 1010 (9th Cir.2005), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2017, 164 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>778 (2006), in which the Court will decide the extent of <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>retroactivity, and presumably will offer analogous guidance on the retroactivity of <em>Davis. </em>I share my colleagues\u2019 premise that, at a minimum, <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>will be afforded pipeline retroactivity and thus be declared applicable at least to all matters that were pending trial or were on direct appeal when those cases were decided.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Powell v. Nevada, </em>511 <em>U.S. </em>79, 80, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>1280, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>1281, 128 L.Ed.2d 1, 5 (1994). In the unlikely event that prediction is mistaken, then obviously the judgment we render here is ill-founded, and we shall need to reconsider the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The doctrinal test expressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>is presently incomplete. As my colleagues note, <em>Davis </em>held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">[s]tatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOr\">[\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2273-74, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 237.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">This multi-factor construct resolves only two of several possible scenarios. One scenario is where there is an \u201congoing emergency\u201d when the declarant speaks or writes <em>and </em>the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the interrogation is \u201cto enable police assistance to meet [that] emergency.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In that scenario, the statement is admissible. A completely opposite scenario is where there is <em>no </em>ongoing emergency and the primary purpose of the interrogation is \u201cto establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d In that particular scenario, <em>Davis </em>instructs that the statement is inadmissible. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">What the Supreme Court does not tell us in <em>Davis </em>is how we should handle scenarios where either (l) there is an ongoing emergency but the interrogation\u2019s primary purpose is retrospective, or (2) there is no ongoing emergency but the interrogation\u2019s primary purpose is only prospective. Since the fact patterns in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>involved neither of these possibilities, the Supreme Court did not need to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Nor does <em>Davis </em>contemplate the sticky circumstance in which the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of a declarant\u2019s interview is unclear, or where the interview is being conducted for dual or multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>purposes. Again, we are left without clear guidance, since the appellate records in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>apparently did not reflect such ambiguous or mixed purposes, at least for eight members of the Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The circumstances before us appear to raise such interstitial uncertainties implicated by the <em>Davis </em>holding. From my own reading of the record, I am persuaded, as is the majority, that there was no \u201congoing emergency\u201d when N.M. was safely ensconced in a hospital room and was being interviewed by DYFS worker Nurudeen. It is less obvious, however, that the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of Nurudeen\u2019s interview was forward-looking, i.e., to protect the welfare of the child, or backward-looking, i.e., to memorialize statements from the child that could establish past events and be potentially used in a future prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">On balance, I tend to agree with the majority that, on the particular record before us, the primary object of the DYFS interview, particularly after Nurudeen spoke with the prosecutor\u2019s representative at the hospital, was to establish past events and to assist in the already-initiated criminal investigation. However, I do recognize that there are countervailing proofs in the record, including Nurudeen\u2019s testimony perceiving that her role at the hospital was \u201cjust to make sure that the child is safe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">By channeling the constitutional analysis into a \u201cprimary purpose\u201d rubric, <em>Davis </em>also causes a perhaps-unintended oversimplification of the task of understanding why people talk with one another. Here, our task is to determine the primary purpose of a DYFS case worker\u2019s interview. The general statutory mission of DYFS in the \u201cprotection of children\u201d through civil legal measures is well-established. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.8. <em>See also State v. P.Z., </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>86, 96, 703 A.2d 901 (1997). To be sure, DYFS frequent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ly must interact with law enforcement personnel. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.36a (requiring DYFS to \u201cimmediately report all instances of suspected child abuse and neglect ... to the county prosecutor\u201d); <em>see also State v. P.Z., supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 98-99, 703 A.2d 901 (cataloguing various obligations and functions of DYFS in assisting in the prosecution of crimes against children).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Nonetheless, if one is compelled to identify a single dominant purpose of Nurudeen\u2019s hospital interview of N.M. here, I am inclined to agree with my colleagues that the interview was mainly to assist law enforcement in having the child report what had or had not happened to him while he was in the defendant\u2019s care and custody. Yet the interview also clearly had an additional benefit in revealing information that would be relevant in deciding with whom the child could safely go home after his medical treatment had been completed. Forced to choose, I concur with the majority\u2019s assessment that the child\u2019s statement to Nurudeen was \u201ctestimonial,\u201d as that term has come to be defined in <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis. </em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">I also wish to stress that our disposition of this case should not be viewed as a per se holding that all DYFS interviews of children conducted after law enforcement have become involved in a matter are necessarily \u201ctestimonial\u201d under the Sixth Amendment. Nor are we deciding that all DYFS workers are agents of law enforcement for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, although I recognize that the marked trend of <em>post-Crawford /post-Davis </em>ease law around the country appears pointed in the direction of such a rule for child welfare workers employed by governmental bodies. <em>See </em>the cases cited <em>ante </em>at 255-56, 912 A.2d at 744-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Lastly, I must observe that reaching a fair and just disposition of this appeal is procedurally complicated by the fact that the record before us was not developed with any regard for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>dispositive factors ultimately announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Davis. </em>Although one might consider remanding this matter for the development of a supplemental record, the numerous practical difficulties attendant to such an exercise, and the consequent delay of this case involving events which transpired long ago in 2002, weigh against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">With these caveats in mind, I join in the judgment directing a new trial, mindful that this case will surely not represent the last signpost on the evolving path of Confrontation Clause jurisprudence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\"> Among other things, <em>Crawford </em>has been aptly described as creating \"a Copemican shift in federal constitutional law.\" <em>See Latimer, supra, </em>36 <em>Seton Hall Law Rev. </em>at 329.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\"> To date our State Supreme Court has declined to pass upon the meaning or scope of <em>Crawford, </em>or upon <em>Crawford's </em>impact, if any, on the cognate provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>confrontation expressed in our State Constitution at <em>Article </em>1, <em>Paragraph </em>10. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Branch, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>338, 370-72, 865 A.2d 673 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b289-11\">I hazard no prediction on whether the Court will go further and declare <em>Crawford </em>retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>See Beard v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number><em>Banks, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>406, 411, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2504, 2510, 159 L.Ed.2d 494, 502 (2004) (delineating the standards for when a new rule of criminal procedure applies on collateral review).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b291-9\"> Justice Thomas observed in dissent in <em>Davis </em>that in \"many similar cases, pronouncement of the \u2018primary\u2019 motive behind [a declarant\u2019s] interrogation calls for nothing more than a guess by courts.\u201d <em>Davis, supra,-U.S. </em>at-, 126 S.Ct. at 2285, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 249 (Thomas, J., concurring and dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> I have no similar difficulty with the admission of N.M.\u2019s \"blurt-out\u201d statement to his mother, which seems plainly nontestimonial under <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
