We also address an insurance coverage issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Defendant Weir Welding Company, Inc. appeals from a judgment obligating it to pay the entirety of a $2,350,000 settlement accepted by plaintiffs Charles and Carol Englert from defendant C. Raimondo &amp; Sons Construction. The settlement was to compensate plaintiffs for injuries Charles Englert sustained as a result of a construction site accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Weir challenges the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of certain contractual indemnification provisions in the sub-contract between it and Raimondo that led to the judgment requiring Weir to indemnify Raimondo for the full amount of the settlement with plaintiff and for Raimondo\u2019s counsel fees incurred in defending the litigation. In its conditional cross-appeal, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company argues that the trial judge erred in determining that the commercial general liability (CGL) policy it issued to Raimondo provided primary rather than excess insurance coverage. We reverse on Weir\u2019s appeal respecting the scope of its obligation to indemnify Raimondo, affirm on Liberty\u2019s cross-appeal, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">These are the facts relevant to the issues before us. On June 1, 1998, Raimondo entered into a contract with defendant The Home Depot, whereby Raimondo agreed to serve as general contractor for the construction of a new Home Depot store in Riverdale, New Jersey. By sub-contract dated July 17, 1998, Raimondo retained Weir to \u201cfurnish all union labor, material, equipment, hoist, transportation ... [and] protection and safety measures required to perform the structural steel ... work for th[e] project[,]\u201d including all erection work. According to Article 11 of their subcontract, entitled \u201cIndemnification,\u201d Weir further agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">[T]o the fullest extent permitted by law, [Weir] <em>shall indemnify </em>and hold harmless [Home Depot] ... and [Rainiondo] and all of their agents and employees from and against <em>all claims, </em>damages, losses and expenses, including but not limited to attorney\u2019s fees, <em>arising out of or resulting from the performance of [Weir\u2019s] Work </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>under this Sub-contract, </em>provided that any such claim, damage, loss, or expense <em>is attributable </em>to <em>bodily injury, </em>sickness, disease, or death, or to injury to or destruction of tangible property (other than the Work itself) including the loss of use resulting therefrom, <em>to the extent caused in whole or in part by any negligent act or omission of [Weir] or anyone directly or indirectly employed by [Weir] or anyone for whose acts [Weir] may be liable, regardless of whether it is caused in part by a party indemnified hereunder. </em>Such obligation shall not be construed <em>to </em>negate, or otherwise reduce any other right or obligation of indemnity which would otherwise exist as to any party or person described in this Paragraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">[All emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The two critical phrases of Article 11 for purpose of this appeal are \u201cto the extent caused\u201d and \u201cregardless of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The Raimondo-Weir sub-contract, which was drafted by Raimondo, included a separate and different indemnification provision in Rider D. Rider D initially set forth the various types of insurance Weir was obligated to provide for Raimondo\u2019s protection; but in paragraph 5, Rider D also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">Weir ... shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ... Raimondo ... against any and all claims and demands of any nature whatsoever including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, claims for consequential damages, loss of profits and damage to property of Raimondo including costs, litigation expenses, counsel fees and liability incurred in connection therewith, <em>arising out of injury </em>or death of, any person whatsoever or damage to property of any kind by whomsoever owned, <em>caused in whole or in part by the acts or omission of [Weir], any subsubcontracts [sic] vendor, materialman, or any other person directly or indirectly employed by [Weir], or any of them while engaged in the performance of the Work or any activity associated therewith or relative thereto.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Ambiguities within the indemnification provision of Article 11, as well as inconsistency between Article 11 and Rider D, do not demonstrate the required clear and unequivocal intention for Raimondo to be indemnified for its own share of negligence. See <em>Azurak v. Corporate Prop. Investors, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>110, 814 A.2d 600 (2003), <em>aff'g o.b., </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>516, 790 A.2d 956 (App.Div.2002); <em>Mantilla v. NC Mall Assocs., </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>262, 770 A.2d 1144 (2001); <em>Ramos v. Browning Ferris Indus. of S. Jersey, Inc., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>177, 510 A.2d 1152 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">Weir\u2019s business was primarily structural steel fabrication; it sub-sub-contracted with plaintiffs employer, defendant East Rutherford Steel Erectors, to erect its fabricated steel at the Home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Depot site. Pursuant to Weir\u2019s purchase order, East Rutherford agreed to perform the steel work in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in the Raimondo-Weir contract. Charles Englert was one of East Rutherford\u2019s employee steel workers. At the time of the accident, he was welding structural steel components at a height of nearly thirty feet above ground. While moving from one beam to another, wearing no safety harness and not otherwise protected by a net or other equipment, Englert slipped and fell, sustaining serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In pretrial motions, the parties sought resolution of the indemnification and coverage issues. Early on, the motion judge held that Weir was required to indemnify Raimondo unless a jury later found Raimondo solely negligent for plaintiffs injuries; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:40A-1 prohibits indemnification for \u201cdamages ... caused by ... the sole negligence\u201d of the indemnitee. The judge also determined that Liberty\u2019s policy provided primary coverage to Raimondo, and a Travelers Indemnity Company CGL policy issued to Weir, naming Raimondo as \u201can additional insured,\u201d was excess with respect to the Englert claim. Weir and Travelers unsuccessfully moved for reconsideration of the order requiring full indemnification to Raimondo, and Raimondo and Liberty moved for reconsideration of the order requiring Liberty to provide primary coverage. Both motions were denied. Liberty and Weir filed separate motions for leave to appeal the rulings. Although this court initially granted leave to appeal, we subsequently dismissed both interlocutory appeals as improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">In the meantime, an order was entered on January 7, 2002, memorializing Raimondo\u2019s agreement with plaintiffs to settle their claims for $2.35 million. Under that agreement, Liberty agreed to pay $1 million to plaintiff; plaintiff agreed to defer receipt of the remainder of the settlement until after resolution of Raimondo\u2019s and Liberty\u2019s claims for insurance coverage, contribution, and indemnification against Weir and Travelers. Liberty, Travelers, and Chubb agreed to the settlement; Weir did not agree to \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>amount or reasonableness\u201d of the settlement. Proceedings on the above-described pretrial motions and the subsequently dismissed interlocutory appeal apparently consumed the better part of the next two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">On the eve of trial, by order filed on March 25, 2004, the trial judge denied Weir\u2019s late motion for summary judgment on the indemnification issue, which had previously been ruled on more than once. The liability trial proceeded for several days in March and April 2004, and on April 6, 2004, the jury found Weir twenty-five percent, Raimondo fifteen percent, and East Rutherford sixty percent responsible for plaintiffs accident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge entered an order directing Weir to indemnify Raimondo for the entire settlement, plus Raimondo\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. A subsequent order determined fees and costs to be approximately $88,000. Weir\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">If Weir prevails, Raimondo is liable for fifteen percent of the settlement, $352,500, and Weir is responsible for the remaining eighty-five percent, $1,997,500. If Raimondo prevails, Weir is liable for the entire $2.35 million settlement, as well as Raimondo\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">On appeal, Weir presents these arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">POINT i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">THE RAIMONDO INDEMNITY DOES NOT CONTAIN AN UNEQUIVOCAL EXPRESSION OF AN INTENTION TO INDEMNIFY RAIMONDO FOR ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">POINT II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRONEOUSLY SUBMITTED THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PLAINTIFF\u2019S EMPLOYER, EAST RUTHERFORD STEEL ERECTORS, FOR CONSIDERATION AND APPORTIONMENT BY TO [sic] THE JURY, CONTRARY TO <em>RAMOS V. BROWNING FERRIS INDUSTRIES, </em>103 <em>N..J. </em>177, 191, 510 A.2d 1152 (1986).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>POINT III</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRONEOUSLY PERMITTED THEODORE GUIS TO GIVE TESTIMONY, INCLUDING INADMISSIBLE NET OPINION, AS AN EXPERT WITNESS WITHOUT THE REQUISITE QUALIFICATION AND SUPPORTING FACTS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">POINT TV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">RAIMONDO SO FAILED TO MEET ITS BURDEN OF PROOF THAT WEIR WELDING WAS ENTITLED TO JUDGMENT AT THE CONCLUSION OF RAIMONDO\u2019S PROOFS AND AT THE CLOSE OF ALL EVIDENCE, OR, ALTERNATIVELY, A NEW TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">POINT V</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">THE TRIAL COURT PREJUDICIALLY CONFUSED THE ISSUES OF NEGLIGENCE AND PROXIMATE CAUSE IN ITS JURY INTERROGATORIES, AND ERRONEOUSLY CHARGED THE JURY ON RAIMONDO'S BURDEN OF PROOF AND ON OSHA REGULATIONS ALTHOUGH THEIR APPLICABILITY HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">POINT VI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-12\">THE AWARD OF COUNSEL FEES AND COSTS WAS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE RAIMONDO INDEMNITY AGREEMENT AND LACKED THE SUPPORT REQUIRED BY <em>R. </em>4:42-9(B) AND RPC 1.5(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">We have reviewed the record in light of the contentions of the parties on these issues, and find insufficient merit in Points II, III, IV, and V to warrant discussion in this opinion. <em>See R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E). We now address Points I and VI of Weir\u2019s <em>argument.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\">The law respecting contractual indemnification for an indemnitee\u2019s own negligence is governed by the principles set forth in <em>Azurak v. Corporate Prop. Investors, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>110, 814 A.2d 600, and <em>Mantilla v. NC Mall Assocs., supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>262, 770 A.2d 1144, reaffirming certain principles earlier set forth in <em>Ramos v. Browning Ferris Indus. of S. Jersey, Inc., supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>177, 510 A.2d 1152. <em>Azurak, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 111-12, 814 A.2d 600; <em>Mantilla, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 272-73, 770 A.2d 1144. In <em>Ramos, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-16\">Indemnity contracts are interpreted in accordance with the rules governing the construction of contracts generally. When the meaning of the clause is ambiguous, however, the clause should be strictly construed against the indemnitee. Thus, a contract will not be construed to indemnify the indemnitee against losses resulting from its own negligence unless such an intention is expressed in unequivocal terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>[Ramos, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 191-92, 510 A.2d 1152 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The disputed issue before us concerns the application of those principles to the facts at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">In <em>Azurak, </em>this court quoted <em>Ramos </em>and expressly followed its principles. <em>Azurak, supra, </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 520-21, 790 A.2d 956. The indemnification language at issue in <em>Azurak </em>did not include either of the two critical, disputed phrases that appear in Article 11 of the Raimondo-Weir contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In affirming Judge Carchman\u2019s opinion for this court in <em>Azurak, </em>the Supreme Court added: \u201c[I]n order to allay even the slightest doubt on the issue of what is required to bring a negligent indemnitee within an indemnification agreement, we reiterate that the agreement must specifically reference the negligence or fault of the indemnitee.\u201d 175 <em>N.J. </em>at 112-13, 814 A.2d 600. Clearly the <em>Azurak </em>provision did not, and indemnification was <em>denied </em>for the mail\u2019s own negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 111-12, 814 A.2d 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">In <em>Mantilla, </em>a customer injured in a slip and fall at the Newport Mall brought suit against the mall and its cleaning service. The jury found defendants as well as plaintiff negligent, and apportioned negligence forty percent to the mall, fifty percent to the cleaning company, and ten percent to plaintiff. The mall sought contractual indemnification against the cleaning company, both for its share of the judgment and for its litigation expenses. The indemnification agreement in issue, like the agreement in <em>Azurak, </em>did not include either of the two critical phrases that appear in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Article 11 of the Raimondo-Weir contract: \u201cto the extent\u201d and \u201cregardless of.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This court had determined that the contract in <em>Mantilla </em>did not require the cleaning company to indemnify the mall for the mall\u2019s own negligence, but relied on principles of insurance law to determine that the cleaning company owed the mall indemnification for the costs of its defense. 167 <em>N.J. </em>at 265, 770 A.2d 1144. The Court granted certification on the cleaning service\u2019s petition for certification, but denied certification on the mall\u2019s cross-petition. <em>Id. </em>at 266, 770 A.2d 1144. Thus the only aspect of the indemnification dispute before the Court in <em>Mantilla </em>was the award of defense costs. The Court rejected the application of insurance law \u2014 whereby the allegations of a complaint are to be measured against the policy coverage to determine the obligation to defend \u2014 to the interpretation of indemnification provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 274-75, 770 A.2d 1144. Noting that the language of the indemnification contract controls, the Court held: \u201c[A]bsent explicit contractual language to the contrary, an indemnitee who has defended against allegations of its own independent fault may not recover the costs of its defense from an indemnitor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 770 A.2d 1144. Because the contract \u201cfailed to express [such an undertaking] in unequivocal terms,\u201d indemnification for legal fees was denied. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The question before us is whether the language of the indemnification provision in the Raimondo-Weir contract meets the <em>Ramos-Mantilla-Azurak </em>standard, that is, whether it \u201cexpresses] in unequivocal terms\u201d the intention for Weir to indemnify Raimondo for its own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Prior to the decisions in either <em>Azurak </em>or <em>Mantilla, </em>this court came to different conclusions respecting indemnification provisions that included the \u201cregardless of\u2019 language we see in Article 11. <em>Compare Leitao v. Damon G. Douglas Co., </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187, 693 A.2d 1209 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>466, 700 A.2d 879 (1997), <em>with Mautz v. J.P. Patti Co., </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 688 A.2d 1088 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>472, 700 A.2d 883 (1997). In <em>Leitao, </em>which the Law Division judge relied upon in this case, this court found that the sub-contractor was liable to indemnify the general contractor for the general\u2019s own negligence, despite the fact that the sub-contractor was not negligent; the only other negligent party was the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Leitao, supra, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 197-98, 693 A.2d 1209. The contract in <em>Leitao </em>did not include the \u201cto the extent\u201d phrase found in the <em>Mautz </em>contract and in Article 11 of the Raimondo-Weir contract. <em>Id. </em>at 191, 693 A.2d 1209. In <em>Mautz, </em>this court interpreted a combination of the \u201cto the extent\u201d and \u201cregardless of\u2019 phrases as analogous to a comparative negligence provision, and denied indemnification to the general contractor for its own negligence. <em>Mautz, supra, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 21, 688 A.2d 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In a written statement of reasons, the trial judge here explained his conclusion that Article 11 met the required level of clarity set forth in <em>Azurak </em>and <em>Mantilla </em>and compared <em>Mautz </em>with <em>Leitao:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">The problem with the <em>Mautz </em>construction, as applied to this case, is that pursuant to the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Act (hereinafter \u201cthe Act\u201d), each party is already responsible for damages sustained \u201cto the extent of\u2019 the tortfeasor\u2019s negligence. The purpose of the Act is to establish the right of joint tortfeasors to seek allocation among themselves of the burden of their fault. N.J.S.A 2A:53A-1. <em>Mantilla </em>and <em>Azurak </em>specifically require the parties to include clear and unequivocal language referencing the fault of the indemnitee. Applying <em>Mautz </em>to the facts of this case would essentially render meaningless the indemnification provisions of the agreements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>We do not agree. Nor do we agree with the judge\u2019s reliance on <em>Leitao:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">This court finds the <em>Leitao </em>court\u2019s interpretation of the language more persuasive. This court finds that by including the language \u201cregardless of whether it is caused in part by a party indemnified hereunder\u201d [in Article 11] the parties to the contract clearly and unambiguously intended to provide indemnification for Raimondo\u2019s own negligence. The agreement specifically references the negligence or fault of the indemnitee and therefore the contract satisfies the bright line rule established by the Supreme Court. In light of the recent Supreme Court decisions, it does not make sense to follow <em>Mautz </em>in holding that \u201cto the extent\u201d modifies the unambiguous language intended to require indemnification. \u201cTo the extent\u201d simply requires that there be at least some liability on the part of the subcontractor, or anyone directly employed by him, regardless of whether that liability may also be caused in part by an indemnified party. The <em>Leitao </em>court noted that there is no inherent public policy against allowing one to be indemnified for their own negligence. Parties to a construction contract are free to allocate risk and responsibility for injuries related to the construction. The parties themselves are in the best position to determine who should bear the responsibility____As a result, the only reading of th[e] [Article 11] clause that makes sense is that the parties intended to require Weir to indemnify Raimondo for Raimondo\u2019s own negligence, absent a finding that Raimondo is 100% at fault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">In his written statement of reasons, the trial judge interpreted and relied on Article 11; he did not refer at all to Rider D.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">It is therefore incomprehensible to us that in its brief on appeal, Weir fails even to mention Article 11, but instead argues entirely based on the Rider D indemnification provision. Moreover, Weir\u2019s appendix, which purports to include its sub-contract with Raimondo, omits the very page of the sub-contract on which Article 11 appears. In its responding brief, Raimondo points to the glaring omission, and includes the complete contract in its appendix. Weir\u2019s reply brief mentions its previous omission only tangentially, arguing that paragraph 5 of Rider D \u201csupersedes\u201d Article 11. We shall return to the question of the relationship between those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The \u201cregardless of\u2019 language of Article 11 clearly states that Raimondo\u2019s negligence does not bar its indemnification claim; but the phrase does not distinguish between allowing indemnification for the negligence of others and allowing indemnification for Raimondo\u2019s own negligence. As Weir\u2019s attorney argued before the Law Division, the \u201cregardless of\u2019 language merely means \u201cit won\u2019t void the indemnity that does exist. It doesn\u2019t create an indemnity that does not exist.\u201d Ordinarily, a claim for indemnification requires the claimant to be free of fault. <em>Ramos, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 190, 510 A.2d 1152 (citing <em>Cartel Capital Corp. v. Fireco of N.J., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>548, 566, 410 A.2d 674 (1980)). Thus the \u201cregardless of\u2019 language in Article 11 can be read simply to eliminate that common law condition from the parties\u2019 indemnification agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In the absence of the \u201cto the extent\u201d phrase in Article 11, the \u201cregardless of\u2019 phrase could be interpreted to require Weir to indemnify Raimondo for its own negligence even if Weir was not at fault at all, as long as Raimondo was not the \u201csole\u201d cause of damages. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:40A-1. The \u201cto the extent\u201d phrase in Article 11 is itself subject to differing interpretations. \u201cTo the extent\u201d can be read to mean \u201cif\u2019; that is, Weir is required to indemnify Raimondo only \u201cif\u2019 Weir is also found negligent. Under that reading, \u201cto the extent\u201d is not inconsistent with complete indemnification of Raimondo, even for its own negligence, as long as Weir is also negligent \u201cto [some] extent.\u201d But the phrase also can be read to require Weir to indemnify Raimondo only \u201cto the extent\u201d of Weir\u2019s (or its sub-contractors\u2019) share of fault. Neither the \u201cregardless of\u2019 phrase nor the \u201cto the extent\u201d phrase answers the question whether such indemnification would include Raimondo\u2019s own share of fault. Article 11 thus does not satisfy the required \u201cunequivocal\u201d expression of intention to obligate Weir to fully indemnify Raimondo for damages resulting from its own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">We also cannot ignore the fact that Article 11 is not the only provision of their sub-contract that addressed Weir\u2019s obligation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>indemnify Raimondo. Rider D is part of the contract, and it includes a very different indemnification provision, lacking either of the critical phrases that appear in Article 11. Paragraph 5 of Rider D simply says, in its material terms, that Weir \u201cshall indemnify\u201d Raimondo for \u201call claims ... including ... litigation expenses [and] counsel fees ... arising out of injury ... caused in whole or in part by\u201d Weir or any of its sub-contractors. The inclusion of these two very different indemnification provisions in the same contract \u2014 Article 11 and Rider D \u2014 creates additional ambiguity. Thus the terms of the contract taken as a whole cannot meet the <em>Ramos-Mantilla-Azurak </em>standard; they do not \u201cexpress in unequivocal terms\u201d the intention for Weir to indemnify Raimondo for its own negligence. <em>See Meder v. Resorts Int\u2019l. Hotel, Inc., </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>470, 479-80, 573 A.2d 922 (App.Div. 1989), <em>certif. denied, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>608, 583 A.2d 310 (1990). There, with three different provisions respecting indemnification, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">We thus conclude that the contractual provisions do not unequivocally express an intention that Claremont will indemnify Resorts for its own negligence. If anything, the three indemnity provisions together suggest the contrary intent; that reading is supported by the principle that ambiguities in an indemnification agreement are to be strictly construed against the indemnitee____Claremont was accordingly entitled to dismissal of the third-party complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 480, 573 A.2d 922 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">As Judge Carchman pointed out in <em>Azurak, </em>it would have placed no undue burden on the parties to have drafted a clear, unambiguous indemnification provision. <em>Azurak, supra, </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 523, 790 A.2d 956. The parties could have spelled out their intention as to which party would bear liability under various circumstances \u2014 in particular, whether Weir would bear Raimondo\u2019s entire liability, irrespective of whether Raimondo\u2019s obligation to a third party arose in part from its own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Under prevailing law, an ambiguous contractual indemnification provision must be construed against the indemnitee. <em>Ramos, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 191, 510 A.2d 1152; <em>Meder, supra, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 480, 573 A.2d 922. Moreover, it is undisputed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>this form contract, including Rider D thereto, was drafted by Raimondo, and an ambiguous contract is to be construed against the drafter. <em>E.g., In re Estate of Miller, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>210, 221, 447 A.2d 549 (1982); <em>City of Orange v. Empire Mortgage Servs., Inc., </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>216, 227, 775 A.2d 174 (App.Div.2001). Thus, despite Weir\u2019s unfortunately incomplete presentation of the issue on appeal, we are compelled to reverse the orders requiring Weir to indemnify Raimondo for the entire settlement with plaintiff, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">We now address Liberty\u2019s cross-appeal from the order determining that the CGL policy it issued to Raimondo is primary. Liberty\u2019s policy included an \u201cother insurance\u201d endorsement as follows: \u201cThis insurance is excess over ... [a]ny other <em>primary </em>insurance available to you covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations for which you have been added as an additional insured____\u201d (Emphasis added.) In accordance with the terms of Paragraph 2 of Rider D, Weir obtained a CGL policy issued by Travelers, which named Raimondo as an additional insured. That policy provided $1 million liability coverage for \u201ceach occurrence.\u201d The Travelers CGL policy provided: \u2018With respect to the insurance afforded to Additional Insureds ... [t]his insurance is <em>excess </em>over any valid and collectible insurance <em>unless </em>you [Weir] have agreed in a written contract for this insurance to apply on a primary or contributory basis.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As required by Paragraph 4 of Rider D, Weir obtained an umbrella policy from intervenor Chubb Insurance Company of New Jersey, which also named Raimondo as an additional insured and provided $5 million coverage per occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Early in this litigation, Liberty and Travelers brought cross-motions for summary judgment seeking a determination of coverage. Liberty argued that the Travelers policy constituted \u201cother primary insurance available\u201d to Raimondo, and that Liberty\u2019s own policy by its terms became \u201cexcess\u201d to the Travelers coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Travelers, on the other hand, has maintained that while it provided primary coverage to Weir, its coverage for Raimondo, as an additional insured, was \u201cexcess\u201d by its express terms unless it was Raimondo\u2019s only coverage for the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In 2001, the motion judge (not the trial judge in 2004) concluded that Liberty\u2019s policy was primary, Travelers\u2019 coverage was excess only, and Liberty had the obligation to defend Raimondo.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The order granting Travelers\u2019 motion was entered on May 10, 2001; Liberty\u2019s out-of-time motion for reconsideration was denied on December 17, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Liberty argues on appeal that the Law Division order requiring Weir to fully indemnify Raimondo should be affirmed, in which case the insurance coverage dispute would be moot. Liberty argues in the alternative that if Raimondo is not entitled to indemnification for its own fault, then even if the Liberty policy is \u201cprimary,\u201d the Travelers policy is also primary, making the two policies \u201cmutually repugnant.\u201d <em>See Cosmopolitan Mut. Ins. Co. v. Cont\u2019l. Cas. Co., </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>554, 562, 147 A.2d 529 (1959). In that case, Liberty argues that coverage for Raimondo\u2019s liability should be shared between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">We are satisfied, as was the motion judge, that the Travelers CGL policy is excess as to Raimondo, its additional insured. Contrary to Liberty\u2019s unsubstantiated contention, the express condition required by the Travelers policy endorsement in order to modify its coverage for Raimondo (from excess to primary) has not been met. Weir\u2019s \u201cwritten contract\u201d with Raimondo, promising a CGL policy that would name Raimondo as an \u201cadditional insured,\u201d did not refer to or promise \u201cprimary\u201d coverage under such policy. Liberty\u2019s CGL policy therefore remains primary as to its own insured. Our decision does not, of course, affect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Travelers\u2019 obligation under the excess (umbrella) policy that also names Raimondo as an additional insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">We affirm the order declaring that the Liberty CGL policy is primary as to Raimondo. We reverse the judgment requiring Weir to indemnify Raimondo for the full amount of the settlement and for its litigation costs and counsel fees. Weir\u2019s obligation to indemnify Raimondo is limited to eighty-five percent of the settlement. We remand for entry of a corrected judgment consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-9\"> Because Carol Englert\u2019s claim was solely derivative, we refer to Charles Englert as \"plaintiff\" in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-13\"> Under the several sub-contracts, Weir was to be liable to Raimondo for East Rutherford\u2019s share of responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b82-9\"> The <em>Azurak </em>indemnification provision, as noted by this court, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A50\">Contractor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnitee from and against any claim (including any claim brought by employees of Contractor), liability, damage or expense (including attorney\u2019s fees) that such Indemnitee may incur relating to, arising out of or existing by reason of (i) Contractor\u2019s performance of this Agreement or the conditions created thereby (including the use, misuse or failure of any equipment used by Contractor or its sub-contractors, servants or employees) or (ii) Contractor\u2019s breach of this Agreement or the inadequate or improper performance of this Agreement by Contractor or its sub-contractors, servants or employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 522, 814 A.2d 600.
